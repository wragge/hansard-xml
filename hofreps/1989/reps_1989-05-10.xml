<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports this motion but a number of things must be said briefly about it. First of all, it must be said that it is very curious that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) should propose a motion of this sort-or indeed of any other sort-without explaining its purpose. So, for the record, it should at least be said that this is a motion proposing the establishment of a joint committee of the Parliament to inquire into the layout of the city of Canberra and its environs and other matters related to the Australian Capital Territory, being those matters that are referred to the Committee by a resolution of either House of the Parliament or the Minister responsible for the ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the very least, the House and the public should be made aware-and I trust they have now been made aware-of the fact that this motion proposes to establish a joint committee which will deal with matters associated with the city of Canberra and the ACT. It is obviously appropriate that there should be a parliamentary committee established to deal with matters relating to the ACT. Indeed, it should also be put on the record that there has been such a committee in the past. We have had a joint committee which dealt with the ACT. When the present Parliament was elected the Opposition, most notably in the form of Senator Reid, proposed and argued for the re-establishment of the joint committee which existed before the last election, but the Government for some reason opposed that or, at the very least, did nothing to re-establish the committee. So, it is good that at long last there is a proposal before the House to establish such a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that the matters relating to the ACT and the city of Canberra have, in the meantime, been dealt with by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which you yourself, Mr Acting Speaker, were a distinguished member for some time. However, these matters are now to be dealt with by a joint parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the thrust and substance of the motion. It will be in the interests of the people of the ACT, and particularly of Canberra, to have such a committee to deal with matters relating to the ACT and Canberra. However, the Opposition does not support the proposition that the committee should be confined to eight members only. Formerly there was a committee of 10 members, as I recall, and I do not understand why the number of committee members should be reduced. Nor do I understand why one of the Independent senators would be involved. The Australian Democrats hold themselves out as being concerned with much more lofty and widely embracing propositions and matters than those concerning the layout of the city of Canberra. I imagine that it is simply a deal with Senator Sanders to help him along life's rocky road. That certainly does not seem to be any sort of justification for allowing him or any other member of his party to sit on this Committee. We support the re-establishment of the Committee. It should be re-established in exactly the same way it was re-established before the last election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a couple of comments about the remarks made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), Firstly, it should be made clear that the concerns about the planning of Canberra have continued to be addressed by the standing committees on transport, communications and infrastructure of both Houses, which have set up a joint subcommittee. That joint subcommittee has operated during the last two years. It has continued with the work of the previous Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, so the national concerns about planning in Canberra have continued to be addressed. That subcommittee arrangement was found to be quite cumbersome. It was unnecessarily unwieldy and caused some delays in the tabling of reports, and it was felt that a separate committee would be a more efficient way of handling these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the re-establishment of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory is in the interests not only of the people of the Australian Capital Territory but of the people of Australia as a whole. Canberra is the national capital, and it is very important that the national Parliament continue to have something to say about the way in which the national capital is planned. As a representative of part of Canberra I welcome that national involvement in the planning of Canberra and hope that it will continue forever. Canberra is a city that the whole of Australia can be proud of, and we want to keep it that way. We are more likely to keep it that way if the national Parliament continues to have some involvement in planning of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Committee will be small because we want to keep it operational. There are only four locally elected members. Three of those will probably want to be members of this Committee. One is a Minister and is therefore unlikely to have the time. One or two other members of both Houses who have electorates close by would want to be members and there are two or three spaces for other representatives of Australia as a whole. That seems to be a large enough committee. I hope that it will work effectively. I welcome the Opposition's support for this motion and look forward to the Committee working effectively.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in leading the debate from the Opposition side on the Supply Bill (No. 1) 1989-90, the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1989-90 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90. These Bills make interim provision for the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the services of government for the first five months of 1989-90. The Opposition will not be opposing these Bills as they form an integral part of the budgetary process. While we are not opposing the Bills specifically, the coalition will reiterate its dissatisfaction in general with the Government's continued mismanagement of the Australian economy. To highlight this I shall move an amendment which will be seconded by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White). I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after ``That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Australia's $95.47 billion net foreign debt at the end of December 1988 and its continuing balance of payments deficit on the current account which increased by $1,624 million during March 1989;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) that the Government is in danger of losing control of monetary policy through persistent attempts to encourage bullish sentiment in financial markets and talk down the dollar;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the Government's high risk economic strategy of sole reliance on high interest rates, whilst increasing Government spending and granting wage increases unrelated to productivity;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the impact of the Government's high interest rate, high tax and high inflation policies on the living standards of all Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) the failure of the Government to address Australia's deep-seated economic problems which require the freeing up of the labour market, a comprehensive micro-economic reform agenda, and policies designed to enhance competitiveness and increase savings''. </PARA>
<PARA>I expect that other shadow Ministers and members from this side of the House will discuss in detail aspects of these Bills and their effects on individual portfolios. I want to address myself today to the current state of the Australian economy and to make some points about the current economic debate in Australia. First, one must recognise that partial indicators of the state of economic activity are very mixed at present. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other Government members have argued on occasions that they believe that activity has peaked. They suggest that interest rates will not have to go any higher and that monetary policy will not need to be tightened. However, a realistic assessment of the facts suggest a quite different story. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is true that some indicators, for example, retail trade activity, have recently shown falls, suggesting from that point of view that activity in certain areas may be peaking or have peaked, a number of other indicators suggest a quite different story. For example, the recently released ANZ job advertisement figures were up 3.4 per cent in April, following a 3.9 per cent rise in March, and their being up 28.5 per cent over the past year I think suggests sustained strong labour market conditions. It probably suggests that it is a reasonably reliable indication that, overall, economic conditions are pretty tight. Similarly, new motor vehicle registrations increased by 4.1 per cent in March, following a 14.7 per cent rise in February. They have increased by 31.9 per cent over the last 12 months. Dwelling approvals were up 1.8 per cent in March, following a 1.2 per cent rise in February, and over the last 12 months they were up 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, some of the other indicators also suggest sustained strength in the economy. The demand for credit is, under the Government's strategy, the key indicator, I would suggest, because it is relying on high interest rates in order to pull back economic activity and, presumably, that process works by those interest rates bearing down on the demand for credit, although the demand for credit has not shown a significant shift downwards in recent months. While it appears to have slowed to some extent, it has been a marginal slowing. </PARA>
<PARA> The strength of the figures in this regard should be of major concern to the Government, which is prepared to pretend that activity has peaked. Similarly, imports have remained very strong. In a trend sense in particular, they have remained very strong, as have the employment numbers, with the possible exception of the most recent figure. We are due to receive another number this week. However, overall, even those two are lagging indicators. I think, at best, the picture is mixed, and, as I see it, there is certainly no clear evidence that activity has peaked, even though the Government has already cranked interest rates up to what are disturbingly high levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, all this is against the background of growing fundamental problems in the Australian economy. The Government's basic economic strategy, as outlined at Budget time last year, is wildly off track. Yet the Treasurer has not really expressed any genuine concern about that. He has made no attempt in the last nine months to adjust policy to any significant extent to deal with that problem. He just let things drift on, hoping to get by with minimal increases in interest rates. The reason is, of course, that he is running not an economic strategy but a political strategy. He is running an election vote-buying strategy, which has very little to do with the fundamental problems that are before us. This is a Treasurer who just a few years ago, in early 1986, made the following statement on the John Laws radio show in Sydney:</PARA>
<PARA>If this Government get the adjustment . . . and a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for. We will just end up being a third rate economy-a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA>That is now a very famous statement by the Treasurer. It provided him with a very real opportunity in terms of economic management to shift significantly the direction and the pace of economic adjustment in this country. Yet if we look back over the period since May 1986 we will see that there has been virtually no additional policy adjustment. There has been a bit of an attempt to tighten Government expenditure, but that has been marginal. Rather, there has been a consistent policy of disinformation, backed up by virtually no economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The best evidence of the nature of that economic strategy has been provided by some recent comments of the Treasurer at the time of the May statement last year when briefing his Caucus colleagues about how this was the budgetary strategy that would get them back into office. He said that all the nervous nellies in the marginal seats should not worry, that this basic strategy would get them back into office. And then, at the time of the last Budget, he boasted that this was the strategy that would `bring home the bacon'. Over that period, all he really talked about was delivering tax cuts from 1 July this year and paying wage increases quite unrelated to productivity. This was a blatant vote-buying exercise rather than any serious attempt to deal with our economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has produced virtually no new information on the economy over the last nine or 10 months. Yet, we observe the fact that his Budget forecasts are wildly off track. For example, we were told at the time of the Budget last year that the current account deficit this year would come in at about $9 1/2 billion, that inflation would fall to 4 1/2 per cent, that wage growth would be contained, and so on. Yet here we are only about three-quarters of the way through the financial year and the balance of payments deficit is looking like coming in at about $16 billion or $17 billion, which is substantially above the $9.5 billion that was forecast. Inflation looks like sticking at around 7 or 8 per cent throughout this year, despite the attempts on the part of the Government to fiddle that number, to lower that number artificially on two occasions in the last nine or 10 months. There is mounting evidence, almost on a daily basis, that wage pressures are not going to come in in line with the Budget estimate but that wage increases and average earnings increases will be significantly above those forecast. Yet, throughout this whole period there has been no recognition by the Government that its strategy is in tatters, that it has run a very high risk economic strategy and that it has now put the economic well-being of most Australians significantly at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note in this regard that the Treasurer has consistently ignored warnings. In political terms, one might understand that he would ignore the Opposition's warnings which consistently have been on the record over the last 12 or 18 months. But why should he ignore the warnings of some people who are notionally quite close to him or who have statutory independence on which to base their views? I will cite two examples. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned the Treasurer on three separate occasions in the last few months about the magnitude of our economic problems. On 29 March, when speaking at the award for Businessman of the Year, the Governor said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is too early to say that a downturn is at hand. We have to hold to tougher policies until it is clear that results are on the board. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the first warning. That was followed up on 27 April when the Governor, speaking to the Australian Institute of Bankers, talked of activity running too strongly and fundamental economic problems still remaining. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course he warned quite flatly that inflation rates of about 7 per cent were unacceptable and that further policy adjustment was required. Finally, there was the incident last week when the Governor, in accepting an award from the Australian Finance Conference, prefaced his response by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> This is no time to be easing monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>He alluded to the fact that in making that statement he had not bothered to check with his political masters. So the Treasurer has received three warnings and, generally, those three warnings have been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Treasurer's previous economic adviser, Professor Barry Hughes, who left the Treasurer's staff early last year, has subsequently warned the Treasurer on several occasions about the nature of the economic situation and the extent to which it is slipping through his old boss's fingers. For example, at the time of last year's Budget, Professor Hughes warned the Treasurer that his forecasts for the balance of payments, inflation and wages were unattainable. More recently, in writing in a bank report-I think it was the First Boston Australia Ltd's economic assessment-he warned the Treasurer that he was `caught in a balance of payments stranglehold'. Of course, most recently on the Face to Face program, on 9 April, Professor Hughes warned his old boss about his `high risk strategy'. In order to get the attention of his old boss, he pointed out in very blatant terms:</PARA>
<PARA>We are going to go through 1989 with our fingers crossed that something nasty does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA>Two major individuals in this country-one who was particularly close to the Treasurer as his personal adviser and the other the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, one of the more significant commentators on the economic scene and a significant economic manager-have each warned the Treasurer on three separate occasions. The Treasurer has ignored those warnings on all of those six occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Treasurer goes on with this blatant process of disinformation hoping to get by until an early election some time after July this year when he will run to the polls and try to convince the Australian electorate that the tax cuts that he is giving from 1 July and the wage increases that have been foreshadowed in the second part of this year should be sufficient to give honourable members opposite another chance in government. The electorate will not be fooled by that. The electorate is fully aware that, in doing that, the Treasurer is only giving back part of what he has already taken. The electorate will also quickly become aware that any temporary relief that is given from 1 July will not be sustained; it will be quickly clawed back by higher inflation, higher interest rates and further bracket creep. It is important to focus on the significance of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the best way to summarise the increased tax burden on the average Australian is to point out that in the last four years to 1989-90 the Government has increased its income tax revenue through bracket creep-the community has been pushed into higher and higher tax brackets by an amount of about $10 billion cumulatively over that period. This Government is therefore giving back roughly half of that income in the form of tax cuts from 1 July. Also the housing mortgage interest rates have increased since June or July of last year from about 13 1/2 per cent to-this now looks like being the across the board figure-16 1/2 per cent. This is a 3 per cent increase in the home loan mortgage interest rate. This implies a very significant increase in home loan mortgage repayments for the average Australian. I think that every one per cent interest on an average mortgage is worth about $40 a week. The prospective tax cuts and wage increases pale into insignificance relative to those orders of magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Any close observer of our current economic scene and anyone who shows concern about the fact that maybe the economy is still significantly overheated and has not yet peaked would be very concerned about the prospect that inflation would run away on this Government, in the course of the next six to 12 months, quickly clawing back any benefits that those tax cuts might bring from 1 July. They will also be concerned that that inflation will push them into those higher tax brackets that the Government has stuck with. It has increased the take via bracket creep and so the benefits from any tax cuts will be quickly clawed back through higher inflation, higher interest rates or bracket creep. The worst feature of the Government's current economic mismanagement is the blatant cynicism with which it has addressed our problems, acting like there is nothing wrong and using the, `Don't worry, be happy' strategy: `Don't worry, everything will be fine. We will give you tax cuts from 1 July. We will give you wage increases later in the year. Just vote for us'. As Barry Hughes has warned and as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia has warned, this is a very high risk economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government's cynicism has gone further than that. Having a background in financial markets, particular concerned at present as to how that cynicism has gone through to the financial community. We saw yesterday the most recent example of blatant market cynicism. The Treasurer has lost all credibility in financial markets. He is a guy who used to go out and court them, trying to coerce them, cajole them and influence them in various ways to support him, and they did. They stayed with him for quite some time. But we now see that he has lost total credibility. Now every time he makes a statement about economic policy, financial markets are very cynical about what it means for them. Yesterday, with the change of leadership on our side, financial markets became bullish very quickly, with pressure to push interest rates down. The reason was that there was an expectation that, in light of these leadership changes, the Government and the Treasurer would push for an early election and that the Treasurer would be in there pushing interest rates down in the run-up to that election-a reasonable bet on the part of financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA> This very cynical behaviour by financial markets has been seen on several occasions now from about the middle of April, when the financial markets seem particularly to have left the Treasurer. We can go back to a number of reasons as to why that has happened. One, of course, is the fact that the Treasurer keeps persisting with the line, `There is nothing wrong. Don't worry, be happy'. Every time a bad balance of payments figure comes along, or a bad inflation figure come along, or he fiddles the consumer price index (CPI) or whatever, the markets say, `This guy is not for real. He is not the slightest bit interested in dealing with any of our economic problems', and of course, they now vote with their feet. </PARA>
<PARA> That basic cynicism, as continuing pieces of new economic data disprove some of the things the Treasurer has said months before, or months before that, is compounded by some explicit statements by both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that interest rates have peaked, that activity has turned down, that they do not want to see any further adjustment of monetary policy, or whatever the particular statement might be. There were a number of such statements in the weeks from the middle to the end of April, which compounded this inherently cynical attitude which was growing on the part of financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial markets also seem to have come to the view that this Treasurer in particular wants an early election. The story going around is that he is just looking for a crack of light and that as soon as he sees it he will barge straight into it. So anything he says against that sort of belief is generally counterproductive in terms of the reaction of financial markets. This has caused a particular problem in financial markets because a very bullish sentiment has developed in those markets, particularly the bill futures market and the long bond market, from the latter part of April to the early part of May, causing some very real problems for the Reserve Bank. We have had an unbelievable situation in recent days, probably reflecting some conflict between the Reserve Bank and the Treasury, and/or the Treasurer in particular, about the conduct of monetary policy. The Government wants a bullish sentiment designed to get interest rates down, to create a climate in which interest rates may begin to fall, before the Reserve Bank is ready to wear that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the comments made by the Governor to which I referred before. Let us recall those warnings the Governor gave as recently as last week. It is clear that the Governor is not prepared, at this stage, to ease monetary policy. He said the other day, `The last thing we should do in the present circumstances is to contemplate easing monetary policy'. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has been forced into the position of having to push official cash rates up further over the last two to 2 1/2 weeks in order to stem this bullish sentiment. He has also had to give various other signal to financial markets in the way he has dealt in financial markets and the speech opportunities he has had. He has had to use those to send direct warnings out to financial markets to the effect that this early bullish sentiment is unjustified; that interest rates really have not peaked and that, as far as he is concerned, there is still a long way to go in terms of policy adjustment by Government at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, over the past couple of weeks, we have had a very bullish market sentiment forcing down bank bill futures interest rates and long bond rates, while the Governor of the Reserve Bank has been in there on a daily basis pushing up official interest rates and actually tightening monetary policy significantly over the past two weeks or so in order to try to stem that unjustified bullish sentiment in financial markets. This has been created by a totally irresponsible attitude on the part of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in terms of the sorts of statements that they have made about the economy and the sorts of policy responses that they have been prepared to acknowledge are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that our problems in this country are very real. At the present time we sit in a set of economic circumstances that are much worse than they were in early 1986 when the Treasurer referred to the possibility our our slipping into banana republic status. Indeed, on the international scene, we are not openly being compared with other countries which have major debt burdens. We rank very highly; in fact, I think we rank No. 3 in terms of, for example, indebtedness to international banks; and we rank very highly in most of the international debt league tables. The situation is becoming worse as every month goes by, every time we have another $1.5 billion current account deficit number, for example. It is interesting the way the press now refers to `1.6 billion'. That 1.6 does not look too large but, if one writes it out in full with all the noughts, it is a very large number. Every day that goes on to the bottom line and every day it adds to our international indebtedness. We are now looking at the prospect of our gross international debts being around $130 billion to $135 billion. We risk the possibility that, if this Government's economic strategy ultimately results in a loss of confidence in financial markets and particularly foreign exchange markets-and I think that that is a possibility-there will be further downward pressure on our currency, and those debt levels could blow out one more time. Debts have already gone up fourfold since 1983 and we are precariously poised at the present time, risking another significant debt blow-out, balance of payments crisis, and so on. It is for that reason that Barry Hughes, the Treasurer's old economic adviser, warned him that he was caught in a balance of payments stranglehold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, roughly 50 per cent is private debt and 50 per cent is public debt, but it is the total indebtedness figure that is of concern from the point of view of the Australian economy. It is a debt burden that every Australian carries, indirectly or directly, and on a daily basis it is growing. The other day I was fascinated to read that there is now a debt clock in New York. As the United States moves into the position of becoming a major debtor country, it is now starting to focus on the fact that its debt rises every second of every hour of every day. So this clock ticks over in New York for the benefit of all people to see just how fast and alarmingly their debt problem is growing at the present time. Recognising the size of the two countries, our debt problem is much bigger. We have a more significant problem than the US. We need a debt clock and it should be placed out at the front of Parliament House. We need to let that clock tick over on a daily basis to focus the attention of the electorate on what our indebtedness means for them. Every man, woman and child in this country is already committed to the extent of about $7,500 per head, which is nearly $20,000 for the average family. That is a significant commitment in terms of weekly interest repayments for everyone in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning I read a report from one of the major banks in Sydney to the effect that it fears that our interest debt burden will increase to about $12 billion-about $1 billion a month-in the course of the next 12 months. That is pretty alarming stuff. Yet the Government sits around and acts as if we do not have a problem. In particular, the Government plays these cynical vote buying exercises, putting at risk our economic well-being and, as I say, risking an over large debt crisis and a balance of payments crisis. The real problem is that we have some fundamental economic problems in this country which have not been dealt with. Our country is essentially still a primary commodity exporting country. This Government is not concerned to do anything about diversifying our export base. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is. I do not see any evidence that it is concerned. For example, a few months ago the Treasurer was talking about the need to stimulate savings; about how we were not ever going to get out of our balance of payments difficulties until we actually did stimulate savings. I will try to find that quote, because I think it is a very important one from the point of view of what I am talking about. Anyway, he said that the fundamental need at the present time is to stimulate savings in Australia. Yet he has consistently ruled out taking any measures that would stimulate private sector savings and, most recently, he has decided to reduce the prospective public sector savings by 50 per cent. He has a prospective public sector surplus next year of $10 billion, $11 billion, $12 billion, whatever it is, and he is reducing that by 50 per cent. He is not worried about generating savings; he is not worried about solving our balance of payments problem from that point of view at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Equally, we have a government here that prevaricates, delays, ducks and weaves over an issue as fundamentally important to our exports as the third runway at Mascot. The Government claims to be interested in developing our tourist capacity, yet it cannot make a decision over six or seven years to build a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The truth is that it should have built the third runway and accelerated the process of building the second airport. Equally, it has prevaricated over the decision of Wesley Vale, an undertaking that promises to be a $1 billion project in this country. It is not seriously interested in exports from those points of view. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Government talks about tax reform another area in which it has to make some fundamental changes. What has this Government done about tax reform? Its idea of tax reform is more taxes. Today in this Parliament we are about to debate a whole range of new taxes on superannuation. The Government has introduced a host of other new taxes. What tax reform means to this Government is increasing the tax burdens on the average Australian. It has absolutely nothing to do with genuinely reforming tax. We have a tax system that discriminates against savings. Why on earth will the Government live with a tax system which discriminates against savings and encourages people to go into debt? There are fundamentally the wrong sorts of signals coming from our tax system for a country like Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also got-and I will make this my final point-a blind spot on industrial relations and wages. It has just been decisively rolled by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Last year Bill Kelty was talking with the Treasurer about a tax- wage trade-off. What trade-off? All we got was an across-the-board wage increase unrelated to productivity, on top of that a tax cut. What has also been committed is a host of increases in public sector expenditure in the name of the social wage. What price this special relationship with the trade union movement? Until those problems are addressed, all this puts this country at risk. Time will tell, and in the passage of the rest of this year or early next year watch the financial markets vote with their feet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my first speech to this House, which I made over 30 years ago, I spoke of my experiences as a prisoner of war (POW) under the Japanese during the Second World War. I spoke of the time at Hintock Road camp when I served under Lieutenant-Colonel Weary Dunlop on the construction of the Burma-Siam railway, and I spoke of the collective principles by which we lived under Weary's leadership during those long years. I stated in my initial speech that in our prisoner of war camp we lived by the principles of the fit looking after the sick, the young looking after the old and the rich looking after the poor. I might say at this time that my whole POW experience had an enormous influence on me, whether it was in Timor, Java, Singapore, on the Burma-Thailand railway or, finally, in Japan where I saw the atomic explosion that destroyed Nagasaki at the end of the war. That experience helped to mould my thoughts during my development as a man and particularly during my political life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is with deep regret and a sense of sadness that I must once again relive these experiences before the House in what will be my last parliamentary term representing the people of Australia. It is particularly distressing that the issue of adequate compensation for former prisoners of war of the Japanese should have to be confronted at a time when we have a Labor Government in this country, a Government which I had hoped would carry out its moral obligations of undertaking a more equitable sharing of the wealth of this nation amongst all people and of implementing the principles which I have striven to achieve throughout my political life. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about the needs of those former service men and women who were imprisoned by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War that I wish to direct my remarks today. Four decades have now passed since Australian soldiers of the 8th Division were captured after the fall of Singapore and the islands which now form the nation of Indonesia and imprisoned by the Japanese for 3 1/2 years. Those captured were subsequently subjected to physical and psychological stress which is barely credible; malnutrition, multiple infections, inadequate shelter, prolonged marches, work to the point of total exhaustion, capricious violence and humiliation. At various times work party forces of these prisoners were sent to other areas, the most notorious of which was the Burma-Thailand railway construction project. </PARA>
<PARA> The physical and mental deprivation suffered and endured led to the deaths of over one-third of those prisoners during captivity. Individual circumstances which could be described only as horrific, saw even greater death rates. The story of the ill-fated F Force shows the extreme likelihood of death by starvation, ill-treatment and disease. Here there was no heat and excitement of battle, yet the hardships and privations endured by these prisoners were infinitely greater than any likely to be met in active service. The casualties were unfortunately of a greater proportion. In just 12 months the members of F Force lost 3,087 men out of a total of 6,998, and 1,058 of those who lost their lives were Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly surprising that the occurrence of illness suffered by these servicemen was abnormally high. The personal reminiscences of the medical officers who served in the Japanese prison camps during the war dramatically highlight the medical condition of these men. Dr Ian Duncan, a veteran of the Burma-Thailand railway, spoke during a 1985 Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio series Australians under Nippon of the extent of disease and infestation amongst these servicemen. Dr Duncan said:</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the war I interviewed every Australian and English soldier in my camp; I was the only medical officer in the camp and I thought it was my duty to record their disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Duncan went on to make the following very interesting comments:</PARA>
<PARA>You say to them, `What diseases have you had as a prisoner of war?'. `Nothing much, Doc, nothing much at all'. `Did you have malaria?'. `Oh, yes, I had malaria'. `Did you have dysentery?'. `Oh, yes, I had dysentery'. `Did you have beri-beri?'. `Oh, yes, I had beri-beri'. `Did you have pellagra?'. `Yes, I had pellagra but nothing very much'. All these are lethal diseases, but that was the norm . . . everyone had them. Therefore they accepted them as normal. </PARA>
<PARA>Clinical evidence reinforces the poignant nature of the high incidence of disease and illness suffered by prisoners of war of the Japanese. In surveys conducted by Dr Kerry Goulston, formerly the senior specialist in gastroenterology at the Concord Repatriation Hospital, and recorded in the July 1985 edition of the Medical Journal of Australia, the disproportionately excessive incidence of potentially fatal disease amongst ex-prisoners of war compared with non-prisoners of war is clearly demonstrated. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which highlights the mean rate of occurrence of specific illnesses during World War II as recalled by ex-prisoners of war compared with non-prisoners of war. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE4">Mr UREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table shows several alarmingly high occurrences of disease. Beri-beri was contracted by 83 per cent of ex-prisoners of war compared with just one per cent of non-prisoners of war. Leg ulcers were developed by 60 per cent of ex-prisoners of war compared with 13 per cent of non-prisoners of war. What was called happy feet-jumpy, painful feet associated with vitamin deficiency-was developed by 49 per cent of ex-prisoners of war compared with 4 per cent of non-prisoners of war. Cholera was contracted by 7 per cent of ex-prisoners of war, whilst none of the non-prisoners of war who were interviewed had this crippling, lethal disease.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could give graphic descriptions of all these diseases. For instance, prisoners with beri-beri would wake up with their faces and legs swollen abnormally. One could push one's thumb into their skin and the thumb mark would stay there. Some of these people died of beri-beri through strangulation of the heart. The smell and stench of an ulcer ward is still with me today. The odour of dead flesh is indescribable. Worst of all was the cholera epidemic. One would go out to one's work place and come back that night to find that one's comrade had caught this disease and aged 50 years in a day. Cholera sufferers would excrete from the rear, the penis and the mouth the saline in their bodies. Their bodies would dehydrate. Their eyes would sink into their heads, their temples would become deeply sunken in and they would turn a grey-green colour. It was miraculous that many of those people were saved through doctors like Weary Dunlop and others strapping them down and inserting a drip in their arms to try to replace saline into their bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked about the ill-fated H Force, which I mentioned in my maiden speech, which was a group of British soldiers. I am not passing a reflection on the British, but they did not have the same comradeship that we had. Over 400 of them came into an area adjoining the Hintock road camp. The wet season started a few days after they arrived. In the old British tradition the officers took the best tents, the senior NCOs took the next best and the men got the dregs. They hardly did any work at all. Of those 400 men less than 50 walked out of that camp six weeks later, and of that 50 about 25 survived. One would walk out of a morning to go to work and have to walk over the corpses-that would be one's starting point. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that most of those people died from cholera and some of dysentery. At Kanchanaburi Cemetery in Thailand the period in which these people died can be seen. They died in the second half of 1943. That this occurred at that time is a tragedy. Prime Minister Hawke visited that cemetery recently and at Sir Ninian Stephen's farewell dinner Hawkie called me over and said, `Tom, I was so deeply shocked at that experience and witnessing that those people died in such numbers in that period'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am being dramatic today because I want to place on record an account of what these people went through and I want to make sure that the people who will make the decisions understand some of the problems that these prisoners of war were confronted with. </PARA>
<PARA> The medical conditions of these servicemen is therefore hardly surprising. For 3 1/2 years these prisoners of war of the Japanese were forced to work on a diet grossly deficient in energy and vitamins. They were exposed to numerous infections, including diphtheria, bacterial dysentery, respiratory infections, tropical ulcers, malaria and various gastrointestinal infections. Added to these diseases were grievous forms of maltreatment, the spectacle of the death of their comrades and the fear that they themselves would die before release. They were denied letters from their loved ones and this contributed materially to their mental anguish. </PARA>
<PARA> During the construction of the railway men worked under savage pressure for up to 16 hours a day for months on end without a rest. Many of the prisoners, particularly the weakest, never saw in the daylight the squalid huts where they resided. They went out to work before daylight and got back in the dark. As a result of this protracted, intense, emotional and physical deprivation suffered during imprisonment, the number of men who returned to Australia from Japanese prisoner of war camps was dramatically fewer than those imprisoned by the dreaded fascists of Italy and the Nazis of Germany and those in war torn Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures are a telling indictment of the inhuman suffering of the prisoners of war of the Japanese. As I have previously said in the House, 550,000 Australians served in all theatres of war. There were 19,000 killed in action and of the 8,000 prisoners of war taken by the German and Italian forces 7,700 came back. I am not undermining the fact that less than 4 per cent of those prisoners died because that is bad enough. But there were 22,000 prisoners of war of the Japanese, of whom only 14,000 returned. Incredibly, 36 per cent of the servicemen imprisoned by the Japanese died in captivity. This suffering and dying of so many men and women as prisoners of war is a distinguishing experience of Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA> The postwar period saw little in the way of compensation for these horrific conditions suffered by the prisoners of war of the Japanese. Indeed, the refusal of the Australian Government-both the Labor Government of 1946 and the Menzies conservative Government of 1949-to allow prisoners of war to collect their entitlement to 3 1/2 years worth of subsistence allowances was seen by many ex-prisoners of war as a rebuke by the very nation for which so many lives had been sacrificed. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the servicemen serving in Indonesia, which was formerly called Dutch East India, were guinea pigs. The group of Australian soldiers from the Middle East landed at Java. A battalion was put onto trucks and they were driven all over Java to make the Japanese think that there were divisions of Australians on the island. On Timor, where I served, there were 1,000 Australians to combat about 24,000 Japanese. We inflicted many casualties, more than in any other theatre of war in the Malaysian and East Indies campaign as a matter of fact. My comrade Sir John Carrick was on Timor with me at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The long period of conservative government following the war saw little in the way of material benefits for veterans in general and specifically for ex-prisoners of war. In 1974 the Whitlam Government represented a significant shift from this general indifference to the continuing suffering of ex-prisoners of war. Free medical, hospital, dental and optical treatment was made available to all ex-prisoners of war irrespective of whether the injuries were war caused or not. Sadly, since March 1983-or really since 1985, but the Government responsible for this has been in office since March 1983-there has been a substantial erosion of these benefits. I set this out comprehensively in my speech during a grievance debate in October 1988. Whilst these erosions represented across the board cuts for all veterans many Japanese former prisoners of war were both deeply hurt and financially disadvantaged as a consequence. Since I last spoke on this issue in the House in October last year I have had meetings with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), other Ministers of the Hawke Cabinet and senior public servants. In all cases I have consistently put forward the case for just remuneration for ex-prisoners of war. Up to this stage I have received a sympathetic hearing from all those involved. I am not trying to butter anybody up, but the Prime Minister has been very understanding of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government's positive action in relation to the establishment of an extreme disablement adjustment to correct the anomaly whereby the totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pension would not be available to any veteran who had turned 65 years of age or had ceased employment demonstrates an understanding of the care required for all veterans. But it is imperative that specific action be taken to compensate those ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese who suffered more than any other servicemen during the Second World War in the defence of freedom and democracy. Australia was once at the forefront in the treatment of and compensation for ex-prisoners of war but it is now well behind other comparable countries, particularly Canada and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> I am troubled that I have to make this speech on behalf of my fellow former prisoners of war at this stage in our history, 44 years after the cessation of hostilities. Of the 14,000 prisoners of war of the Japanese I mentioned who were fortunate enough to survive the horrors and deprivation of life in the camps fewer than 6,000 are alive today. About a third of these survivors, due to the severity of their medical condition, are now receiving the TPI rate of pension. Senior officials in the Department of Veterans' Affairs have informed me that of these former prisoners of war of the Japanese who are still alive some 70 per cent will die from war related illnesses or injury. Their wives will be able to receive the war widows pension. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been made abundantly clear from a vast array of medical evidence that the medical condition of those ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese still alive remains significantly worse than that of ex-servicemen in general. Several recent studies undertaken by doctors pre-eminent in their field state conclusively that former prisoners of war of the Japanese in World War II continue to have a significantly increased risk of illness and death compared with other servicemen who served in the Pacific rim but who were not prisoners of war. As prisoners soldiers were grossly undernourished, overworked and subject to many tropical diseases, as well as maltreatment by their captors. The illnesses suffered by these ex-prisoners therefore bear direct relationship to the nature of these war time experiences. </PARA>
<PARA> A study conducted by Professor Christopher Tennant of the psychiatric unit of the Royal North Shore Hospital reported in 1986 in the journal Psychological Medicine that prisoners of war had significantly more anxiety and depressive neuroses than a comparative sample of combatants from Pacific theatres of war who were not captured. (Extension of time granted) In terms of clinical psychiatric status prisoners of war of the Japanese had a greater risk of having a post-war clinical psychiatric disorder than did the comparison group-71 per cent compared to 46 per cent. Similarly, a study by Dr Kerry Goulston of the Concord Repatriation Hospital, reported in the July 1985 edition of the Medical Journal of Australia, on gastro-intestinal morbidity among World War II prisoners of war concluded, in part, that 25 per cent of ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese suffered from duodenal ulcers compared with only 10 per cent of the non-prisoner of war group. Twenty-five per cent of prisoners of war had one or more admissions to hospital for gastric disease compared with 14 per cent of non-prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA> A further study of post-war mortality among Australian World War II prisoners of the Japanese, which examines the impact of detention as a prisoner of war on post-war survival and disease-specific mortality, reported in as late as the April 1989 edition of the Medical Journal of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> From 1945 to 1959, the ex-prisoner of war group had estimated mortality rates which were four times those of the comparison group. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to point out that former prisoners of the Japanese in World War II continue to have a significantly increased risk of death compared with that of other servicemen who served in the South West Pacific and South East Asia but who were not prisoners of war. Further detailed medical evidence, which clearly points to the same fundamental conclusions, is all publicly available. It indicates the urgency of the situation and the real need for action to be taken to recompense ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese in the forthcoming Budget. Action not taken immediately will prove too late for the ever dwindling survivors of the Japanese prison camps of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> What is required is a full restoration of all the benefits granted to the ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese under the Whitlam Government of 1974-benefits which in the interim have slowly been eroded. These include the provision of free medical, hospital, dental and optical treatment for all veterans, the proper appreciation of ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese in relation to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and the removal of the statutory patient contribution which currently applies to war veterans who require nursing home care. It must also include a revision of the legislation affecting liability for the Medicare Levy which now means that an ex-prisoner of war whose spouse has a private income is not eligible for exemption from this one per cent tax, which was previously the case. I want to stress that if the spouse or partner is working then that person should have to pay the one per cent Medicare levy. I am stressing that the prisoners of war of the Japanese, who were formerly exempted, whether their wives were working or not, should be exempted from that one per cent levy. Because the totally and permanently incapacitated pension is not available to those ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese who have turned 65 years of age and have ceased employment, and because the Government has already set a precedent in the extreme disablement adjustment available to all veterans, I would argue that the Government should create in this Budget a special pension for ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese only. I stress the word `only' because I am specifically talking about prisoners of war of the Japanese. Those prisoners of war of the Japanese entitled to this special pension should be in need and should not already be in receipt of a TPI pension. This special pension should be paid at a rate higher than that of the extreme disablement adjustment and the entitlement for this special pension should be assessed in a compassionate way. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, some politicians and public servants argue that there should be no special cases in dealing with precedence in regard to veterans. But there have been special cases such as the case set in 1974 when the ex-prisoners of war were granted free medical, hospital, dental and optical treatment. I hope I have given enough evidence in my speech to clearly identify that the ex-Japanese prisoners of war are different from other veterans. I think if we were to ask the veterans themselves they would recognise this proposal. The sacrifices of the ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese are unequalled as a group in the defence of freedom and democracy in the Second World War. No other group suffered as they did. I am seeking justice for the surviving ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese. I hope the Government will give compassionate consideration to their claims. </PARA>

<PARA> The Supply Bill (No. 1) 1989-90, the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1989-90 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90 seek interim authority for Commonwealth expenditure not allowed for in the appropriations, which the House has already approved for the period up to when the next Budget is brought down. The amounts dealt with in these Bills represent about $14 billion, which is some 16 per cent of estimated Commonwealth outlays in the 1989-90 financial year. As the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) said in his second reading speech, Supply Bill (No. 1) deals with a 14.5 per cent increase in spending over the amount provided last year in the equivalent Bill, while Supply Bill (No. 2) seeks authority for an amount which is 46 per cent greater than that provided for in last year's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills offer the opportunity to discuss questions of fiscal policy and its relationship to the role of government. The spending outlined in these Bills makes clear that the Labor Government's claims in relation to a tight fiscal policy are little more than rhetoric, designed to disguise the fact that, while it wants government to run efficiently, as we all do, the Australian Labor Party is still the party of big government and interventionism. Fiscal policy is much more than an economic policy tool which can finetune growth in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that fiscal policy alone is not effective in achieving the goals of government. Supposedly, expansionary policies in the short term can reduce growth in the long run. Fiscal policy is also a reflection of the Government's ideological beliefs about the role of government. The Labor Party's fiscal policy is dominated by its ideological considerations. What honourable members opposite mean when they refer to `tight' fiscal policy is a tight fiscal policy within the narrow constraints of their ideological beliefs-and those beliefs necessitate extensive government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to the record level of spending required to fund its extensive programs of social engineering. Within those limits, the most that can be expected from the Labor Party on the fiscal policy front is a tinkering at the edges. In recent years, Labor has marginally limited the growth of Federal Government outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). This has been achieved largely through the use of policies which have produced high growth, but through the agency of relatively high inflation, and it has not been accompanied by lasting development of the productive capacity of Australian business and entrepreneurial activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's smaller share of GDP is a feature of growth in measured GDP rather than a decline in the cost and role of government. Thus, much contemporary debate about fiscal policy is wildly astray. The debate cannot just be about a greater efficiency in the provision of government services. Both sides of the political debate want that efficiency-but for different reasons and involving different outcomes. The coalition wants to use savings to reduce the demands of government on taxpayers. Labor wants greater efficiency so that it has more money to spend on defending its electoral fortunes and supporting its favoured constituency. A genuine debate about fiscal policy must involve debate about what government should and should not do. </PARA>
<PARA> As it happens, Labor has its hands tied behind its back in the debate about fiscal measures. It is committed to expensive government funding of pet projects and to support for the vested interests which Labor depends on. In the process of this extension of the role of government under Labor, the proper functions of government suffer and decline from neglect and under-funding. Increasingly, it is being realised that economic policy is not a simple exercise in the engineering of economic aggregates and statistics. For all the efforts of the Government to fiddle the measures of inflation, Australians are still aware that prices are rising. The economic effects of high inflation are not eliminated by the less than honest expedient of changing the way that a government agency chooses to measure that inflation. Similarly, the short term effects of a Budget surplus will not alter the reality of an economic policy which has seen foreign debt rise to a record level of some $120 billion-that is, $120,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> The macro-economic structure of the Government's fiscal policy-that is, whether it is high or low, increasing or decreasing-can be far less important than the micro-economic make-up of that government spending. The economic effects of government spending can be vastly different, depending on what the money is being spent on. It is at this micro-economic level that the fiscal policies of the Labor Party, under the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Treasurer (Mr Keating), have led to lower growth and greater inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor has executed fiscal policies which distort the market, reduce efficiency and remove incentives to remain independent of the support of government. These Supply Bills help to illustrate the problem. For example, nearly $1.5m is provided for the Australian Industry Council secretariat. That secretariat provides administrative support for the structure of corporatist industries councils, which Labor developed a particular liking for in its earliest years in office. This expenditure has not only been a waste of money but it has also helped to produce the failures of the Government's industry plans. In turn, industry policy under Labor has compounded the problems of the dependence of industry on the initiatives of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's industry planning has increased the power of trade unions and has institutionalised the rigid and outmoded industrial relations systems. It has produced a productivity performance which is well below that of comparable Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. An important investigation of the Government's car industry plan, once the centrepiece of Labor industry policy, has suggested that the industry is not competitive and that it is producing a product which is too expensive and of inferior quality. The advancements made by automotive manufacturers in recent years have been in spite of, rather than because of, the Government's industry plans and the agencies which are supposedly there to support them. In the meantime, consumers have to pay huge tariffs on imported vehicles, which still manage to compete with their Australian equivalents. Compounding these industrial problems is an industrial relations system which is an affront to all of those who genuinely believe in individual liberty. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation seeks to spend some $12m on the Australian Industrial Registry, which is the agency through which the Government's new industrial relations legislation effectively prohibits genuine freedom of association in the workplace. The Industrial Registrar is responsible for the obnoxious procedure of granting permission to individuals who do not wish to join a union or an industrial association. Under the industrial legislation one has to have the permission of a bureaucrat to retain any freedom at all in the workplace, and even if it is granted, that freedom is heavily qualified. Similarly, the legislation denies freedom of association by prohibiting the registration of new trade unions in competition with those unions which already have registration. Through the agency of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-cum-Labor Party programs for the amalgamation of trade unions into so-called mega-unions, it will see union hierarchies even more distant from their membership, it will see more influence over government and it will produce a more rigid labour market. That has been ordained in the industrial relations legislation. It is an example of a government spending measure which is fairly small in total but which will contribute to the widespread economic disasters of poor productivity and reduced incentives for hard work. It illustrates that the direction of spending can be just as important as the aggregate amount of spending. </PARA>
<PARA> Government fiscal policy produces the apparently anomalous position of being fairly tight, while encouraging wages and other outcomes which are themselves far more expansionary than is in the best interests of the nation. Why does Australia need a tight fiscal policy? There are two major reasons why the Government should tighten its fiscal measures. Firstly, a tight fiscal policy will have necessary effects on demand, which will counter the recent enormous growth in the current account deficit. It is the current account deficit which has to be addressed first. A reduction in the role of government which accompanies a tight fiscal policy would open up room for more efficient private sector operations, which, in turn, would help the competitiveness of export industries. Secondly, fiscal policy would take on some of the burden presently shouldered by monetary policy, which has led to increasing interest rates and will eventually cause even greater havoc in the domestic economy. Not only has the Government come to depend almost exclusively on monetary policy, but also it has lost control of some of the most important aspects of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time the growth in monetary aggregates has been amongst the most rapid in the Western world. M1 has grown at the rate of 14.2 per cent, while broad money has grown at a rate of 22 per cent. This growth in money supplies underlies and underpins the high inflation rates which Australia still endures. It contributes to the need for high interest rates, and Australian interest rates are now the highest amongst the reasonably stable countries of the Western world. The response of the Treasurer is to claim that the concern over monetary growth is an anachronism in a deregulated market. He derides monetary targeting as inconvenient and inaccurate. On both counts, experience has proved him wrong. The measures of monetary aggregates might be inaccurate, but so are many of the other economic statistics which the Treasurer quotes with gay abandon if they happen to be favourable to the point he is plugging at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The most difficult problems of measuring money supply occur in the United States of America. The United States dollar is the most heavily traded currency in the world and, being the reserve currency it is, is held in large quantities by governments and central banks around the world, yet the United States has not abandoned monetary targeting. It has set its targets low and has met or exceeded those targets. As to the problems with the economy of the United States, excessive monetary growth is not one of them. Our economy differs very greatly from that of the United States in that respect also. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Treasurer has done in the monetary policy field is to abdicate responsibility, adopting confusing practices and confused policy which leads to uncertainty and potentially disastrous results. When monetary policy is lost to the Government as an effective means of dealing with the economic mess which this Government has created and fiscal policy is constrained by the ideological needs for big government and action by the Federal Government, the economic prospects for the country are not all that good. In fact, they might be said to be very dire indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The spending which these Supply Bills outline and the prospects for the next Federal Budget indicate that the Government has failed to come to grips with the recent changes in the economic outlook which, in turn, result from long-run policies, such as the so-called accord, that have undermined the economic future of this nation. The Government is no longer able to deliver the economic reforms which Australia needs if we are to claw our way back from the brink of an abyss which is made deeper by a $120,000m foreign debt, an inflation rate of at least 7 per cent, unemployment levels stuck at around 7 per cent, interest rates amongst the highest in the world, wages growth which is about to get out of hand, and levels of taxation which are unprecedented. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor remains beholden to the ACTU, extensive government spending-to the point of being excessive-through the Medicare mess, burgeoning social security costs, and a range of new legislation which will undermine the competitiveness of Australia business. Labor offers no prospect of genuine solutions to deep-seated economic problems. It is unable to deliver privatisation, labour market deregulation and continuing micro-economic reforms. The Labor Party is no longer capable of governing the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, I was about to make the same point. The comments by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) about the terrible experiences of prisoners of war of the Japanese were a moving tribute to those men and women. Their comments were a fine example of bipartisan humanitarianism and concern in this chamber. I warmly endorse and support the comments of both honourable members. I would like to be able to go on and say that I agree with everything else that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin, said, but unfortunately I cannot do that. I agree with one comment he made, that the justification for public expenditure depends on what it is spent on. It is true that sometimes public expenditure should be increased and that sometimes it needs to be decreased. I want to present this morning a case for increases in one of the centrally important areas of government outlays, public investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Adam Smith is sometimes claimed to be the chief philosopher of the free marketeers, yet he argues in the Wealth of Nations that one of the basic responsibilities of sovereign or Commonwealth government is to provide an adequate structure of public works `to facilitate the commerce of society'. He argues that an extensive and well maintained system of roads, bridges, highways, lighthouses and canals is necessary to meet the needs of a vital, growing economy. The duty of constructing such public works falls to the Government because their benefits accrue not just to particular individuals but to the economy at large, or because the cost reductions derived from economies of scale are best captured by direct, centralised, public capital outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> These propositions would have been accepted generally by public policy makers and other economists for most of the last two centuries since they were written by Adam Smith. It is only the aberrant monetarists, who believe tighter monetary control and cutting public outlays are the key policies, and equally aberrant supply siders, whose highest priority is to cut taxes, who would challenge them. In Australia, at least until the early 1970s, all major political parties, business, unions and academics agreed that the public and private sectors shared the role of being the engine of growth. The rapid pace of Australian private sector development would have been impossible without public investment in roads, railways, water and sewerage, electricity and gas supplies, telecommunications and assisted migration, let alone activities such as health services and education, housing and general government. That national consensus, which had existed for most of Australia's history, disappeared in the 1970s under the influence of the monetarists and the supply siders. One consequence was a fall in the priority given to outlays on public investment. In the 20 years from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s public investment was allowed to fall as a proportion of national income from about 9 1/2 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent. Private investment did not increase to fill the gap either. In fact, private investment, including housing, also fell from 18 1/2 per cent of national income in the mid-1960s to 16 per cent in the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> Maintenance and replacement have also been affected. Though Australia's infrastructure is younger than that of comparable western countries it is not much younger. Therefore we can expect the build up of rehabilitation or replacement during the next decade that has already occurred in other industrialised countries. Two of Australia's most serious economic problems are the current account deficit and high unemployment. Reducing the seriousness of those problems will involve restructuring economic activity to build up new and existing export industries and to reduce imports. This requires not only private investment but also an efficient, up to date public infrastructure so as to maximise Australia's competitiveness. The need for improved productivity cannot end at the factory gate. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent work has shown that Australia is facing severe capital capacity constraints. We need more investment in both human and physical capital to achieve a more rapid growth in Australian exports. This means we cannot simply employ more people without the capital backup, if the employment is to be most productive. The size of the current account deficit is imposing severe constraints on Australia and on the public sector at present. It is tempting for governments to reduce capital spending in the current economic climate. However, this not only reduces economic activity and employment growth in the short run but also runs down the nation's investment in infrastructure, its economic efficiency and eventually the social fabric of society. Increasing investment is centrally important to achieve more rapid economic and employment growth and to cope with our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the few relationships about which all economists agree is that between investment and economic growth. That relationship is shown by comparative experience between Australia and other Western countries. For example, from 1962 to 1979, Australia had the third lowest rate of investment and the fourth lowest growth of national income of 25 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries-that is, all Western countries. Only the United States, Canada and New Zealand had a lower rate of economic growth per person employed than Australia. In common with New Zealand, Canada and the United States, we have relied too heavily on past investment and now find our relative place slipping away. </PARA>
<PARA> This conclusion is reinforced by research in the United States by David Aschauer. This research shows that changes in public investment have a significant impact on private investment. Aschauer has found that a rise in the public capital stock makes private capital more productive. Public investment leads to growth in private investment by increasing rates of return on private capital. There is a striking tendency for profits to be high when the level of public capital formation is high over the course of several years, even after excluding business cycle effects. This is a clear example of the complementarity of the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> A related area of concern is maintenance. The worst fears of major infrastructure networks all falling apart at the same time are probably unfounded. Many of our infrastructure services and networks compare well with the best in the world. But to avoid the problems of the gradual, inevitable deterioration of infrastructure needs thought and planning. We have not seen major freeways in Australia fall into such a bad state of repair that they could not be used, as happened in parts of the United States in the 1970s. The same thing could happen here, but would not, if sufficient financing is provided to ensure adequate maintenance. However, maintenance and replacement needs will substantially increase during the rest of this century due to the overall age pattern of Australian infrastructure. Unless funding requirements due to ageing can be offset by savings elsewhere through lower demand, aggregate public investment must rise. It says something for the managers of public assets that they have been able to maintain infrastructure assets with a generally declining share of national resources. But this situation is about to change, with increasing requirements for rehabilitation and maintenance expenditure in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps of more concern than the state of the nation's assets is the failure to examine thoroughly other areas for potentially productive investment. For example, many overseas countries have intermodal links between rail and port and rail and airports-links which are generally missing in Australia. There are many gaps in Australia's infrastructure and areas where it would be desirable to increase investment. These include urban arterial and ring roads in capital cities; standard gauge rail to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and many other potential improvements in the rail system with high estimated rates of return; improvements in airport facilities in Sydney; significant unsewered areas in cities, notably Perth; salination of the Murray-Darling basin; and the quality of Adelaide water. A major potential new investment has begun in telecommunications, including the great potential to improve productivity with the proposed Integrated Services Digital Network. There are likely to be many other areas where greater infrastructure investment would yield high rates of return also. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most striking example is the study of a very fast train between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. This is being undertaken by a private consortium and the pre-feasibility study has been sufficiently promising for the group to be now doing a full feasibility study. That is a very important private sector development which the public sector should support and look towards ways of cooperating with. Assuming that a thorough procedure for selecting public infrastructure investments is used, the question remains as to whether all viable projects can be funded. If present practices continue to be followed, potentially profitable public investments may still be excluded by a cut-off in funds through the global limits on loan council borrowings. Private investment does not place the same absolute cut-off in funds once a certain level of investment is reached. Rather, projects are considered on their merits and, if finance is not available for justifiable projects locally, local overseas funds may be sought. A similar kind of situation ought to apply in the public sector. Rather than being a residual, public investment should have a much higher priority so that all facets of the budget-recurrent and capital, revenue and the deficit, or, as we have at present, the surplus-are set on a iterative basis in relation to budget priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Another innovation which is important is exclusion of borrowings by commercial public authorities from the public sector borrowing requirement. That would assist better planning of investment by these authorities. The impact of public authorities such as Telecom Australia, Overseas Telecommunications Commission, Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd on the capital market is very similar to that of private corporations. There is no logical reason for including them in the general funding transactions of government. The question following from what I have said is: How could increased public investment be funded? Increased public investment could be funded by increasing borrowing. That would be the logical way to do it. That is the way the private sector does it; when it wants to invest it borrows. Why should not the public sector do the same thing, because after all, investment is in facilities which will improve conditions for later generations?</PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to general belief, Australia has a relatively low level of public debt as a proportion of gross domestic product. In fact, Australia is second only to Finland as the lowest public debtor amongst Western countries. There is little empirical evidence to support the view that public sector borrowing crowds out the private sector. The simple version of the `crowding out' theory, which holds that higher levels of public borrowing will reduce the scope for private investment, cannot be sustained by the evidence. Even the more sophisticated version, that increased public borrowing leads to higher interest rates, cannot be sustained by empirical evidence. As Australia has a small open economy, Australian interest rates are set principally by interest rates in the US, by expected changes in Australia's exchange rate, by our inflation rate and by the standards of monetary policy, rather than by the extent of government borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be essential, nevertheless, to minimise potential damage to market perceptions from any increase in public sector borrowing. One way of doing this would be to separate the capital and recurrent sides of the Budget, as many countries do. This would show that recurrent outlays were entirely covered by recurrent revenue and that revenue at present also pays for all investment. In fact, it has always paid for some investment throughout the post-war period. It would demonstrate clearly that all borrowing was for investment. Publicity about the returns and other economic benefits of that investment would then contribute to justifying the borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major constraints on investment is simply that Australia's savings rate is too low. The spread of occupational superannuation will certainly contribute to increasing household saving. It is interesting to consider methods used for encouraging saving in countries where the saving rate is high, such as Japan. There, until recently, substantial tax concessions were offered to encourage saving. I think it is very worthwhile to consider that kind of policy also in Australia. A heavy reliance on foreign capital for national investment involves even greater debt and equity servicing obligations which, given our current level of overseas debt, should be avoided. Therefore, it is important to build up Australia's saving rate and it is worth looking at the possibility of offering tax concessions to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have outlined a strategy for providing the infrastructure framework, for increasing national productivity and for restructuring the economy. Public investment must be increased if we are to improve our trading position, reduce our overseas debt and maintain steady rates of economic and employment growth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to the contribution by the Hon. Tom Uren, the honourable member for Reid, with a great deal of emotion. I was deeply moved by what he had to say about Australian prisoners of war during World War II, particularly in the Japanese theatres of war. I have a personal interest in this matter. I was only born in 1934, so I was fairly young when the war started. But my godfather was a prisoner of the Japanese in Changi in Singapore and served on that infamous death railway between Bangkok and Burma. In 1945 I can recall going with my parents to the Sydney Showground to greet the returning prisoners of war of the Japanese. I can still see the doubledecker buses coming in and the walking skeletons, the scarecrows of men, being helped off the buses. It may come as no surprise to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I certainly support wholeheartedly and totally the move by the honourable member for Reid to have some special recognition of these Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> None of us can ever possibly understand what those men went through. One hears our good friend Tom talk and one really gets the feeling. If one sees some of the film from the time and one reads some of the accounts, these must also make any human being abhor war and the inhumanity of man to man. I find it fairly distressing, when talking to a lot of young people in Australia today, that they do not really believe that that happened. I find it quite often. They see things on television. Perhaps it is the conditioning, the horror and violence that we get on our television every day, but very largely one finds that young people say, `Oh, that could not happen. Nobody could do that'. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly do not hold any brief for not forgiving. I do not think we can forget and I do not think we should forget. But most of our ex-service men and women who served in the Japanese theatre of war are prepared to forgive. In the interests of humanity in the long run, however, we must never forget. Over the Christmas period, only a few months ago, my wife and I had the opportunity of briefly visiting Singapore. I also undertook a study tour of parts of Thailand. I took it as a necessary duty and obligation to visit the Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore and to pay a brief pilgrimage to Changi gaol which is still there as a gaol, with vastly different conditions of course. I took the opportunity to visit the small memorial and the reconstruction of the chapel at the Changi prison. Christmas day was the most remarkable and wonderful Christmas day, because we left Bangkok at about 5.30 in the morning and travelled by bus to Kanchanaburi, up towards the River Kwai, where we visited a Commonwealth war cemetery with mainly Australians buried there. It is a great tribute to the Office of Australian War Graves that our war cemeteries are kept in such immaculate order. </PARA>
<PARA> As one walks along the rows of those gravestones with those plaques and reads the names and other information, above all, one is struck by the ages of our fellow Australians. Some of course were my age, some in their 30s and 40s, but above all the majority were 18, 19, 20 and 25 years of age. What an incredible waste! On that particular Christmas day we visited the war cemetery there and went to one of the Buddhist temples in which is maintained a museum of the prisoners of war. From there we moved up to that famous or infamous bridge on the River Kwai and walked across it. We then went up to the hotel where we were to spend two nights, the River Kwai Village Hotel. I hired a car and a driver and went further up towards Burma to what has now become the famous Hell-Fire Pass. I walked down the steps which the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce had installed to Hell-Fire Pass, which is one of the cuttings on the Burma-Thailand death railway. This is again a very moving experience, because one moves down through open forests of bamboo; it is very still, very quiet, very hot and humid and one walks along the bed of what was the railway line. Some of the sleepers are still there and one can step from sleeper to sleeper. I stopped and realised that in the building of that railway 16,000 allied servicemen died. I could be wrong; if Tom were here he could correct me. As well as that, another 100,000 Asian labourers drawn from Singapore and all over Asia by the Japanese worked on that railway as slave labour. When one stepped on one of those sleepers while walking along the rail bed, one could not help but be conscious that one human being died for every sleeper on that railway line. I will not go on about it at great length, except to say that any Australian who has the opportunity to visit Thailand should take the time to make this pilgrimage, because that is what it is-a pilgrimage. In fact, on 26 April last year-the day after Anzac Day-Hell-Fire Pass was dedicated as a memorial to Australian prisoners of war and a suitable plaque is on display. As I said, I spent a memorable Christmas day visiting Australian war cemeteries. </PARA>
<PARA> Hell-Fire Pass is only one of many cuttings where our fellow countrymen suffered and, in many instances, died. Japanese engineers said that it would take them about five years to build the railway which the British had surveyed in, I think, 1902. Of course, it took far less than that; it took probably under two years. This result was achieved by Australian prisoners of war and others working with picks, shovels and crowbars and some explosives but no other equipment or machines. They dug a cutting down through solid rock basically using manual labour and carted the debris away in baskets. They worked God knows how many hours a day, but certainly from the very early hours until well after dark. The area had to be illuminated by flares hung above the pass. Of course, this hellish situation, with the illumination from flares, led to the name of Hell-Fire Pass. I am delighted to see my friend and colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) come into the chamber. He also has an association with Hell-Fire Pass. To conclude my remarks on this topic, I again commend the honourable member for Reid on the proposal he has put forward. I think every member of the House should support it totally because, in my view, there is absolute justice in what he says. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another area which is also of great concern to me but on a different level. I refer to the current attack by the Government on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I think it would come as no surprise not only to members of this Parliament but also to members of the public that the pharmacists of this country are quite distressed and up in arms over what has been happening. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme has been a vital and important facet of our overall health scheme for nearly 40 years. However, since the Hawke Government came into office there has been attack after attack on pharmacies, the most recent of which was contained in the 12 April economic statement which proposed to cut from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme $31m in 1989-90, $96m in 1990-91 and $156m in 1991-92-a total of $283m. This is the culmination of six years meddling in pharmacies by the Hawke-Keating Government. We have the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) presiding over the disastrous demolition of our pharmaceutical system. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is proper and in fact absolutely essential that we consider what our friendly family chemist does. Ordinary Australians regard pharmacists as `their chemist' when they go to the chemist shop. The service provided is not just one of handing pills over the counter. The Australian Institute of Pharmacy Management estimates that 1,000 pharmacies will close by 1991 and that the jobs of 35,000 pharmacy workers will be endangered; in fact, some estimates suggest that over half of Australia's pharmacies will be forced to close. I make the point that there are over 450 country towns in Australia with only one pharmacy. I think perhaps it would be scaremongering to suggest that all of those pharmacies will close. I do not think that that will be the case. But it is also quite apparent that those towns with only one pharmacy may have to reduce their services. I am not making an idle claim. I can see the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), stirring. I am not making an idle rhetorical claim: there are facts and figures to support what is happening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Please do: I like the Minister's happy, smiling face. But, let us return to the real circumstances that are having an impact on the pharmacies of Australia. In 1987-88, the cost of drugs to pharmacies rose by 25.7 per cent. In the same year, average weekly earnings rose by 5.9 per cent, while pharmacists' remuneration increased by only 4.4 per cent. So, in 1987-88 pharmacists were behind the eight ball in terms of the economic situation. But this is not just one year in isolation. In the past two years the consumer price index (CPI) has increased by 17.4 per cent and average weekly earnings have risen by 13.1 per cent, while pharmacists' remuneration has increased by only 4.5 per cent. I have the greatest respect for the pharmacists that I know. I know that they are running a business and trying to make a profit. There is nothing wrong with that, but they also provide fantastic service. So we have established that in 1987-88 pharmacists were going down the drain and in the past two years they have been going down the drain again. Over the past five years the cost to them of the goods they sell has increased by 101 per cent and the cost of labour has increased by 87 per cent. At the same time, the average pharmacist's remuneration from scrips has increased by only 44 per cent. Again, that sets the stage and tells the story that our pharmacists are going out backwards.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt about that: country towns will lose pharmaceutical services. To cap it all, the Government will reduce funding in respect of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by a further $283m in the next three years. So what is the situation we are in? Tomorrow there will be a strike-and perhaps that is the wrong word-involving pharmacists right around Australia. Between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. the chemist shops of Australia will close in protest. We all know the professional standards of the people who operate pharmacies. Frankly, I think it is quite amazing that they have been pushed to the point where they must consider taking this sort of action. I hasten to add that arrangements have been made for one pharmacist to be on duty in every town and suburb of Australia to make sure that anyone in real need of urgent pharmaceuticals will be able to be helped. That is a slightly different situation to the air traffic controllers' method of making their point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation has not been helped at all by the Government. In fact, pharmacists have been forced into this position. If one goes back a little in time, the Government added 53 frequently prescribed drugs to the `authority only' list and, following public agitation and representations from the Opposition, it replaced 34 of them. The Government had no medical or therapeutic reason for putting those prescribed drugs on the authority only list-it had no reason at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude by asking honourable members to think about their pharmacists, their friendly family chemists, and the sort of services that they provide. Perhaps for people sitting here it might not happen very often, but the neighbourhood chemist for most people is in the front line of the provision of basic health services. I have a list of things that pharmacists do. It is not just a question of taking a prescription in and handing it over and out comes the bottle of pills. A whole world of advice, care and concern comes from the pharmacist. Many things that doctors are never seen about are dealt with by pharmacists. They can advise on things like weight control, travel sickness, sores, bunions, sore eyes and bad breath. All these minor things are treated with the advice of a pharmacist. How often have mothers taken their kids to the chemist to show him a boil or cut on their child's knee and get the appropriate advice and help? I have actually been in a pharmacy when people have brought in their kids with sunburn. Of course, I live in that wonderful electorate of Cowper on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, which has a superb climate, but unfortunately people sometimes stay on the beach too long and get sunburn. I have seen mothers take their children into the chemist and get something to solve that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether it is colds, flu, pimples, bruises, cuts or dandruff, advice for these things comes not just when one pays one's money for the treatment itself; a great deal of warmth, compassion, care and concern goes over the counters of pharmacies. I have, of course, forgotten all the assistance given to mothers with young babies-the weighing; the feeding advice; advice about nappy rash, spots and colic. All these things are provided at no fee whatsoever. If this Government, by taking the action it has and the action it has forecast in the 12 April statement, is going to put many Australian pharmacies in a situation where they will have to close, reduce staff and reduce the service they give to the Australian community, a marvellous and valuable service, the people of Australia-the aged, the ill and the young-will be those who suffer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like first of all to compliment the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) on at least the first part of his speech. I certainly appreciate the sincerity of his views and the manner in which he expressed them. I may not totally agree with the second part of his speech and the conclusions that he drew there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today we are something like 6 years and 2 months into the life of the Hawke Labor Government. In that time there have been rapid change; major reforms in Australia's economic structures and framework; and an evolution, if you like, of Australia's social structures. These have particularly affected women in terms of the larger number of women moving into the work force and families generally. There is much day to day debate about living standards, productivity, national debt and personal debt, but I suppose it is easy to lose sight of the overall picture of these day to day issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw attention to some of the large and important items that we may sometimes forget about and look at how Australia is moving along historically, where we are at in 1989 and whether we are moving forwards-or backwards, as members of the Opposition would like the Australian public to believe. Let us look at some of the basic items. For instance, the average life expectancy 100 years ago was 50 years. By 1940 that had increased to 65 years. Today it is 72 years for men and slightly older for women. One hundred years ago the standard working week was some 52 hours. By 1940 it had reduced to 45 hours. In 1989 we are going through a period of transition, with some workers still on a 40-hour week and many working 38 hours or 35 hours. We have far more flexible working arrangements. Rostered days off, flexitime and things of that nature are quite common throughout the spread of the Australian economy and work force. Most importantly, over the last decade disposable household income has increased by some 11 per cent. Total disposable household income has increased in five of the six years in which Labor has been in government. So despite arguments about falling living standards and squeezes on families, in an historical perspective the average household today is considerably better off than it was 10 years ago and immeasurably better off than in decades past. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there is a fondness for looking back to the good old days and recalling how life seemed to be easier and more pleasant then, when we actually examine such claims they often do not quite stand up. We often hear that Australian productivity is too low. Yet output per head of population has increased some 20 per cent over the last decade. Let us look at material assets-consumer goods, for instance. The penetration of video cassette recorders into Australian homes has increased, some 13 per cent of homes having had video cassette recorders in 1982 and some 57 per cent having them today. The ownership of personal computers has increased by some 90 per cent in the last three years. In 1982 only 5 per cent of homes had a microwave oven. That is now up to 43 per cent. Only 45 per cent of households had a simple thing like a clothes drier in 1983. That has now increased to 55 per cent. Over that same period there has been an increase in the number of households having a dishwasher, from 17 per cent to 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Motor vehicles are always a very good indication of the strength of an economy. In 1983 there were some 421 motor vehicles per 1,000 of the Australian population. By 1988 that figure was 440 motor vehicles per 1,000. In 1983 some 85 per cent of households had a telephone, a very basic item, and 7.5 per cent said that they could not afford to have a phone connected. In 1988, some five years later, 91 per cent of households had a telephone and only 4.5 per cent said that they could not afford to have a phone connected. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw those figures from an excellent article by Michael Stutchbury which appeared in the Australian Financial Review of 26 April of this year. The article points out and those figures show that in many ways there has been a spreading of affluence throughout the Australian economy. Although we are often taken up in this debate with living standards, levels of income, wage rates and inflation rates, the picture which is often tempted to be painted, certainly by the Opposition-and that is understandable-but also, perhaps more broadly, by the media is that Australians have undergone a period of severe squeeze. But while there are undeniable problems, the reality is that the 1980s has been a decade in which there has been a steady improvement in living standards within this country. If one looks at the statistics, that is simply undeniable. A lot of people would argue with that and I can understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> There are of course problems which we, as a nation, are still addressing. They are, I suppose, predominantly the balance of payments problem, because we are importing far more than we are exporting and that has led to a large increase in the level of Australia's foreign debt. The inflation rate in this country is too high, and I do not think anyone will argue with that and, of course, our interest rates at the present time are higher than the Government or any reasonable person would like them to be. Again, I do not think we can argue against that. However, we have to look at those problems in the overall context and make a judgment about what is causing those problems and what responses a government should be making to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental problem which the Australian economy is suffering from at the moment is that we have excessive demand; that is, there has been a large increase in disposable income if we look at it in terms of the national figure. The cause of that has been the large increase in employment. Some 1.3 million more Australians are now in a job than in 1983. So while individual wage earners have not seen real increases in wages during that period, 1.3 million more Australians are actually drawing a wage. That has meant that many hundreds of thousands of families who were living on unemployment benefits or in very difficult circumstances, have moved out of that extreme difficulty, out of poverty, and back into a reasonable standard of living. It has also meant that there are now two incomes coming in for many other families. That has obviously led to an increase in those families' living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> But employment growth is undeniable and it should be put into that context. It is some four times greater than the rate which was achieved by the Fraser Government, and it is twice the rate enjoyed by the average of the rest of the developed world, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. That is an outstanding record and one of which the Labor Government is justifiably proud. Other economic indicators also reflect this strength. Profitability for Australian business is at levels which have not been seen since the late 1960s or early 1970s and there is at present a record level of business investment. Since records have been kept, we have not seen such a sustained period of business investment as we are seeing at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, Australia has gone through periods of strong employment growth before it has gone through periods of reasonable business profitability and reasonable levels of business investment. When the Australian economy has overheated in the past it has normally gone through the typical boom-bust cycle. We go through a period of boom and that inevitably leads to a large bust and the economy goes into a recession. The losers in a recession are principally the people who lose their jobs. It is those families, with individuals thrown out of work, who lose that income. They are the principal and the most severe losers in an economic recession and it is that which this Government is attempting to avoid. Historically, Australia will inevitably, if it follows its history and cycles of the economy, move into a period of recession. But the Government is not going to allow that to happen and it will do everything in its power to stop that from happening. The challenge is how to beat the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to hear alternative views from the Opposition. We hear that interest rates are going too high. How do we bring interest rates down when the other arms of government policy have been fully utilised? Those other arms of course are government spending itself and the size of government. The Government can reduce the size of its expenditure so as to build up public savings or to stop further stimulation to the economy by its own expenditure. But the record shows that this Government has reduced government spending by some five percentage points of our gross domestic products. For the fourth consecutive year there will be a real decrease in the size of the Commonwealth government. It is unprecedented in this country's history for that sort of restraint to be shown by government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to say that we should have more than a $5 1/2 billion surplus in order to reduce demand in the economy. Unfortunately, there is no more room left to cut, unless the Government is willing to go into the big ticket items, to get into pensions, into the health system and into education. Those are the options which this Government faces, but as a Labor government it is simply not prepared to attack the most disadvantaged in the society, those dependent on the pension system. We are not going to attack those people. There is no significant further room in which to cut government spending to the sorts of levels that we would need to to have some sort of impact on the level of demand in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The other alternative is to slow down the strength of the labour market. We could do that by causing a recession and throwing people out of work. That would lessen the demand for higher wages, but again that has a huge social cost and it is a cost which this Government is not willing to bear. In turn, the Government has negotiated with the trade union movement a wage-tax trade-off. That means that wages will increase by about 6.5 per cent. At the moment that is about the Australian inflation rate, probably a smidgin below it. So it is not a real wage increase in terms of what business has to pay in relation to the inflation rate. So it is a good wage result. But in order to meet wage demands and what could legitimately be expected to be obtained by the work force, or at least significant sections of it, in a free market situation, there has been action by the Government to reduce taxation and improve social wage measures. </PARA>
<PARA> So through the 12 April statement we have seen reductions in income tax rates, improvements in family allowances the dependent spouse rebate and other measures, to improve the living standard of the average Australian. That is only fair, right and reasonable. But it is also economically responsible, because the path proposed by the Opposition of, `All right, we need the wage-tax trade-off, but it really should have been a total trade-off, so any wage rise should have been nil in terms of the tax cut', is utterly unrealistic, and it knows it. It knows that when it was in government it had a similar situation of a strong level of domestic demand and strong labour force conditions and there was a wages explosion. Wages went through the roof and that contributed to the recession in which we saw high unemployment and double digit inflation. That path has been tried and it failed. It is really poor that the Opposition has not come up with anything new concerning Australia's economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We have in place a level of high interest rates, which will dampen down demand. No government likes to see high interest rates, they obviously hurt people-that is indisputable-but the alternatives would hurt an awful lot more and cause a lot more hardship. That is what this all boils down to, the Government taking the responsible course and by no means abandoning its economic responsibilities but ensuring that Australians are hurt as little as possible. That is what the 12 April statement is all about and that is what the Government's economic policies are all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that interest rates will play their role and that a slowing down of demand will follow. There are already signs of that through various indicators and that will mean that in the later part of this year or early next year, interest rates can come down and we will have a sustainable level of economic activity, at a base where we can again improve things. We will have avoided the boom-bust cycle which Australia has historically gone through. The Government's economic policies are in place. They are sound policies and I commend them to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say something about the hardships which Australians are incurring under the management of this Labor Government. I will outline to a degree the barefaced attitude of the Government in ignoring the public interest in running for an election. This has been brought out so clearly by the changes made in the Opposition yesterday. The first result of the change of leadership of the coalition will be that we will definitely and automatically win the next Federal election, but beneath that obvious certainty portrayed today by the enthusiastic reception of those changes around Australia is the transparent nature of the Government's previous strategy, which it has now cancelled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's strategy was to run for a quick and early election and, in so doing, to hide the facts from Australians. As the Opposition spokesman for finance, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), said this morning, `Don't worry; be happy'. That is the theme which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been peddling to Australia to create a bridge to a short term election. It is quite clear and transparent because this morning the reports, which are quite well based, say that the Government is not going to have an early election. Of course it is not because it would lose automatically. Out of this alteration of strategy has emerged the deception that the Treasurer and the Government have been running in relation to the economic health of Australia. This will become more and more apparent to Australians as the argument is developed in this House and in other public forums. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting also to look at how Australians are meeting this lowering of their living standards, at how they are managing to maintain their home loans and necessary purchases and the like to maintain a certain living standard for their children. How are they doing this in the face of the decline in living standards? One of the most alarming reports of how they are doing it emerged early this month in the Age under the heading `personal debts set at average of $5,700'. A new look at the personal debt held by Australians produced an alarmingly enlarged statistic on the one currently held to be the fact. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's level of personal debt it almost double previous estimates, nearing $5,700 for every employed person, according to the latest figures compiled by the Reserve Bank. The Bank's May bulletin says the level of non-mortgage personal debt has jumped sharply from previous estimates of about $25,000m to almost $42,000m. </PARA>
<PARA>Does not that tell the story of how Australians are managing to maintain their standards in the face of the increasing taxation burden of this Government and the attack on their real wage? Of course, it is hidden in this debt structure. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . debt has increased by about 13 per cent during the past 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>That is twice the consumer price index. If one looks at home loans, one will find a very great additional burden under this Government. A survey of home loan affordability published in April this year gives the simple fact that the comparisons of the ratio of average home loan repayments to a median family income increased from 27.3 per cent in 1987 to 31.7 per cent in 1988. Yet we hear the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) talking about increased living standards. As if this can be ignored, as the Treasurer tried to ignore it in his short run to the now cancelled election. That is an another indication of the problems Australians face under this Government. In the Australian Financial Review of 3 May in a report headed `Monetary policy stays tight' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Revenue collections in the nine months to March were up 7.7 per cent on the corresponding period in 1987-88 below the anticipated 8.3 per cent increase. But key areas were above forecast. Net PAYE payments were up 18.2 per cent compared to the 13.8 per cent in the Budget forecast . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This makes a mockery of the Treasurer's tax reductions because every time we hear from the Government about tax reductions we read of these enormous increases in PAYE collections which are totally out of line with the rate of inflation in the community. Also on 3 May under the heading `Screws have to stay on-Hawke', the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) referred to the growing overseas debt and said:</PARA>
<PARA>More than 45 per cent of the growth in demand last year was met by imports. </PARA>
<PARA>What sort of management is this Government giving Australia? What sort of encouragement is it giving to Australian producers? What sort of attempts are being made to reform the infrastructure of this country to enable people to compete with overseas producers when 45 per cent of growth in demand is met by imports?</PARA>
<PARA> We have reached the stage under this Government where Australia cannot afford a lift in production or a lift in internal prosperity. Under Labor's management, as soon as there is an increase in activity in the community we pull in an unsustainable rate of imports, to the degree that our overseas balance is deteriorating as much as it has in the past. When we look at the Australian support industries, we find a report from the Automotive Industry Authority of 3 May which says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . local car makers had the lowest levels of automation and the highest labour turnover rates in the world-even after four years of rationalisation-and there were no prospects of achieving reasonable rates of return on their assets as the industry is structured now. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to talk about the best performers in relation to quality cars. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that such is the production control in Australia that a few years ago when I bought a new car I found that the badge on the front of it was upside down. I find it incredible that a car could be turned out of a dealer's retail premises with the badge carrying its name and flaunting its brand upside down. When I took the car back for its first service I left instructions that the badge was to remain upside down so that I could carry with me this example of Australian production inspection, but when I got it back the badge had been put right. No dealer would allow his car to be upside-down badged. Whilst that happened a few years ago, it is totally on all fours with this report of the Automotive Industry Authority of a few days ago. Again, this is Australia under a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> In a report from one of the newspapers of this month under the heading `Qantas to use ``unqualified'' help' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Qantas is hoping to contract out aircraft maintenance work to a Melbourne engineering company that union officials claim does not have the necessary qualified staff. </PARA>
<PARA>The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA>So far Qantas has sought to cope with its labour squeeze by farming out maintenance work to a diverse range of foreign airlines, and occasionally hiring foreign carriers to run its flights. </PARA>
<PARA>Our national carrier cannot meet its maintenance requirements from Australian sources. Topping all this was a report put out by the National Farmers Federation on 3 May which says that if one buys Australian, Australia will be in trouble. At first glance this seems an incredible statement to make, that by buying Australian one will harm Australia's export activities. The claim was that the average Australian family will be $2,000 a year worse off if the Federal Government's `buy Australian' promotion succeeds in its aims. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is basically telling people to buy things which we're hopeless at making competitively. </PARA>
<PARA>The theme of that assertion is that if one buys Australian goods to reduce exports they will be made at an uncompetitive price because input costs will be totally out of line with the costs of other countries. All of this is an enormous reflection on this Government's management. Since 1983 the Government has been totally unable to argue successfully that previous governments should shoulder the blame. We find that Australia is heading along a road of overseas debt which will be unsustainable and that cannot continue at $1 billion a month. We find no plan from the Treasurer that will effectively reduce that debt of $1 billion a month. At a time when our exports are probably at the top of a cycle-their next move may be down-we find that we are unable to pay for our imports by $1 billion or more a month. The reason for this is the failure of this Government to provide leadership to those companies and individuals who want to do things for themselves that will ultimately lead into the export market. It is difficult in Australia under this Government to find the incentive which will allow us to produce at overseas competitive prices. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only to walk around the streets of any capital city in Australia to find the foremost example of restrictive trade practices. I am referring to the `no ticket, no start' banners which are all over the capital cities and provincial centres of Australia. People must pay for a licence to work. This Government does nothing to stop compulsory unionism which is the flag that represents all other restrictive trade practices. This practice may be somewhat open in the building industry. God help us when we examine the unfathomable depths of managed internal labour rip-offs and labour relations in respect of the wharves. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by not in any way trying to depress morale in this country. I want to draw attention to the fact that after six years in government the Labor Party has done little to reward those whose efforts are necessary to pull this country out of its problems. Until it can do something about the restrictive trade practices which stand between us and success, we will have no solution to the problems which confront us in terms of overseas debt. The solution lies in yesterday's activities, to which I referred when I began my speech. This will be argued out at another time and in another place. The solution is imminent for Australia. As to when that will occur depends on when the Prime Minister calls the next election. </PARA>

Yesterday marked the first anniversary of the opening of this new Parliament House-it is no longer new.

<PARA> In speaking in support of the Supply Bill (No. 1) 1989-90, the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1989-90 and the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1989-90, I want to take the opportunity to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), on the Government's initiatives which were announced yesterday for science and technology. I want to say a few words about the macro-economic aspects of our economy before I turn to other things I would like to say about science and technology. It is going to be very difficult for the Government to ensure that its initiatives-which are aimed at helping Australians in need-are put in place. The initiatives which were contained in the April economic statement and the ministerial statements on science and technology which were made yesterday will strengthen the infrastructure of our economy, particularly in the science and technology areas. It seems to me that deregulation is the real problem. The deregulation of our financial system has meant that the Australian Government no longer has the ability to control Australia's economy. The Government can attempt to influence the economic system with the use of monetary policy, such as manipulating interest rates or fiscal measures or the imposition of taxes or tax relief. But the Government can only influence; it is not able to determine any particular economic outcome. If this was not bad enough, we have the problem that the Australian dollar has been involved in far more speculative pressure now than it ever had been prior to 1983, prior to deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The assertion that deregulation would ensure that there will be more foreign capital available for productive investment in Australia has been found in 1989 to be totally incorrect. Foreign investment in Australia has been largely used for speculative ventures or for short term gain. Takeover bids of existing companies by Australian and overseas corporations have done nothing to improve productivity or create wealth. Australian corporations, such as the Bond Corporation, are also investing overseas. This has resulted in increases in our overseas debt. That is quite apart from the morality of investing in a country where military dictatorship ensures that exorbitant profits can be gained at the expense of workers employed on starvation wages. </PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation was heralded as a means of providing more competition and giving an opportunity for private investors to invest in new industries. But private investment has let the Government down. Assets have been shifted overseas and Australian business, with some exceptions, has failed to invest in new enterprises in Australia. The Federal Government's restructuring of our industry, such as the steel and vehicle manufacturing industries, was essential. But where are the new export and import replacement industries which will help to turn around our adverse terms of trade?</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Australia is in the middle of an investment boom. But the question is whether the investment is occurring in the export and import replacement industries. Nobody, least of all the Government, is able to answer that question, owing to a lack of statistical data. On the face of it, it would appear that financial deregulation is making few dollars available for venture capital and development finance for the new internationally competitive industries which must be created if the Federal Government's industry restructuring initiatives are to succeed. In the years since the introduction of financial deregulation it has been difficult to identify one productive investment or loan to a productive private enterprise which was made as a result of financial deregulation and which could not have been made on better terms under the previously regulated system. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also not forget that, whilst having concentrated on the deregulation of the financial system, deregulation is also occurring in other areas of business and government activity. Whilst it can be argued that regulation in a number of areas can be seen to be archaic, and unnecessarily restrictive, it must also not be forgotten that regulation is a means of protecting the public from the operation of unscrupulous and avaricious business interests. I would be the last to deny that prudence in public enterprises and government activities is essential. Let us not take on the mantle of the conservatives and limit the public investment, which must be made if government is able to undertake responsible management of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In this sense, the expenditure of an additional $390m over the next five years for science and technology is an essential ingredient for the development of science and technology. The extension of the concessions is also a vital part of the support package. On a number of occasions in this House I have had to express my regret regarding cuts which have been made in funding for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). I have given a number of examples of the valuable research work being undertaken by the CSIRO, and I have detailed a number of research projects which were undertaken by the Entomology Division, for example. It follows, therefore, that I welcome the additional allocation of $90m over the next five years for new equipment and research projects, which need priority funding. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I still remain concerned as to whether the welcome addition to CSIRO funding is sufficient to ensure that many of our young and promising research scientists do not continue to leave the CSIRO, as they have been doing, to pursue more favourable research opportunities overseas. I congratulate the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) on his new appointment as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Technology. This involves additional responsibilities, and I know that he will carry them out well. I am sure that this is already in operation, but I hope that the Minister will continue to consult with the divisional heads of the CSIRO. Many of them have expressed their strong concerns at the loss of research scientists from their divisions and a consequent loss of many important research projects. I know that other Ministers, such as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), are also involved. I hope that these consultations will continue, because I believe that there are, and will continue to be over the years, problems with the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time remaining to me in this debate, I want to raise some valuable points in regard to scientific research. One aspect of research which I think is absolutely vital, and in relation to which I do not believe enough work has been done, concerns the area of renewable energy resources-water, wind and solar power. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be interesting to hear the honourable member's comments. I have mentioned the Entomology Division, and I also want to mention the Wildlife and Ecology Division, the Forestry and Forest Products Division, and the Soils Division. Over a number of months I have had the opportunity to become acquainted with all their work. I refer particularly to the valuable travelling exhibitions which have been brought here to Parliament House so that we can see the work that the CSIRO is doing, particularly on the greenhouse effect. Those exhibitions have been valuable, and I hope that the CSIRO will continue to ensure that such exhibitions come here, because it is difficult for us to get away from this House and visit them. I have also had an opportunity to visit the CSIRO's research establishments in the work that I have been doing as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is notable that at the moment in Britain British Petroleum is now investing very heavily in solar research. This is occurring for the first time. That is an example of the sort of research that ought to be going on here. After all, we have more potential for solar power here than Britain has. These days we are getting more sun in Melbourne than in Sydney. Perhaps that is the place where we should undertake the research. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to mention the difficulty that we have had with pure research as it relates to applied research. I looked at a very interesting article by Gordon Sanson, and edited by Geoff Maslen, in the `Education Age' section of the Age of Tuesday, 28 February. The article, entitled `The cutting edge of evolution', is about the study of the teeth of mammals and other animals. Studies in this area can affect the research that we might undertake in a whole range of areas which would appear to be removed from the area of teeth. It was interesting to see that this kind of research:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . encompasses not only the biological disciplines of plant and animal anatomy, physiology, behaviour and ecology, but also physics, chemistry and engineering. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a holistic approach and it covers all these wide areas. This relates to pure research into the study of mammalian teeth. This is the sort of applied research that can come from pure research such as this, yet no-one would ever know. No-one would think that the study of the teeth of a kangaroo, perhaps half a million years old, could be used for applied research in this country. But it can, and we must not neglect our pure research work. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that I want to mention concerns the National Bushfire Research Unit, which, I am pleased to say, was given permanent funding after the 1984 bushfire report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, as it was at that time. The National Bushfire Research Unit has been doing some valuable work in relation to bushfires and into how we might prevent their very serious effects. In recent years we have not had too many serious bushfires in Australia, but they will recur-they always do. It is absolutely essential that bodies such as the National Bushfire Research Unit should be given more funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes that I have left, I would like to mention that in relation to forest research, for example, the Soils Division and the Forestry and Forest Products Division have been very worried about the cuts in funds which have occurred in those divisions. I hope that the new money that has been provided will enable those divisions to continue to carry on some of their very valuable research projects, which are so important in a country where two-thirds of the land surface is degraded. In that serious situation it is absolutely important that the consultation with those divisional heads should continue. The money is there for equipment and new research projects, but what about the existing research staff, and also the technical staff?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that worries me is what will happen to the technical staff. Will the funding that is being provided be sufficient to ensure that the technical staff are able to stay on in the divisions? For the research scientists to do their work properly, they must have support from the highly skilled technical officers who are required to work with them. I commend the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, who is at the table, for his initiative, and I commend the Prime Minister for the new funding that has been provided for science overall. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Yesterday I was asked by the acting shadow Treasurer what underlying deflator was used in estimating the increase in household disposable income. As I recall the question, I was asked what deflator was used and what was the rate. The Prime Minister is showing me the table which has asterisks next to the words `deflated by the private consumption deflator'. Apparently, this is a matter which is supposed to stand the cut and thrust of Question Time. The acting shadow Treasurer asks, `Which deflator is used?' when the table states that it is the private consumption deflator. If the greenest backbencher in the place asked me, `What is the deflator which the Department of the Treasury has used to calculate the increase in household disposable income?' and the table says it is the private consumption deflator, out of sheer kindness I would say to such an honourable member, `It is a private consumption deflator; you might not have noticed'. But to somebody who prides himself on having some technical capacity, which has yet to be demonstrated in the last 18 months, and who asks such a question I would say, `It is here. Apparently you don't know'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his devastating follow-up question he refers to the lock-up in the Treasury cafeteria, and suggests that the Treasurer is apparently not telling journalists what the private consumption deflator rate for the year was assumed to be. In other words he is saying, `Oh, Treasury officers are keeping mum on the private consumption deflator; therefore, the Government is hiding something'. The private consumption deflator for the calculation is 6.75 per cent. It is not terribly strange considering that the private consumption deflator in the national accounts, from my recollection, was just over 6 per cent and the consumer price index is running, according to the Australian Statistician, at 6.9 per cent. So it is 6.9 per cent for inflation to date and the private consumption deflator is 6.5 per cent as used by the Treasury in the calculation.</PARA>
<PARA> But these are issues which are coming up at Question Time. We are asked, `What deflator is being used?' when the chart says, `(a) forecast, (b) non-farm sector, (c) deflated by the private consumption deflator'. That is on page 29 of the April statement. Yet the honourable member asked me yesterday what deflator is used. The chart says what it is. Today we have the killer question: `What is the rate?' The answer is 6.75 per cent which is almost at the inflation rate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of recent media coverage which has detailed staff concerns about the Endeavour Foundation services for people with disabilities, and alleged action by Endeavour to dismiss staff who raised those concerns. I recognise that the honourable member for Lilley has taken a deep and personal interest in this issue in Brisbane. The concerns raised are about the conditions of employment and wages paid to people with disabilities, and are generally consistent with the concerns of this Government's review of programs for the handicapped. The Government is committed to improving the range and quality of services provided to people with disabilities and the new Disability Services Act is aimed at achieving that objective. Under the Act, organisations can now be held accountable for the services they provide to people with disabilities. The achievement of positive outcomes for people with disabilities, such as a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, is the central theme of the new Disability Services Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lilley has written to me, and has raised this issue again today, seeking a joint inquiry involving my Department and the Endeavour Foundation into the particular activities of Endeavour's Brisbane North branch. I have approved in principle a joint review and have asked my Department to progress the matter in conjunction with Endeavour. Reviews of this type have been undertaken before in relation to other organisations funded under the Disability Services Act and have resulted in the improvement of services for people with disabilities. I hope that Endeavour will respond to the offer of a joint review so that we can speedily settle the problems in that area.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a rather distorted debate running in the country for quite a while about the levels of research spending. I thought that the statements put out by my colleagues and the Prime Minister went some way to remedy that, and to point out what some of the facts are in this whole area. The major thrust of the Government's statement was to increase the links with industry and to improve the level of industry funding for research and development. The primary industries which I represent have already increased their contributions through rural industry research funds which are matched by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has been forgotten in this whole debate is that research and development spending by these means has grown from $33m in 1978-79 to something like $164m in 1988-89. The Opposition never talks about that when it grizzles about funding for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Of course, it does acknowledge the success of such industry directed funding in its rural policy document. It is one of the 34 Government initiatives that it will maintain. The word `maintain' appears a lot in its policy document. This $164m in industry responsive research and development is accessible to universities and the CSIRO on a competitive basis. We are getting a far more competitive and healthy environment for research in this country. But, again, all honourable members opposite ever talk about is the bottom line in a Budget statement.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the response from rural industries, the focus of the primary industries and energy statement is on policy principles as a guide to government funding and the ways in which the administration of these funds can be improved. There has been a specific extra allocation of $1.3m directed towards encouraging more consultation on priorities between scientists and the relevant industries and greater attention to commercialising research results. This is responsive, industry effective research and development. I point out that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy now spends about $200m a year on research and employs about 1,000 people within the Department itself, in the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics, in the Bureau of Mineral Resources, and partially within the Bureau of Rural Research. As well, there are the rural research and development corporations and the research councils. Too often all this is overlooked.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Dick Woolcott, has just completed visits to nine regional countries to sound out their reaction to the Prime Minister's proposal for regional economic cooperation. I am pleased to report to the House that the reactions have been very encouraging and in fact suggest widespread support for both the objective of enhanced regional cooperation and the ministerial meeting later this year. I would like to stress one point, especially against the background of a statement by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, that is, that what is being considered is a framework for regional economic cooperation to progress matters of mutual economic interest within the region. Most importantly, from Australia's point of view, this includes how countries in the region can work to secure a more effective open multilateral trading system. We are not-I emphasise not-talking about developing a regional trading bloc.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I have had some difficulty in deciphering what the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday at his press conference, it seems to contrast starkly with what we are on about. Yesterday he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . take a broader perspective to see Australia playing an effective role in the fastest growing region in the world . . . to be taking beyond the mere talk of OECD type secretariat for interchange of views.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition interjects that that is ludicrous. I can assure him that, as a result of the tour of the regional countries made by Mr Dick Woolcott, the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there is no interest in such a proposition in this area at all. I remind those opposite of the difficulties in developing the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand-a country which, when looked at from a social, economic and political viewpoint, is very similar to us. The likelihood of being able to develop such a trade arrangement with countries so diverse as those in the region and the core group of countries that the Prime Minister took the matter up with is almost non-existent. Equally, in reply to the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition, any attempt to do so would completely undermine our arguments against the European Commission-that is, that the Europe 1992 exercise should be outward looking and should not be, as some people fear, a fortress Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, it is in the best interests of Australia and other small and medium sized trading nations to maintain an open multilateral system in which we keep the small players alive and they are able to get a fairer go. From the Secretary's visit, which I referred to earlier, it is apparent that that view is shared by our neighbours, contrary to the view expressed yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to his plans, if they mean what I think they mean. As I indicated earlier, it is a bit difficult to understand what he was on about.</PARA>
<PARA> He then went on to say that trade was the lifeblood of this country. I was delighted to hear him say that because in the last two years and previously, when my colleague the now Minister for Employment, Education and Training was then the Minister, I do not think that anything came from that side of the House to indicate that it was even relevant to the existence of this country. In relation to the multilateral and the bilateral relations, no government has worked harder to achieve this than the Hawke Labor Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I will close on this note. I would like those opposite to think of a few things. I ask them: Which government established the Cairns Group to fight for our farmers in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round? Which government initiated the comprehensive China action plan? Which government secured an opening of the Japanese beef market? Which government reached an agreement with Thailand for the development of an economic cooperation agreement and is establishing new levels of dialogue with Indonesia? Which government initiated a trade and commercial development program for Korea? The answer to all of those questions is the Hawke Labor Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one honourable member just interjected, `That is an old one'. The list of properties that I put forward to the Premiers at the supply side policy conference on Commonwealth land for housing comprised a number of properties which the Commonwealth thought we would be able to release for housing over the next five years as they progressively become available. The property at Carseldine was certainly going to be used for housing. It is true that it was already on the market. But I made it clear to the Premiers that we would be offering land, either to the States or to the private sector. There was no commitment by me that all of the properties on that list, whether they were in the five-year list or the long term list, would be exclusively offered to the States. That is a fact. In my answer the other day I pointed out how some of the properties I gave as examples would in fact be offered to the States and some would be offered direct to the private sector. Some would be offered to the private sector if the States rejected them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude my answer by saying that Mr Ahern, despite what he and the Opposition have said about the property at Carseldine, has already indicated interest in another property at Cooper's Plains and in fact has made an offer to buy.

The Opposition has a lot to say about the Government's efforts in releasing Commonwealth land for housing. I am reminded of the fact that the Opposition was in power from 1975 to early 1983, during which time no effort whatsoever was made by the former Government to examine the correct use of Commonwealth land-whether we were making the best use of it; whether the Department of Defence, or the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or any other agency, were making the best possible use of the land which they occupied.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in this very important subject. Award restructuring and workplace reform are as much about giving a fair go to all employees in the workplace as they are about giving our industry a fair go in the marketplace. The honourable member is very much aware of this. He has been very much involved in the commitment to improving opportunities for Tasmanian women in the workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Together with this Government's policies of affirmative action and equal opportunity, award restructuring provides an unprecedented opportunity for women to be given a fairer go in the workplace. That can happen through better training, job redesign, flexibility in working arrangements and better provision of career paths. This Government has initiated a range of measures to assist Australian women in the work force. We are now seeing the results of those measures. At a national level, some 700,000 of the 1.3 million new jobs that have been created under this Government have gone to women. That has happened at a time when there has been a record high level of participation by women in the work force. At the same time, we have seen a substantial growth in retention rates for girls in secondary schools and enrolment rates for women in our universities. The national unemployment rate for women of 6.7 per cent is at its lowest level in a decade. Much has been done to improve opportunities for Australian women, particularly to gain employment. But we should note the fact that Tasmania has the worst unemployment rate for women-10.9 per cent-and that the second prize for the worst unemployment rate goes to Queensland. They are two conservative States, so we can understand why that has happened.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has done a great deal to improve the lot of women but a great deal more still remains to be done. The statistics I have quoted show a genuine improvement in the position of women in our society. This has been the result of the deliberate policy initiatives of this Government-initiatives which meet the real concerns of women and their families. These initiatives have not been supported by the Tasmanian Government. Whilst most of the other States have been pursuing policies aimed at closing the gender gap on employment and career opportunities, those policies have been ignored by the Tasmanian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past six years, the Commonwealth and every mainland government except Queensland have enacted legislation on either affirmative action, sex discrimination or equal opportunity for women. That legislation has helped underpin the change in attitude towards women in the workplace. Women are now seeing greater opportunities in the workplace and in respect of jobs, careers and education than ever before. But this is not happening in Tasmania. In short, the Tasmanian Government denied Tasmanian women fair opportunity in the workplace and in education. They have lost jobs, they have lost careers. I can say to the honourable member and to the women of Tasmania that the only solution that is before them on Saturday is a change from the Gray Government and the arrival of a new Labor government in Tasmania.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Services to government are, of course, a very important part of the public sector. Unfortunately, over many years the provision of these services, particularly as far as their administration and cost of delivery are concerned, had become quite rigid and uncompetitive. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that over the past year or so we have engaged in a major task of reform. In fact, we have looked at something like 12 major common service areas and have taken decisions on them. The three criteria that the Government and I used were, firstly, whether the service should be subject to cost recovery; secondly, whether it should be commercialised, that is, whether its clients should be untied; and, thirdly, which areas should be preserved and funded from the budget in the public interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The combination of those three measures as applied to all of the agencies that were examined results in two things: firstly, the exercise of demand control over the client agency and, secondly, an efficiency incentive as to the cost of the delivery of the service. Several very brief examples of what has occurred include the fact that the very large Australian Construction Services agency has been subject to cost recovery for its services and the fact that clients will be untied from 1990-91 in respect of design and construction services. I can name two public interest activities that will be funded from the Budget in future. The Australian Government Publishing Service and the services it provides to this Parliament clearly should be tied in the public interest and, of course, funded from the Budget through cost recovery appropriations to the parliamentary departments. That has been done. The Australian Government Analytical Laboratories represents an area that should be tied in the public interest, and that is obviously analytical work in respect of the analysis of drugs and imported food under the Customs Act.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of productivity, I make what is, I hope, a very important point: the result of all of this reform obviously creates downward pressure to become more efficient. In the past year or so, the total numbers employed in the Department of Administrative Services across 12 divisions has been reduced by over 1,900 people. That creates an onward cost saving year on year of $55m. In Australian Construction Services alone, where reductions have occurred over the past several months, by the end of June the work force will have been reduced by 550. In the Transport and Storage Group (TSG), the services of which include the provision of car with driver to entitlees, including parliamentarians, there are some problems with administration that we are tackling. Currently, it has 2,100 employees across the board, many of whom are car drivers. I have decided that we ought to reduce the total TSG employment level by something like 700 and then perhaps use some part time workers, which would make a net reduction of approximately 450. We hope to introduce that change over several years.</PARA>
<PARA> The important part of all this is that it is happening so far without industrial disputation, in consultation with the trade unions, and through the offering of voluntary redundancy packages to the employees concerned. I think that $55m already saved year on year is a quite substantial achievement, and it is certainly more than any previous government, Minister or department achieved. We are committed to efficiency in the Public Service. We will achieve that goal. The reforms are already under way and I am happy to say that not one of these redundancies has had to be achieved or will be achieved through either sacking or compulsory redundancy.</PARA>

I refer to the serious air traffic congestion occurring at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and to the closure of the airport to all incoming and departing aircraft last weekend. I ask the Minister: Is the Government fully aware of the hardship suffered by thousands of passengers and the loss being sustained by airlines and, in particular, the smaller airlines, such as those operating to and from country centres in New South Wales, which now face serious financial problems because of the effect of the disruptions and delays? What action is the Government taking to try to overcome the congestion caused by the timeslot limitations and closures imposed by the air traffic controllers, who claim that adequate staff are not available to enable full manning of the air control system at the airport?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2340" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the closure of Sydney Airport last Friday, which certainly caused great disruption to thousands of travellers, both domestic and international. It was a rather regrettable development, to say the least. It occurred because of the lack of air traffic controllers to come to work given that there had been a high level of supposed sickness occurring amongst air traffic controllers in Sydney. This level of sickness has increased considerably in the past few weeks and was particularly high when the Government was moved to seek bans clauses in the air traffic controllers' award. Following that, the sickness level dropped off somewhat but it has remained at a much higher level than it used to be. I might also say that the sickness level seems to drop remarkably on weekends, when penalty rates apply. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the employer of the air traffic controllers, has now instituted a system of requiring a doctor's certificate from any air traffic controller who reports sick so that there will be some verification that they are sick. In the circumstances that seems to be a highly desirable development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Discussions have been occurring since the major industrial action by air traffic controllers in Sydney and to a lesser extent those in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago. There were discussions between the CAA and the air traffic controllers' union with regard to finalising a number of aspects that it was agreed would be examined in the discussions they had to resolve that industrial action. Those negotiations have continued reasonably productively. The intended end result is that a case will be taken to the Industrial Relations Commission for award restructuring for air traffic controllers as a small group of special cases that will come on before the rest. The Sydney air traffic controllers, however, seem not to accept that this is the appropriate way to go.</PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that the supposed high level of sickness at Sydney has much more to do with the desire of some people there to pursue a wage claim which is way outside the wage fixing guidelines. All I can say is that, in the circumstances, the CAA is doing all it can to ensure that services are maintained. There have been discussions with the union since events of last Friday night. Part of the matters which were up for discussion following the agreement a couple of weeks ago was a review of staffing levels. That review is continuing as a matter of considerable urgency and will be completed in another week or two, following which, if there is a need for any more air traffic controllers to be employed, that will be done.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the major problem stems from the fact that there is a level of supposed sickness occurring at Sydney Airport which is far above the historic levels and is not being brought about by their being required to work excessive overtime. They are working to a level of overtime which is that determined by the Industrial Relations Commission as being reasonable, which is one extra shift of seven hours per fortnight. That is the only amount of overtime that any air traffic controller is being required to work. I think everyone would agree that this is hardly an excessive level of hours for people to work, even given that they do have a stressful occupation.</PARA>
<PARA> So the question of their numbers is being addressed. I believe that the level of sickness is artificially high, and the action of the CAA requiring doctors' certificates, hopefully, will do something to bring that back and that will mean that there will not be a shortage of air traffic controllers.</PARA>

While he recognises, and will see from remarks of the honourable member, a kind of cynicism which exists in the community, he and I and certainly the Prime Minister recognise that cynicism in the community for what it is and recognise that one of the things about leadership, which apparently the Leader of the Opposition thinks he possesses more of than the former Leader of the Opposition, is to take on board commitments to those people in the community who, as everyone recognises, have the greatest need. That commitment means, of course, not some vague vapid nonsense about being concerned for families but a commitment to budgetary strategy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can see that he is just as sensitive as his predecessor. On the other side of the ledger, that means putting in place reforms that have some real priority about them. I do not think any commentator has suggested, in terms of the social security system, that our Government has had anything other than the priorities of ensuring that those most in need get the greatest assistance. I have not seen a serious commentator suggest other than that the Government's commitment with respect to child poverty has been met by very significant reform; not by throwing money all around the place but by money targeted in terms of a constructive reform of the whole system of family payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, that is only one dimension of the reforms that this Government has attempted. I do not want to go through all the areas, but I think we have, in many respects, been one of the leaders in the world in linking income security to labour market reform. In income reform, for example, we have seen the importance of recognising the link between educational payments and what we are doing in the social security system. The common allowance reform will stand as one of the great reforms of this present Government. We have recognised that what we should be about as a government is opening up opportunities for people and not locking them into the social security system. The evidence for that is there not only in terms of the massive reductions in the numbers on unemployment benefit but also in programs like jobs, education and training (JET) and new start. To take new start as an example-and perhaps if those opposite listen they might learn something-in the new start program, 5,000 people on long term unemployment benefit have already returned to work in just a little more than two months. The commitment of the Government to social reform is stronger than that of any previous Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This statement marks a new chapter in defence's relationship with Australian industry. The defence policies adopted by the Hawke Government over the past six years have transformed our defence strategy and reshaped the Australian Defence Force. Defence self-reliance is inextricably linked to our industrial capacity. The capacity of our industrial base to support our defence effort is as important to self-reliance as a Defence Force structure tailored to our strategic environment. Our policies have played a cardinal role in overhauling industries vital to our defence. These embrace electronics, aerospace, shipbuilding and ship repair, heavy and general engineering, and munitions. These are essential elements of an industrial base to serve our defence needs. They are equally essential for the type of commercial industry structure this Government has sought to encourage to serve Australia into the next century: a structure that is global in outlook, export oriented, and internationally competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to announce today another major step in this process with the formal launching of Australian Defence Industries (ADI). ADI has taken over the major defence industry facilities still remaining in government ownership. These establishments were previously controlled by the Office of Defence Production within my Department of Defence. Australian Defence Industries, a government-owned corporation, will operate on a commercial basis. ADI will have an annual turnover of $400m. It will commence as the largest single supplier of defence equipment and services. Instead of 11 independently-operating government establishments, we now have a single company with four operating divisions: naval engineering-principally the Garden Island dockyard; ammunition and missiles; weapons and engineering; and military clothing. We have been fortunate to obtain the services of the former Secretary of my Department, Mr Alan Woods, as Chairman of the new company. </PARA>
<PARA> The launching of Australian Defence Industries completes the process we began in 1984, when we abolished the Department of Defence Support, which had been created by our coalition predecessors. By 1984 Defence Support had become one of the largest Public Service departments, with a staff exceeding 15,000, a total outlay of $598m, of which only $242m was recovered from sales to customers. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that decision in 1984, this Government has embarked on a quiet revolution in the Australian defence industry. We have undertaken a massive program of restructuring, rationalisation and commercialisation. We have closed or are closing two government-owned defence factories, the Albion Explosives Factory and the Explosives Factory Maribyrnong. </PARA>
<PARA> We sold the Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Victoria and the aircraft workshop in South Australia. We converted the former Government Aircraft Factories at Fishermen's Bend and Avalon into a government-owned enterprise, Aerospace Technologies of Australia, run strictly on business lines. In the last five years the annual cost to the taxpayer of subsidies to our government-owned defence factories has been cut by around $250m. That is not a one-off saving. It is a permanent reduction in defence outlays each year in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> With the launching of Australian Defence Industries we have taken a further significant step away from the bureaucracy and politics that have bedevilled these defence establishments for so many years. At the same time, the transformation has given us the opportunity to restructure awards and employment levels. Overall, our actions have reduced the number of employees in dedicated defence manufacturing facilities from more than 15,000 to 6,800. This has resulted in a saving of $92m in the wages bill alone. Another round of staff reductions at ADI commencing this year involved about 1,300 positions. ADI's head office in Canberra now has just 35 people. Just four years ago the comparable number was 1,000. There will be further major savings, about $8m a year, with the decision to close the explosives factory at Maribyrnong over the next 18 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise, however, that this has not been a negative exercise; a `slash and burn' pursuit of efficiency no matter what the consequences. Our aim has been to make government factories and dockyards not just competitive, but an integral part of Australian industry. These factories served us well in earlier times. Australia has been in the munitions business for more than 100 years. By the end of World War I we had five government-owned defence factories. During World War II, by mobilising Australian industry around the core of government-owned factories, we achieved genuinely outstanding results in defence production. In April 1940 Australia sent Britain 30,000 rifles. Within 14 months we had also sent 100 million rounds of small arms ammunition. To put this in perspective, British industry in 1940 was able to produce only 81,000 rifles; with some troops being forced to drill with dummy weapons. Other Australian defence production establishments responded with similarly spectacular increases in production. During the war, no fewer than 10 shipyards built three destroyers, 12 frigates and 60 corvettes. </PARA>
<PARA> Successive conservative governments after World War II failed to recognise and act on the fundamental change in our strategic circumstances. They maintained massive excess capacity in progressively more obsolete capabilities. As a result the defence industries facilities inherited by this Government were in poor shape. They suffered from low morale, chronic undercapitalisation, excess capacity and totally unsatisfactory industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has finally swept away the long held notion that industry capabilities needed for defence purposes must be carefully identified, and then preserved at public expense. That is not the way to go in today's environment. In fact, it is self-defeating. Our defence industry policy has clear objectives which were spelt out in the 1987 defence White Paper. That document pointed out that, while a substantial commercial workload can provide a base from which to bid for defence orders, the inverse is rarely true. The peacetime requirements of the Australian Defence Force are not usually capable of providing a viable long term baseload for individual firms or industry sectors. An insistence on maintaining specific defence industry capabilities leads to a freezing of technology and, ultimately, to a decline in capability. Defence, like the economy at large, is best served by an industry structure that can hold its own in the world market, capable of recognising opportunities and seizing them. We have not abandoned the idea of nurturing particular capabilities in special circumstances, but government support of that kind is no longer an easy way out for firms unable to compete in the commercial area. </PARA>
<PARA> This contribution to the Government's micro-reform agenda was possible because, as my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Keating) puts it, we tackled the big picture first. We recognised that a more responsive financial sector was a prerequisite for change. By floating the dollar, relaxing exchange controls, and freeing up the banks we gave the economy access to goods and services at world prices. We have signalled that the days of Australia's inward-looking, protectionist stance have gone for good. Industry has been a direct beneficiary of the accord process with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Government has succeeded in maintaining a wages policy under which real unit labour costs have fallen by about 10 per cent in the past five years. That restraint will continue under the arrangements announced by the Treasurer on 12 April. The wages-tax agreement contained in that statement will further consolidate the linkage between productivity and wages, and between wages restraint and the growth of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is overseeing a sweeping overhaul of the industrial award system, the most momentous change in 80 years in the sphere of industrial relations. The overhaul of occupational classifications and skill categorisations promises immense benefits to both employers and employees. This will allow Australians to adapt more easily to changing technologies. These initiatives are reshaping industrial practices so that industry can adjust to a more competitive environment. In defence our principal instrument for change has been a greatly expanded capital procurement program. Fourteen years ago the capital program represented about 18 per cent of defence outlays. Today the equivalent figure is around 30 per cent. We intend to keep it at that level. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government took office the average level of local content in new equipment acquisitions was about 30 per cent. Now it has reached 59 per cent. In the 1990s we estimate that it will reach an average of 70 per cent as projects such as the new submarine and the Anzac frigate project gather pace. Our objective is to foster Australian prime contractors able to achieve high levels of local content without subsidies. The shipbuilding, ship repair and engineering industries exemplify this approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The submarine project costing nearly $4 billion and the Anzac frigate project costing about $5 billion have prompted a major restructuring of the Australian shipbuilding and ship repair industries. This restructuring started with the sale to the private sector of the former Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Melbourne. Employment in the dockyard has reduced from 2,200 to 750 and the productivity of the overall organisation has increased at least fourfold. The landmark industrial award at the dockyard has fundamentally changed the way people look at their jobs. People are encouraged to develop their skills in order to become an integral part of a multiskilled work force. Some 23 unions have been reduced to three. All this has occurred in a dockyard once notorious for inefficiency. Last Friday Williamstown dockyard launched, three months ahead of schedule, the frigate FFG 05, the first warship launched in this country in nearly 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government, Australia is now back in the business of naval warship building. The owner, Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd (AMECON), is tendering the German Meko design for the Anzac ships, in conjunction with Cable Price Downer, a New Zealand engineering firm. The decision to close Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the Wran Government's decision to close the Newcastle State Dockyard cleared the way for the emergence of a second bidder for the Anzac frigate contract. Australian Warship Systems, comprising TNT, Carrington Slipways, AWA and the New Zealand engineering firm McConnell Dowell, has teamed with the Dutch company Royal Schelde and has proposed the Dutch M class design. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important development has been our decision to relocate half the fleet to Western Australia over the next 10 years. To accommodate that move, the naval base HMAS Stirling is being expanded at a cost of more than $300m. We now envisage two centres of ship repair located near the main naval bases on either side of the continent. In Western Australia the facility is to be established entirely in the private sector with investment in the first stage totalling more than $20m. A shiplift has been built and the first docking of an Oberon submarine has been completed. The destroyer escort HMAS Swan is currently undergoing refit at the facility. Garden Island Dockyard will remain the east coast ship repair centre and will remain in government ownership as part of ADI. It will increasingly have to look to the commercial market for part of its workload. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has also initiated important changes in the aerospace industry. This sector developed its wartime skills in areas such as missiles and aircraft. The Ikara missile and the Nomad aircraft were at world standard in their day. However, as time passed the industry lagged, particularly in management, finance and marketing. As I mentioned earlier, the aviation and aerospace activities of the former Government Aircraft Factories have now been combined in a new company, Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA), established by legislation of this Parliament. ASTA is an independent, fully commercial company, with a board of directors experienced in business and keen to see the company expand on a profitable basis, both in Australian and international markets. It has made substantial progress in this direction already. </PARA>
<PARA> ASTA's most recent success is a contract from Boeing to manufacture the composite rudder system for its 757 aircraft. This is the firm's third major contract with Boeing and has a potential value of around $125m. In addition, the company has signed an agreement with the Sikorsky company to take over from Hawker de Havilland as the prime local contractor for the assembly and test program of the Navy's eight second phase Seahawk helicopters. I am pleased to be able to advise the House that the ASTA board is now exploring the sale of some equity in the company. Companies with key technologies, or access to markets, may be invited to make strategic investments in relevant parts of ASTA and its facilities. The Government believes that this will maximise returns to the taxpayers of Australia as well as enhancing the aerospace industry's prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department has put its relationship with the rest of the aerospace industry on a normal commercial footing. The private sector counterpart to ASTA is Hawker de Havilland, which took over the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. Hawker has restructured substantially and has been winning defence and commercial work. It recently signed a commercial development contract with McDonnell Douglas to design a new light helicopter which has already achieved preliminary sales. This industry structure is based on two major companies as prime contractors associated with specialist sub-contractors. It offers the best compromise between competition and economies of scale and bodes well for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence program has also stimulated change in the electronics and systems industry, which, in a strategic sense, probably has become the industry of greatest importance to the defence effort. In the last three years the submarine and frigate projects has generated major opportunities in the electronics sector. Most of the world's leading companies in this field now take a more active interest in Australia and are doing business with Australian companies. As with shipbuilding and aerospace, local companies are starting to act as prime contractors and linking with overseas firms to tap their technologies and access to markets. They are starting to acquire the necessary technical, financial and managerial expertise to compete effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that big defence projects have attracted into Australia technologies and investment in this industry that would not be here otherwise. Some are already looking actively for civil sector work to maintain Australian operations for the long term. To an important degree, the increasing sophistication of some sections of Australia's electronics industry has been driven by defence-based research. Perhaps the outstanding example is our remarkable Jindalee over-the-horizon radar system, which will give our forces a surveillance reach of some 3,000 kilometres. Over a decade of research and trials the Defence Science and Technology Organisation has established the principles used in the system and the hardware and software elements have been demonstrated experimentally. Jindalee, as an operational system, will enter service in the mid-1990s. Australian companies have been involved throughout this process, and will be involved more and more as the operational phase progresses, with up to three radar systems being envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot stress too strongly that my aims for industry development, as Minister for Defence, complement those of my colleague Senator Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Defence has also made a significant contribution to the Government's commitment to help Australian firms to tap export markets. The defence offsets program has been progressively refined and broadened over the years, and it has done much to encourage long term arrangements between overseas and Australian suppliers. The offsets program is now starting to run down because of the success of our overall efforts to encourage local industry involvement. Australian content in the submarine contract was 65 per cent. With the Anzac ships the Australian and New Zealand content should reach 70 per cent and, in fact, with offsets work added, could reach 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached the point where Australian firms are able and more than ready to take on the role of prime contractor for major defence programs. Obviously this means a progressively lower foreign content in such programs and a commensurate decline in new offsets obligations. Nevertheless, the program continues to provide valuable assistance for Australian companies. Last financial year new offsets obligations were a relatively modest $25m. But past obligations discharged in that same period for offsets and Australian industry participation programs totalled more than $120m. </PARA>
<PARA> Three weeks ago, Defence signed deeds of agreement with four big overseas suppliers of high technology defence equipment for the accumulation of defence offsets credit. These deeds of agreement will allow the companies to undertake long term programs with local companies to help the Australian partners meet our own future needs and aim at export markets. The companies concerned already have begun negotiations that could lead to Australian industry involvement in joint development, production and export sales. The Government has also fostered the development of a number of specialised technologies to meet particular Australian requirements. Last year we spent $12m to develop generic technologies and a further $27m to facilitate Australian industry involvement in our capital equipment projects. In June 1987 I announced an extensive revision and streamlining of the regulations governing exports of defence-type goods. This is a fairly specialised export area but it has the capacity to foster and maintain specialist skills and reduce the cost of such goods on the Australian market. Last year we received 400 applications for the export of defence goods, of which only 2 per cent were declined. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is critically dependent on access to advanced Western military technology if it is to realise its goal of self-reliant defence, and we are just as critically dependent on access to advanced Western commercial technology if the Government's objectives of more internationally competitive, outward-looking Australian industry are to be achieved. Australia therefore adheres to guidelines developed by the main North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries and Japan for the export of advanced commercial technology with dual civil and military applications. Full observance of these guidelines is vital in maintaining this access. Last month we joined the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, COCOM, which administers these arrangements. I am confident that this will both facilitate advanced technology transfer into Australia and help increase exports from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Hawke Government, defence self-reliance is no longer a mirage but a realisable goal. Our policy of self-reliance has two central pillars. The first pillar is a clear definition of our primary strategic environment, which in turn dictates a force structure matching our unique geographic circumstances. The second pillar is a competitive, technologically proficient and adaptable industry base, able to supply and support the changing requirements of our Defence Force. The Government believes its redirection of our defence industry in recent years has already produced significant long term benefits for Australia. I am confident that Australian industry increasingly sees our defence policies in the same light. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Defence Industry-Ministerial Statement, 10 May 1989. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ4">Mr WHITE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(McPherson)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). It makes a difference to be able to support a defence statement with which we fundamentally agree. I must say at the outset that the Minister was speaking on his favourite subject. If he devoted some of the time and energy that he puts into equipment and industry to operations and personnel matters he would not have the problems he has on his hands at the moment. Australian Defence Industries (ADI), as I understand it, came into operational effect on 3 May. We wish it well. It is very much a step in the right direction. My colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) no doubt in his service career visited Williamstown in days gone by. Anyone who went there before it was handed over to Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd. could have only been appalled at the state of that government facility and the low productivity that emanated from it, although `emanated' is hardly the word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the problems that occurs in government-owned companies relates to capital. I know that the Minister is as well aware as I am that Aerospace Technologies of Australia-and presumably the ADI-has and is going to have this problem of capital. Whereas companies go to their shareholders to raise capital if they want it these companies have to come to the Government. This Government, understandably, as any government would be, is reluctant to keep shelling it out when these companies have been set up for the purpose of looking after their own affairs and making a profit. Nevertheless, they do have a problem when they have old facilities. Some of it is good and some is bad at ASTA. I do not have an instant solution as to how to get it into shape to attract the private sector. I see the Minister nodding his head, indicating that he is aware of the problem. I very much hope that we do not take a purist view of these government companies which are making progress towards achieving profits and getting into shape so that at least part of them can be sold off or privatised and that we are able to give them the reasonable assistance they require and at least access to some sort of capital. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Defence said in his statement, we have come a long way since 1984. I do not defend anything that happened before that-quite the reverse. In 1984, the Department of Defence Support employed some 15,000 people and productivity was low. ADI will now employ some 6,800 people and I am sure that in some areas productivity will be greatly improved. I understand from the Minister that that figure of 6,800 people will be further reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in the course of his statement, mentioned two pillars of his defence policy. The first related to a clear definition of `primary strategic environment'. I presume he is talking about the strategic environment as described in the White Paper. It is very interesting that, some two years after the White Paper was tabled, people lower down in the defence structure keep talking about the purity, structure and integrity of the White Paper-although, as the Minister himself has clearly recognised, it has been overtaken by events and seems to have moved on. There is no doubt that in the past two years the White Paper has been seen to be a flawed document. It is basically defensive and isolationist. In considering what has happened in our region in the past two years, it is apparent that there is a need for an outgoing policy of regional involvement. Not only have we seen the events in Fiji, in Vanuatu, and in New Caledonia last week-and particularly in New Guinea-but also we are faced with a declining capability in New Zealand and a declining American defence presence in this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> All these things point to a policy of increased regional involvement; yet, we stick to the White Paper, which according to some people is always on track. It does not matter how many Budget cuts there are-projected on to a 3 per cent real increase-in every economic statement and in every Budget that is brought down, what happens to defence? A bit more is sliced off the top. The Government's response is, `Don't worry, everything is still on track'. This is another reason why the integrity of the White Paper has been reduced to an absolute shambles. We do not live in a benign region any more. Our defence policy should be based on a strong deterrent approach and maximum regional involvement, including an off-shore deployment capability and experienced personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of a strong deterrent, as has been indicated before, the Opposition applauds the development of the 471 submarines. That is one arm in our effective deterrent strategy. The other arm, the more visible one, involves the F111 aircraft. The F111 aircraft are currently under threat-or at least one squadron is. There is still no aerial refuelling for the F111 and no proposal for this in the program. There are no airborne command and control aircraft or airborne radar aircraft. So, in terms of effective and visible deterrence, that capacity is going down. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of regional involvement, despite the lessons of Fiji two years ago, we still have no real offshore deployment capability. We still have no ship that can carry Blackhawk helicopters. But the Minister does not worry too much about that. If another Fiji-type situation arises, the Minister's solution is to use paratroopers. I saw a statement made by the Minister-and presumably he was quoted correctly-that if that sort of thing happens again we are going to use paratroopers. We will not worry about some seaborne offshore quiet deployment capability; we are going to drop in paratroopers. Imagine what would have happened to the first Australian paratrooper dropped into Fiji-or for that matter a paratrooper likely to be dropped into any other area? It is absolute nonsense to be talking about a credible regional presence if we do not have any capacity to deploy troops, equipment or stores. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the third leg of this White Paper, the whole of Australia now knows the condition of the experience levels and the capabilities in our units, arising from the enormous wastage of personnel. In the past six years, 50,000 people have left the service. This is over a trained base-excluding trainees-of 62,000 people. In another couple of years, in numerical terms, we will have turned over the whole of the Australian Defence Force within about seven or eight years. </PARA>

The Minister has presided over the debilitation of the Australian Defence Force and yet he says it is all on track. It would assist a sensible defence debate in this country if the Minister said occasionally that there are problems, instead of denying it, because every time the Minister or the Chief of the Air Staff gets up and says, `Its all on track, don't worry, no loss of capabilities', all the people out there whom they are supposed to be commanding and the people whom they are hoping to retain say, `There they go again, what is the point of staying around here if they deny the very existence of a problem'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ4">Mr WHITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Get the Skyhawks over? Maybe we can get some New Zealand naval assets, and maybe some soldiers. What are those people who used to be in the Australian Fleet Air Arm now thinking as they see those Skyhawks coming back, with them being virtually given away in 1984? I suppose they are grateful that they left the service to seek other avenues of employment. The Minister in his speech talks about the force structure. The force structure simply does not exist any more, as a further squeeze is put on the service. They have not been told what they are expected to do; they have simply been told that they have to lop off some more men. A bit has been taken from here and from there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have now finished up with, of course, is a division that cannot deploy, an Air Force that is barely operational in some of its units, and a Navy that is seriously undermanned. The amphibious squadron is still being disbanded, despite the great requirement for an offshore deployment facility. The Navy has also had to close many of its facilities so that it can man the ships that it has. The Government's manning plan in relation to these new frigates and the Anzac ships is a mystery to me and a mystery to the Navy as well. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the balance of priorities in our defence spending-and this is pertinent to the Minister's statement, because it concentrates on industry and equipment-it is now out of kilter. As important as some of this equipment is, the Government does not seem to be able to understand the vital relationship between equipment, operations and personnel. In its enthusiasm to put so much support into equipment, operations and personnel have been allowed to run down-and this is as a matter of deliberate policy. Until the Government recognises this position, even with the best equipment in the world, with young and inexperienced and not properly motivated people, it really has nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his statement talked about reshaping the Australian Defence Force. Well, the Government has certainly done that. I want to provide two or three quotes from some recent service reports. First, I refer to a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) report of January 1989, signed by Air Commodore Tuckwell and several other officers. It is entitled `Study Team Report on RAAF Officer Manning Deficiencies', and states:</PARA>
<PARA>It is unarguable that the current aircrew to aircraft ratio is so low that the RAAF would be incapable of fully utilizing its assets in any situation except for the most benign contingency, and then only if this was transitory in nature. Consequently, the lack of aircrew is a pervasive and major factor which affects the real (as distinct from perceived) operational capability of the RAAF today. </PARA>
<PARA>It is some restructuring that the Minister is so proud of! The Air Force is crying from the heart in that report that its units are simply not operational. The Air Force states:</PARA>
<PARA>We can only cope with a benign contingency. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me read an extract from the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which inquired into the personnel wastage rates in the Australian Defence Force. The Royal Australian Navy in a submission dated April 1988 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Greater emphasis on unit training is required to compensate for this low level of operator and maintainer experience . . . Generally, ships have achieved most annual continuation training targets, but have maintained a less than optimum level of proficiency in some areas. There is evidence, accumulated over the last few years, of declining standards in weapon practices. Further, this evidence also indicates that the trend is accelerating. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how the Government has restructured the Navy. Let me turn to the Army. An article in the Army newspaper by the Chief of General Staff, Lieutenant-General Laurie O'Donnell, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Wastage is affecting the Army's operational capability, because we do not have sufficient trained personnel to fill an already finely-honed manpower establishment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how the Government has restructured the Army. I do not know how the Minister can come into this chamber and talk proudly about the reshaping of the Defence Force when we look at how it has been reshaped. What does the Minister say about this time and again? On 23 November he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no loss in Defence Force capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet every report we pick up from the Services to their own chiefs tells how badly off they are. The Minister talked in his statement about the number of ODP personnel in Russell Offices. He said that there were 1,000 in 1984. That was an absolute disgrace. I congratulate the Government and the Minister in getting that number down to something like 30. Many are not necessary now that we have a government company. But the growth of public servants in Russell-although there has been an overall decline-is still a serious problem. Figures taken from the last defence report indicate that there are 1,200 civilians in the Russell complex of the equivalent rank of lieutenant-colonel and above. It is very interesting that recently Major-General John Sanderson was commissioned and directed to undertake a structural review of higher ADF staff arrangements-that is, the number of lieutenant-colonels and above in the military. The terms of reference include the words `reduce the number of senior officers'. I suppose the salary compression could be looked at once the number of senior officers was reduced. Quite rightly, a review is being conducted in respect of the military structure. But, is a compensatory review being carried out of these 1,200 Public Service senior positions?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But there is no study. It is all very well to get stuck into the military, to get Major-General Sanderson to put the axe through them, but at the same time the Public Service is being left virtually untouched. Unless there is a compensatory reduction on both sides, even more power will be in the hands of the Public Service. This is part of the problem that the Department of Defence has at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned the Williamstown Dockyard. There is absolutely no doubt that the Williamstown Dockyard's success in the last few years has been remarkable. One would get the impression from reading the Minister's statement that this success had everything to do with the Government. The fact is that it had nothing to do with the Government. It was not until it was sold that it started to make progress. The private sector was responsible. This success is due to the Australian Marine Engineering Corporation (AMEC) in cooperation with and help of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). Dr John White, the general manager of Williamstown, and his team deserve congratulations for this achievement. They have reduced the number of unions on the dockyard from 23 to three. They have four skill levels and there are no demarcation disputes or problems with them. People move freely in a multiskilled environment. Training in higher skills is undertaken on company time and at company expense. There is every incentive for men and women with ability to move up through those skill levels. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some dispute about the numbers which, according to one of the Government's reports when the sale was effected, was about 1,200. Yet, the Government claims today that the number is 2,200. That is a small point; the numbers need some clarification. The number is now about 750 and productivity would appear to be up about four times. The company is very proud of its progress at Williamstown. It is an enormous success story from a productivity and an industrial relations point of view. This was demonstrated last week by the launch of the frigate 05, three months early. No doubt, with the contract for the Anzac frigate project coming up shortly, the company wants to demonstrate what it can do-and that is to its great credit; it shows that it can do the job. If the Government is so clever with industrial relations as it claims, why does it not get stuck into the Garden Island Dockyard and do the same thing there? Having said that, it is pleasing to see that Garden Island has also made great strides in recent years. We should give a lot of the credit for this to Admiral Berlyn and his team. </PARA>
<PARA> Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) was mentioned in the statement. This Government company was established in October 1987 to take over from the old Government Aircraft Factories. I visited ASTA last week and although it is making progress-I wish it well-it still appears to have some union problems. Again, one would hold up the Williamstown example as something for companies, such as ASTA, to follow. ASTA also has a problem in terms of lack of capital. I am pleased to see that the private sector is being invited to become involved in ASTA. That is a major step forward. It is a matter of whether those sectors can be made profitable enough to induce the private sector to come in. This also points up the importance of massaging these companies into shape so that they are attractive. It is not just a question of selling them off; they have to be formed into profitable enterprises before they can be offered to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of industrial relations, of which the Minister in his statement seems so proud, we on this side of the House believe that the accord with the ACTU has made our industrial relations system inflexible and has contributed to Australia's problems which have been brought about by a centralised wage system, low productivity and the dominance of the ACTU in any industrial matters as far as the Government is concerned. Once again, if we compare the productivity of the Garden Island Dockyard with that of the Williamstown Dockyard, Garden Island comes a bad second. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of industrial relations, we still have had no explanation of why 540 people were sacked in August 1987 when the Government Aircraft Factories was overtaken. Up to 150 employees sat around for some six months. Although they were paid for doing nothing, servicemen are leaving the services in ever-increasing numbers because of appalling conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make some final points on the matter of defence exports. We now have a prospect of selling some of our defence production overseas. It should have happened years ago. The person who stopped it for all those years is the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bill Hayden. He simply would not allow those exports to proceed. A recent tour by an Australian export study team will say that there are some prospects. It will be a long haul because we are not competitive on world terms. Nevertheless, a start has been made. I once again ask the Minister to address this question of capital because that study team going overseas came up against defence exports from other countries, including Britain and America, that would offer the prospective buyer some capital deal-a cheap loan, a grant or a deferred payment. We simply do not do that. Until such time as we do, we will have great problems in expanding our defence export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of points must be made about the accountability of Government companies. The Auditor-General is responsible for the audit of Australian Aerospace Technologies. I presume the same situation applies throughout the Australian defence industry. The problem is that when the Auditor- General has carried out his audit, he hands the results back to the company. The company then produces an annual report and that report goes to the Government. But these Government companies are not accountable to this Parliament. The Opposition is currently addressing this matter. It seems to us that it is entirely unsatisfactory for a company to be set up with taxpayers' money, to be controlled by the Government and yet not be accountable to this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat that the Government has made progress. We support that progress and the restructuring of defence support facilities. It is good to see. The Australian Defence Association is another step forward, although we have a long way to go. We, on this side of the House, are pleased to be able to endorse the thrust of the statement made this afternoon. But we would be more impressed if the Minister had paid some fraction of attention to the problems of operations, conditions of service and personnel progress that he has given to defence industry because, if he had, he would not have the problems that he has on his hands today. </PARA>

Unfortunately, the only way we can speak to him is by proposing for discussion a matter of public importance.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is completely out of touch. Quite honestly, great financial hardship is being experienced by many of those people who have been the traditional service providers of disability services throughout Australia. There is certainly confusion in this area and uncertainty felt by the service providers, their clients and particularly the families of the disabled. The most recent example of this is the formation of the Bundaberg Group-a group of parents of intellectually disabled children under the auspices of Mrs Mary Walsh. These people have become a rather large force within Queensland, thus indicating a concern of parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a fear of the future. Parents who have disabled children fear that they are unable to plan precisely what is ahead of them and particularly for their children. This is particularly so when one reads bulletins such as Our Voice published by Disabled People's International (Australia) Ltd in which the Minister, under the heading of `No more Cradle to the Grave', says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Programs and services are to be developed and administered so as to ensure that no single organisation providing services shall exercise control over all or most aspects of the life of a person with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA>This concerns parents who, with limitations to their own lives, have to make provision for their children. That bulletin was headed `Blewett Issues Ultimatum'. Where is the concern of the Minister when headlines such as that are generated? There has been a long-running argument in the industry. The Bulletin of 13 December, speaking of Mrs Edith Hall and under the heading `Bashing one's head against a brick wall', states:</PARA>
<PARA> Hall is the front line of an `intense and bitter struggle' between the Department of Community Services and Health and ACROD. The battle is over the new Disability Services Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is relevant to note that the problem is continuing because from a letter dated 11 April 1989 it is obvious there is an absolute breakdown in understanding of what the Minister is doing. At the conference held last year by the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled (ACROD), the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me be clearly understood on this point, once and for all: there is no intention on the part of the government, or my department, to close down or defund existing sheltered workshops and activity therapy centres in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely the problem set out in the letter dated 11 April, which was addressed to constituents of ACROD. The Minister is now going back on his word. A real battle between the service providers, their clients and the Minister is going on out there. This battle is about retaining existing services against the philosophical commitment of this Minister to change. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the changes away from those old services. I think that many honourable members in this chamber, particularly in the Opposition, would be acquainted, in some way or another, with providers of these services. They have given a very long term of service and a very good service to their clients. They have been prepared to change with the times. They have been prepared to accept innovations from overseas. At this stage the volunteers and the charitable organisations are providing the best service in a non-profit capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not come as a surprise to hear a person who is a leader in the field of rehabilitation and disability services saying that he is dismayed at the way in which the Department of Community Services and Health seems to be dismantling all the services which, 20 to 30 years ago, were hailed as revolutionary advances-such as the activity therapy centres, the help of volunteer bodies and now the sheltered workshops. It is quite incredible that the departmental officers, backed of course by their Minister, are behaving in such a fashion. They are such impractical people. It looks as though before long we will be back in the era of the 1920s and the 1930s. Instead of moving into the future, we are moving back to the past. Australia is a world leader in rehabilitation services and assistance of the disabled. What is intended, as suggested in the form of that letter, is to turn all of that backwards and to try the high-risk, high-cost innovation methods being introduced from America, when in fact we lead the world in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also financial hardship. I wish to mention a few things in this regard. I understand that pilot projects have been implemented throughout Australia, where the Government has taken the full responsibility of the services being offered in the area of disabilities. These projects have had unlimited access to finance. I understand that the results were so horrific that the Department and the Minister are not prepared to disclose the cost per client on an annual basis. Studies have been done within organisations which suggest that their cost per client under the present method, which involves a lot of volunteer, charitable and public support, is about $14,472 per year, and that their cost per client for accommodating these people and putting them out into the community on a four to a cottage basis escalates to $63,000. The amount has been quadrupled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department and the Minister are quite prepared to change, and to insist on change, but at no stage have they suggested where the cost of these changes will come from. As I said before, it is a high cost operation, but more importantly it involves a high risk, because the American experiment has not shown the results, whereas the Australian experience indicates that Australia is well on the track in this regard and providing the services to the best of its ability. I am not saying that there should not be change. However, when we suggest change, we have to make sure that the change is going to be beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make some other comments in connection with the implementation of the Disability Services Act and the concern it is causing the industry and the providers. I wish to mention specifically the Spastics Centre in Brisbane. It is backed by a charitable qualification. As far as the raising of donations is concerned, it is accepted as such for income tax purposes by the Australian Taxation Office and by the Government. The Spastics Centre provides an assessment centre, accommodation, education, family respite and transport. Under the new guidelines, this organisation will not be eligible for funding in future, irrespective of the fact that Government members have been on site to say that it is doing a great job. The Spastics Centre has been told that when new projects come up in this regard, it will no longer be available to receive the funds it requires because it is too big a provider, too big an institution. It has been told it has to use up all of its reserves. I believe that it is operating on reserves which amount to about nine months' clear funding if it does not get anything from the Commonwealth. It has been asked to use up these reserves before it comes back to the Commonwealth for funding. In other words, it has to use charity, whereas once it was funded at Commonwealth expense. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no transport assistance available under the new guidelines, which state that this is supposed to be a State matter. If one separates services into different centres where transport will be absolutely essential to get people from accommodation to workplaces, that is expected to be at the cost of the provider or the State. Yet, there have been no State arrangements in this regard. The Spastics Centre in Queensland is an example of a non-profit organisation, a charitable organisation. There is a tremendous amount of volunteer effort, a tremendous amount of professionalism, being displayed in the delivery of these services. Yet this organisation is being held to ransom in this regard. It is being told that big is no longer beautiful. If the answer is that small is beautiful, it will be an expensive exercise. The Minister has to assure these people that, if change is absolutely imperative, the finance will be there to back them up. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite another example, Bedford Industries, from the Minister's own State. I believe that the Minister has been on site in that establishment and has said that it provides wonderful work. It certainly does. It is providing everything from work placement to training, getting people with skills out into the field. Yet, according to the guidelines under which the Minister is now operating-guidelines he is implementing-Bedford Industries is concerned that it no longer fits the bill as far as further finance is concerned. It provides accommodation and all the related services and it provides skills in 21 different directions, yet it may not be entitled to funding under the new arrangements. I could also talk about Westfield in Dubbo, New South Wales. I could talk about the Australian Quadriplegic Association operating out of Sydney. I could also talk in terms of the Endeavour Foundation and the Challenge Foundation and what they are doing in their sheltered workshops. Yet, all these organisations are under threat of de-funding. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said to me that the Act itself is appropriate; that it is only in the delivery of these services that the Government and the Department have failed. If the guidelines are so bad, and their implementation is so bad, there must be something wrong with the Act itself. I want to mention two areas that concern the industry. Under the guidelines, in chapter 5, which are at the discretion of the Minister, contracts are being entered into where these guidelines can be inserted after the contract. In another area, I think chapter 8, certain services are mentioned which are not being delivered at present. The Minister might look at that. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines do not make any provision for the differences in the various handicaps and in the degree of handicap. For instance, Multicap in Queensland provides services to intellectually handicapped with an IQ of less than 35 per cent. Endeavour supplies those services for people with an IQ of 35 per cent. Yet, the Act and the particular basis on which these guidelines are being implemented do not take that into consideration. To give an example of that, let me refer the House to a question and answer in Question Time, where the Minister said that in spite of the degree of handicap, intellectual or otherwise, the basis for assistance must be a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. Obviously, the Minister was referring to sheltered workshops and to a comment made in the press in that regard about sweated labour. That is not the manner in which the Department should attack the problem. Nor does the Department show any consideration or understanding of the fact that there can be quite a vast difference in disabilities which cannot be provided for under the one set of guidelines. I think this is fairly obvious from that one example. There are large differences in the degrees of handicap, a fact which the Minister does not acknowledge. There has been talk about flexibility. I had felt that there might be a greater degree of flexibility in the appointment within the Public Service of Mr Ian Fletcher. I have on hand the April-May 1989 statement of the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled, in which the question is asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What happened to flexibility under the DSA?</PARA>
<PARA>The comment is:</PARA>
<PARA>What happened to the flexibility Don Grimes promised us so often? What happened to the emphasis on consumer outcomes rather than processes? What happened to the economic factor?</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the major organisation, the peak organisation, completely at sea in the delivery of these services. On the other hand, we see the use of advocacy teams at great expense; the use of consultants in order to push the governmental guidelines. ACROD is unhappy. There is a compliant that there is a move in personnel and a moving target cannot be hit. Endeavour, for instance, has had 63 contacts with the Department over two years. Finally, Dr Madden was promoted to another position, so the proceedings have gone back to square 1. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the manner in which the Government is trying to discredit organisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like first of all to comment on the exquisite timing of this matter of public importance. I have looked through the Notice Paper and I can find only one question on disability services. This is so urgent a matter that looking back over all those questions on notice I can only find one question on this matter. Secondly, I have gone through an entire two years of questions to me. The honourable member for Dawson( Mr Braithwaite), who now brings this issue up as a matter of urgency, has not asked of me in two years a single question about disabilities. So we must ask ourselves why this matter is on the agenda today. I suggest that it has more to do with the blood-bath about to take place on the front bench of the Opposition than it has with concern for the disabled. It clearly shows the cynical nature of this operation and the reaction of honourable members opposite. If over the past couple of years honourable members opposite had asked these questions and shown this concern, one might take this matter seriously. I suggest, as I suggested a moment ago, that the noise being made by honourable members opposite has something to do with whether or not the honourable member will survive the bloodbath next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will make a second point about this matter. On the very day that this cynical matter is brought on for debate and we are accused of not having proper communications with disability groups around the country, my Department and the heads of all the newly established disability advisory councils in each State are meeting here in Canberra in a constructive way to look at the problems associated with the Disability Services Act. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled in a moment, but not in the negative and mischievous way that this has been brought up. One of the points that was raised, and it is raised in the matter of public importance itself, has something to do with financial hardship. I will discuss the point raised about financial hardship. There is a cold hard fact that the Opposition needs to take into account here. In the last year of the coalition Government, in 1982-83, $72m was spent on disability services. This year the Government has spent $165m on disability services so, in fact, there has been more than a doubling of resources going into disability services in the six years of this Government. However, honourable members opposite have the hide to come in here and talk about financial hardship, even though they can look at the books and see that there has been an increase of over 100 per cent in six years. That has occurred because in many ways this Government has put effort, energy and resources into disability services in a way that no previous government has done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me look, firstly, at other members of the Opposition. When the Disability Services Act was introduced into Parliament and it was referred to the Senate there was a bipartisan attitude and the kinds of cheap points that have been made today were not raised. There was support for the outcomes and processes of the Act. I will quote Senator Peter Baume. I hope he will emerge as a spokesman for the Opposition once the bloodbath is over. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We regard community services as one part of public policy whose goal is to enable as many Australians as possible to live their lives with dignity free of interference and as independently as possible. To the extent that this legislation seeks to enhance and advance that goal we support it. When we are in government and responding to need we would like to determine priorities, set goals and pursue outcomes. To the extent that this legislation seeks to do those things, we support it. Our goals include the restructuring of Government funding so that we can promote services that look towards producing certain outcomes as they affect the dignity, the financial, physical and emotional dependence of people and a new community integration of people with disabilities. To the extent that this legislation seeks to do that, we support it. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is what the Disability Services Act sought to produce. In the defence of all the conservative organisations mentioned by the honourable member, he does not appear to have read the reports and surveys published under both his Government and this Government which show quite clearly the major need for restructuring and change. It is no good saying that our services in Australia have led the world. There is no doubt that in the 1970s and early 1980s reports made conclusions like this:</PARA>
<PARA>The review found that the services for people with disabilities were inflexible, poorly funded, inadequate and demeaning. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no good accepting the arguments of a few organisations around the country that things in the 1970s and the 1980s led the world when in fact report after report to the then coalition Government and later to this Government suggested that Australia needed fundamentally to rethink the way it treated people with disabilities. In fact, the review report New Directions, which was tabled in Parliament in May 1985, concluded that such were the major massive and sweeping changes necessary to the types of disability services delivered in this country that what we wanted was an entirely new Act. The old Handicapped Persons Assistance Act was no longer sufficient; we wanted new disability services legislation. So this Government went about introducing new disability services legislation. That legislation is unique and, let me say, it is in front of the world. It provides a detailed statement of principles and objectives to be furthered in the administration and implementation of the Act. It encourages the direction of financial assistance to those who would undertake new operations, take some risks and exercise some imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> A whole new range of specific services were funded, and this is one the reasons why we have doubled the funding for disability services in our six years in government. These services include new forms of accommodation support. The honourable member talked about big no longer being beautiful. Big is no longer beautiful in terms of disability services. In fact, it is widely agreed amongst those who think about the problems of disabilities that it is a disadvantage to cluster all our disabled people in central complexes. We need to break them down, and I accept that in breaking them down we need to look at some of the issues. One of the more constructive suggestions made by the honourable member related to the question of transport. The general point in relation to people with disabilities is that it is not desirable-and it is no longer regarded in most parts of the world as desirable-to have disabled people in very big centralised institutions. The way to go is to integrate them in smaller establishments and smaller homes and integrate them into the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You must recognise that that costs a lot more, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the reasons why we have had this pretty massive increase, a commitment to a real increase of 5.5 per cent over the next two years. We have made that commitment because we recognise that some of the things we are doing will cost this extra money. I refer to supported employment and the respite care provision. Supported employment is the notion of getting people out into the work force, even if in many cases it demands a back-up person. I have the figures for sheltered employment allowances and their earnings. Those figures certainly do not reflect too well on the State from which the honourable member comes, if he is really interested in disability services. In New South Wales, the average amount earned is $23 a week, in Victoria it is $27 a week, in Queensland it is $14 a week, in South Australia it is $25 a week, in Western Australia it is $38 a week and in Tasmania it is $23 a week. We want people to have more opportunities actually to be out in the work force. We recognise that in many cases disabled people will not be able to go out into the work force and earn wages like others if they do not have back-up and support. Therefore, we have the whole notion of supportive employment. When one looks at the figures for sheltered workshops, and particularly the situation in Queensland, one can see that there is a need to encourage imagination-and I will come to some of the things that have been done in this area-to get people into supportive employment situations and also competitive employment through training and placement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of independent living training, one of the things that emerged from all these reviews was the desire of so many disabled people to live in their own homes, provided they could be taught the skills and have the back-up services. So independent living training becomes a new emphasis of the Act-as well as advocacy recreation and information. I accept that when one commits to change like this there will be opposition. Some of the points made by the honourable member come from our critics who run organisations which they believe have done a very good job-and in many ways they have done a good job. However, they are somewhat resistant to change. When people face change they always have problems accommodating to it. We have tried, and will continue to try, to be as flexible as possible in carrying through this legislation and to be responsible to needs. For instance, we have a working party which has been looking at activity therapy centres. It is a Government working party which includes members of ACROD, so there is representation from the disability organisation itself. Its report, which is about to come down, addresses again some of the issues and concerns of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition talks about me not consulting or my Department not consulting. But rarely in the history of this country and never before in the disabilities area has there been so much consultation. The whole thrust of what we are trying to do is to enable people with disabilities to achieve their maximum potential. That often means exercising some imagination, which I know comes hard to the conservative parties. It often means taking some risks. They are the sorts of things that the Act is concerned with doing. We aim to assist people with disabilities to participate as fully as possible in society, and that means being very genuinely concerned about employment opportunities, about really trying to get people employment opportunities out in society. That becomes another major thrust of what we are trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Peter Baume said-and this is again a major point of the Act-we are concerned very much with the outcomes for clients, judging success very much from their point of view. Finally, we are encouraging innovation and imagination in the provision of these services. Of course, those organisations which have been prepared to exercise that imagination and innovation have certainly prospered under the new Disability Services Act. For instance, I had Bedford Industries thrown up at me. I notice that I was accused of not being accessible on these matters, but the honourable member himself acknowledged that I had been to many of the organisations and conferences that he mentioned. If the honourable member reads the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs of 18 and 19 April this year, he will find that the chief executive officer of Bedford Industries in South Australia was very positive in his approach-it is there on the public record-towards the Disability Services Act. That does not mean that we have not been taking up a whole lot of issues with a big organisation like Bedford Industries. But, certainly, his response to that Committee was extremely positive towards the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have tried to do is be flexible and consult, recognising-we do not deny it-that whenever one is faced with change there will be some opposition and people will be doubtful about taking new or imaginative steps. Let me just talk about some of these consultations. We have revamped the whole of the advisory bodies in the States. A State advisory body on disability services has been established in nearly every State. We have been working on that to get proper representation. Their chairmen are meeting here today, as I have mentioned already. There is a whole range of regional consultations and conferences sponsored through the Department. I do not deny that we have had disagreements with ACROD, but we have had a good and continuous contact with ACROD right through these processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me finally take-I think the sorts of things on the ground are most important-a few of the examples of the kinds of transition programs that are around which really, in a way, prove the successes of the program. </PARA>

Is the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) saying that it was not urgent? The Minister should really get out on the ground and have a look at some of the people who are facing these problems. They will tell him whether it is urgent or not. He asked why we did not actually ask any questions. I will tell him why we do not ask questions. The last question I asked the Minister was on 22 November 1988. I got the answer on 28 April 1989. That is how long it takes to get an answer. Why does he think we do not ask any questions?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What about the other point? The Minister said that it was difficult to take this matter seriously. I think I am almost quoting him. He asked, `How can you take this matter seriously?' I will tell him how he can take it seriously. He should go and talk to the disabled people, their families and to the societies who look after them. One has to take it seriously if one has an ounce of decency in one's body. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister talked about the financial hardships and about an increase in resources under this Government over the last seven years. There has been an increase. If one asks any of the resource groups who are looking after disabled people, they will say categorically that the financial allocations that this Government has made are inadequate because they are being told to spend money on programs and not being given the money to start those programs. The Government is asking them to move people out of hostels into individual community houses, into cottage accommodation, which costs money. The Government is not giving them the money to do it. It is as simple as that. That is why the problems of financial hardship are arising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister missed the whole point. The whole problem that we and the community have is not with the Disability Services Act. We believe that the Act itself is admirable, and the Minister quoted Senator Peter Baume's comments on this. The Act has admirable intentions: it tries to encourage the independence of the disabled; it gives them economic opportunity; and it provides for community integration. We all believe in these things. Our problem is with the Government's and the Department of Community Services and Health's implementation of the Act. The Government has caused fear and trepidation amongst service providers-organisations such as the Challenge Foundation, which is not known for its radicalism-amongst the families of the disabled and, most importantly of all, amongst both the mentally and physically disabled themselves. What has happened to those groups is a disgrace. The disability service provider groups in particular are distressed for a number of reasons, partly because of the misinformation that has come out from the Minister's Department. I do not know whether that is deliberate, but it is amazing to see different information being spread around the community. This action has to be considered to be deliberate. These groups face uncertainty and delays. Changes are made to the funding formula. For example, there is no flexibility for block grant changes. That is crucial in the society in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the disappearance of the promised equipment and the maintenance funds? All of the major groups in every State of Australia that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), other members of the back bench committee and I have visited and talked to, have the same problem. They say, `What about the disappearance of the promised equipment and the maintenance funds? We cannot survive financially any more'. The Minister has acknowledged that movement from hostels into community houses does cause major problems. We support the concept in general. But there are two factors that the Minister needs to recognise very clearly. First, and above all, it costs money and the Government is not providing that money. This is a very desirable option for a number of people, but it is expensive and the Government has to provide the wherewithal to make it viable. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that the Minister has to realise is that it is not suitable for all people. Unfortunately, a decision seems to have been made somewhere in the Department that there is a blanket move for everybody who possibly can be moved in any State at all from the hostel situation into cottage housing. That is just not feasible. I went with the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dawson, to the Challenge Foundation at Minnamurra and saw people who were apparently about to be moved. They actually had trouble moving themselves around the floor while they were undergoing their occupational therapy and stimulation. To expect these people to survive on their own is outrageous. That may be an extreme example, but there are whole hosts of other examples of people who should not be moved into the community. But the Minister is moving them into the community. They cannot just be moved into this new type of accommodation. The staff have to be provided and trained and the community around those cottages has to be educated to accept them. The Government is not doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Challenge Foundation is concerned that the implementation will be done by bureaucrats living in an ivory tower in Canberra who have no practical experience, no hands-on grass roots experience, at helping the disabled organise their day to day living. They would be relying on textbook information of the system mentioned previously from the United States of America rather than actual knowledge. If the Government is going to go down this track, it has got to provide the funds to do it. The Challenge Foundation, one of the most respected groups in this area, believes that the benefits of hostel-type accommodation have been sold short. If hostel-type accommodation is properly designed and staffed, the quality of life can be as good as cottage accommodation and at a much lower cost. In this situation, big may still be beautiful. So stop the blanket approach of getting everybody out of hospital into cottages. By all means do it for those where it is appropriate and provide the funds for it, but do not make this across the board attack. Have some sensitivity for the people that are being attacked. They are scared witless about what is happening to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned the Disability Services Act's aim of getting people out of sheltered workshops and into the open labour market. It is an admirable intention, but in general terms it is unrealistic to do this across the board. The Minister mentioned a number of things. In other speeches he has mentioned this concept of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, implying some sort of Dickensian workshop experience around Australia. The workshops we are talking about are not similar to that of Dickens with the beadle throwing scraps to Oliver Twist; these are workshops with modern equipment and modern staff and where modern overseeing is carried on day in, day out. If the Minister goes to those workshops-and I cannot imagine he has been to many if he really believes they are Dickensian-he will see that the people there have a role, which is very largely fulfilled by the workshop environment. </PARA>
<PARA> We have asked a number of people in the area what percentage of people in sheltered workshops would be able to cope on the open market. The answer is from 5 to 10 per cent. Let us look at those. Firstly, the majority of those do not wish to work on the open market. We may say that they will get much more money on the open market, but the reality is that when they are in the sheltered workshops they are the team leaders, the foreman, the big fish in a little pool. It boosts their self-esteem beyond anything that would happen in the open market. They develop social relationships and independence, whereas if they went out into industry, even those people who are the foreman in the sheltered workshops would become the toilet cleaners and the butt of jokes and they would be ostracised by their workmates. The integration of these people into the workplace can certainly be enhanced by education, but education of the community and the work force needs money, and the Government is not providing enough money to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Programs such as job support work very well. They are very effective at moving these people and training them and educating their work colleagues to understand the problems they face. But the staffing required to educate those people through community programs such as job support is almost one to one. One staff member is needed pretty well full time to look after the first few months of somebody going into the work force in the open market, because the problems that person faces are enormous. The unions are not on side. They are scared that they might affect the employment conditions of the people they are supposed to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> That applies only to 5 per cent who might be able to move out into the open work force. What about the other 95 per cent? They will not be able to cope. With all the best will in the world and all the help in the world, they will not cope in the open environment, whereas in the workshops they do. In the workshops they interact with their peers. It is not just a work place; it is also a social occasion, if you like. The workers who attend the sheltered workshops go there as a way of having social interaction. One of the prices they pay for that, and most are happy to pay for it, is that they do not get paid as much as they would in the open market, but their lives are much fuller in terms of their overall lifestyle. They have a joy, if you like, in going to what is a community centre as well as a workshop. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a shame that we have to use the term `workshop' because it does have Dickensian overtones, which are entirely inappropriate for the current workshop environment. I have visited many of them. The people working in them have the joy of being productive. According to our scale, in many cases that may not be very productive, but it is productivity as they see it. They see themselves as being useful to the community, to their employer and to their workmates. What would happen if they were forced out into the open labour market? Clearly, they would fail. They would resign or they would be sacked and, if they were sacked, they would be stuck at home in isolation and that would cause more problems for their psychology. It would put more pressure on their families and more pressure on the whole community, which would have to provide other services to look after them. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile this Government sits in splendid isolation laying down the law and then not following it. We are basically very happy with the Disability Services Act as it stands, apart from a few minor details. It is the implementation of that law by the Minister's Department which has caused all the problems. The Minister has to stop hiding from the consumers, the disabled and the societies looking after them, and their families, and make himself accessible. The regular complaint we get wherever we go is, `Why cannot we get in touch with this Minister? Why will the Minister not see us?'. I ask the Minister to stop hiding from the consumers and their representatives. I suggest that he come out and let them approach him, and let us together constructively fix these problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am becoming involved in this debate with some feelings of concern, particularly regarding the politicisation of an area affecting disabled people and their carers-that is, the staff, the number of people in the community who have been working together with government for some years to strive to put together programs which will bring up to optimum the way in which people who suffer disablement can effectively perform in the community. I say that it is really important that this debate should not be politicised because I have had experience with the reaction that can occur if one tries to represent concerns which are put forward by disabled people, by their carers and by their staff. When politicised, people misrepresent the genuine efforts of members of parliament and governments as merely looking for a headline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comments made by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) and some of the comments made by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite)-although I am sure that they do have real concerns-if acted upon would, I think, make the matter very much worse. Questions have been asked by people on the other side and out in the community as to why so many people are confused. The Opposition's contributions today have suggested that it is all the fault of the Government, the only government which is funding workshops and activity therapy centres (ATCs) in conjunction with the community-about 30 per cent funding from the Federal Government in the case of some major organisations, the community putting in the rest. I find this extremely unreasonable. One could say that the concern and the confusion in the minds of some parents, some disabled people, some carers and some providers, could be because of a breakdown in communication between parents and the board of management of the provider, and between the provider and government. But it is absolutely unintelligent and lacking in integrity to try to channel home criticism to the one body. This Government and the Department of Community Services and Health are striving to effect change in an area in which trauma can lead to fear. In the 1980s we are now looking at an altogether new scenario for disabled people. At the start of the century disabled people were just shut away and not assisted. People with disablements or with mental disturbances were shut away in hospitals or institutions or left at home and not assisted, mainly through a lack of knowledge. Parents underwent trauma and stress trying to care for disabled people. Disabled people wanted to become more operative, and there were no ways open to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Disability Services Act prescribes two discrete employment outcomes for people with intellectual disabilities: supported employment and competitive employment. It was envisaged that people with mild or borderline intellectual disabilities and working in sheltered workshops would stream into competitive employment, while those with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities and working in activity therapy centres would move to supported employment. There was an attraction in the different options which were offered by this legislation. However, it was found that there were inherent flaws in the basis of the legislation. They were quickly recognised by the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health, leading to efforts to introduce a more flexible approach which was premised on individual needs and aspirations. Following that, a number of transitional plans have been undertaken to try to ensure that the facilities and services offered for disabled people are effective. So it is not at all true or fair to say that nothing is being done in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be easiest for me to refer directly, in the very brief time I have, to the experience of people working in activity therapy centres and sheltered workshops within the electorate of Lilley. In March of this year I was contacted by parents and staff members at workshops and ATCs in the north Brisbane area who outlined specific concerns regarding an alleged lack of services for disabled clients. They did not wish to speak out against the Endeavour Foundation, which provides 45 per cent of the services for intellectually disabled people in Queensland-some because of a sense of loyalty; others, however, feared victimisation. Although this may not have been based on fact, they feared that if they spoke out their sons or daughters could be denied access to the workshops and centres. </PARA>
<PARA> I visited the workshop, spoke with staff members, liaised with the Endeavour Foundation and spoke to parents. Eventually, I calmly and factually stated some of these allegations in the grievance debate in this House on 6 April. However, following that speech, conditions reached the stage where, although those people were afraid to speak out about the alleged lack of facilities, staff members expressing concern at alleged poor conditions at ATCs went to the media. My concern is about misrepresentations which followed this publicity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, this is not the media's fault; I am not saying that at all. I am not trying to put the fault anywhere. It is a matter of great concern. One staff member who had been with the Endeavour Foundation for over five years was dismissed for going against the guidelines and speaking to the media. Three other staff members-gentle, intelligent, caring women from the Northgate workshop in my electorate, one of whom had been at the Foundation for 18 years-resigned, allegedly in support of Kathy Cross, the Endeavour supervisor who was dismissed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage I decided to take the matter to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and also to the Endeavour Foundation to see whether we could work out some way in which the Government could liaise directly with the Endeavour Foundation to review the specific and serious allegations which were made and which I have on record. There had been a number of serious allegations and I decided to see whether they could be addressed with a view to reaching just resolutions and the best outcome for disabled people, for their carers, for the staff members concerned and consequently for the Endeavour Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Endeavour Foundation is not the only provider of these services in Queensland. Certainly there would be question marks over some services which, I believe, operate under very bad conditions. I have supported the Endeavour Foundation for many years. It is not true that that organisation does not have my support and that of this Government; it does. But it advantages no-one if serious allegations are not met and addressed. If the iceberg of unresolved allegations were allowed to surface slowly, the public animosity and misrepresentation that would surround such an ongoing situation would discredit all of the good services offered by the Endeavour Foundation. I am very pleased with the response I received from the Minister, who has approved in principle a coordinated review of the areas of concern identified by the Department of Community Services and Health and the Endeavour Foundation. This afternoon I will be liaising with Mr Tom Barry, the State Executive Director of the Endeavour Foundation in Queensland, to seek his cooperation in the interests of disabled people and their carers. I trust that those people who have incorrectly and publicly assumed that there is an organised attack of the Endeavour Foundation will realise that this is not so. I wish, and the Government wishes, to put the interests of disabled people first. Surely no-one would expect us to ignore the allegations and concerns expressed to us, rather than moving to assist those who have requested help. I hope we will now be able to work together towards a just outcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the taxation laws in a number of respects and in addition will remove some 180 pages of redundant provisions of the income tax law. Three outdated tax-related Acts will also be removed from the statute book. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains measures to apply after today to specifically tax gains and allow a deduction for losses on the disposal of traditional securities. As announced on 22 November 1988, the exemption from capital gains tax for a taxpayer's sole or principal residence is to be extended to make sure that it covers those residing in retirement villages and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill extends the exemption from income tax of maintenance payments received by a wife or former wife to maintenance payments received by a spouse, former spouse, de facto spouse, former de facto spouse or by or on behalf of a child. Other amendments in the Bill ensure that a minor who is in receipt of a child disability allowance or is a disabled child will not be subject to the special anti-avoidance measures that deal with the unearned income of unmarried minors. The level of beneficiary rebate for 1988-89 will be increased from $260 to $262. </PARA>
<PARA> Gifts to funds for the relief of persons affected by the earthquakes in Armenia and to the Australian Ireland Fund are to be allowable income tax deductions. The taxation secrecy provisions are to be amended to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information to specified law enforcement agencies in certain circumstances, and to the Australian Customs Service. Finally, the Bill makes some minor technical amendments to the tax laws. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Redundant Provisions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government is conscious of concerns expressed over the volume and complexity of tax legislation with which taxpayers, tax administrators and other users must cope. Much of this legislation has been directed at curbing the excesses of the tax avoidance era that we inherited in 1983, and at creating a fairer taxation system. As part of this overall process, the Government is committed to improving the tax laws and to responding to constructive criticism of these laws. In that vein, this Bill will slash some 180 pages of redundant provisions from the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Further changes of this kind will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will also continue to see the adoption of a simpler drafting style in new tax laws, and the gradual revision of their provisions that could be expressed more clearly. It must be remembered, however, that all developed countries have complex laws-including tax laws-which necessarily reflect the complexity of commercial affairs. Indeed, some laws must be complex, if only because those out to exploit them do not shy from complexity in what they do. This ongoing process of law improvement, which will involve consultation with practitioners and industry groups, will ensure continuing progress in a key element of our tax reform program. The whole Australian community can only benefit from this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation of Traditional Securities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces new rules to apply after today for the taxation of traditional financial securities not being securities issued at a discount to which the accruals provisions of division 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 apply. Under the existing law certain gains and losses on the disposal or redemption of traditional securities are dealt with under the capital gains and capital losses provisions. This Bill excludes from the operation of those provisions gains or losses on the disposal or redemption of traditional securities acquired after today. Instead, under specific measures included by this Bill, the future tax treatment of gains and losses on the disposal or redemption of traditional securities will be dealt with under the general income tax law. The amendments will result in a small but unquantifiable gain to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Principal Residence Exemption</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will give effect to the proposal announced on 22 November 1988 to extend to units in retirement villages and similar accommodation the exemption from the tax on capital gains for a taxpayer's sole or principal residence. The amendment will apply from 20 September 1985, the date of first effect of capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Maintenance Payments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The income tax exemption available for periodical payments of maintenance received from a husband or former husband will be extended to include payments received, on or after 1 July 1988, from a wife or former wife, or by a person from a de facto spouse or former de facto spouse. Periodical payments of child maintenance received by or on behalf of a child will also be exempt from tax. A related measure will ensure that an income tax deduction is not available for expenditure or payments in respect of maintenance of a spouse, de facto spouse, or a family member under 16 years of age. The annual cost to revenue of these amendments is estimated to be $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation of Unmarried Minors</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the special provisions dealing with the unearned income of unmarried minors which is taxed at the top rate of personal tax. The changes take account of an amendment of the Social Security Act 1947 which replaced the handicapped child's allowance with the child disability allowance. The amendments made by this Bill will ensure that a minor in receipt of a child disability allowance, or who is certified by a medical practitioner as being a disabled child, will not be subject to the special provisions. These amendments cover all payments of the new allowance, which began on 15 November 1987. These amendments cover all payments of the new allowance, which began on 15 November 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Beneficiary Rebate</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A small adjustment, from $260 to $262, is being made to the level of the beneficiary rebate available for certain single taxpayers in 1988-89, so that no tax will be payable on taxable incomes up to $6,192. The rebate will shade out where taxable incomes exceed the $6,192 threshold and will shade out completely where a person's taxable income is $8,288 or more. This adjustment, which ensures that persons wholly dependent on specified Commonwealth benefits or allowances do not pay income tax, is estimated to cost $200,000 in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As announced on 16 December 1988, gifts to a public fund for the relief of persons affected by the earthquakes in Armenia made on or after 8 December 1988 and before 1 July 1989 will qualify for tax deduction. The revenue cost of this proposal is estimated at $500,000 in 1989-90. Gifts to the Australian Ireland Fund will qualify for tax deductability for today at a cost of $50,000 in a full financial year. I think you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will be particularly interested in that provision. </PARA>
<PARA>Access to Taxation Information</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the taxation secrecy provisions contained in this Bill will permit the Commissioner of Taxation to provide taxation information to certain law enforcement agencies. The authorised law enforcement agencies are the Australian Federal Police, State and Northern Territory police forces, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the National Crime Authority and State and Territory corporate affairs commissions. The legislation contains tight controls on the use that may be made of any information provided by the Commissioner. The amendments will allow the Commissioner to disclose taxation information to authorised law enforcement agency officers only where he considers that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence-that is, an indictable offence-has been committed. The information may only be used for intelligence purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments also allow the Commissioner of Taxation to release taxation information relating to a person convicted of a serious offence for evidence purposes for a post conviction proceeds of crime proceedings. The Commissioner will be required to disclose in his annual report to this Parliament, in respect of each broad category of offence, the number of requests for information by each law enforcement agency and the number of occasions on which information has been provided to each agency. The taxation secrecy provisions are being further amended to permit the Commissioner to provide taxation information to the Comptroller-General of Customs. The requirements of secrecy applying to taxation officers and other persons privy to confidential taxation information will, of course, extend to persons to whom taxation information can be communicated under these amendments. I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to introduce this Bill, which will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of a comprehensive double taxation agreement with the People's Republic of China. The Bill will insert the text of the agreement into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as a schedule to that Act. This agreement substantially accords with the other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. The Government believes it will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and China. The agreement was signed on 17 November 1988, at which time details were announced and copies of the agreement were made publicly available. It deals with all substantial forms of income flowing between both countries, apart from profits on international air transport operations covered by the existing Chinese Airline Profits Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> A particular feature of the agreement is that it provides for `tax sparing' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by China under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. Where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives, the agreement calls for a tax credit to be allowed as if the Chinese tax forgone had been paid. By this means, the Chinese development incentives will retain their attractions for Australian investors as they will not be effectively negated by the imposition of Australian tax. I note here that the agreement was negotiated on the basis of the existing income tax laws of the respective countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that aspects of proposed changes to Australia's general foreign tax credit system, which have been foreshadowed as applying from the beginning of the 1990-91 income year, could affect the practical operation of the tax credit provisions of the agreement, including the tax sparing mechanism. For example, proposed income tax exemptions under our domestic law for certain dividend payments and branch profits derived by Australian companies from comparable tax countries are likely to provide at least as great relief from Australian tax, and would operate in relation to such income from China. The agreement will enter into force when all necessary constitutional processes are completed both by Australia and China. This Bill, when assented to, will complete the processes required of Australia. The agreement is not expected to have any significant effect on the revenue. I table the explanatory memorandum on the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to give effect to the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 13 February 1989 that only bottles that are for repeated use in marketing alcoholic beverages qualify for exemption from tax on their initial acquisition by a brewer or wholesaler of such beverages. To achieve this, the Bill will remove containers used for marketing alcoholic beverages from the scope of items 94 and 94a of the first schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. At present, these provisions exempt from sales tax bottles and jars that bear a moulded notification that they remain the property of their supplier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also modify exemption item 95 which applies to bottles for repeated use in marketing non-alcoholic drinks. That item will now also operate to exempt, at the time they are first acquired by a manufacturer or a wholesaler, bottles for repeated use in marketing alcoholic beverages. The cost of such bottles, together with costs associated with their recovery and preparation for reuse, will be included in the sale value of the beverage on which sales tax is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will extend parallel treatment to beer kegs. This will remedy a situation under which beer kegs became exposed to potential double taxation since beer first attracted sales tax on 24 August 1988. This amendment will apply from that date so that affected taxpayers may obtain refunds of overpaid tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill contains social security and veterans' affairs legislation amendments to refine programs introduced by the Government in 1988 and to correct minor drafting defects. In the Budget sittings last year a far-reaching housing assistance package was introduced primarily to help social security recipients renting privately. The measures included rent assistance rate increases, a rise in the rent threshold to address the greater need of people paying higher rents, restriction of rent assistance eligibility to non-home owners and rationalisation of the assessment process for board and lodging rent assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Several refinements are being made by this Bill to improve that comprehensive package. The measures introduced last year are split between two different commencement dates. In the interests of the efficient delivery of these important initiatives, this Bill is aligning the take up dates. All will now begin on 13 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In making changes last year to the rent assistance provisions for people in board and lodging accommodation so that only two-thirds of their costs were treated as `rent', special saving provisions enabled existing boarders and lodgers to be phased into the new arrangements. Provision was made for them to continue to receive the same amount of rent assistance they would have received before June 1989 had the higher threshold applied, until they either stop boarding and lodging or become eligible for a higher payment under the new rules. This Bill clarifies certain aspects of those saving provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The notion of `existing boarders and lodgers' is being extended to ensure that not only people already receiving rent assistance but also any who advise the Department of Social Security of their eligibility before the commencement of the new rules will be covered by the saving provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The rent assistance provisions relating to residents of retirement villages will be expanded to ensure that all married persons living apart owing to ill health will be more beneficially assessed as individuals in determining their eligibility. At present, these provisions exclude cases where a married couple is living apart for reasons of ill health but where only one of the couple is a pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment is being made to one of the rent assistance definitions. Currently, the legislation defines `rent' for rent assistance purposes as `amounts payable every three months or more frequently'. An amendment would provide for the inclusion in the definition of regular payments in the nature of rent. This will have the effect of extending eligibility for rent assistance to people who pay amounts on a regular basis which are clearly rent although they may be paid less frequently than three monthly-for example, annual rents for caravan sites, boat moorings or some retirement villages. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes further improvement in the equity and effectiveness of payments to Australian families. The 1988 May Economic Statement announced the integration of all family payments. This was largely achieved by the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1988. To consolidate the integrated payment cycle, the Government proposes minor and consequential amendments in the areas of payment of arrears and cessation of payment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of these amendments is to bring the family allowance supplement (FAS) provisions into line with those for family allowance in allowing up to four weeks' arrears to be paid for a newborn baby, provided the claim is lodged within four weeks of the baby's birth. The FAS provisions are also to be brought into line with those applying to other family payments for the purpose of cessation of payment of pension, benefit or allowance. This will be done by concentrating all the cessation provisions in one reference in the Act. The operation of the formula which applies to the reassessment of the FAS rate following a substantial increase in income will be clarified. This will be achieved by deleting a reference to `125% of' the income threshold as the basis for the recalculation-the intention is that the flat income threshold be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of two minor amendments to the child disability allowance (CDA) provisions is to make it clear, by reinstating a reference to the Handicapped Persons' Assistance Act, that CDA is not payable where a child in an institution attracts certain payments, including handicapped child's benefit, under that Act. Secondly, it is being made clear that qualification for CDA is preserved even where family allowance, which is usually a prerequisite of CDA, is no longer paid because the child has been admitted to an institution for a period. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, an income test for maintenance income was introduced. It applies in addition to the longstanding test on general income for all means tested pensions and benefits. A small technical amendment to the maintenance free area component of the new income test is required to remove an anomaly in the splitting of the free area between married clients. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Treasurer's April statement, an additional waiting period is to be inserted for unemployment or sickness benefit for people who receive payments for annual leave on termination of employment. This will be over and above the usual seven day waiting period. The new waiting period will be the same as the period of annual leave for which the payment is due, up to a maximum of four weeks. This extended waiting period is a more accurate reflection of a person's need for support in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Two minor corrections are also to be made to the existing waiting period provisions as they apply to unemployment benefit. An existing reference to a period of three months will be revised to read 13 weeks. This reference covers a particular circumstance in which the waiting period may be waived. The amendment provides equal treatment regardless of the number of days in a month and is consistent with adjacent references. Special benefit is to be included in the list of benefits which entitle a former long term beneficiary to a waiver of the waiting period on reclaiming within the requisite period. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also has provisions to promote a fair and efficient system for dealing with certain debts due to the Commonwealth arising from prosecution action. Where a person is convicted of an offence under the Social Security Act, a court may, as well as imposing a penalty for the offence, order him or her to pay back any incorrectly paid entitlement resulting from the act, failure or omission for which the conviction was made. This is known as a reparation order. </PARA>
<PARA> The only mechanism available to enforce such a debt is through picking up the relevant State or Territory laws on the enforcement of fines. Differences between these laws have resulted in disparities in the treatment of Federal offenders who have been ordered to pay reparation. Where they are not treated as civil debtors, these people may become embroiled in criminal recovery procedures with the possible consequence of imprisonment in default. Such results should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> By inserting a ruling that reparation orders are to be enforced as civil judgments, this Bill, along with complementary amendments being made to the Crimes Act, makes sure that any order will be dealt with as compensation for loss rather than as a punishment. The risk of imprisonment for default will be eliminated and all Federal offenders will be treated consistently. Furthermore, enforcement will be at the discretion of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the Bill deals with a series of technical amendments and name changes. These include amendments to various references in the legislation to certain prescribed educational schemes for Aborigines to reflect the decision to change their names as from 1 January this year. The former Aboriginal secondary assistance scheme and Aboriginal study assistance scheme have been replaced by one comprehensive program, known as Abstudy, which encompasses both secondary and tertiary elements, known respectively as Abstudy Schooling and Abstudy Tertiary. Another amendment is to state correctly the name of the Air Force emergency Force as it appears in the provision which exempts participants from the work test requirements for unemployment benefit. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the interjections from the honourable member for Parramatta and the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, the comments by the honourable member for La Trobe fell far short of the standard required of this House in that they misrepresented the true funding position of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation-or perhaps I should say the funding that afflicts CSIRO. I have to admit that I have been developing a sneaking regard for the honourable member for La Trobe in his advocacy of CSIRO over the past few months, however lame that advocacy was on occasions. However, after his comments today in which he welcomed the supposed Government rescue of CSIRO and science generally, as announced in the Government's major statement on science on Monday, I now regard him, as I always have, as a rabid left winger, incapable of addressing in any structured way the realities that afflict our great institutions.

I ask the honourable member to adhere to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Madam Deputy Speaker. However, I remind the House that the honourable member for La Trobe is a self-proclaimed radical left winger. That is exactly what he is-myopic and out of touch. He has now betrayed the same people he has sought to represent over the last few months. Nonetheless, towards the end of his speech before the suspension of the sitting for lunch he swung back to veiled criticism of the Government. He posed the question of what would happen to the technical staff of CSIRO after the injection of Government funding following yesterday's science statement. He said that he hoped the funding would be sufficient to maintain CSIRO as the premier research institution in this country. He started off congratulating the Government but, by the time he had finished and perhaps thought through as he was speaking some of the realities of that charade, that fraud of a science statement, he was not so sure that the Government deserved congratulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One cannot help being utterly bemused by the praise he heaped on the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who was then at the table. He congratulated the Minister on his new responsibilities, those new responsibilities being twofold: First, the elevation to the position of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Science and Technology and, secondly, the responsibility of formulating and developing a coordinated strategy on science. Let us look at both of those elevations in turn to see whether they are deserving of congratulations. First, as I told the House on Monday, can one possibly think of anything more absurd than giving a Minister of State the title of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the same portfolio that he already has? There is not a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Defence Science and Personnel, there is not a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Defence; there are Ministers for those separate portfolios. It is playing with words to elevate a Minister already in charge of a portfolio to the position of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister. It is a total con. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Minister has been given the responsibility of formulating science policy. It is tragic not just for the Minister concerned, who has been completely humiliated, but for the constituency he is supposed to represent in his role as a Minister of State. If he has not been developing science policy and coordinating Government strategies in this area, what has he been doing for six years? We are delving into the realms of the ridiculous if we believe that this turn of events has heralded some changed circumstances, that the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business will now have any more influence over this Government than he had in the past-and that was precious little. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a payoff to the Minister for Science for withdrawing at the last moment one of his numerous threats to resign. He has gone to the brink and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has bought him off. I am not so sure that the Minister for Science knows it. If he is incapable of understanding the true crisis of science in Australia today, he is probably incapable of knowing that the Prime Minister has pulled the wool over his eyes. The Minister for Science has been patted on the head and told that he is a great academic. He is an important man now! He will now have the ear of the Prime Minister as the person responsible for coordinating science strategy, as if he was not always the holder of that responsibility. I ask the House the rhetorical question as I did on Monday: can anybody imagine Bob Hawke sitting around on a Saturday afternoon as the races are being run at Randwick and the football is being played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground-presuming he is not at either event; I expect that he would be-listening to Barry rabbit on about science?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Prime Minister has displayed an utter contempt for the Minister for Science in the past six years, that is not about to change magically because he has a new title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me now draw the House's attention to what the coalition would do on assuming the Government benches. I will advise how science, and in particular, the CSIRO would profit under a coalition government. Under a coalition government, this country would enjoy a comprehensive strategy for the development of its science and technological potential. A coalition government would bring to an end the fragmented and ad hoc approach to public policy in respect of science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA> If one benefit has been accrued from last Monday's statement it is that the Government has finally realised that a coordinated strategy is needed for science. We cannot have the several different Government Ministers responsible for different aspects of science and technology running in different directions. When the absurdity of the very first sentence in the Minister's statement, which read that this was the first time in six years that the Minister for Science had stood before the House to deliver the Government's coordinated science policy, was pointed out to him, his lame reply was, `It's the first time I've managed to get together the five Ministers who have an influence in this area'. What sort of explanation is that? What sort of justification is that for standing for the first time with a supposed coordinated policy in his hand? Was it so difficult to bring five Ministers together? Is Cabinet not a regular occurrence? Is it not possible for the Minister for Science to bang together the heads of the Minister for Defence and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) to bring some sense to science planning and implementation in this country? Why has science been the loser for six years? Is it because of the personal antagonisms among those five Ministers, with the Prime Minister on the sidelines? Of course it is. </PARA>
<PARA> We know about the celebrated, bitter personal attack made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on the Minister for Science. I will spare the House the vulgarity of the language used but, in effect, the Minister said, `You've done nothing for this Government over the past six years except whinge. You've never argued for increased funding on a factual base. You're nothing but a liability'. Suffice it to say that, given the vitriol of his attack, the Minister had to write a personal letter of apology to the Minister for Science. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has dismissed out of hand the Minister for Science as an irrelevancy. He has taken over the policy formulation of CSIRO and has even taken unto himself most of the day to day functions of CSIRO, leaving the Minister for Science as the titular head of CSIRO only. I know from the shadow Minister for Customs, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), that the Minister for Science now has little effect, even in Customs. Everything must be cleared either through the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce-DITEC-or Senator Button's office. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret very much that the Minister for Science has been bought off so very easily with meaningless titles that give him no more weight, no more influence and no more power to argue on behalf of the science community in this country than he had over the last six years. No-one from the Government benches should come into this House and pretend that the problems of science have been meaningfully addressed. The status of the Minister for Science might have been papered over but the structural fundamental problems of CSIRO, of university research, the dilapidated equipment and this Government's failure to attract the best and brightest young people, still remain for the reasons outlined by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and me last Monday. </PARA>
<PARA> We would put an end to the Ministerial rivalries. Indeed, it is not overstating the case to say that the loser in this inter-Ministerial rivalry and bitterness that exists on the side of the Government, is of course the science community. Whilst the Ministers engage in a most self-indulgent way in their personal rivalries and animosities, science loses out. Under a coalition government, immediate and direct steps would be taken to implement a coherent science and technology strategy which would fill the vacuum left by our predecessors. Under a coalition government, CSIRO would again assume its position as the critical centre of the nation's research. It would be adequately funded and effectively administered so that all of its divisions could get on with the job of providing the base for our short and long term economic needs. Moreover, all CSIRO divisions would be adequately funded. They would be free of fears and suspicions brought on by apprehensions that their research project might not be favoured by particular Ministers. Nobody should underestimate the fear that resides within CSIRO. If one does not play favourites and does not indulge in some of the particular research programs that are likely to appeal to some of the Ministers with some influence over CSIRO one will lose out. </PARA>
<PARA> We would meet the CSIRO's current funding shortfall of $40m and supplement it to the value of a further $20m per year in line with the advice of that organisation. Under a coalition government, the CSIRO would be accountable to a committee of Ministers, who would articulate the economy's needs and lay out an agenda for that organisation which would, firstly, spell out what is to be the balance between applied and pure research. Secondly, it would lay to rest debates about the merits of industry and agricultural research, which have, at points, threatened to tear that organisation apart. </PARA>
<PARA> In what little time remains to me, I wish to address, under these Appropriation Bills some energy matters. I refer particularly to confusion within Government ranks regarding uranium. As we know, this Government has pursued a three mine policy-the three mines being Ranger and Nabarlek in the Northern Territory and Roxby Downs or Olympic Dam in South Australia. Following the fury of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) National Conference in Hobart last June, a committee was established to examine the three mine policy. It is now emerging that the divisions that ran so deep in the ALP up to that conference remain. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine some of the different positions of the senior Ministers of this Government and let those submissions to the ALP committee of review on the three mine policy speak for themselves. The Prime Minister has mooted the use of uranium as a substitute for coal fired electricity generating plants so as to diminish the greenhouse effect. He mentioned this at the time of the announcement of a new package for funding for further research efforts into the greenhouse effect which was on 6 April this year. That set the hares running and followed very much on comments made by the Chairman of the CSIRO, Mr Neville Wran, late last year, that he believed that nuclear power should be considered as an alternative to carbon dioxide producing coal-powered plants. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, defended the Prime Minister in early April when the Prime Minister floated the idea of nuclear plants. Senator Richardson's submission to the committee of review has ridiculed the current three mine policy as being purely illogical, ideological, hypocritical and a demonstrable failure. He believes, as does the Prime Minister, that nuclear powered plants would have a beneficial environmental effect, particularly so far as the greenhouse effect is concerned. He has put forward other arguments. He has argued that the ALP is out of kilter with attitudes of international socialist movements towards uranium. He also argues that more than two producing and operating mills are needed in Australia to fully employ Australia's potential so that the only limitation to expansion would be commercial viability. Obvious economic benefits, in terms of offsetting current account deficits, also form part of Senator Richardson's submission. Senator Richardson is dismissive of the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island incidents. He replies, `Look at other industry deaths, accidents and hazards'. Moreover, he concludes by saying that ideological principle overshadows reality; the reality being that Australia needs to export uranium. Moreover, the effect of locking up uranium reserves in Australia has had no influence of any kind on the expansion of the nuclear power industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button contends that one ought to get into the value-added side of the uranium market. He believes that Australia should become involved in chemical conversion applications worth about $30m a year; that is, the conversion of uranium oxide-yellowcake-to uranium hexafluoride. Uranium enrichment would add $300m to exports through metalazer technologies. He likes the idea of fabricating fuel rods in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans is somewhat circumspect about expansion of the industry on economic grounds alone, but he believes in the possibility of involvement in the uranium enrichment processes. The biggest surprise of all comes from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. He is a supposed economic rationalist who wants to deregulate the wheat market but leave alone the very highly regulated labour market. In other words the form of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is that he will do the easy thing as long as it does not affect his supposed constituency, being the trade movement in the example I have just given. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy defends the three mine policy in his submission, or in his public statements. He says that there is no immediate economic benefit from expansion. Why does he not let the market determine this? He sees nothing to be gained from involvement in the conversion and enrichment technology available as the market is in oversupply. </PARA>

<PARA> In Western Australia Premier Dowding says that the idea of building a power station would be inconceivable, given Chernobyl and Three Mile Island. He takes a different view again. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) and the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) have complained in a letter dated 5 April to the convener of this committee, Mr Ian Henderson, the ALP's assistant national secretary, that the committee was being railroaded into a pro-uranium policy, because of the tight timetable for the report at this year's end. The committee has only had 18 months; it has been in existence only since last June; and it only has to report in December this year-hopefully, the Government believes, after the early election. There is no way in the world that that committee will deliver a report before the next Federal election. This Government is likely at this stage to have an election early next year, so let us not hold our breaths for this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is now commencing a debate on six Bills: the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988, Income Tax (Fund Contributions) Bill 1988, Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988, Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1989 and Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. If these six Bills are passed in their entirety, they will introduce into the legislation of this nation some of the most profound changes ever seen by the superannuation industry and by over 3 1/2 million Australians who belong to superannuation schemes. The Bills will introduce a range of changes which, while many are necessary, the Opposition believes will have a profound and negative influence on the future direction of individual savings in this country, with particular reference to the capacity of Australians, the work force in particular, to save for their ultimate retirement so that they may in due course have a degree of financial independence which previous generations were denied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has now been nearly 12 months since the Government, in its statement of May 1988, announced these superannuation changes. Towards the end of the last session, in the dying days of the Budget period, we saw introduced into this place three Bills which the Opposition at that stage simply refused to take, because it argued then-as was certainly its right-that the people of Australia deserved the opportunity to see the entire package debated concurrently. Therefore, I am pleased to say that after so much delay and prevarication, and after government by what can only be described as press release, both the Opposition and the industry-representing, as I said, over three million Australian superannuants-now have before them these six most important Bills. The major tax measures which are the essential ingredients of this legislation will impose a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions to public and private sector superannuation funds, a further 15 per cent tax on superannuation fund income and a 16.25 per cent tax, which of course includes the Medicare levy, on lump sums over $60,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this package is to replace the 30 per cent tax introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) back in 1983. It may be recorded that at that time it was this Labor Government which did away with the old 5 per cent lump sum tax and replaced it with a very high level of lump sum tax when people took their final benefits. In an effort to get access to revenue earlier rather than spread it over about 30 years, this really brings forward the tax which otherwise would have to wait for collection until ultimate retirement. There is nothing illegal nor illogical about that-it is a legitimate thing to do. Of course, it is equally legitimate to conduct one's tax policy on the principle that one is not taxed through the period of generation of the asset but is taxed when the asset is realised. However, the Government has gone further than that: It has introduced a third element into the equation, that is the 15 per cent tax on fund income. It is that point above all else that particularly concerns the Opposition in this debate. In due course, in the committee stage, I will move a range of amendments so that the House, and the Australian people through this House, will have the opportunity to determine whether that is the right direction in which superannuation policy should go for the future of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Liberal and National parties released their policy a few months ago they made some very important commitments in the area of superannuation. At that time we stated that we were committed to a retirement income policy which gives opportunities for all Australians to plan their retirement and achieve greater self-reliance so that they may live in dignity with an adequate and secure level of income. We believe that this subject is of paramount importance, and that is because our population, like that of Western Europe and the United States, is now going through a cycle of ageing. People are living longer and they are retiring earlier. By the year 2010 it is estimated that the number of Australians over 45 years of age will be between 8.5 million and 8.7 million, or about 40 per cent of the population-a growth of 70 per cent over that period. This significant change in our demographic profile, combined with the trend to early retirement, highlights the need for a sensible, coherent and socially responsible retirement income policy which will ensure greater financial independence, self-reliance and security for all Australians as we prepare to enter the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of profound regret to members of the Opposition that, while the opportunities have been before this Government for over six years, so little has been done in a long term sense to put in place a range of policies which will achieve those obvious objectives which are of such profound importance that the Opposition believes they should meet with agreement across the political frontiers of this land. Since coming to office in 1983, this Labor Government has repeatedly chipped away at retirement income, leaving it with no comprehensive philosophy or national strategy for retirement income planning. Over the past five years, the Government has increased the tax rate on superannuation alone by nearly 1,000 per cent. Everyone knows that the Labor Government is Australia's highest peacetime taxing Government, but I wonder how many people realise what impact that taxation has had on the life savings and retirement savings of millions of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Over that period the Government also introduced no less than 20 major changes affecting retirement planning. While the purchasing power of the pension has fallen dramatically, the eligibility criteria for the age and service pensions have been changed on no less than seven occasions. Under Labor, Australia now has one of the most complex systems of occupational superannuation anywhere in the world and undoubtedly this has created massive uncertainty in the minds of contributors, beneficiaries and fund managers alike. Through the rigid application of the income and assets tests, a great many people in need have been forced off the age pension. That is why they need access to superannuation and life savings more today than perhaps at any other time since the second world war. Undoubtedly the atmosphere of this constant change created by Labor has made it virtually impossible for many Australians to plan their retirement income with any real confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that the Liberal and National parties' retirement income policy is designed to achieve the following three primary objectives: firstly, a stable and simple legislative and administrative environment in which people can plan their retirement income with confidence; secondly, greater encouragement for all Australians to plan and contribute to their retirement income with the aim of achieving universal coverage of the work force and increasing significantly the level of domestic savings; and, thirdly, ensuring that those in genuine need are protected in their old age. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of profound regret that Labor has failed those three tests. It will continue to fail unless it is prepared to support the policy approaches adopted by the coalition. Therefore, these six Bills are of profound importance. While they bring forward a number of administrative changes which are necessary and which we support, it is our profound belief that at the basis of the legislation there is a lack of political and philosophical integrity as to what the objectives of retirement income policy, and especially the interface between that policy and role of superannuation, should be all about. When the Treasurer announced the superannuation tax changes in the May 1988 statement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The taxation and superannuation benefits will be radically yet sympathetically changed, putting it on a more logical long-term basis without reducing lump sum and pension entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that one year ago and since then, almost on a monthly basis, we have seen constant changes, through press release, to the ball game. The industry has been in consternation; fund organisers have been in consternation; and investors have been in consternation. Meanwhile millions of Australian workers, frankly, do not know who to believe. Is that any wonder, when one literally does not know the basis upon which one enters into a fund and for how long that basis will remain intact? So if it could be said that there are three fundamental contradictions in the Government's policy, that is clearly the first. The next contradiction is contained in this further statement of the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA>Together these changes complete the Government's review of superannuation tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>and listen to this-</PARA>
<PARA>People can now plan their retirement with complete certainty and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government should go out and tell the three million pensioners of Australia on superannuation and people in the work force who are contributing to superannuation how real that situation is. They have no confidence because the changes which are now in place-and I will discuss them in a moment-emphasise fundamentally that without a stable legislative basis, one cannot plan with any confidence for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Where does this leave the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) and his proposed retirement income policy which we are told will be introduced to the Australian people, I hope, some time in June or early July? Will it contain further changes because, if it does not, I seriously question how it can be a retirement income policy. Clearly, it will have to contain changes, which emphasises yet again the fallacy that the Treasurer put to this House in May 1988 that people could now plan with confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is the question of tax changes, and in that respect this is what the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>They will allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money now lying in superannuation funds without diminishing any personal end benefit by one cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words should be emblazoned upon the Treasurer's forehead for the rest of his life-`one solitary cent'. He is a very brave man to make a commitment like that. It is almost as silly as saying what the tax changes are going to be 12 months before they are introduced, totally ignoring the realities of economic change over that period. But we have done our examinations of this particular commitment, and I can confidently tell the House-and I will be tabling information to emphasise this point in due course-that there are few, if any, members of superannuation schemes around Australia who will not lose 10, 12, and sometimes as high as 15-odd per cent of their end benefits because of the impact of the three tax points introduced in this legislation. `But do not worry, no one will lose one cent'. It must be true! Why? Because the Treasurer told us so, the same man who told us that inflation was going to come down, joined by his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the same man who said that everybody was going to be better off than they had been in the past, despite the realities of at least six years of diminishing income for the average Australian family. But do not worry, nobody is going to lose one cent from his or her retirement income!</PARA>
<PARA> Since that famous promise, the coalition has consistently stated that its attitude to this legislation will be predicated on two important facts: Firstly, the need for the Treasurer's promise to be met and, secondly, the need to ensure that the level of tax would not become a disincentive to superannuation savings. We made those commitments because we want this Government to be honest to the Australian people and to be responsible for the commitments it made in this House and elsewhere in the area of superannuation. Secondly, we made this commitment because we believe that in the Australia of today, which is so desperately crying out for greater domestic savings, the integrity of superannuation savings must be beyond doubt. That is why we will stand and fight to stop those millions of small Australians-not people who have a big voice in this Parliament, but ordinary workers who are simply trying to save for their future retirement and save something for future taxpayers in so doing-from being walked over yet again by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have remained consistent on these points. It is a matter of great sadness that others have not. We believe that the need for greater self-financing for retirement income to reduce the inevitable demand on present and future taxpayers should be self-evident. Following the Government's personal tax cuts announced in the April statement, it is clear that the comparative attractiveness of superannuation as a long term source for savings under Labor's new superannuation regime is no longer viable. That is particularly so for low income groups. They would do better to spend their money elsewhere, to put it in real estate or in their own domestic homes, but not in superannuation, because with the new tax scales, as against the 15 or 16.25 per cent tax levels introduced by Labor, the differential has gone. There is simply no longer a tax advantage in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> I confess that I honestly hoped that the Treasurer, in introducing his tax changes, would realise this fact and would bring into this chamber in his White Paper a statement saying, `We will now reduce the tax on superannuation to bring it into line with the new personal tax scales'. If he had done that, that would have been a step well and truly in the right direction. But the Government failed, and it failed for one fundamental reason: It is either inept or it is simply interested in collecting as much revenue as it possibly can. I leave it to the audience to choose which they like. The coalition is, therefore, determined to ensure that these new taxes do not discourage people from planning for their retirement via superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the tax on earnings, the 15 per cent income tax. Our main concern is that this tax on investment income, and the two amendments that we will move in this regard to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6), have the following effect: The critical effect in the Government's front end taxation package is meant to allow imputed tax credits to offset the nominal 15 per cent tax on fund earnings. The front end tax measure is designed to force a greater proportion of the investment assets of the superannuation industry into what the Treasurer euphemistically called the quality end of the Australian share market. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, no one in this chamber should object to the concept of encouraging investment in Australian manufacturing and other industries. Let me make that absolutely clear. But let us also face the fact that it is this Treasurer who seeks such credit on his own behalf for the fact that he deregulated the financial industry-in other words, he said to the banks, building societies and everybody else, `Go out, do your hardest, maximise the return on your investment and help your shareholders accordingly'. That is splendid stuff; we have endorsed that all the way. Yet at the same time, through this particular proposal, he is putting limitations on the capacity of the free movement of funds towards investments of quality, wherever they may be, when the objective should surely be to maximise the ultimate return. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Treasurer, superannuation funds can bring the 15 per cent nominal tax on earnings down to a lower effective rate of some 4 per cent. That was because he gave them the right to dividend imputation, which was quite sensible in that context. It meant that they could write off their taxes, that they could have tax credits elsewhere, which to some degree will be affected when the company rate comes down from 49 per cent to 39 per cent, and when those credits are used up perhaps there will be higher taxes in the future. But one thing is clear: companies which have the best portfolio balance in terms of shares which attract the full range of dividend imputation credits can significantly reduce their taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> But the system tends to fail in view of the fact that not all of us put our money into superannuation schemes until death. The vast majority of people change jobs at some stage, and when that takes place the money goes into an approved deposit fund (ADF) or into a roll-over fund. Other people do not even have to go to superannuation; they can go directly into roll-over funds. In those funds, for the most part, they do not have access to the same level of dividend imputation as is available in superannuation schemes, because the investments in those schemes, for the most part, are in longer term fixed investment-type arrangements. Consequently, the outcome is clear: From the moment one's money is taken out of a superannuation scheme one is lumbered with the full 15 per cent. There is no way it can be avoided. That is why we argue that there is a fundamental fallacy and a lack of equity in the approach to individual investments in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a wide range of reasons why superannuation funds, with the exception of large funds such as the AMP Society, do not hold a greater proportion of their assets in equities. The principal among these is that the value of shares is subject to wide and unpredictable fluctuations over time. What greater example of that did we see than the crash of 1987? Prior to the crash, funds which did not have an annual return of around 35 per cent were regarded as the tail end of the market, whereas the average fund today is lucky to make it to 15 per cent. That is a clear demonstration of the realities of the marketplace, realities which, I submit, were not taken into account by those in the Treasury or elsewhere who advised the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that this was a milch cow that had to be milked for all it was worth, ignoring the fundamental fact that if investments are taken out of superannuation not only is the capacity of individuals to have greater financial security and independence in retirement effectively reduced, but also, at that tax point, much more so than the tax on employer contributions or even a limited tax on final end income, one is maximising the administrative costs and, therefore, the costs to the individual, of going down that second tax point road. </PARA>
<PARA> What is so sad, coming from a Labor Government, is that union based superannuation funds, which are capital guaranteed, for the most part-the so-called 3 per cent productivity schemes where the contributions mainly come from employers and workers who do not have any other form of superannuation-will be the greatest losers of the very scheme that Messrs Kelty and Crean, the Treasurer and others put together and forced on the manufacturers and employers of Australia in a so-called productivity package. They did not think it out. Twelve months later they still have not had the courage to say to the millions of workers whom they want to bring into superannuation-an object which the Liberal Party and the National Party totally support, I might add-that their end benefits are being cut to ribbons because of the impact of this tax package, which is onerous and grossly unfair on that section of the superannuation market which has the least level of protection. They will have to pay the full 15 per cent tax on employer contributions across a wider base than other funds, and will be severely disadvantaged by their reduced access to the offsetting imputation credits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer made it clear in May 1988 that he wished to see ADFs and roll-over funds become a natural extension of superannuation. As I have already pointed out, the very impact of the tax, unfair as it is on superannuation schemes and their various categories on the one hand, and the way they impact upon ADFs and roll-over funds on the other hand, demonstrates clearly that while it is correct to say that they should be a natural extension of superannuation, the fact is that this policy has utterly failed in achieving that most important outcome. Therefore, as I said earlier, Labor's tax package will seriously affect simple accumulation funds, especially the 3 per cent productivity schemes, the majority of which accommodate low paid workers, the very backbone of the union structure of this country, which the Australian Labor Party has claimed for so long as its own. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition believes that the imposition of the 15 per cent fund income tax does reduce people's end benefits, not only for those in ADFs and roll-over funds, but for those in normal superannuation funds as well. As a result, it can be seen only as a fundamental disincentive to save. There are three categories of losers comprising hundreds of thousands of superannuants. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the statistics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table is self-explanatory, so I will not comment on it. It simply demonstrates quite clearly that whether we are talking about investments in fixed interest ADFs in situations where we have both employer and employee funded schemes, or where we have productivity schemes, or in the case of new members joining contributory schemes, the simple and sad fact is that in virtually all categories, everyone is a loser. So much for the Treasurer's commitment that no-one will be worse off by one cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer now to fixed interest ADFs. Individuals who have placed their accumulated retirement savings in a roll-over facility with no equities exposure will pay the full 15 per cent tax, even allowing for the Treasurer's generous transitional rules. Therefore individuals must pay substantially. For example, for individuals aged 50 at 1 July 1988 with 18 years prior service, the cumulative effect of this tax at the full 15 per cent will reduce the end benefit at age 65 by 12 per cent, and by 6 per cent if the benefit is taken at the age of 60. Even if those individuals transferred to a roll-over facility, they would still lose. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a similar situation with the loss arising out of the May 1988 package for these people, which is substantial indeed. For a 40 year old with 18 years prior service, the loss is as high as 17 per cent of end benefit for a person aged 65, based on a fund income tax rate of 10 per cent after imputation. Even if the fund income tax rate is reduced to 5 per cent, as the Treasurer claims it can be, the loss at age 65 is still 10.5 per cent. For young people who are commencing to participate in superannuation, the cumulative effect of the fund income tax over a working life will also be substantial. I give an example of this. For a 30 year old, the loss at age 65 in a non-contributory scheme, for example Labor's glorious 3 per cent productivity arrangements, will be 6.5 per cent based on a tax rate of 5 per cent, again after imputation, and 15 per cent based on a tax rate of 10 per cent. Except in those rare cases where the tax rate will be zero, every new contributor 30 years of age or less will lose out because of the fund income tax. For these reasons, we will be moving a range of amendments to this legislation which will have the purpose of removing from the Act the effects of the 15 per cent tax on dividend income, irrespective of where it falls. Furthermore, we will also be removing, as a result of that amendment, the effect of the capital gains provisions under this Act. The Liberal and National parties' policy on capital gains is well known. We will remove utterly Labor's capital gains tax and we will certainly do so in the area of superannuation. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has indicated that the coalition is concerned about the overall bias in the tax system against savings. For some time this has been a matter of great concern to us. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard statistics from the database of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The significance of this table is that ever since 1982-83, the position has been getting steadily worse, but I am pleased to see that there was some improvement in the year 1987-88. The fact is that the level of total savings as a percentage of national disposable income has fallen below 3 per cent, and that is a matter of the gravest concern to this nation, which is now so dependent on foreign investment and an accumulation of capital from the people's savings elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It cannot be stressed too highly that superannuation is the only form of saving which is specifically intended for retirement purposes, and hence has the potential to reduce the demand on the Budget. Any measures by the Government aimed at enhancing the attractiveness of savings and investment in general must ensure that superannuation retains its relative attractiveness if future governments are to have any hope of funding adequate retirement incomes for an ageing population, with the fundamental principle, which I thought was supported by this Government, that we must help to the maximum extent possible especially those most in need. As a result of all this, we are also concerned about the impact of this legislation on final end benefits. Consequently, we will be moving another amendment to lift the current threshold of $60,000 below which no final 16.25 per cent tax is required, to $125,000, which we regard as a more responsible figure, because that in fact equates with what it costs the taxpayer fully to fund a retired couple over the normal number of years in retirement. If we can encourage people to be more independent in their lives so that they can accumulate funds to give them greater financial security in retirement, we will have achieved a great success for this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of Bills-the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) and cognate Bills-introduces measures which give effect to the superannuation tax reform announced in the May 1988 economic statement. The two central elements of this package are: firstly, the bringing forward of tax from end benefits to the point at which employer superannuation contributions are made and, secondly, the introduction of a tax at a concessional rate on the investment income of superannuation funds and approved deposit funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) also includes legislation announced in the May statement to repeal a special tax treatment relating to the calculated liabilities of life insurance companies. The Bill also incorporates changes in relation to arrangements where a holding company cancels shares that are held by a subsidiary company. The Bill removes the tax exemption from the income of compliant superannuation funds that satisfies standards laid down in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. Any income accrued before 1 July 1988 will not be taxable, even if derived after 30 June. This will ensure that there is no retrospectivity in this provision. In broad terms, public sector funds are being brought within the scope of the taxation provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some discussion in the 12 months since the May statement about different aspects of the package. Some people with interests in the area have quite rightly brought forward concerns. I wish to touch on one of those concerns which has been brought forward by unions which cover people working in emergency services. They are concerned that this legislation will effectively remove proper early retirement provisions from the superannuation of those emergency service workers. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been indicated to those unions that there is an assurance that, in applying the new reasonable benefits arrangements, any benefits accrued in the emergency services superannuation scheme up to 30 June 1990 will be fully protected. To achieve those benefits the Government has requested the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to review the existing arrangements for the administration of the reasonable benefits limit. The Government has not considered the Commissioner's proposal, but the unions have been assured that the Government will support the development of arrangements so that emergency services officers are not disadvantaged by any requirement to retire early. I think that is important because it characterises the way in which the Government has entered into full consultation with those people who have concerns about some of the aspects of the proposal as outlined in May of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, like so much of Australia's economic and social infrastructure, the retirement income industry was left neglected by decades of coalition incompetence. Since 1983 the Government has embarked upon a process of review and reform. The results of the reforms speak for themselves. In 1983 the total assets held by superannuation funds amounted to some $25 billion. By March 1988 this figure had grown to $80 billion. This Government has given strong and consistent support to private retirement incomes. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has stated in the past:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first Government since Federation to recognise the right of all Australian workers to superannuation, the first to actively support its extension to areas of the work force long left forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA>That is important. Not only has there been an expansion of access to people who traditionally were involved in superannuation schemes, but the Government has set out to ensure that those at the lower end of the scale have had similar opportunities. In fact, by the end of the current parliamentary term the level of superannuation coverage is likely to have doubled-and I think that is quite an achievement for this Government. The Government is determined to get retirement incomes policy right to deal with the fact that Australia is an ageing society. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) touched on this matter and it should be indicated that last year there were about 2.5 million Australians aged 60 and over, which represented about 15 per cent of the population. It is estimated that by the year 2021 there will be about 5.3 million Australians in that age bracket, which will constitute 24 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, older Australians are not a particularly wealthy group. Nearly three-quarters of them have very modest assets. Apart from their family home, their assets amount to under $50,000; but it is important to note that in this age bracket there is a high home ownership rate-76 per cent. The income of older Australians has shown a general improvement since the early 1970s in relation to the Henderson poverty line. Fortunately, it was less likely for an older Australian to be living in poverty in 1987-88 than it was in 1972-73. Although Australia has a better projected age dependency ratio than most other major Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, we cannot afford to ignore the policy implications of an ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA> At a macro-economic level, the Economic Planning Advisory Council estimated in 1988 that, to maintain parity with a general rise in living standards, outlays on age pensions would increase from 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1985 to 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2025. This Government has undertaken the necessary research and consultation to ensure that the policy settings are in place to provide security for an ageing population. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the overall Social Security Review, recently paper No. 6 entitled Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy by Chris Foster was released. The Social Security Review highlighted the fact that comparatively few pensioners received a superannuation pension or annuity income. In 1987 it was a mere 98,000 out of a total age pensioner population of 1.3m, which represents only 7.5 per cent of that population. This reflects the fact that widespread coverage of superannuation has occurred only in the last 15 years. On page 62 of the Social Security Review paper it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The consumption of lump sums prior to age pension age remains a source of policy concern and could thwart the longer term objective of encouraging self provision for retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is providing considerable retirement income support in two forms: the age pension system and taxation concessions for superannuation. It is estimated that the annual cost of age pensions this year will be in the order of $7 billion. This is, of course, income and assets tested to ensure that it is properly targeted. On the other hand, the Social Security Review paper estimates the value of the tax concessions for superannuation at anywhere between $1.6 billion and $4 billion. Like a whole host of other taxation expenditures, it is always very difficult to get accurate figures. Other estimates have put the figure at about $3 billion. Whatever the amount, it is considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Treasury estimated that the tax exemption for employer contributions and individual contributions to approved funds amounted to $1.71 billion in 1985-86. Again in 1986 the Treasury estimated that the tax free status which applied to most forms of the income of superannuation funds amounted to a further $1.7 billion in forgone revenue. The problem with this form of taxation concession is that it is highly regressive. This problem has been in part addressed by the 1988 May statement. The exemption from taxation of superannuation contributions and investment income derived from a superannuation fund was terminated. It has been replaced by a flat rate tax of 15 per cent. Tax on the end benefits will be reduced by the same rate. Other changes, for example, to the reasonable benefits limit are designed to encourage end benefits that genuinely provide continuing retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA> Issues of fairness and equity, especially in relation to retrospectivity, have by no means been completely resolved. The flat rate tax of 15 per cent still represents a considerable concession to wealthy taxpayers who would normally be subject to the top marginal rate of taxation on employment and investment income. I have previously quoted Rick Krever, a senior lecturer in law at Monash University. Tonight I wish to quote from some of his work which appeared in the journal Impact in July 1988, where he made some comments on the effects of the May 1988 statement. In talking about the regressive aspect of the impact of taxation expenditures, Mr Krever had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The level of Government subsidy has dropped, but the upside-down effect remains untouched. Compared to the tax that would normally be levied on a taxpayer's remuneration and investment income, the new tax on contributions and fund earnings represents no concession for lowest income taxpayers, a slight concession for low income taxpayers and a massive concession for high income taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>Again he has illustrated and outlined a concern with the present arrangements. Rick Krever also pointed out in a recent issue of Australian Society:</PARA>
<PARA>The attraction of this low rate-</PARA>
<PARA>which, in particular, is the 15 per cent that is being introduced in this legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>drops with a taxpayers income, as the gap between the 15% and the marginal tax narrows. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of low income earners there is no subsidy. Krever concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>Only the rich continue to enjoy significant tax hand-outs from the concessions. </PARA>
<PARA>When I have spoken previously of the way the effects of taxation expenditures impact on superannuation, the honourable members opposite have quite unfairly suggested that by making those comments I am seeking to have a higher tax burden placed on superannuation. In putting forward my concerns and those of others, I ask that in considering these matters we fairly and squarely keep the fairness and equity points in mind and that we attempt to ensure that the effects are put in place in an equitable manner. It is unfair that, having gone through other aspects of income support and ensured that any benefit that derives from government is appropriately targeted, we should ignore in the overall review of superannuation government assistance to superannuation which is not given the same appropriate targeting. I hope that at some stage we will be mature enough to be able to have that discussion and debate. I hope that those sorts of points are not in some way misrepresented by someone saying that they are an attempt to increase the tax burden. That is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The May statement of 1988 provided that the overall effect of the superannuation measures would be neutral. That is an important aspect. It is disappointing that the Opposition cannot see its way clear to support this package of legislation. It is important that we try to rearrange the way superannuation is treated. The other important aspect-I do not think the honourable member for Bradfield, on behalf of the coalition, actually addressed these points-is that this package is an attempt to tie in the disparate aspects of income support for the aged, not only age pensions and superannuation but the general way the tax system affects both. We have to realise that. There should be much more importance placed on the effect of so-called tax expenditures-that is, tax that is foregone by special arrangements-that government puts on activities. We tend to overlook and ignore those aspects. The Department of Finance puts out a paper which is separate from the Budget related papers. Whether it be through the committee system of this Parliament or in some other way, we should be looking more closely to see that the effects of those tax expenditures do not in some way run counter to what we are trying to do in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I simply say that this is an attempt by the Government to put in place and to improve further a superannuation system that is open to a wider range of the work force. This is very important. This system will assist members of the work force to ensure that during their working lives they can make proper arrangements that will give them support in their retirement years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take part in this debate because I have had a continuing interest in the development of this country's retirement incomes policy. Sadly, since the present Government has been in office a number of significant opportunities of developing a rational retirement incomes policy have been missed. That is a very great pity. There was a time when over 80 per cent of the Australian population reaching retirement were eligible to an age pension or part age pension. We were so close to a situation where there was universal availability of that age pension that it is a tragedy that the opportunity was not taken to abolish both the income and the assets test so that all those people aged 65 and over could become entitled to a basic pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is introducing taxation legislation in respect of superannuation funds because it failed to take that opportunity. Had it done so there would then have been an automatic eligibility for Australian citizens with the appropriate residence who attained the age of 65 to receive a universal and basic pension equal to 25 per cent or thereabouts of average weekly earnings. That would have brought about a dramatic change in people's social savings, investment and working behaviour. What we find now is that everyone, as they approach retirement age, asks the question, `How will the system prejudice me if I take a certain course of action?'. They ask whether they should continue in employment. They ask themselves whether they should save and if so in what form should they save. They ask themselves whether they should run down their savings in order that they may get below the limits, whether it is the assets test limit or the incomes test limit. As a result of that, we have many thousands of Australians whose basic desire is to be self-reliant, to save for their future, saying to themselves, `I have paid my taxes; a large percentage of people are entitled to a pension so why shouldn't I be entitled to that same pension?'. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been my view that all who reach retirement age should receive, as of right, a pension. But governments have walked away from that. They have said, `Oh no, there are some few wealthy people, whether asset rich or income rich, who will get those pensions and therefore we must have a needs based system'. They do not understand that they are denying those who are totally reliant on the pension greater levels of pension benefit because people's behaviour as to earnings, savings and expenditure is changed and distorted in a way which is not in the interests of the Australian economy. We find that people spend their money overseas so that they will, like those who have spent their money during their working lives, enjoy the benefit of a government pension. We find that they invest their money in their houses because their houses are exempt from the assets test and capital gains tax when we want that investment put in the development of Australia's taxable and income earning capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> In this legislation people are being encouraged to take out superannuation. It is very pleasing to note that as a result of a changed view about superannuation savings an increasing number of people in the Australian work force are becoming members of or contributors to superannuation funds. The pity is that too many of them are receiving benefits that are contributed only by their employers, because they are not encouraged to contribute or pay for themselves. The reason for that is that the tax system is not a level system. It is to the advantage of an employer to pay the contribution and get the tax deduction for making the payment rather than to pay additional wages to an employee, who then in most circumstances is required to pay into a superannuation scheme out of after-tax income, without any tax benefit. I think that is a crazy system. I think also that it is most unfortunate that now in this legislation the contributions going into the superannuation funds are to be taxed in the hands of the superannuation funds when received. More unfortunate is the fact that then the income of the superannuation fund is to be taxed, and it is unfortunate again that the taxation of any lump sum payments is still to be continued, albeit at a lower rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The major issues of this retirement incomes policy have not yet been faced up to. We will not get individual and family retirement income self-reliance until contributions are made by or on behalf of employees to their superannuation funds at a rate not less than 10 per cent of the income of those employees. Indeed, for lower paid workers it should probably be at a rate not less than an amount equal to 10 per cent of average weekly earnings per annum during their working lives. Only in that way will we reach a situation where retirement savings-whether they have come as a consequence of payments made by employers into superannuation funds on behalf of their employees or as a result of the employees making payments direct, or a combination of both-comprise a sufficient fund to provide a person at the end of a normal working life with a pension which is at least equal to pensions now being paid, from tax revenue, under the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be much better for Australia if this were handled by the private sector, with a safety net for those people who had not made such a provision. I believe there should be a universal safety net, with everyone entitled to a basic pension. People may well ask how that can be done. Everyone should be entitled to a basic pension, in one of two forms, but not both. One form is through social security payments, and the other is through the tax sheltering of superannuation funds. Notwithstanding the introduction of the superannuation contribution tax, the superannuation fund income tax and the tax on lump sum payments, there is still a significant level of tax sheltering available through saving in superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that that should be quantified. Everyone in the work force should be entitled either to those tax concessions or to a pension-but not both. I think there should be a ceiling on the extent of the tax concessions that are available. That should be on the basis of a universal flat rate retirement income provision. Also, the provision calculated on an earnings related basis should be in relation to after-tax income. It should be a matter of choice on the part of the employee as to whether he wants to have an income related retirement benefit or whether he is satisfied with a flat rate basic minimum. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the case with the legislation that we are considering here. This legislation is just a revenue collecting measure. It does not provide for a mechanism to bring fairness into our retirement income system. Honourable members opposite talk about the people who will benefit from a universal pension at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, the wealthy people of the land, and they say that those people should not get those pensions, but what are they allowing to continue? They allow those very same people-including ourselves as members of parliament-to receive huge tax free benefits, earnings related, to provide themselves with a very substantial retirement income, out of a tax sheltered savings mechanism. If the Government wants to have a rational retirement incomes policy in Australia, it should limit the amount of tax concession available to all. Whether it is through employer payments or through employee payments, it should be limited to the capital cost of purchasing a flat rate age pension of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to read in the publication put out by the stock exchanges that these days one can buy immediate annuities. For $50,000, which is about twice average weekly earnings, a 65-year-old man can purchase from the AMP Society a flat rate annuity of $7,754, to be paid for the balance of his life. If he wanted an indexed pension, he would have to take a lower amount. The interesting thing is that an accumulation equal to about twice average weekly earnings-and maybe a bit higher-will purchase an indexed pension equivalent to the present age pension. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that for a person who reaches 65 and who has made no provision, the Government, through the tax system is, in effect, giving that person $50,000, but in a pension form, over the balance of his or her life. That should be the limit of the amount that is provided through tax concessions to those who are saving for their retirement. For the rest of us, if we want benefits beyond the flat rate pension, which the Government has a responsibility of ensuring is available to everyone, that should be provided for out of our after-tax income. If we developed that model we could then have a tax system under which top marginal rates would be much lower than they are today and the general underlying flat rate of the tax system would also be much lower than it is today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe that should pay the same rate as any other investment would pay. What I am saying is that the total extent of the tax concession to a superannuation fund saver should be limited over his or her lifetime to the capital value of the pension, which is the guaranteed minimum pension that should be available universally to the whole community. Beyond that level, if anyone wants a higher level, we should be able, out of our after-tax income, which would generally be income that is taxed at much lower rates, to save for ourselves according to our own choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point I want to make now-and because time is limited I will have to develop this point on some later occasion-is that I think there should be a much greater freedom for people to make provision for their own retirement. People should not be forced, in an almost compulsory unionism sort of way, to save through the AMP Society, the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd, approved deposit fund, building unions superannuation or BUS scheme, the union controlled schemes, the joint employer-employee schemes, or whatever it might be. They are fine, and everyone should have the choice of going into those funds if they want to do so, but, equally, people should have the choice of saving for themselves. I might be a young person aged 25 being told that 3 per cent of my income must go into a superannuation scheme, and I might then find that I do not have enough money left to save for my own home. I believe that in those circumstances I should be able to put that 3 per cent of income into my home-with the only requirement that I would have to guarantee that, because I have put that money into my own home, I will not call upon the social security system when I turn 65. There are legal methods whereby adequate security could be provided to guarantee that that saving would be available ultimately for one's retirement and that one would not be able to double dip in the system. It is a great pity that the present Government has not taken the opportunity with this legislation to introduce a major reform of the retirement incomes system. It has been left for a future Liberal government to provide for a universal system which encourages self-reliance and which maximises freedom of choice for retirees. This legislation before us at the moment penalises and punishes many of those people who want to save and achieve retirement security. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I bring before the House a Bill to enact a number of changes to improve a range of human services provided through the community services and health portfolio. The most significant changes involve the implementation of the first stage of the new general practitioner (GP) fees package as agreed between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), and new private health insurance arrangements with are designed to maximise the security and protection of the insured aged. </PARA>
<PARA> The new GP arrangements are the most far reaching advances which have ever been achieved in general practice in this country and are consistent with advances occurring in many similar Western nations. The new arrangements will promote better quality patient care, resulting in improved treatment and assessment outcomes through the provision of incentives to GPs to take part in continuing medical education and quality assurance programs. Private health insurance arrangements are to be changed to protect the elderly and share the insurance risk of Australia's ageing population fairly among all private health insurance funds. The changes will lead to increased stability within the private health sector, advantaging the majority of health fund contributors in the short term and the entire private health care industry in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes strengthening of the confidentiality provisions of the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987. It introduces a new pathology services table and changes the arrangements for future alterations to the table. The Bill establishes a Private Health Insurance Administration Council to take over many of the health insurance functions currently performed by the Department of Community Services and Health. It introduces new health benefit arrangements to encourage greater use of day surgery, and establishes differential day only benefits based on the different types of treatments provided. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment will enable an independent person or body to apply for the classification of residents in nursing homes where the proprietor has frequently misclassified residents. The Bill provides for transitional funding arrangements for 38 nursing homes for disabled persons still covered under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 until that Act ceases to operate after 30 June 1992. Finally, there is a minor amendment in relation to the transfer of nurse education to the higher education sector and the dates of collection of higher education census data. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 of the Bill provides for amendments to the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987 to impose more stringent controls on release of information by the Institute, preventing the disclosure of information, other than to the Minister, contrary to the conditions under which it was supplied to the Institute. The amendments recognise the concerns of States and Territories to ensure adequate safeguards of confidentiality of data which may be supplied by States and Territories to the Institute. In particular, the minor amendment to paragraph 29 (4) (b), which ensures that an information provider includes a State or Territory as a body politic and, therefore, gives that State or Territory power to set terms and conditions for the release or publication of the information it provided to the Institute, represents an agreed response to these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in part 3 of the Bill relate to an agreement between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners on a package of measures designed to improve the quality and cost effectiveness of medical services provided by general practitioners. The package provides a number of interrelated measures to provide incentives for general practitioners to strive to improve the quality of care. These measures are: a vocational register of general practitioners; the requirement that for general practitioners to remain on the register they undertake continuing medical education and quality assurance programs accredited by the RACGP; the introduction of new items into the Medicare benefits schedule for consultations by vocationally registered general practitioners; the new items to attract higher fees than those currently available to general practitioners and to be generally based on both complexity of the service provided and the time taken; and the introduction of improved audit and monitoring arrangements, involving an independent professional organisation, for services provided by vocationally registered general practitioners, which will extend to examining, referral and prescribing patterns and the ordering of diagnostic tests. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes provision for the establishment of the vocational register which will enable the new items to be introduced from 1 August 1989 by regulations. Existing items for general practitioner services will remain for use by other doctors providing primary medical care. The Government intends to introduce further legislation in the Budget session to permit the establishment of the improved audit and monitoring arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed register will be maintained by the Health Insurance Commission. The Bill provides that the Commission shall register a medical practitioner who has been certified by the RACGP-or other body as determined by the Minister-as practising predominantly in general practice and as having appropriate training and experience in general practice or who is otherwise eligible in accordance with the regulations. Enrolment on the register will be voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing a practitioner's medical practice, the RACGP will have regard to whether the practitioner provides a comprehensive primary medical service, including treating a wide range of patients and conditions using a variety of accepted medical skills and techniques, providing services away from the practitioner's surgery on request-for example, home visits-and making appropriate provision for the practitioner's patients to have access to after hours medical care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted that fellowship of the RACGP, or an equivalent postgraduate qualification in general practice, should ultimately be the only experience and training which make it appropriate for a practitioner to be placed on the vocational register. This will apply from 1995. However, to protect doctors already engaged in general practice, other qualifications and training will be accepted in the meantime, including membership of the RACGP, a certificate of satisfactory completion of the family medicine program, or five years experience in general practice. This will ensure that doctors who are currently in practice will be able to qualify for vocational registration on the basis of experience before the tighter requirement comes into effect in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress that any medical practitioner whose practice has been predominantly in general practice as defined for five years-whether full time or part time-will be eligible. The RACGP has defined part time practice as a minimum of two sessions a week, which I regard as a generous provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has been involved in a campaign of misinformation, with its claims that part time GPs, the majority of whom are women, will not be eligible to register, when a simple inquiry would have revealed that this was patently false. Likewise, doctors who work in sports medicine, student health clinics, women's health clinics, and family planning clinics-other areas targeted by the AMA-will be assessed on an individual basis against the eligibility criteria. It has been the aim of the Government and the RACGP to include as many GPs as possible within the eligibility criteria-not to exclude them. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take issue with the AMA's attempts to depict the new arrangements as in some way discriminating or disadvantaging those doctors who are found to be ineligible. Rather, the reverse is true in that the arrangements will reward those GPs who are prepared to improve their skills by taking part in continuing medical education and quality assurance programs. Certainly not all doctors will be eligible, but neither should they be if they are not prepared to meet those requirements. What the Government and the RACGP are in effect seeking are changes in work practices which result in increased productivity in general practice through an improvement in the quality of patient care. The Bill also makes provision for a doctor's name to be removed from the register in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals provide an active role for the relevant professional body, the RACGP, in ensuring the quality of general practice in Australia. It conforms with the role of other specialist medical colleges as the arbiters of professional standards in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The RACGP will provide a review mechanism for its decisions relating to vocational registration, including independent arbitration, to ensure that its assessment processes are fair for all doctors. An independent arbitrator who is acceptable to both the aggrieved doctor and the RACGP will perform this function. Should such processes present difficulties, there are provisions in the Bill to enable registration to be done by other means and another body to be substituted for the RACGP. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the general public to be able to find out from the commission the names of medical practitioners on the register and for the Commission to make information about the register available to the RACGP. These provisions will assist the public to make informed choices about medical care and will facilitate the RACGP's role in registration and removal from registration. The Government and the RACGP are jointly developing a program to better educate and inform the medical profession and the public about the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together with the proposal for monitoring arrangements, these proposals will create a climate for improved patient care at the primary level, a more professional approach to general practice, and improved public accountability for the $1.4 billion in Medicare benefits which go to underwriting the costs of general practitioners' services. </PARA>
<PARA> In the longer term, the Government expects general practitioners to be more willing to care for more complex conditions within their competence and to be more discriminating in their use of specialist referrals, prescribing and diagnostic tests. This should lead to reduced costs in the secondary and tertiary sectors and overall a much more effective use of health resources. I am confident that this package will have the overwhelming support of the majority of general practitioners, and of the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill also includes new provisions for variations and alterations to the pathology services table. As a result of findings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts report No. 236, entitled Medical Fraud and Overservicing-Pathology, a new statutory body-the Pathology Services Advisory Committee (PSAC)-was created to review pathology items and fee levels and related matters and to make recommendations to the Minister for Community Services and Health on such matters. The framework of PSAC was designed to bring about a more appropriate level of financing of pathology services which would adequately compensate the industry, while at the same time removing the potential which had been identified by the PAC report for abuse and overservicing. PSAC made its first recommendation, which the Government accepted, for an increase in fees of 6.62 per cent to all pathology services, to take effect from 1 December 1987. In July 1988, PSAC recommended a new pathology services table (PST) aimed at rectifying most of the major concerns raised by the Public Accounts Committee. This new table came into effect on 1 November 1988. However, following a challenge in the Federal Court, the new table was ruled to be void and benefits reverted to the 1 December 1987 PST. </PARA>
<PARA> I should stress that the Federal Court ruling on the November 1988 table was not made on any inherent structural deficiency in the pathology table put on the basis that PSAC, in making its recommendation, had not followed parts of the principles determined for the performance of its functions. Subsequent legal opinion was that PSAC's previous recommendations to me were also void, because PSAC had followed a similar approach in regard to the principles that had applied to the 1988 table. Payment of Medicare benefits for pathology services therefore had to revert to the table in effect prior to PSAC's establishment, that is, the August 1986 pathology table. This table against which Medicare benefits are currently being paid has all the deficiencies identified by the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Late in 1988, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia (RCPA) withdrew its nominees from PSAC, rendering the Committee inoperative. In effect, under the existing legislation, this means that the pathology table cannot be amended. The Government therefore has no option but to introduce this amending legislation so the pathology table can be varied when necessary. This legislation proposes that those provisions in the Health Insurance Act relating to the pathology services table and PSAC mechanisms be repealed and replaced with a structure which allows the Minister for Community Services and Health to determine an appropriate table which is then prescribed by regulation. This is a similar mechanism which is in place, and has been in place for many years, in respect of the general medical services table. The new table is based broadly on the 1988 table recommended by PSAC, but with modifications to reflect some of the concerns raised by the profession. While it simplifies the existing table, taking into account advances in technology which have occurred since the last major restructuring of the pathology services table in 1977, and reduces the overall number of items, it also eases some of the restrictions contained in the 1988 table in relation to the availability of some tests. The Government is confident that the new table will promote good medical practice and reduce the potential for abuses, and believes it essential for it to be put in place to allow for a more appropriate level of Medicare benefits for patients compared to the existing table. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record my appreciation of the considerable input made by the pathology industry through the Australian Association of Pathology Practices (AAPP) in the development of the new PST which is appended to the draft Bill. AAPP gave freely of its time and expertise throughout this process and I am pleased that agreement has been reached on the structure of the new table and the description of individual items within it. I am confident that the continuation of this consultative process in relation to matters concerning the pathology services table will be of benefit to Government, pathologists and patients. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 of the Bill seeks to make two main changes which affect people with private health insurance, firstly, in relation to revised reinsurance arrangements which will commence from 1 June 1989 and, secondly, in relation to the establishment and functions of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. The reinsurance account arrangements form an integral part of community rating, which has always applied to the health insurance arrangements in Australia and has an important social welfare role. This principle provides that all people are treated equally for health insurance purposes, regardless of age, medical history or family size. The alternative is a risk rated system where the young and healthy would pay lower premiums but the aged, the chronically ill and people with large families would find the cost of insurance prohibitive. They would pay far more than they do currently. The reinsurance arrangements provide a mechanism for part of the benefits liability for heavy claiming contributors to be shared between funds on an equitable basis. The current system, which has remained largely unchanged since 1978, involves sharing the benefits liability at the basic table rate for any days in excess of 35 per contributor unit in a 12 month period. The effect of this system is that funds with a higher than average reinsurance claims experience are subsidised by funds with a lower than average experience. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of concerns that the current arrangements were not adequately reflecting the varying experience of funds with a disproportionate share of heavy drawing contributors, a detailed review was conducted. That review showed that benefits paid out to the 65 and over age group amounted to about one-third of total hospital benefits, although the group represented only about 15 per cent of the total insured population. Moreover, there was a significant disparity between funds in the liability for these benefits, some 70 per cent of which related to hospitalisation under 35 days in a year and were thus not included in the current reinsurance arrangements. It also became apparent that total hospital experience, as opposed to basic table only, would be a more appropriate basis for reinsurance as some 83 per cent of all those insured have supplementary cover. In addition, basic table cover is being increasingly aligned with public hospital experience and thus increasingly is out of step with benefits paid for private hospital services. </PARA>
<PARA> After extensive consultation with the private health care sector, preference was given to a reinsurance system that covered the total hospital experience of the 65 and over age group as well as total hospital experience over 35 days for the under 65s. The proposed new arrangements therefore provide a much fairer basis for reinsurance and specifically recognise those people, that is, the aged and chronically ill, who are the heaviest users of hospital services. These changes will provide greatest assistance to those long established non-profit funds with a disproportionately high share of aged and chronically ill members. Where possible, the Government will be looking to those funds to reduce their contribution rates or forgo planned future increases. Some funds, particularly the small new for-profit funds and the closed funds with restricted membership, and which have a better than average claims experience related to age profile, will, of course, face an increased liability, which is the very nature of reinsurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these funds have enjoyed a privileged position within the health insurance market, either because they are relatively new or because they have been able to be more selective of their members. The Government has decided that this unfair competitive advantage should not be maintained at the expense of the majority of contributors and that there should be a more even playing field between funds. The extent to which these changes will need to be reflected in contribution rates will vary from fund to fund, depending on factors such as the profitability of current contribution rates and the level of accumulated reserves. Many of those funds with an increased liability already possess substantial reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, the Government will be making a one-off contribution to reinsurance of $20m this financial year to minimise the effect of the new arrangements. This money will be disbursed over the next eighteen months to December 1990 so as to cushion the impact of the reinsurance changes on those funds most heavily affected. Apart from this one-off contribution, there will be no further Commonwealth contribution to reinsurance. This combination of factors will mean that any increases in contribution rates as a direct cause of the new arrangements will be minimal. It should be noted that, although the changes will increase the reinsurance pool from $200m to more than $600m a year, this will result in a redistribution of only an estimated $70m, as compared to $29m under the current arrangements. This represents less than 5 per cent out of total hospital benefits of $1.54 billion. Thus, while these new arrangements will provide for a greater sharing of risk and therefore greater stability within the industry, there will still be ample scope for competition and cost efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> As a further incentive for funds to seek to expand their memberships, newly insured members-not including those who transfer between funds-will be excluded from the reinsurance count for the first year of their membership, although their claims will be included in the reinsurance pool assessments. The new arrangements remove the disincentive to insure people aged over 65. They also provide a positive incentive for funds to offer better supplementary benefits and therefore will encourage the use of private hospitals-a fact which the Australian Private Hospitals Association attempts to gloss over. The supplementary benefits, which will be acceptable for reinsurance purposes, will be defined by ministerial determination. By providing for a greater sharing between health funds of the cost of caring for the aged and the chronically ill, the Government is underwriting its commitment to community rating-a commitment which to date has been shared by those opposite and which I would hope they would continue to share, as community rating works to the benefit of the aged, the chronically ill, and large families. </PARA>
<PARA> Much needless anxiety has been generated in recent times by hysterical claims about a supposed crisis in the private health care industry, yet an analysis of the facts shows that this is simply not the case. Over the past four years, the private health sector has remained relatively stable, with only small variations overall in both the levels of private health insurance coverage and in private hospital utilisation. Indeed, despite what some prophets of doom have claimed, the number of people with private hospital cover has grown by more than one million in that period. I have always maintained that Medicare's continued success and high popularity is dependent upon the maintenance of a strong, viable private health care sector. The Government recognises that there are particular pressure points within the private health care market and indeed these changes are designed to alleviate some of those pressures. However, they are not intended to solve every problem besetting the private health care market as some would wish. It is not the Government's responsibility to maintain the viability of every private hospital bed in Australia. That would simply better sustain an inefficient private system at public expense. Nor is it the Government's responsibility to compel or encourage people to take out private health insurance. Under Medicare, all Australians are covered for essential medical and hospital treatment and then have the freedom to choose whether to take out additional private cover. </PARA>
<PARA> With this initiative, the Government is ensuring increased stability for health fund contributors and a more even playing field for the private health funds-it is now up to the private health funds, private hospitals, and private doctors to make the private health care market work. For example, if private funds and private hospitals cannot agree to closely align their charges and benefits, and if private hospitals will not observe the step down periods, so that patients are left substantially out of pocket even after paying top table insurance, then quite naturally they will question whether they should retain their private cover or go to private hospitals. But these are problems which only the industry can resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides for the devolution to an industry body of certain private health insurance functions currently carried out by the Department of Community Services and Health. This proposal accords with the Government's Budget strategy to reduce the size of the public sector and its policy of reducing the degree of regulation in the private sector. The industry body is to be known as the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. It will be under the control of an independent Commissioner, who shall have four advisers-three representing the health insurance industry with the remaining adviser also being independent. Members of the Council will be appointed in accordance with guidelines which will be developed in consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The main functions of the Council will be to:</PARA>
<PARA>administer the reinsurance arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA>monitor the financial performance of health funds to ensure viability and to make recommendations as to the action to be taken where a fund's experience declines;</PARA>
<PARA>collect and disseminate financial and statistical data, including an annual report for tabling in Parliament, on health funds' operations; and</PARA>
<PARA>administer the funding arrangements for the operation of acute care advisory committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to allow individuals to seek an injunction from the Federal Court against an organisation that appears to be acting in breach of section 67 of the National Health Act. This section was primarily designed to ensure that health insurance business could only be offered by registered health benefits organisations in accordance with community rating. Section 67 has, in the interpretation of `health insurance business' versus `accident and sickness insurance business', generated a substantial number of legal challenges which have proven to be both complex and time consuming. Departmental resources will no longer be available to be devoted to the resolution of these disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that organisations may register as a health benefits organisation on a national basis rather than a State basis as at present. However, organisations will still need to conduct a separate fund for each State in which they have approval to operate. Also, they will still need to seek approval to transfer reserves between States as a safeguard against predatory pricing to increase their membership size. The repeal of section 73baa of the National Health Act which controls diversification activities by registered organisations is merely in keeping with decreasing unnecessary regulation. The Bill also provides for tighter solvency requirements for health funds, similar to the requirements for general insurers provided under the Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Organisations will be required, nationally, to maintain the greater part of $1m-with provision to prescribe a higher amount to maintain monetary value because of the effect of inflation-or two months contribution income. Provision is included to exempt funds from this requirement-for example, for small funds which would have to cease business if forced to carry reserves of $1m. Where exemptions are sought by existing organisations, they will need to produce satisfactory actuarial and other evidence to demonstrate their viability. No exemption will apply, however, to a new organisation seeking registration. These more stringent requirements are considered imperative as a safeguard against a fund collapsing, particularly in this increasingly `de-regulated' environment. However, in the unlikely event of a collapse, two measures are proposed to protect the interests of contributors. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council will be empowered to impose a levy on health funds for the purposes of meeting any outstanding claims for benefits of the collapsed fund. Secondly, the Bill proposes an expansion of a condition of registration on funds to accept former contributors of a collapsed fund with full continuity of benefits entitlements. The changes proposed to section 78 of the National Health Act are designed to simplify the processing of changes in health fund rules and complement the reduction in departmental staff resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the changes in clause 48 of the Bill is to facilitate mergers between registered health benefits organisations located in different States. Currently, mergers can take place only between organisations in the same State. This amendment is consistent with that contained in clause 28 to provide for national registration of organisations. Clause 51 makes provision to prescribe by national health regulation a specific modification to the operation of the basic private table. The purpose of this amendment is to allow for a health fund to seek ministerial approval for self-funded pilot or demonstration schemes to advance private health insurance. As part of the devolution process, provision is made for a rationalisation of the acute care advisory committee review process and hands over responsibility for the administration and financing of the process to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. However, the purpose of the review process, namely to adjudicate on whether certain long term patients in hospitals are acute care patients or nursing home type patients, remains unaffected, as will the medical basis for that adjudication. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 is designed to close a loophole whereby `gap' type medical benefits can be paid when not related to the actual loss sustained in meeting medical expenses. This practice is contrary to the Government's policy of prohibiting certain medical insurance, as intended by section 126 of the Health Insurance Act. In clauses 20, 21 and 22, changes are proposed to remove anomalies in the current day hospital arrangements, as well as to encourage day-only admissions in lieu of overnight in-patient hospital stays, for a range of surgical operations and medical procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience suggests that up to 40 per cent of surgical procedures can be safely undertaken on a day-only basis. The amendments proposed should ultimately achieve a similar result for Australia, which will:</PARA>
<PARA>be more convenient for patients;</PARA>
<PARA>assist in reducing public hospital waiting times;</PARA>
<PARA>reduce hospital costs; and</PARA>
<PARA>contain health fund premiums. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposals allow for the identification of a range of largely surgical procedures considered suitable for day-only admissions to either hospitals or licensed free-standing day surgery centres. These procedures will, where the patient is privately insured, qualify for a day-only basic table benefit rather than a full in-patient hospital benefit unless the patient's doctor certifies that an overnight admission was warranted because of medical, social or environmental reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> As an adjunct, in recognition of the varying levels of complexity of procedures which can be carried out on a day-only basis, a grouping of the procedures will be undertaken to which a differential scale of basic insurance benefits will apply. The present arrangement of a flat rate benefit does not recognise the differing costs and complexities of individual procedures. These changes are designed further to promote day surgery in line with the special funding being provided to the States and Territories under the new Medicare agreement incentive package arrangements which provide specific grants for the development and improvement of day surgery in the public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the National Health Act to introduce provisions designed to prevent abuse of the resident classification system in nursing homes. Under current arrangements nursing home proprietors are able to abuse the resident classification system by providing information leading to the classification of residents at unjustifiable levels, thereby obtaining excess benefits. These amendments enable the Secretary of the Department of Community Services and Health to determine that an independent person or body should apply for the classification of residents in cases of flagrant and frequently provided inaccurate information leading to the classification of residents at levels which have not been sustained at review. A nursing home proprietor will have the right to request a review by the Minister of the Secretary's determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also facilitates the phased transfer of all nursing homes for disabled persons from the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 to the Disability Services Act 1986, which provides access for people with disabilities to a more appropriate and extensive range of services. Honourable members would be aware that all aged persons nursing homes previously covered by the Nursing Homes Assistance Act have been transferred to the National Health Act. The Nursing Homes Assistance Act now covers only 38 nursing homes for disabled persons, with the further 20 nursing homes for disabled persons covered by the National Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention that all nursing homes for disabled persons should be brought under the Disability Services Act by 30 June 1992. All of these homes were advised of this in May 1988. Eight have transferred and a number of others have indicated their intention of doing so. The nursing homes have also been advised that, once they transfer under the Disability Services Act, additional funding, as necessary, will be made available to enable them to deliver a less restrictive range of services to people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's view that the nursing home model does not provide the most appropriate, least restrictive, accommodation for people with disabilities, the Bill introduces a sunset clause to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act to provide that the Act will cease to operate after 30 June 1992 and provides that no approvals will be given for new nursing homes under this Act. This brings services funded under the Act in line with those services formerly funded under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974, which are already required to have transferred to section 10 status under the Disability Services Act by that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the definition of `nursing home care' by including a specific reference to `personal care' which is defined as `assistance of a personal nature given to help a person attend to his or her daily needs or carry out his or her daily routine'. This recognises that many people with disabilities are in nursing homes because they have high personal care needs, not because they require the medical model of nursing care provided in such homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks to establish an indexed upper limit on the level of funding that can be provided to nursing homes that choose to remain under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act. The Bill therefore provides for the continuation of the previous deficit financing arrangements, with the proviso that the level of ordinary expenditure per occupied bed in 1988-89 can be increased only in accordance with an approved level of indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the proposed simple amendment to the States Grants (Nurse Education Transfer Assistance) Act 1985 is consequent upon a change introduced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to collect census data on students enrolled in higher education courses on 31 March and 31 August rather than 30 April and 30 September. The census data is used to check, for payments purposes, that the planned numbers of students are actually enrolled. Any future amendments to the key dates for collection, or other matters required or permitted by the Act to be prescribed, may be made by regulation of the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Australian Institute of Health Act have no financial impact on government outlays. The financial impact of the new GP fee arrangements will be announced separately as part of the Government's statement on Medicare fee increases for 1989-90. The revised pathology services table arrangements will result in a saving of $45m on the Forward Estimates for 1989-90 and 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be providing a one-off payment of $20m to the Reinsurance Trust Fund in this financial year but will remove its $1m annual contribution from 1989-90. The effect on the consumer price index of the full impact of the reinsurance changes as reflected in contribution rates will be nil. An amount of $300,000 will be provided over three years to assist with the establishment costs of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. All other expenses will be borne by the industry, with the Council having the power to impose levies to meet the costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act are expected to provide moderate savings in the order of $1m a year, although this will be offset by the requirement for additional funds to assist nursing homes for disabled persons to make the transition to the models of service delivery required under the Disability Services Act. I now present the explanatory memorandum for this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) and cognate Bills give effect to the May 1988 economic statement on superannuation tax reform. It has been introduced in two stages. The first, in November last year, legislated for the introduction of a 15 per cent tax on superannuation contributions and earnings. The second, which was introduced last week, provides for compensating reduction in the tax rates on end benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been three speakers in the debate so far. I suppose the most interesting speech was that of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) who, in a somewhat tortuous treatise, started attacking the assets test and the incomes test. He put the view very strongly that we should revert to the situation that previously existed where millionaires and anybody else could be in receipt of the pension. I doubt very much that this will be part of the new Peacock economic push but, as with the Foreign Investment Review Board, the honourable member for Sturt seems to be slightly out of step there with the rest of his Party. He suggested that there should be a universal benefit of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and, beyond that, choice for those who wished to supplement their retirement income with further superannuation. He did not suggest for a moment how it should be set up or how people could be conscripted to such a scheme. Indeed, the whole idea seemed rather anachronistic. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Sturt did say that many opportunities have been missed by this Government. When one looks at the history of this Government, one finds that rather absurd comment particularly galling. When the Hawke Government come into office after 30 years out of 33 of conservative rule in this country, what sort of retirement income policy did we have? We found ourselves with a massive deficit of $10 billion in the domestic framework and a tax framework which was structured like a piece of Swiss cheese. One could drive holes through the tax system in all sorts of areas. Indeed, in the area of superannuation, there were fantastic concessions available to those who were able to take advantage of them, particularly those who were very fortunate. Only four in 10 Australians had access to superannuation at that time. Indeed, it was a lamentable picture. </PARA>
<PARA> So we set about rectifying the tax system. As part of that rectification of the tax system, we introduced a lump sum tax on superannuation benefits. That was a very difficult decision for the Government to make. It is never a popular thing to do. But it was part of a whole structure that made the tax system fairer. We looked at introducing the fringe benefits tax, clamped down on entertainment expenses and tax rorts that were involved there, and introduced the prescribed payments tax and the capital gains tax to remove many of the distortions which existed in the system. Not only did we do that, but also we improved incentive for people. The top rate of tax by the end of this year will be 47c in the dollar, whereas previously it had been 60c in the dollar. The bottom rate for those in that framework will now be 21c in the dollar whereas previously it was 29c or 30c in the dollar. We introduced the tax file number system and we introduced substantiation and self-assessment. Very significantly, business imputation removed the double taxation on dividends and distortions in investment. It is this element that gave effect to the moves that we are able to make towards superannuation in this legislation. Fully franked dividends of the superannuation funds will be available to balance against the tax on contributions and earnings that allows these new initiatives to function. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members do not believe what I say about tax and the inequities and the lethargy of the previous government, I might mention something that occurred earlier this week. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which was privileged to have before it Mr Mark Liebler, senior partner in the legal firm of Arnold, Bloch, Liebler and Deputy Chairman of the Taxation Committee of the Law Council of Australia. We asked Mr Liebler about the sorts of practices which were involved and the sorts of practices that tax planners became involved with in the late 1970s and 1980s. He said, unequivocally, that the reason that many tax planners got involved in paper schemes and bottom of the harbour schemes was that the Liberal Government of the day was tardy in its action against those schemes and, indeed, the Commissioner of Taxation and the Government at the time allowed those things to occur. So honourable members do not have to take my word for it. What we inherited was a tax structure which was unfair and inefficient and through which one could figuratively, drive a truck when one looks at the number of opportunities there were for people to take advantage of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about superannuation-and principally that is what this legislation is about-we talk about ordinary people being able to save enough money for retirement. We talk about people being able to earn sufficient so that they are better off than on the pension. Some will be able to accrue only a small amount over a period, but others will take the choice and have the opportunity to accrue larger amounts for their retirement and will provide themselves with an opportunity to be comfortable in that retirement. Unlike the Opposition, we have done something about it. The record speaks for itself. There are two statistics which stand out. When we came into government four out of 10 Australian workers had access to and were involved in superannuation schemes. Now, five years later, eight out of 10 Australians are in that position. There has been a doubling of the number of Australian workers who have access to superannuation and thereby are able to plan for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The second very significant figure is that, if one looks at total assets of superannuation funds, one finds that five years ago there was $25 billion and that there has been a significant increase to $80 billion now-more than a two-fold increase. It is hard to suggest, as the Opposition does, that the moves that this Government has made, the legislation it has introduced, is in some way anti-retirement income and in some way anti-superannuation. The whole tax system is fairer. We have closed off those areas where there was leakage and we have provided incentives for those people who were in a position to take advantage of long term benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who led the debate for the Opposition, was correct when he said that Australia's population is becoming older. Indeed, it is necessary for us to plan for the ageing of our population. It is necessary for people in that situation to plan for their own self-reliance, security and independence during that time. That is what we have done, and that is what this legislation gives effect to. There was a massive haemorrhaging of revenue previously through superannuation concessions. That has been brought under control whilst still allowing an incentive for people to take advantage of the concessions available. </PARA>
<PARA> What argument did the Opposition produce? The honourable member for Bradfield said that there were two principle concerns that the Opposition thought were the principle reasons why it should oppose this legislation. The first was that in fact within the structure of this legislation-I admit that it is a complicated piece of legislation-there would be many people who would find that their end benefits were affected. In the May 1988 statement the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said that there would be many whose end benefits would increase, but none who would be disadvantaged by these moves. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield suggested that hundreds of thousands of Australians would find themselves in that position. I have looked very closely at it, and it appears that theoretically it is possible that some people may find their end benefits affected, but it would take unusually bad management of the fund and a refusal on the part of the management of the fund to take action as to what is the most appropriate investment course. Indeed, it would mean that the managers of that fund would have to refuse to take advantage of fully franked dividends from investments in Australian companies, which is something we are trying to encourage. There are some very wealthy people who, because of the tightening of the maximum end benefit limits, will be affected by this legislation. But is the Opposition arguing on behalf of a handful of very wealthy people-I am talking about the people who would receive benefits of about half a million dollars and more-because we have not heard any screams for them? Those are the people who are best able to look after themselves in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who work here knew about these changes. There was a great deal of speculation before May 1988 and an intensive amount of lobbying from the superannuation industry, because it was very concerned that the changes that may be made-there was a great deal of speculation about the changes-would affect the industry and would be a disincentive for people to get involved in superannuation. What have we found since then? Since the May statement we have found a stoney silence from the superannuation industry. The Life Insurance Federation of Australia wants this legislation passed. The life insurance industry in Australia got on with business, it got involved with selling more business and it has found that its business has continued to grow. Yet we hear hysterical bleating from the Opposition that hundreds of thousands of Australians will be affected. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), who is sitting in the chair, I am sure like me would have been plagued by constituents if hundreds of thousands of Australians were to be affected by this legislation, but that is not the case. We are not hearing this from our constituents or from the life insurance industry, so where is this mythology coming from? It seems it has been conceived in the mind of the honourable member for Bradfield. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point he made was that these legislative changes encapsulated in the May statement would in some way provide disincentive for superannuation savings and for people to be involved. I have already given the statistics. We have seen an increase from four in 10 Australians to eight in 10 involved in investment. The total assets of the superannuation industry were $25 billion in 1983 and they are now $80 billion. In desperation he said-I suppose this is a Malcolm Fraser type comment, and we all remember the comment in 1983 about the money under the bed-people would be better off to spend their money elsewhere. It is a very stupid comment to make, because it is the sort of thing that the Opposition does time and time again, trying to frighten people away from what is a very sensible form of investment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he lost his seat to a very good member from this side of the House. He changed that figure after a week and came down to 10,000 jobs being lost. Yesterday I asked the statistics group in Parliament House to find out what the figures were. We find that in the last five years of the Fraser Government, there was an increase in employment of 13,000 in the restaurant, hotel and club industry. In the last five years of our Government, there has been an increase of 74,000, four or five times the record. While gloom, doom and spoiling was the name of the game when it came to the introduction of those changes, we find that once again the spoiling tactics of the Opposition were all that it was left with, because it did not have a structure or a policy. All it is left with is spoiling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new legislation maintains substantial concessions for people, but it keeps the cost to government within affordable limits. We have had two days of the new regime of the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and we want to hear about his policies. He has been sitting there for a long time spoiling, trying to destroy, but we want to know about policies, because we think the Leader of the Opposition is all froth and bubble. Honourable members do not have to take my word for it. The Australian Financial Review of Wednesday, 10 May said:</PARA>
<PARA>As Shadow Treasurer, Mr Peacock was a lamentable failure, making virtually no impact on the development of economic debate in an atmosphere where the Government was itself struggling. The coalition needs to lift its economic game from the second division, where it is currently wallowing. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed the second division is about where it is at the moment, I do not think there is any question about that. It is no good the Opposition coming in here and bleating about interest rates day after day if it does not have a solution or a policy that can change them. To bleat about interest rates is ridiculous. Again, if we look at the economic statistics in the Economic Round-up of the Treasury of April 1989, we see that the 90-day bill rate was 17.5 per cent. No government wants interest rates at that level. But if we look at June 1982, the interest rate was 18.7 per cent. We find that it is all froth and bubble on the other side, lots of spoiling but no substance. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation improves the efficiency of the dividend imputation system and it reduces tax avoidance opportunities. It increases the spread of superannuation without an unsustainable Budget cost, and it allows for the tax cuts that we were able to deliver on 1 July and which we will deliver on 1 January of the new year. It reduces the unequal tax treatment for employer and employee contributions, and it increases the incentives for employees to make contributions to superannuation for their retirement. It is consistent with the long term philosophy that this Government has. It is economically sound and it is socially appropriate. I object to, and reject, the Opposition's amendment. I wholeheartedly support this legislation and hope that it passes the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in speaking tonight to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) and cognate Bills. As honourable members know, 5 amendments will be moved, which I will support and which apparently the Government will not accept. It is very important for our side of politics that the Government accept this amendment, because we feel it will help this package of six cognate Bills that has been introduced. Most of the income tax levy Bills are about the Government increasing taxation on Australians, which it has done consistently since it came to office in the early 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not only have honourable members talked about increases of taxation tonight, but the previous speaker, the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), talked about the level of interest rates we are suffering from. Admittedly the bank bills were running at 18 per cent, but for how long? It was about two months. Under this Labor Government we have been paying an interest rate of over 15 per cent for the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government came to power the debt owing for overseas borrowings was about $25 billion. Under this Government and other governments throughout Australia we now have a debt of $125 billion. These characters opposite have seen fit to prop up their own Government to the tune of $100 billion in the last two terms in which they have been in office. These are the sorts of problems faced by this nation. Not only that, the Government is desperate for more income tax to continue to prop up the standard of living of those who need so-called social justice. Unfortunately, the middle and upper income people continue to be shocked by the taxes imposed by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an horrific balance of payments problem. It is amazing that when the Liberal Party was in government under Menzies and Fraser it ran a terrific surplus of trade. Our standard of living continued to rise, we were all living well and we did not need the sort of tax regime that these characters have put in place. Now we see them running up anything up to $2 billion a month in debt. As a farmer I know all about the debts we have to pay. I am struggling to pay the 18 per cent and 20 per cent interest rates to balance the Government's books. The situation these blokes have put us in is absolutely ridiculous. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), does not do a bad job for the veterans, but I would like to have a go at the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about the sort of tax regime that he has put in place. Anything that moves is taxed these days. Superannuation is taxed to death. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is doing all the work for the Treasury? The Treasurer says that he has not had to increase the number of public servants. Of course he has not because the employer has been asked to make all these new tax arrangements. To help the so-called worker, a new superannuation package has been introduced. Who pays for it? Who does all the pencil and book work? It is not the worker; it is the employer who has to do it all. This is foisted upon him. He has to fill out all these forms every month. These days, the poor farmer I represent spends half his week in the office working for the Treasury. That is what it amounts to. </PARA>
<PARA> There are all sorts of brand new taxation arrangements. These measures were introduced in the May statement last year. We have had one Budget and another statement increasing taxes since that time. Every time we get a statement in this House from the Treasurer another $1 billion worth of taxation is imposed upon us. These are the facts. I do not have to speak in broad terms about these matters. All that happens to the primary producer is that he loses the sort of help that is needed in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA> There is something in these Bills which I support, and that is the 150 per cent write-off for science endeavour for companies. They have to be registered to get this concession of 150 per cent for expenditure on research and development. That is something this country sadly lacks. I fully support this measure. In fact, I think it should be 200 per cent. However, I question why it should apply only to a registered company. Even a farmer in small business does experimental work for his fellow growers or for a department. They run trials on such things as increasing yields and finding ways to do jobs better. I think that those people should also be entitled to a tax deduction, not just big business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government supports big business. To qualify for a tax deduction the company must be registered. For God's sake, it costs $100 per year just to register a company. If it is not registered, the Tax office will say that it cannot claim a deduction. A farmer might have spent thousands of dollars to increase the quality of wheat or he may have worked with one of the cattle counts on a research farm to increase the production of beef cattle or to increase the yield of wool to help our balance of payments. Farmers slave their guts out to try to get the Government out of the hole it has put us in. What sort of help do they get when it comes to taxation arrangements? None at all! They have all been abolished. There is hardly one left. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been an increase in the tax free self-employment scheme for superannuation, which I support. In fact, it ought to be higher. I believe that members should be able to transfer their previous superannuation entitlements to the parliamentary superannuation scheme. When I became a member of this House I belonged to a self-employed superannuation scheme. If a State member moves to a Federal House his State superannuation can be transferred to the Federal fund, but the money a member has been paying into a private scheme as a self-employed person cannot be transferred. I think that is a gross disadvantage. Why should a State member of parliament have the privilege of transferring superannuation, while any other dogsbody like myself who belongs to a self-employed scheme is not able to transfer to the Federal fund? I would like the Minister to look at this issue and see whether some changes can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought it would be interesting tonight to look at the parliamentary superannuation scheme. I know that people do not like to talk about it because it is felt that we get too much. In fact, we do not. We probably used to but under this Labor Government the whole scheme has been taxed in half. There is hardly any superannuation left at the end of a member's term in parliament. I asked the Department of the House of Representatives to look up my entitlement. I am not ashamed to talk about it. If I were to drop dead tomorrow, I would be entitled to $87,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would expect the honourable member to save me if I started to go pale; at least I trust him that far. If I completed the full four terms in the Parliament or 12 years and then retired, the rate of my superannuation would go up quite substantially. I would actually get $141,000. I would prefer to stick out this fourth term, which I happen to be in, so that I can get the extra benefit. I use this example because pre-1983-pre-Labor-we were charged 5 per cent tax on our lump sum superannuation payment. However, since 1983 the Government has introduced a new tax regime. Having come into the Parliament in 1980, for the entitlement that I would receive I would pay $1,500. It is to be remembered that all this income to be got from superannuation is to be added on to any other moneys earned during the year. If I happened to be retired I could be mowing lawns and earning $100 a week or chipping burrs for my neighbour and getting paid two bucks a day. That income must be added to the superannuation and then one of these horrific tax scales which Keating has imposed would be applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On top of that we are required to pay a 1.25 per cent health levy. These characters come in here and talk about reducing the scales. They do not tell you that the poor people of Australia have to continue to add on this extra health levy of 1.25 per cent. I wish to God they would start deregulating the health industry. The Government is in favour of deregulating the wheat industry and putting the poor farmer to the dogs, but it will not do anything about deregulating the health industry. The health industry is totally tied up, totally regulated and totally taxed. The community has to pay 1.25 per cent of its income. If a person earns a higher income, a percentage of that is paid. I probably pay for half a dozen people who are meant to be suffering from bad health. Most of the people on the lower scales do not pay anything. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to run through these figures. Post-1983 the taxpayer is paying 31.25 per cent tax. On my retirement benefit I would pay $18,750. As I said, that figure is to be added to what I may earn. At that tax level I would pay 31.25 per cent tax. That is just for politicians. I think that we can use ourselves as the classic example of how the Labor Party has increased the superannuation tax regime. After one has completed four terms or 12 years in Parliament and one loses at the polls or retires, one is entitled to take only half of one's benefit in a lump sum and the other half must be taken in a pension. As I said, prior to 1983 we paid only 5 per cent tax; now we are paying 31.25 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another problem. If I leave voluntarily, although I would get $87,000 I would be entitled to only a $14,000 pension. The other thing about superannuation is that it pays to live to a reasonable age. Someone who is over 55 pays only 16 1/4 per cent on the first $60,000 of the retirement benefit lump sum. If he is under 55 he pays the iniquitous 31 1/4 per cent tax. Those figures are from the Department-straight from the horse's mouth. All I can suggest to honourable members is that they work for a full four terms of Parliament and live to 55. After that they can get out, still paying quite a deal of taxation but paying at the lesser rate. I would suggest that a lot of the young turks around the place who are under that age should stick around for a long while if they want to get any benefits for their pension. By the time they do get out they will be looking forward to some sort of entitlement. Also their wives will be entitled to their pensions once they pass on. </PARA>

The maximum benefit in our scheme is payable after 18 years of service. After that, as a pensioner, we are entitled to 75 per cent of our salary. If we get beaten at the polls before we have served four terms-or 12 years- the benefit is calculated on three terms. So there is some advantage in being beaten, not that it would be all that exciting for that to happen on polling day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing that is being introduced is a capping on these arrangements. The Minister has not even got around to making an announcement on this capping proposition. It is not a benefit; it is another tax. The Government suggests that we cannot have too much superannuation. It is going to introduce a tax levy if we take ourselves beyond a certain level. We are waiting for the Minister to announce these changes. Although they are meant to come into operation on 1 July 1990, I am told that the scribes that be in the Department are still running around trying to work out what a fair and equitable cap will be, whatever that is. It means that if we want to have enough money left after paying tax to retire in some sort of comfort, we are going to be restricted by having to pay yet another tax rate on top of the existing rate. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the 15 per cent tax has been introduced in respect of properly constituted funds. We can roll over our lump sum and have a fund invest it. People are now being asked to pay 15 per cent tax on their net earnings. This is just a case of more taxation in the system. I can never understand why the Government is not prepared to leave some money with the people for a change. They will do a better job than the Treasury will with the funds they have to invest in businesses. That is all I have to say in relation to this Bill.

There is not a lot of sympathy in the community for those of us who are fortunate enough to have a decent superannuation scheme, which undoubtedly we do have in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) gives effect to a number of superannuation tax reform measures announced in the May economic statement. It continues the reform of the tax system that the Labor Government has been carrying out since 1983. Amongst other things it also includes measures to repeal the special tax treatment of calculated liabilities of life insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> As this is a sizeable piece of legislation, I shall contain my remarks this evening to the superannuation changes, as have many of my colleagues. In this context I concur with the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) in his address, and also those made earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). Contrary to some opinion expressed in the course of this debate, savings through superannuation will not be discouraged as a consequence of these measures. Their effect is not to increase the tax on superannuation, but to achieve a bring-forward of tax liability and achieve a fairer tax treatment of superannuation funds income by taxing investment income at 15 per cent and extending the imputation system to these institutions. The after tax benefits of fund members will be largely unaffected by the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the House's attention to an article by Barry Dunstan in the Australian Financial Review some time ago, on 3 June 1988, just after these arrangements were announced, in which he was discussing the unacceptable risks, as he put it, of minimising superannuation tax impact. There is no way that the Government is saying that funds have to undergo the imputation exercise. That is not the point; the point is that there is a way now for life insurance companies to minimise the tax on their funds if it is seen to be appropriate. They can go down that track if it is seen to be appropriate for their fund and not endanger the savings of people who have their money with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation of superannuation will be placed on a more consistent and less costly basis as a consequence of the measures contained in this Bill. These reforms will establish sustainable long term arrangements which will enable individuals and the industry to plan and invest with certainty. This should encourage, not discourage, savings through superannuation. The fact is that despite the tax cuts, savings made through superannuation remain the subject of very considerable tax concessions even for those on the new lowest marginal tax rate of 21 per cent. Furthermore, the two reforms are quite separate and cannot properly be linked. For instance, low paid workers may receive far greater benefits relatively from superannuation than more highly paid workers simply because they do not have the same security of employment and are less likely to be able to save in other less compulsory ways. Benefits cannot always be equated with cash outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Some commentators have tended to overlook the tax deferral benefits available to superannuation savings. Superannuation benefits are only taxed at 15 per cent as they accrue and on retirement after the age of 55 the first $60,000, indexed to average weekly earnings, of the assessable post-1983 component of the benefit, as well as the person's own undeducted contributions will be tax free while that part in excess of the threshold will be taxed at 15 per cent. As benefits will be taxed as they accrue at rates well below the lowest marginal tax rate, this will provide even low rate taxpayers with substantial tax deferral benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument about the desirability of superannuation as a savings mechanism for low paid workers seems to assume that they all currently have access to superannuation and that somehow a choice should be made between lowering the tax rate for such people and taxing superannuation contributions. Although more workers are now able to obtain the benefits of superannuation as a direct consequence of our Government's continuing endeavours in this area, many low paid workers are not yet in a position to access superannuation in their industries. Necessary reforms are still being negotiated to ensure that people such as regular part time employees are extended the opportunity of superannuation. We do not have to look past our own backdoors and our own employees to see that this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> To emphasise this particular point, I would like to acquaint the House with an example of the difficulties confronted in some industries where a significant segment of employees are female part time workers. A well known Australian organisation-which I will not name-has been involved in negotiations with its industry union for about six years in relation to an extension of superannuation to its part time employees. During this time the number of part time employees has increased substantially, and they now comprise about 15 per cent of the work force. Needless to say, the vast majority of these employees were women. Of 5,000 such workers, only 50 were men. Happily, I have been informed that the problem has now been satisfactorily resolved, but not without a considerable degree of agitation and activity on the part of the union in recent times, and the incidental involvement of a number of members of Parliament. Madam Deputy Speaker, you might recall the case. </PARA>
<PARA> That example is not unique. Failure to extend pro rata benefits such as superannuation to part time employees simply institutionalises the practice of employing such workers because they are cheaper. This Government has a commitment to improving the conditions of work of Australians as well as to protecting their wage rates. Consistent with the policy of bringing forward the tax on end benefits to the point of contribution, deductions will no longer be allowed for amounts not paid into a fund but merely set apart by an employer to provide superannuation benefits. I suspect that that is the type of fund to which the honourable member for Maranoa was referring when he mentioned the one that he was in. </PARA>
<PARA> Deductions will now be available only for amounts actually paid to a recognised fund. This, too, is an important measure. In the past, the absence of a specific, discrete, inaccessible and publicly accountable provision for superannuation through an approved institution or fund has cast doubt on the bona fides of some superannuation schemes, and workers have naturally been reluctant to sink their hard earned money into accounts which may disappear into thin air in the event of an enterprise collapse, closure or amalgamation. In other words, this aspect of the legislation is in place to protect the money of workers. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted the contributions of honourable members opposite on this legislation with particular interest, given the fact that their respective parties have never evidenced a commitment to universal or even near universal availability of superannuation in the work force, and neither have they ever pursued initiatives such as portability of superannuation, without which superannuation is rendered unviable for people working in insecure areas of employment. While recognising the genuineness of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) in asserting the need for the removal of the income and assets test, I cannot agree with his argument. The objective of an age pension, which equates to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, would not have been achieved without the imposition of the assets test and the income test. Neither would it have been achieved under a Liberal-National Party Government. It is, after all, an objective enshrined in Labor Party policy, and one to which the Government was and is committed. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Sturt also talked about people having a choice of retirement income, but did not refer to opportunity or ability to save. This matter was covered, in part, by the honourable member for Perth. There are many people in Australia who lack the resources to save for their retirement. They are low paid workers, if they are workers at all, who have not had either the opportunity to access superannuation or the level of disposable income necessary to save. The recipe of universality and choice put forward by the honourable member for Sturt is unrealistic. It would inevitably lead to a blow-out in the cost of providing adequate retirement incomes for an increasing number of people, and the only choice then, under a Liberal Government in particular, would be between the age pension and other forms of retirement income. Unfortunately, in these circumstances outlined, this would be a battle which the age pension would lose-as it did under the last Liberal Government. I do not believe for one moment that that choice would be made out of spite. Rather, it would be made because honourable members opposite do not seem capable of understanding that some people in our society are genuinely unable, for a variety of reasons, to set aside funds for sustaining themselves in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point mentioned by the honourable member for Sturt related to the need for a liberalisation of the definition of savings for retirement, such that home purchase would be classified in this way. The honourable member claimed that there are legal ways of ensuring that double dipping could not occur. He is probably right, but he has not convinced me that it would be easy. The human condition is one of great complexity. Administration and monitoring of such a scheme would necessarily be tremendously intrusive and Australians would not countenance it. It is for this reason that I am personally opposed to lump sum payouts of superannuation beyond an acceptable minimum. I agree absolutely with the Government's earlier decision to tax these at a higher rate than the 5 per cent mentioned by the honourable member for Maranoa because I believe that the double dipping that was occurring was costing this economy a great amount of money and also depriving pensioners and people who required assistance with their incomes of an improvement in their conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has reduced income taxes on two occasions since coming to office, the most recent being announced in the April statement, and this has been accompanied by substantial improvements in family income. This is more than the Opposition has ever managed to achieve. Measures such as those contained in the Bill tonight help to make the tax system fairer and more just. I support the legislation and oppose the amendments put forward by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation to impose a new system of taxes on the superannuation industry and recipients of superannuation is indicative of the legislative incompetence and irresponsible attitude of the Labor Government. The eventual changes to the taxation of superannuation were first signalled in the 1988 May economic statement. However, the complete legislation dealing with these complicated, significant and short-sighted changes was introduced into this House only last week. We are debating the legislation now, only a few days later. We have had little opportunity to examine the details of the most recent of the Bills presently before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislative inability of the Labor Government and the irresponsible Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), to legislate in a timely manner has produced uncertainty for businesses and for those who are seeking to provide for their future through superannuation and investments in superannuation funds. It is typical of the sloppy approach towards this Parliament which the Treasurer takes. The quality of legislation on taxation matters in this House is another indictment of the performance of the selfsame Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that the Australian economy is now showing signs of advanced decay. In the context of that indefensible economic decline, the role of superannuation is particularly important. It is through such very long term investments that people seek to guarantee their future against the uncertainties of day-to-day economic change when they are no longer in a position to earn income. The value of those investments can be severely affected by government taxation policies and those economic polices which produce high inflation and erode the value of long-term investments. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation is a particularly important issue. These taxation measures affect not only tax and income policies, but also the whole range of social security measures which the Government oversees. At stake here is the question of private provision for welfare or the dependence of Australians on government. This question is more difficult now than it once was. Limits of resources available to government mean that future governments must balance the need to guarantee the existing rights of pensions to dignity and to a pension which is not theirs from charity but as a matter of real or perceived right after years of paying taxes against the fact that people will increasingly choose not to rely on the uncertainty of government support from dwindling resources. </PARA>
<PARA> It is almost trite to observe that Australia has an ageing population and, therefore, a declining tax base from which to support the increasing numbers of older people. Many consequences flow from these changes. One is that compulsory retirement should be re-examined so that healthy people who are beyond the age of 65 can continue to work for as long as they choose without being financially disadvantaged. Another is that governments of all complexions must seek to encourage people to make private provision for superannuation. The uncertainties involved in the presentation of these changes over more than a year discourage those contemplating superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The firms which provide superannuation funds have already had to make provision for paying these new taxes even though the legislation has not been debated in this Parliament, let alone been passed by it. On top of this uncertainty, the Government is proposing a series of new taxes on money invested in superannuation funds and on lump sum superannuation payments. This superannuation tax package began as a fiddle at the time of the 1988 May economic statement. It was designed to bring forward government revenue from lump sum superannuation payments so as to increase the apparent Budget surplus in the following couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was quite willing to sacrifice the long term planning of individuals for their future to the short term interests of the Labor Party. The Treasurer has become an expert in budgetary fiddles since his first ham-fisted attempt at a Budget in 1983. They are not sufficient justification for poorly drafted and-thanks to the Government-inadequately debated legislation. The effects of this legislation, which had its origins in a clever trick dreamed up by some adviser I presume, will be felt long after the Labor Government falls and its budgetary problems are forgotten. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very bitter fruits, indeed. These measures are estimated to produce revenue of $980m in 1989-90 and $1.4 billion-that is $1,400m-in 1990-91. We know that the effects of that corporate tax package over time will in fact mean greater revenue for the Commonwealth Government and, of course, more commensurate burdens for Australian businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The mirage of lower taxes in the corporate rate tax area is ominous for those who are now looking forward to cuts in personal income tax. This legislation, which is part of that corporate tax package, will also have a significant impact on the affairs of everyday pay as you earn taxpayers whose only major investment, apart from their family home, is a superannuation scheme to provide for some comfort in retirement. An essential element of the Treasurer's argument was his statement that no recipient of superannuation payments would receive lower payouts because of the new tax structure. The shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), subsequently demonstrated without question that a range of losses, up to as much as 17 per cent, could be incurred by some people in some circumstances. As usual, the Treasurer's assurances to the Australian public were found to be worthless. It seems that only those who vote are of interest to the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> The pattern of the Treasurer asserting an implausible account of a benefit to voting Australians, which is dutifully reported by his followers in the press before ultimately being abandoned when reality proves the Treasurer wrong, has been repeated so many times that it is now expected-it is passe. The estimates and predictions of the Treasurer have lost all credibility; they cannot be trusted. The worst errors are in his estimates of the effects of taxation and the revenue to be gained from new taxes, whatever their nature. Time after time, the capital gains tax, or the fringe benefits tax, or a sales tax change, or some other tax measure, has produced much more revenue than the Government found it convenient to admit when the measure was announced. We can have little more confidence in the assertions of the Treasurer about this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements which are contained in this package, a 15 per cent tax will be imposed on the contributions by employers to superannuation funds. This tax represents a large slice of the revenue gains expected from the package. It involves, essentially, the bringing forward of revenue which would have been collected when superannuation payments were eventually made to retirees. There is nothing intrinsically more plausible about this arrangement than about those which existed previously. Like the rest of this tax package, it is not based on any principle or on a clear direction in taxation policy; it is a tax bred of expediency, rather than of a more sensible approach to taxation, which is so desperately needed to relieve the burdens of taxation on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will also impose a 15 per cent tax on the income from investments made by superannuation funds. This new tax will be partially offset against the dividend imputation credits on domestic equity investments made by the funds. It is estimated that after these credits are taken into account the effective rate of taxation on some funds could be as little as 4 per cent. Given that low return, it is questionable whether the enormous administrative costs on business and the Australian Taxation Office justify imposing this element of the new tax at all. As these costs are realised, there must be a real prospect for increases in the rate of the tax in the future. In other words, it could be considered to be the thin end of the wedge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer sought to present this tax as a means of promoting investment in Australian securities rather than securities overseas. Any incentive for domestic investment would derive from the fact that imputation of dividends is not applied to foreign companies paying tax overseas or to overseas profits earned by Australian companies. The new tax on the investments of superannuation funds would be minimised by investing in large local companies which offer fully franked dividends. Therefore, this is far from a neutral tax. It seeks to direct and distort the investment profile of some of the largest investors in this country-I refer to the superannuation funds. Indeed, it encourages firms to modify their behaviour so as to minimise tax-a practice that the Treasurer claims to frown upon in other circumstances. It is now clear that tax minimisation is okay so long as the Treasurer's permission is obtained first. What is new about that?</PARA>
<PARA> Australian firms can do without the gratuitous advice of the Treasurer to invest in what is really a fairly limited number of Australian companies. Fund managers must be encouraged to invest so as to maximise the return to policyholders, not the doubtful interest of the Government. Most superannuation funds already maintain extensive investments within Australia. However, if they are to continue to expand and are not to dominate local markets, the largest funds must invest overseas. The subtle form of protection which is involved with this tax further undermines the Government's claims to credibility and economic reform. If only slightly, this measure will provide comfort for companies to be less efficient than they might otherwise be, to return less to their shareholders than they otherwise might, and to be less competitive with the funds of shareholders than overseas companies are. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern with this tax is that it will fall more heavily on funds such as approved deposit funds and roll-over funds which invest in safer securities such as bonds that will not attract any imputation credits. This is yet another distorting outcome of this hastily conceived, if slowly implemented, legislation. Considering all of these effects, it is clear that there are substantial grounds on which to reject this part of the Government's superannuation tax package. I doubt whether the Government is fully aware of the potential consequences of this legislation. It was brought together as a gimmick to hold together the corporate tax package-no more no less. Honourable members opposite who have no principled commitment are not really endeared to this package. I suggest that they consider the constructive changes which the Opposition has proposed by way of the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Bradfield. </PARA>
<PARA> The third leg of this package, which is nearly unstable enough to fall, is the 16.25 per cent tax on lump sum superannuation payments of over $60,000. It replaces the Government's earlier tax on lump sum superannuation payments. That earlier package caused havoc enough with people about to retire when it was first introduced. This new package has compounded that uncertainty. People want to provide for their futures without being dependent on government. However, they are cautious about the type of long term investment that superannuation represents when the Government imposes new constraints and imposts on their investment. Superannuation is an area in which stability is essential. This Government has not provided that stability. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the rhetoric about providing for the aged, the Australian Labor Party is even discouraging those approaching retirement from looking after themselves. This package, in keeping with the sorry record of the Keating inspired Labor Government on taxation matters, is at least consistent with its record. It is full of consequences which were no part of the design of those who drafted the legislation. The Government has had 12 months since its original announcements to refine this legislation. Yet this package of Bills, which we will debate just one week after the most recent of those Bills was introduced, is as sloppy as any of the myriad of other tax Bills that have been introduced over the past six long years of Labor rule. </PARA>

Yet again, narrow political considerations have predominated over economic rationality. Government policies in taxation and social security are not-I repeat not-moving in the right direction. They undermine private provision for the futures of individuals. They reduce incentives for private individuals to save or invest. The Government should accept the Opposition's amendment. I hope that it learns from the numerous mistakes it made when implementing the corporate tax package.</PARA></TALK.START>

If one wants to put together a comprehensive economic management package that works, combined with a package to deal with the problems of the poorer sections of the population and provides social justice across the board to the population, one should have a look at the programs of this Government which are so impressive that they are now being copied in other countries as examples of how to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to get on with the debate, but obviously the honourable member does not want to hear what I have to say. After all the comments of the honourable member for Curtin and his attacks on the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), the honourable member for Bradfield impertinently keeps interrupting me when I refer to the Opposition's policy and the nonsensical ideas put forward in this area by members opposite. I return to the comments of the honourable member for Curtin. Obviously I will have to restrict myself to some of his comments in order to satisfy the honourable member for Bradfield. The honourable member for Curtin said, `It is a trite observation that Australia is an ageing society and that therefore we are not going to have enough money for the provision of aged care in the future'. Why is it a `trite' observation? I would have thought that it is a crucial observation about which all Australians should be concerned. Certainly, we on this side of the House are concerned about this matter, and our population and immigration policies are designed to deal with this question. It is not a trite observation at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's elderly citizens are demanding to know how any government-whether it is our Government or a government formed by members opposite, and let us hope that that is a long time in the future-will deal with this very serious problem; that is, the problem of how to provide sufficient retirement income for Australia's elderly citizens in a period when the population is ageing in a substantial way. So, instead of the honourable member for Curtin addressing this question, he says merely that it is a trite observation. It is certainly not a trite observation, and the honourable member for Bradfield should recognise that. It goes to the essence and heart of why we are amending the Superannuation Act. We recognise the importance of making changes to ensure that people provide for their superannuation and that it is more broadly available to more people in Australia. In other words, we are trying to move to a situation in which over a period every Australian will be in a position to be in some kind of superannuation scheme and have some provision for their old age and for their pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Opposition has decided that it will attack certain technical aspects of these reforms. But it does not come out with any set concrete suggestion about how we deal with this overall problem. One only has to look at history to recognise the behaviour of the Opposition in relation to this question. During the period of the last Labor Government, the Whitlam Labor Government, attempts were made by the Labor Party to introduce a national superannuation scheme to cover all citizens. That was resisted by the Opposition forces. As a result, we are paying the price for the lack of such a universal scheme. That is a fact. </PARA>

If we had moved in this area years ago we would not be faced with the kind of crisis we are faced with. We are not the only country to be faced with this crisis in relation to the ageing of the population and the problem of superannuation; other countries in the world would face similar problems. But we would have moved a lot closer to the solution of the problem if these changes had been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are we doing as a government? The Minister for Social Security, in my estimation, is the greatest social reformer in the postwar period in terms of the social programs which he has put forward in this country. Anyone can see the difference in his record of concrete achievements within a difficult economic climate as distinct from the lack of achievement by the Opposition when it was in government in an easy economic climate. One can look, for example, at the achievements in the areas of child support, family assistance programs, and pensions and benefits. In all of those areas we have been able to assist. At the same time as having to face difficult economic decisions he has put forward great social reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing here is that we now have a study, through the report of Bettina Cass, of the serious questions involved in retirement and superannuation. For the first time we have had a comprehensive study of what needs to be done in this country. It is on the basis of that report that we will be moving to legislate in the next year-indeed, in the next term, which will certainly see another Labor government in office-to ensure in the longer term one of the best retirement programs in the world for elderly citizens. That is the program that we are aiming for in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed the question of the changes involved in these Bills in this broad context because the Opposition tried to raise these matters in a broad context. What do we find from the Opposition? We find that the Opposition is not moving to oppose the legislation completely but moves a number of minor amendments. Then it makes a lot of noise-about what?

The honourable member for Curtin said that this measure was no good because it was trying to interfere with the investments of superannuation funds. Why?

He said it is not an open market policy if we try to encourage superannuation funds to invest in Australian companies. In other words, he said the government should do nothing to encourage superannuation funds, which are among the biggest investors of capital in this country to invest in Australia and Australian corporations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the honourable member for Curtin, any action by the Government to encourage investment in our own country and in our own corporations is to be seen as some kind of undue interference. Does the Opposition stand for the selling out of Australia or what? What a nonsense this is. In other words, one of the most positive measures for a long time to encourage capital investment in productive Australian enterprises and in Australian companies, to encourage superannuation funds to invest in them, is described by the Opposition, this bunch of no-hopers over here, as being contrary to some vague ideological principle of the New Right that I referred to before. The fact is that this is a very important and very sensible measure that has been well thought out in order to encourage investment in the area in which we need it most if we are to turn the Australian economy around; namely, in the productive companies of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> So I do not quite understand why the Opposition is opposing that particular clause. To me, this is an incredible opposition to a very sensible measure. It also means that the impact of the 15 per cent tax on the payout of superannuation funds is reduced, as the Treasurer said. In other words, superannuation funds have been told, `Look, you can pay the 15 per cent tax, but you can get back most of that 15 per cent if you invest in Australian companies and in Australian shares'. It is an excellent scheme, an excellent idea, for helping to encourage capital formation in Australia. Instead of that, we find the Opposition getting up and saying, `This is no good because, after all, it is some kind of interference in some vague concept of the free market'. It does not mind interfering in the free market to suit its rich friends whenever it suits them, but when it is a measure which is intended to ensure the direction of these scarce capital funds in this particular way for Australian production, especially in the areas where we need it most, namely, Australian manufacturing capital, we find the Opposition, as usual, in an incoherent way and without thinking through it, wanting to oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the way in which the Opposition has tried to argue against these changes, I am amazed to see that it has not suggested more amendments to the Bill than the honourable member for Bradfield has suggested. I do not understand why the honourable member for Bradfield thinks that simply changing this particular clause is some alternative policy on this question; it certainly is not. For him to say, `If we do not get this through we are going to oppose the whole Bill', what is going to be put in its place?</PARA>

Because some of their rich friends have not benefited from the introduction of that tax. If we had not introduced the capital gains tax, we would not be able to sustain pensions and benefits at the level at which we are sustaining them. There is no question about it. What would happen is the same as happens in other countries that have foolishly adopted new, right philosophies in government. Pensions would be cut and benefits would be cut.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am really surprised and somewhat disappointed in the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) for constantly interjecting tonight in an attempt to stop the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) contributing to the debate. The honourable member for Bradfield had done nothing but try to stifle that contribution. As the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling), who previously occupied the chair, said, there is the opportunity for a wider debate, as there must be. One cannot discuss taxation changes in any field without relating the discussion to other areas of taxation. These things are very much intermixed; they are very much connected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one were more in contact with the community, if one went out and spoke to retired persons, one would find that their concern is not focused simply on taxation and superannuation, but on the standard of living that people in retirement enjoy or do not enjoy. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey) and I, as members of the task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on retirement incomes which went from State to State, discussed these matters at first hand with 3,000 or more individual retirees in this country and we came back with many messages for the Government. One message that came back clearly was that what any government must do is provide a standard of living which is equitable, sustainable and reasonable for all retirees, whether they are on superannuation or government-funded pensions. Nowhere could it be said that the changes in the taxation on superannuation could be seen in isolation from other areas of taxation that affect the standard of living. So it is wrong for the honourable member for Bradfield to try to stifle the broader debate tonight with, can I say, inane and pointless interjections. In fact, his colleagues in the Opposition were far more wide-ranging in their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) spent some time trying to indicate, although without statistics, that the general economy was flat, dead, on the way down. Yet, if he had bothered to look at the statistics he would have found an acceleration in this economy. He would have found that unemployment is down and is going down and that employment is going up. We are increasing our job creation. Productivity has increased. The economy, while flattening out, as it should so that it cannot get overheated, is still very much one of high activity. So that if the honourable member for Curtin can raise wide ranging matters in this debate I do not see why the honourable member for Calwell or any other honourable member cannot do likewise. What rubbish for the honourable member for Curtin to say that the economy is on a rapid downturn. I suppose that is because his memory of when Opposition members were last in government was when this country faced a recession. Perhaps they dream daily of crossing the floor and occupying the government benches and of the golden years when they nearly wrecked this country, when they nearly sent it down the proverbial gurgler. </PARA>
<PARA> Another Opposition colleague of the honourable member for Bradfield-I refer to the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron)-had the hide to make the statement that this Government has the highest tax rate in federal history. Only last month the Treasurer (Mr Keating) introduced his April statement which reduced, for the third time the marginal rates of tax, so that those rates are now far lower than they were during the Fraser years. When they are combined with the family allowance and the family allowance supplement payments the position is different from that claimed by the honourable member for Maranoa. In fact, there are rising standards of living for those people in the lower economic groupings, the lower income areas, who were neglected for years; in fact bruised by the Opposition when it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to talk about retirement incomes unless we can talk about the contributions that wage earners are able to make towards superannuation to provide for their own income in retirement years or for those who have to rely on the pension. When we talk about retirement incomes, we have to talk about what the Opposition will do. I want to repeat one line delivered towards the end of the contribution of the honourable member for Calwell, and that was that an amendment trotted into this House tonight to these Bills does not constitute an economic policy, does not constitute a policy on superannuation. The amendment is a reaction to what the Government is doing. In other words, it is in recognition that this Government has an acceptable policy which, even in the Opposition's own terms, is generous but requires some fine tuning. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition had a policy which it had engendered amongst its own ranks, it would have come in here with that alternative policy. In fact if it had a policy which is acceptable to the people, it would not be on that side of the House, it would be on this side. But it was rejected repeatedly in 1983, 1984 and 1987. When the next election is held it will be rejected again, because amendments, off the cuff statements and silence during press interviews are no substitution for an economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has spent some time shuffling its leadership and very soon it will be changing and recycling its front bench. The community has to ask: `What do we get for that? Do we get cosmetic changes or do we get a change in some form of policy?'. Since the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) last occupied that position, a great many words have been spoken about taxation, including in this debate, by members of the Opposition. This House and the Australian people have been told on many occasions that the Liberal Party would soon be releasing, would soon be exposing for criticism, would soon be detailing to the public, its own taxation policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last August, the honourable member for Hawker reminds me. But there is not a single word, not a scintilla of evidence that it has in its feeble mind a taxation policy. So what do we have in the shuffling? A change of pace. Do we wait longer or are we going to see a change in the Opposition's thinking? The latest episode in the Liberal Party's long running taxation saga was when the Leader of the Opposition spoke to the National Press Club in his capacity as shadow Treasurer. In this case I must say that the title of shadow Treasurer was most apposite, particularly appropriate, for he said very little of substance but he promised a great deal in the future if we had the patience to wait. His speech and answers to questions were strong on rhetoric but weak on content.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson)-a man who gained his doctorate and his professorship in the lucky dip-comes in here and says just as little, just as few words of explanation. So it is more like the shuffling of a comedy or song and dance team. If one were to give them a title, knowing that the honourable member for Wentworth drives one of those flashy sports cars from Italy, and knowing the preference for sartorial splendour of the new Leader of the Opposition, we would call them Gucci and Ferrari. A song and dance team is not good enough for the Australian people. It will be rejected at the next election for what it is, farce and comedy. The time has come for the Opposition to give the Australian people more than simple rhetoric. The time has come for the Leader of the Opposition to show whether the souffle tag is merited or not and whether we will hear something of substance instead of shadow. </PARA>
<PARA> To contrast that image with that of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who now sits on the back bench, it can be said of the honourable member for Bennelong that what you saw was what you got. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has given him a reference. I suppose `hard working' and `honest' if not inventive, were accurate statements. But at least we got what we saw. Now, with all the tinsel and the packaging, the window-dressing, we have something to rival Myer's windows at Christmas time. In other words, the community still has to guess what the Opposition has in mind for its taxation policy because it hides the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that, with the shuffling and the changing, there is still the commitment to the hard, dry economics referred to by the honourable member for Calwell. That was probably nowhere exhibited more than in the hard fought preselections that took place in Victoria only last weekend. We know that the honourable member for Kooyong is to hold fast to the dry line of economics that is postulated in Future Directions because he said that the legacy left by the honourable member for Bennelong-hard, dry, responsible economics that have no heart, no soul and no compassion-is what he will embrace and carry on like a standard to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask ourselves whether, with the new Opposition front bench when it is announced and with the new leadership already elected, we will see the same old policy. The Opposition has not announced a new policy. It has said that it will just reject, throw out, this Government's tax reforms lock, stock, and barrel. Let me explain what I mean by lock, stock, and barrel, because that is what the honourable member for Bennelong and now the honourable member for Kooyong have said they are going to do. We hear nothing about the substitute policies. The Opposition will reject the Government's taxation policies lock, stock and barrel. Its policies are election-driven. They are not based on what is good for the country, not on what is best to bring about a proper, decent, sustainable retirement incomes policy based on a combination of superannuation and pensions but on `How can we out auction the Government come the next election? How can we somehow, with our tinsel and gaudy presentation, have a better point of sale at the ballot box than the Government?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, members of the Opposition will suggest that they can lower taxes further-hold out the fistful of dollars like they did in 1977. Then, after the election, when the votes are locked in, they will take the dollars back. In other words, their task, their idea, is to present a package which they cannot sustain but which is there for electoral-driven purposes just to lock in the votes. Then they would promise to lower taxes, not for the general population but for their mates. They want to get rid of the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax so that the rorts that went on when the Opposition was in government will keep going. Instead, they will give a new tax to the ordinary wage and salary earner, to the pensioners and the retirees we are talking about tonight. That is called a consumption tax. In other words, it is the good old reverse Robin Hood-you take from the poor and you give to the rich. That is their stock in trade. They lock in the votes and their stock in trade is to reverse the taxation burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, if they have any brains, they will have to work out how to pay for these tax cuts. What do we find if we look to the past? We have to look there because we have heard no new policies. We have to listen to the words of the Opposition, shadow Treasurer-I suppose that is the honourable member for Wentworth, although it has not been properly announced as yet-and the honourable member for Kooyong who was in the Fraser Cabinet. We find that they will continue those policies, such as a freeze on pensions. They would ignore the benefit and the necessity of child care in invigorating the economy. In other words, they would have pensioners and mothers with child care needs over a barrel-they would have them in the gun. So, there we have it, lock, stock and barrel: lock in the votes, employ their stock-in-trade of reversing the tax burden in this country and then, to pay for the whole shemozzle, have the ordinary people of this country over a barrel. Why do we believe that what happened in the early 1980s will continue? Last weekend in Melbourne at the preselections for Goldstein and Higgins members of the far right of the Liberal Party-</PARA>

While you have been in the Chair, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have already referred to the opportunities taken in this debate by the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Curtin, who certainly strayed from the subject far more than I have. I want to explain the relevance of the preselections. Immediately after being preselected for the seat of Goldstein, Professor David Kemp-by golly, this place is raining professors lately although, as the Treasurer says, they sink without trace-said in an interview that he thought there were too many people on welfare in this country. The same thing could be said about pensions, that there are too many retired people on pensions in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through its work and policy development based on Bettina Cass's excellent paper-No. 6-on retirement incomes, the Government is able to say that the only way it can continue with providing retirement incomes is on the twin bases of pensions and superannuation. Yet, these right wing future members of this House say that there is too much reliance on the Government payroll; that too much is being spent on pensions and welfare payments. But there is no policy, mark you, to put in the place of what this Government is doing. In other words, we will have more and more of what we have seen under the Opposition and which this Government is correcting in respect of superannuation. There are very few women on superannuation; it is mainly the domain of males-not all males, but males on higher income. That is the way it has been. The Opposition never did anything about it. This Government has said that the last productivity increase of 3 per cent should be paid through a widening of the availability of superannuation. In other words, all wage and salary earners will have an increased opportunity to enter superannuation and provide for their futures with less call upon tax paid for superannuation schemes. Yet, the future members of this House who have been preselected in Melbourne-the right wingers-are going to drive the new leaders of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the honourable member for Hawker and I have gone around the country as part of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes talking to the real people who matter-those approaching retirement and those in retirement. These people said that for years this had been the most neglected area by governments and they were pleased and excited by the prospect of the development of retirement incomes under this Government. They would be able to plan for their future and their security. They asked questions about what would be the effect of the 15 per cent taxation on employer contributions and the removal at the other end-which has not been raised very often by the Opposition-of the 15 per cent on payouts to superannuants. We were able to say quite clearly, and this legislation puts any other argument to rest, that there will be no extra tax paid by superannuants in this country. Perhaps the most important part of this legislation is the opportunity, as the honourable member for Calwell said, for superannuation funds to invest in Australian companies. </PARA>

<PARA> I was concerned that, earlier this evening, before the dinner adjournment, the honourable member for Bradfield went through the exercise of expressing concern about the savings of ordinary Australians, as he put it. I do not think anybody in this country has forgotten his lack of concern for the savings of ordinary Australians in 1981, 1982 and 1983 when he was a member of the Government that saw the economy of this country collapse-no one could see the bottom. It was the worst decline in the economy since the Great Depression. At the same time we saw the unemployment rate rise to double figures-there was almost 11 per cent unemployment and almost 12 per cent inflation. Savings of ordinary Australians were being rapidly eroded and destroyed before people's eyes. I do not know where the honourable member for Bradfield was at that time, but I would have liked to have seen him express his concern at that time rather than now because, at that time, he was a man who said what he believed. I know he does not believe much of what he says now; I know him too well. </PARA>

The point I was coming to was that in that period prior to 1983 we looked at what was happening to the taxation system and we now compare that with the measures that have been taken by this Government to make it a fairer tax system. We should recognise one thing: the only growth in the seven years prior to 1983 was the tax avoidance and tax evasion industry. During that period the tax burden moved away from the corporate sector, away from the high income earners and onto the shoulders of wage and salary earners, the pay as you earn taxpayers and their families. They are the people who suffered during that period. I am sure that fact is not forgotten and will never be forgotten by Australian taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to respond in general to the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Bradfield and to indicate at this early stage that we will not be accepting the amendments that are to be moved by the honourable member for Bradfield. The Opposition proposal to eliminate the 15 per cent tax on investment income of superannuation funds will be rejected by the Government. It is rejected by the Life Insurance Federation of Australia which represents the major participants in the superannuation industry. It is even inconsistent with the Opposition's own retirement incomes policy. The very low rate of tax on the earnings of superannuation funds was introduced in the May 1988 economic statement to give this very significant group of investors access to the Government's landmark imputation system. Under that imputation system, tax paid on a company's profits gives rise to a credit which can be applied by a shareholder to reduce tax payable on dividends paid to the shareholder from those profits. This was one of the most historic moves and beneficial changes in the history of the taxation system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The May statement also extended the imputation system to life officers and registered organisations. These measures complete the removal of the bias in the tax system favouring debt over equity. The only responsible way of extending imputation arrangements to superannuation funds is by introducing a tax on fund income at a concessional rate so that we have a tax liability against which imputation credits can be offset. Imputation not only gives a fairer treatment of dividends and interest but it removes substantial inefficiencies hindering the development of Australia's equity markets. Until tonight the Opposition has consistently endorsed the extension of the Government imputation system to all taxpayers. But tonight it seeks to deny these provisions to superannuation funds. I believe that the Opposition has very little appreciation of the wide ranging consequences of such actions. I confess that I do not think the honourable member for Bradfield really understands how the system works or the implications of what he is moving. It is not overstating the position to say that passage of the Opposition amendment would require a reassessment of the continued viability of the entire imputation system. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the changes announced in the May statement, superannuation funds and other large institutional investors such as life officers and friendly societies were excluded from the imputation arrangements. This meant that franked dividends they received were wasted. Superannuation funds and institutional investors were attracted to debt instruments rather than to equities. A number of so-called tax effective financing schemes and other tax avoidance arrangements also resulted. These included schemes promoted by companies publicly associated with the Liberal Party. The Opposition amendment, if successful, would return superannuation funds to a position in which they were encouraged to make investment decisions based on taxation advantages rather than the greatest overall economic return. Superannuation funds would no longer prefer investments in those companies which pay a fair measure of Australian tax; instead, they would again have an incentive to invest with those best able to exploit loopholes in the tax system and invest more funds abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> Who will be the losers in that kind of arrangement? The losers will be the Australian economy and the Australian people. I have said on a number of occasions that the Liberals are like leopards, they do not change their spots. At the first opportunity they are back to their old habits, back to loading the burden onto the pay as you earn taxpayers and their families and away from the high income earners. That will result in an unfairer tax system weighted against wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of superannuation funds from the imputation arrangements would force the Government to consider complicated anti-avoidance provisions to prevent tax effective financing arrangements once more becoming popular. The Opposition's decision to impose the tax on investment earnings is difficult to understand for other reasons as well. It is clearly inconsistent with the Opposition's own retirement income policy launched in November last year. That policy stated that the Opposition would `continue to provide company tax imputation credits to superannuation funds on franked dividends'. </PARA>
<PARA> Several representatives of the superannuation industry have stated publicly that in practice the tax will have no effect on the investment earnings of most superannuation funds. In some cases superannuation funds are expected to have excess imputation credits which they can use to offset the tax on contributions. The net result is significantly improved end benefits for those investing in major superannuation funds. For other superannuation funds, including many approved deposit funds, the earnings tax will either be minimal or could be readily reduced by an adjustment to their investment portfolios. Tax liabilities can be reduced by investing in shares, but also by investing in assets which provide a return in the form of a capital gain. Moreover, even in those cases where some net earnings tax would be payable, it does not follow that after tax end benefits would be lower. The reason for that is that the reduction of tax on end benefits intentionally exceeds what is necessary to offset the new tax on deductable contributions. This is a quite deliberate design feature intended to provide an offset to any residual effect of the earnings tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I will turn now to some of the more specific points made by the honourable member for Bradfield earlier this evening. The honourable member claimed that the Government's changes to superannuation taxation have made investing in superannuation unattractive. I want to emphasise that this proposition finds absolutely no support among any of the major superannuation funds. In a letter to the editor of the Australian Financial Review on 4 May, the taxation and legislation manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society superannuation said, `There remains significant tax incentives to contribute to superannuation'. In a statement issued this evening the group managing director of National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd has said that the new tax arrangements `present a significant level of incentives to encourage the community to save for retirement, and this should be welcomed'. National Mutual has said that it is essential that the legislation `should be passed quickly in the interests of fund members and administrators'. This position has been supported by the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, which on Friday called for the speedy passage of the legislation. The Opposition's amendments do not have the support of any credible voice in the super- annuation industry. One of the reasons for this was outlined by the managing director of National Mutual in his statement tonight:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been significant consultation with the Government over the drafting of the Bill, and all of the significant recommendations contained in the 15 point submission by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Institute of Actuaries and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia have been accepted and included in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Bradfield seems to have based his argument on the proposition that people will be made worse off by the Government's legislation on the basis that superannuation funds commonly only hold 15 per cent of their portfolios in equities. The honourable member is hopelessly ill-informed about the true position. Apparently, he does not understand the importance of the concessional taxation of capital gains in reducing the effective earnings tax rate. This is one of the reasons why many funds do not expect to pay any net tax on investment earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note that I have seen a statement released by the honourable member for Bradfield to the media tonight to the effect that, if the Opposition amendment is defeated in this place-as it will be-the coalition is committed to opposing this Bill in toto in the House of Representatives. All I want to say about that is that it is a grossly irresponsible position to take. It would deny the revenue some $980m in 1989-90 and $1,400m in the following year. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I turn to the Opposition's proposal that the $60,000 lump sum threshold contained in the Government's legislation be increased to $125,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no more graphic demonstration of the fact that this Opposition represents only the very top end of town, the very top end of the income scale. In the 1987-88 income year, less than one half of one per cent of eligible termination payments declared for tax purposes were higher than $55,000. Not surprisingly, these eligible termination payments were all received by high income earners. No more than a handful of people would benefit from the Opposition's amendment-and those who would benefit would be very wealthy people. It is essential that the Opposition's amendment be defeated so that the taxation of superannuation can maintain an acceptable degree of progressiveness. The government is not prepared to see higher income retirees advantaged relative to people on lower and middle incomes, and nor is it prepared to see their families advantaged. The Opposition's amendment would also encourage more people to take their retirement benefit in a lump sum rather than in the form of a superannuation pension, with obvious adverse implications for retirement income policies generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I indicated at the outset, the Government will be rejecting the Opposition's amendments. The measures which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced in May 1988 substantially enhance the integrity of the superannuation system. They place the taxation of superannuation on a more tax consistent and less costly basis. They lay the basis for sustainable long term arrangements. They enable individuals and industry to plan and invest with certainty. They provide a positive inducement for Australians to save through superannuation, and the government will not be swayed by the opportunistic and vacuous arguments which the Opposition has put to the House tonight.

<PARA>The amendments will effectively excise the 15 per cent tax on investment funds as they will be applied to superannuation funds. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that millions of superannuants' end benefits will not be reduced and to ensure that superannuation remains a viable retirement savings alternative. We have just heard the Minister's response to my speech in the second reading debate, in which I covered in some detail the essence of these observations. For the benefit of the Committee I emphasise again quite clearly, so that there can be no doubt at all in the Minister's mind, that contrary to the advice given to him it is utterly absurd to suggest that dividend imputation, if the changes we propose are in place, will somehow or other be lost. Surely, logic dictates that if we are removing a tax we do not need dividend imputation. The whole purpose of the Government's imputation arrangements was to lessen the tax and to transfer it to other tax credits. </PARA>
<PARA> If we remove the tax as we are proposing in this amendment, clearly the observation made by the Minister is logically unsustainable. I seek his advice on that matter; no doubt he will give it in due course. The reason we are moving this amendment is quite simple. This package of Bills contains three new tax points. They were first advised in May of last year. Here we are 12 months later and the legislation is not yet through the chamber. It has been subject to only four days advice on this very complex area of policy because the Government chooses to force the issue, despite the delay of some 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry, in particular, is desperately concerned to get this matter sorted out one way or the other. The Minister has been happy to come into the chamber and give us quotations from the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd about this attitude. Other organisations, such as the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia Ltd, have been arguing for months, supported by other companies such as the Australian Mutual Provident Society, which have also argued for months, that the application of a 15 per cent tax on dividend income is not only extremely expensive to administer, but also is at a cost to individual contributors to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I emphasised in my speech on the second reading motion and which I now re-emphasise is that, contrary to what the Government bothered to tell the million-odd people who have recently gone into 3 per cent productivity schemes, because of the imposition of this tax, virtually all of those people will be losers. It stands to reason that if the bases of their schemes are to be subject to a level of tax which prior to this was not in place, clearly their end benefits will be less. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already tabled in the House the most detailed analysis that has been conducted in this area. It demonstrates beyond doubt that in virtually every category of superannuation coverage there are a significant number of losers, despite the commitment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that not one beneficiary would be worse off by 1c. The fact of the matter is that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was less than truthful in his observations on that matter. Maybe he was led astray. Maybe he just got carried away by the rhetoric of the moment. These changes will involve losers. As an Opposition which is responsible in this matter, we hold the Government to account. It is no good hiding behind situations and trying to obfuscate and alter the basis of the debate. The fact is that we have 3.2 million people, at least, in superannuation schemes. The Opposition is desperately interested in getting as wide a coverage for superannuation as possible. However, there is no way it can seriously be argued that an end benefit of somewhere between $18 and $20 a week-which is precisely what we get from 3 per cent of average weekly earnings-is in any sense an adequate basis to sustain financial independence in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are all about is giving the millions of people with superannuation and the millions of people who do not yet have any form of superannuation, access to a range of products which will enable them to achieve some greater degree of financial independence in their retirement. On that point at least the Government and the Opposition appear to be at one. Therefore, I find it most offensive that the Minister at the table should come in here and allege that somehow or other we represent the top end of town-to use his expression-when the amendments we are moving tonight are specifically directed at helping the hundreds of thousands of low to middle income earners who, under normal circumstances, have great difficulty in achieving adequate financial support for their retirement outside the pension system. The Government shares with us-at least in its verbal capacity if not in reality-the belief that we must, for the sake of future generations of Australians, do what we can to reduce access to pensions for those who do not need them or to those who have alternative sources of financial support. The obvious and the logical outcome of that policy initiative must be that while people are in the work force they must be given adequate incentive and opportunity to save through superannuation so that when they receive their retirement package at approximately 55 years of age, or later, they will have an appropriate level of financial independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister made the point, as did other Government speakers, which I underline and support, that we cannot indefinitely, with the ageing of the Australian population, find ourselves in a situation where people believe that there is an incentive in not saving for tomorrow in the belief that, because they claim they have a right to a pension, regardless of their assets, in future days it will not really matter because somebody else-the taxpayers of tomorrow-will carry the load. To approach policy with that belief is to sell this nation short and fail in this Parliament to represent the reality that we have to plan for the Australians of tomorrow and for those who are not even born. It will be their generation, and our children's generation, who will have to carry the cost of our retirement income in another 20 or 30 years time. It is short-sighted in the extreme to regard superannuation as yet another milch cow. The Minister made the observation saying, `This amendment will rip the guts out of the $1.4 billion tax base in this arrangement'. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in the Treasurer's announcement on this matter he claimed that in a full financial year the total tax from those three new tax points will be $1.4 billion. We are talking about a major reform to one of them. We are talking about removing from the legislation the second tax point. We are not talking about removing the first, which is the tax on contributions, because that is worth at lest $1 billion. I interpolate here to say that the Government has not yet had the courtesy to tell us its precise estimates for the tax fall in those three specific points. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the first tax point will be the major one. It is the cheapest one to administer. It is the easiest one for funds to apply. It is of minimum cost to contributors. Therefore, we live with that particular tax arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trying to amend the third tax point. That will be the subject of a later address by me when I speak to that proposed amendment. On the second tax point, which is a tax on investment income, the fact is that the estimates we have been given are as low as $20 million and as high as $120 million or $150 million-we do not know exactly what the tax base will be. Perhaps the Minister will tell us. One thing is sure: every cent of that amount is being taken from the contributions and from the benefits which have accrued to the superannuation funds of millions of Australian workers-not just of the top end of town, as the Minister claims. What is so pathetic about this particular approach is that by removing revenue from the centre, the Government will be effectively reducing its final tax on the lump sums at the end. Not satisfied with that, the Government will apply a third tax to what is left. As I said, I will have more to say about that in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) made great play of the 3 per cent superannuation. I remind him that that was an initiative of this Government. His government had no concern for superannuation for the less well off in the community, for lower to middle income earners. Now, through some piece of opportunism, the Opposition seeks to express its concern. Let me go back to what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) actually said, as distinct from what the honourable member for Bradfield has just said. All I have to do is refer to page 3228 of Hansard of 3 June 1988. I quote the Treasurer's words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it will allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This change in superannuation has two parts to it: a bring-forward of the 1983 deferred tax arrangements and the tax of 15 per cent on the funds. I repeat the Treasurer's words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it will allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money-now lying in superannuation funds-</PARA>
<PARA>not contributors' money, but the Government's money-</PARA>
<PARA>without diminishing any personal end-benefit by one cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely true; it is correct. It has been endorsed by every member of the industry-the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd, the AMP Society, and every actuary. The only person who has got it wrong is the honourable member for Bradfield. Yesterday I sent him a note about 10 errors, with 10 replies to his errors. The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore decided to bring superannuation funds within the full ambit of the imputation system, giving them access to dividend tax credits. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this a tax of 15 per cent will apply to fund earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> But this 15 per cent tax can be neutralised or offset by the receipt of dividend tax credits. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also quite clear that the honourable member has great difficulty in understanding my earlier remark that the fund, by change of its portfolio, can derive considerable tax credits from the imputation system. He does not seem to understand the change in the composition of its investment portfolio. If he does understand it, he deliberately avoids it in the course of his comments.

<PARA>The amendment relates to measures contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1988 which prevent an undue reduction in tax liability where a holding company cancels for less than market value shares in itself that are held by a subsidiary company. The Government has decided to introduce a transitional measure to modify the legislation as it applies to a share cancellation that occurred after the date of the announcement of the legislation and on or before the date of its introduction into the House, that is, after 11 August 1988 and on or before 30 November 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> By this amendment, when shares held by a subsidiary and its holding company are cancelled, the subsidiary will be deemed to have received the lesser of the market value of the shares at the time of cancellation or the amount of any consideration given by the subsidiary company for the acquisition of the shares. If the capital gains provisions apply to the shares, the subsidiary will be taken to have received the lesser of their market value or their indexed cost based to the subsidiary or their cost base if the cancellation is within 12 months of the acquisition of the shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, this will ensure that the income tax position of the subsidiary is the same as it would have been had the shares been cancelled or otherwise disposed of for their cost price, or in the case of capital gains, for their indexed cost base or cost base as the case may be. The result of the amendment will be that in the period between the date of announcement and the date following the introduction of the legislation, the share cancellation provisions simply operate in line with the announcement of 11 August 1988. I commend the amendment to the Committee. In doing so, I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum which explains the amendment in more detail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not be opposing the amendment, although I wish to make some comments about the nature of the amendment, which has been brought on fairly quickly, at least to my attention. We will be giving it closer examination. If we have any further comments to make they will be made in due course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that concerns me most is that this is another one of those unintended consequences of the haste with which this Government introduces ideas into the public domain and then delays their implementation by way of legislation. This process of legislation by press release has been characteristic of most of the Bills that are before the House. One of the most untenable situations to my mind has arisen in relation to the superannuation legislation which became effective in July last year and where trustees, fund managers, superannuants and others had to operate in a situation where they had no idea what the legislation would look like. This amendment is in a similar vein. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the amendment deals with an unintended consequence. As originally drafted the legislation contained a retrospective element. I am not surprised that we find it containing phrases like, `a transitional measure to modify the legislation', and a whole host of what is gobbledegook about the nature of the valuation of share transactions simply to mask the fact that there was a significant element of retrospectivity in the legislation as drafted which I gather arose as a result of this matter being drawn to the attention of the Government by one of the parties concerned. I hope that the Government has learnt something from this episode-that it should not go off half-cocked in terms of major pieces of tax legislation. It should not rely on the process of taxation by press release. It should not move until, in most cases, it is in a position to put the legislation into place in a meaningful form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make one important observation in relation to capital gains in the context of this legislation. We are not moving a specific amendment in respect of capital gains. However, it is effectively taken care of by virtue of the earlier amendment that I moved which, regrettably, the Committee did not see fit to support. I want it to be recorded that the capital gains tax proposals are totally inequitable as they cause inequities in the treatment of individual unit holders in a fund depending on when they deposit or withdraw their funds from an approved deposit fund (ADF) or a superannuation fund. Therefore, on efficiency and equity grounds alone the capital gains proposals are seen as being unworkable and, in addition, they will result in higher fees and therefore fewer benefits to contributors. For that reason, as I said, we believe that the capital gains provisions are completely unacceptable to the Opposition and, of course, in government we would excise them from the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If any member of the Government believed in even half of the rhetoric on this superannuation package of legislation he would be voting with the Opposition on this side of the chamber. Much has been said tonight by the Minister at the table claiming that we on this side of the chamber are interested only in the upper end of business, ignoring the fact that the very substance of this reform is directed at helping the ordinary, average, and lower income families in Australia. The purpose of this reform is to increase the current threshold of $60,000, above which a tax of 16.25 per cent will be applied, to $125,000, above which that tax will be applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are simply meaning to do is increase the sum to the appropriate amount equivalent to what it costs the Australian taxpayer to fund a married couple through a reasonable period of life in retirement. We have taken the national average of life expectancy, we have multiplied that by the appropriate annual pension, and the amount we have come up with is approximately $125,000. If the Government members are truthful about their rhetoric and really believe the objective of this legislation which they claim to be that people should have greater financial independence in retirement, how is it that the Government can apply yet another, a third onerous tax of 16.25 per cent, including Medicare levy, to people who have lump sum payments in excess of $60,000?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table made the observation that, last financial year, less than one half of one per cent of people had superannuation lump sum benefits in excess of $50,000. What are we here to debate-the past or the future? What are we here to try to establish in Australian law-a set of principles that will encourage people to have greater financial independence in the future or is the Government prepared to put, in legislation, the onerous controls which will ensure that hundreds of thousands of people will continue to depend on the pension in the future? And why? Because Government members, in their small minds, are unable to appreciate the relationship between incentive and tax and, until they understand that basic principle, they will never be able to succeed in any area of taxation law and certainly not in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> By lifting, as we propose, the threshold from $60,000 to $125,000 Government members are sending a signal to every worker, to every manager, to every person who is able to save for his retirement and, hopefully, the hundreds of thousands of people who, because of the Government's taxation arrangements, simply say it is not worth their while to do so, that we want across the board in all parties in this Parliament as close a level of universality of coverage as possible. But, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate and as I repeat, in their small-minded approach they are regarding superannuation as yet another taxable milch cow and have missed the whole purpose of their legislation, which is to ensure that people have greater financial independence in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee at this late hour, I wish simply to implore and beseech Government members opposite that here is their opportunity to stand up and let the Australian people in their millions know that in the future we do not want their children to be saddled with massive social security debts because of an ageing population, that we want people to have greater freedom in their retirement. The only effective way of achieving that is by ensuring that from the time people first enter the work force they start putting aside a measurable amount of money on a regular basis, which will multiply over the years and give them a measure of real independence when they finally retire. The Government has not achieved that in its 3 per cent productivity schemes. It has not achieved that in the passage of these Bills through this chamber tonight. But I assure the Government that the Opposition parties here and in another place will maintain their rage and their interest in the welfare of the Australian people, because if the Government is not going to look after them, it is certainly our duty to do so. I formally move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speaking from a somewhat unfamiliar position in this chamber, I can tell honourable members that the world looks a little more distant, but no more distant than the practicalities of development in Australia under the concept, as the Government puts it, of a Resource Assessment Commission. We know that the Government itself is a bit of a sham and is labouring under significant difficulties. We know that in the reality of the marketplace those who run around with vocal minorities, wave banners and get their images on television and their voices on radio-and occasionally their names in print-are people who significantly frustrate the development and growth of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am delighted to see that my dear friend and old colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren)-battle scarred though he might be-at least had the courage of his convictions. Sadly, the members of the Government do not have that same forthrightness or ability to present their arguments knowing that nobody really senses that they believe what they say. The Resource Assessment Commission Bill is what might be called the Graham Richardson palliative, for if I have seen anybody who, as a latter day greenie, is more inept at presenting what is genuinely a requirement by all of us in Australia that our basic natural resources be protected, it is the person who, for the moment, is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is designed to try and somehow put in place a device which the Government says is going to keep the Graham at bay, to keep somehow his interventionary practice from frustrating the decisions of State governments which properly have responsibility for land use in Australia. This Bill has not been introduced because people genuinely believe that in some way it will facilitate the development of new projects. This Bill will not make it easy for those who are prepared to invest shareholders' money and taxpayers' money in order to develop. This Bill is designed to ensure that the Government does not have to take decisions. It is designed to ensure that minority groups will not be beating at its door with poor old `prevarication Bob' finding it hard to know which way to swing. This Bill has been introduced because the Government sees that it is going to help it get through a bit of political problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Government is not bad at trying to face political problems. After all, it has had more than a few little difficulties with the third runway at Mascot. The Government is not doing too well when it comes to trying to persuade the electors of Tasmania that the Tasmanian Government should not be returned. In fact, from what I can see, Robin Gray has run a great campaign and I look forward to being able to work with him when a coalition government is elected here. Similarly, I must admit that the Labor Party is not doing too well in the State seat of Merthyr. I will be interested on Saturday to see the result up there. In case Labor members have forgotten, we have a pretty good National Party in Queensland. The Labor Government here is finding it harder and harder to try and get people in Merthyr to accept that Mr Goss and his ilk need support. </PARA>
<PARA> With this Resource Assessment Commission Bill, as in Merthyr and in Tasmania, we have a Government trying to avoid taking hard decisions and facing up to the responsibility for where it goes. I say to the people in the Parliament: we need to comprehend something of the difficulties that face the Government. I know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Minister for Resources (Mr Cook) have found these super ministries a little too tough a nut to handle. The Australian Financial Review of 14 February reports that the relationship has deteriorated badly over the reshuffle of the responsibilities between the two key resource industry Ministers. We thought that was just an occasional shaft-a few honourable members have had one or two from me in the past and will continue to enjoy the same in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should not worry-we will be on the other side of the House and a few honourable members opposite will be over here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that according to the Sydney Morning Herald the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, decided he would use an Australian Petroleum Exploration Association conference to tell the world that the oil and gas industries are paying too much secondary tax. I found that very interesting because we know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy thought that was his bailiwick, and the poor old Treasurer must have thought, `I thought secondary taxation was mine'. Senator Cook-and bully for him-thought, `It might be a good idea if I let everybody know that I am going to get out there and battle for them'. The only problem is that, having made that speech, he has been put under wraps and nobody knows when anything will happen. I commend him for at least recognising that secondary taxation in the oil and gas industries is, frankly, far too high and is causing enormous difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> We have a device that is designed to avoid some of the complications in resource development in this country. It is also important to note that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories tells us, on the one hand, that he did not want to push for the Wesley Vale development but that, on the other, there was worry about adverse balance of payments problems. When the Government looked at Wesley Vale Senator Button said, `It would be great if Australia could process the pulp here. We have the resources, and it would generate jobs'. They seem pretty natural sorts of measures that a State government would want to encourage. One might even think that occasionally Federal Labor Government Ministers might think that jobs for the working men and women of Australia were perhaps worth supporting, but not so our environment Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody on this side of the House denies the impact of the pollution that may or may not have occurred from a pulp mill. Nor is it a fact that as far as we are concerned there should not be a proper appraisal of the environmental impact. Certainly, we are concerned about the effect on the fishing industry and about the general effect on the environment. But we are also worried that, as far as Senator Richardson is concerned, he remembered at the very last minute that we have a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation should be involved. One would think that even members of the Labor Party would know of the existence of the CSIRO. After all, they have done their best to destroy it. I commend the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), the Opposition spokesman on energy, science and matters relating to the CSIRO, for the way in which he has identified the progressive cuts masterminded by that great political strategist Neville Wran, as Chairman of the CSIRO, and implemented by poor old Barry Jones, whose science statement this week was supposed to be the great green light for the development of scientific resources in Australia. Frankly, it was a bit like a damp fish-a bit like my friend opposite, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). Every time I look at him I think of what would happen if we had a bait on the end of the hook. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble is that if Senator Richardson thought CSIRO was the right body to bring in, he did not bring it when the project was first developed. He did not go to the State Government and say, `We understand you have the land use responsibility. We know you want to create employment. But we would like to bring in the CSIRO to help you with the development of an environmental impact study'. No; that would be a far too rational approach for the Federal Government. What did the Federal Government do? It waited until the eleventh hour. The State Government had been coming and going, trying hard to reach a compromise between what it thought everybody wanted and development. Probably, it foolishly listened to Senator Button and thought that he meant it when he said, `We want development in Australia'. But Senator Richardson same in at the eleventh hour. </PARA>
<PARA> Our objection to the Federal Government's intervention is that it ought to be able to make up its mind and not listen to every two bob group in the community that tell people they have something to worry about. Frankly, I believe that the environment Minister's intervention was probably the catalyst for this piece of legislation. The Resource Assessment Commission Bill is designed to ensure that the environment Minister is not embarrassed by last-minute interruption to a major development proposal. It is fairly important that people in the resource industry understand that this Bill will not help them. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, but naturally, many of my friends in AMEC and in the Australian Forestry Council, who are looking to develop Australian industry, are saying, `We think this would be a great idea but we do not know how the devil to get through to these Labor people. This is the way the Government might be able to get some decisions out of them'. If the Government can tell me why it wants another layer of bureaucracy in Australia, why it wants somebody to stop the Government making decisions, why it wants to create a body which has no real responsibility, where the States, which have prime land use, are denied a voice in selecting special commissioners, why it wants a group that is constituted not to facilitate objections to development, then it has another thought coming. </PARA>
<PARA> The Resource Assessment Commission is not going to achieve what the developers, naturally, want. The developers, who are trying to do something about the chronic adverse balance of payments situation, want decisions made. They want a government that is prepared to get up and say, when a proposition is advanced, `These are the criteria we want you to meet. It is not an environmental problem. These are the ground rules. These are the obligations'. If the Federal Government is speaking to a State government it should say, `We are going to work with you'. We would prefer it if the State government did the environmental impact statement. We believe that there is a role where the Commonwealth and the States can surely at least talk to each other. We know that is hard. We saw what the poor old Minister for Primary Industries and Energy did to the wheat Bills. What has happened to the complementary legislation that successively, over the years, coalition Ministers seemed to be able to negotiate?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the wheat Bills have done a great deal for me. They have enabled me to tell the people of Australia that 90 per cent of what the National Party wanted it has achieved. That is far more than the honourable member is going to achieve in the seat of Denison in his short term life in this Parliament. I will be interested to see the result of the Tasmanian State election on Saturday. I wish Robin Gray well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill does not provide, therefore, for the proper, rational balance between Federal and State governments. It does not facilitate decisions, and therefore it should not be supported. People need to put the frustrations that developers in Australia feel against some of the headlines about declining oil availability, for example. There is one in the Sydney Morning Herald of 2 May that interested me, `Oil deficit heads for $10m a day'. </PARA>
<PARA> People need to understand that Labor has increased the degree to which our Budget each year provides for interest payments that are now second in outgoings. Our overseas debt and our chronic balance of payments are realising an aspiration of the Treasurer for the banana republic status that he mentioned some time ago. With the oil deficit heading for $10m a day, why does the Government want another layer of bureaucracy? Why is it employing another group of people to stop it making decisions? It would be a good idea to lay down the guidelines. Where are the guidelines for Wesley Vale? Months after the whole thing has been shelved and another one seems to be developing, why can the Government not tell the community what it wants? It cannot do so because it decided it would set up another body. It wants another bureaucracy and a few more jobs. If the Government thinks that is good for Australia, then what the devil is the Government about?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a problem. Australia has run up a petroleum trade deficit of $413m this year. That is a little more than $1m a day. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 2 May forecasts that within the next few years it will be as high as $10m a day. By the end of this century it will be 10 times worse than it is today. The deficit will be $3.7 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks to make it harder and harder for the oil industry, for those who are involved in oil exploration, for members of the Australian Pipeline Industry Association, to do something. If the Government is going to have all these interventionary processes people have to understand that that is the price of Labor. Have they thought of all the millions who work under the guy who sits in the box seat occasionally in this House? They ought to look at what he suddenly tries to do when he thinks that the populist cry requires his intervention. It was reported in the Australian Financial Review on 5 May that Mr Silver Hair himself had voiced his strong opposition to mining Antarctica. I would be delighted if the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said a bit about mining in Australia, if he expressed a few views about development in Australia and if he did not create a Resource Assessment Commission designed to avoid his having to take decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The statistics are pretty worrying throughout the mining field. The Bureau of Mineral Resources has given projections of mineral resource exports between the year 1988 and the year 2000. One would think that it would know a little about what was going on. The rate of growth in export revenue between 1980 and 1988 was 100 per cent. In 1988 export revenue amounted to $17.2 billion. It will rise to only $21.5 billion in the year 2000, a growth of 1.9 per cent. I think that is appalling. In other words, what has happened in the last eight years is that, taking benefit of the policies we introduced, the Labor Party has been able to benefit and Australia's exports have benefited by a growth of $9.2 billion to $17.2 billion. Between now and the end of the century they will go up by only 1.9 per cent. I ask why this has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable members might have attended the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC) conference last week. The guest speaker was the Prime Minister. He did not say very much about how his Government is going to try to facilitate growth and development and he did not say very much about how the new mineral resources will be developed. Even the Treasurer did not say anything to us about the balance of payments or when he will redress the situation. I think that people need to understand that the Resource Assessment Commission will frustrate the position even further. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members thought that that area is bad, they should look at the industrial record. The Prime Minister has claimed to have done many things for Australia. He has said, `Things have been quite out there in the industrial environment. The ACTU loves us and we love it. It is a great little happy band of brothers'. The only difficulty is that if we look at the industrial area and the mining area, what do we find? `Strikes take highest toll since start of the accord', says the Australian Financial Review of 4 May. The biggest percentage increases over the figures for the previous year occurred in coal mining, 73.2 per cent; other mining, 65.8 per cent; and metal products, machinery and equipment manufacturing, 56.8 per cent. What is the Government doing? The Government says, `We are going to help you make decisions. We are introducing another body, the Resource Assessment Commission. We are not getting rid of the strikes'. The strikes take place because the Government really has not addressed fundamentally the failure of the accord. The Government has not deregulated the labour market. The poor old wheat cocky can have this lot. The Government does not worry about the guys who are really causing problems for Australia-the members of the trade union movement that the Labor Party needs to survive. I do not think it is good enough, and the Resource Assessment Commission is not good enough either. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members thought that that is bad enough, we have another area that affects all this development-the amount of land that is locked away. If honourable members look at the AMIC report of 1988, they will find that conservation parks, reserves and other areas, not including marine parks, take up 5.6 per cent of the available area in Australia. Aboriginal owned or controlled land, including land under claim in the Northern Territory, not including national parks, takes up 14.1 per cent. Land subject to owner veto in Western Australia and possible future problems in the Northern Territory, Tasmania and Queensland, not including Aboriginal land, takes up 3.3 per cent. Other areas, including defence ranges and training areas, all of the Australian Capital Territory, restrictive coastal zones and some urban areas, et cetera, take up 0.5 per cent. Future wilderness areas proposed by conservation interests not including areas in existing parks, reserves and areas already restricted are foreshadowed to take up another 11 per cent, and we are told that land subject to future veto and conservation areas take up another 22.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening to Australia? We have a device here, a Bill that is designed to put in another intervening process. There is no power in that Bill to do anything about unlocking land. There is nothing in this Bill about looking at who has the rights for land use or how we will overcome the areas of Australia that are locked up. We are not saying that the Government should not exclusively reserve some types of land. We are saying that it is important that people understand in Australia that we have a chronic adverse balance of payments problem. We are saying that it is important to get a balance between protecting the environment and proper development considerations. We are saying that multiple land use is possible in Australia. We are saying that the Government should approach this subject rationally and make decisions as a government. It should recognise that some areas must be locked away, but it should recognise equally that in relation to some of the areas that potentially could be locked away as well as some of the areas that are now locked away it is denying any opportunity for profitable development and any opportunity to generate more export revenue. Frankly, the sooner this Government realises that the more we get into hock the more our living standards fall, and the more our living standards fall the more the Australian people suffer, the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be a good idea. That is probably a very sensible suggestion. What will be the first reference to this inquiry? It will of course, be the forestry industry. I support the proposition that there should be some rational examination of the forestry industry, but why the devil does the Government have to set up another body to do it? I do not know whether honourable members opposite understand that in the past few years imports of forest products have been consistently valued at approximately $1.5 billion, whilst exports have been valued at about $400m. That is not just a statement out of the blue, it is contained in a press statement made by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) on 9 December last year. I find it fascinating. This concerns an industry in relation to which people are saying, `You know, it is pretty nasty out there cutting trees. Gee, it is bad to see an industry that has existed since the establishment of white settlement in Australia, an industry which has contributed thousands of millions of dollars in income over the years, which generates employment for so many people. It is terrible to let that industry survive!'. What did the lot opposite do in relation to north Queensland? The industry in north Queensland has been managed effectively and well. If there is need for change, sure, we can talk about it where it is needed. But the Government is locking up enormous areas, and never mind the consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. It has led to the desecration of many of the jungles and forests in lands where governments cannot afford to say no, where environmental considerations do not matter. What is the Government going to do? It will set up a resource inquiry. It will not in any way prevent the making of an environmental impact statement, it will set up another forum, another bureaucracy, another layer so that the poor old Government cannot be forced to make decisions. It is not good enough. It is not as though things are too certain even in our mining industry. The Minister for Resources has told us that the world iron ore industry has been badly squeezed in the past few years. We know what has happened to steel demand and we know about the variations in coal prices. We know all the problems that exist out there, and I think it is about time the Government did something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to this side of the House, our resources policy is designed to address the decline in petroleum self-sufficiency; encourage the discovery, appraisal and development of our resource base; encourage conservation measures in the use of energy; encourage the use of renewable energy resources; support measures which add value to our resources; improve the efficiency of mineral and energy industries; develop an internationally competitive and reliable export sector; and facilitate Australia's access to international markets-and we are actually going to take the decisions that should be taken by government. We are not going to set up another body to do it. I think Australia will be much better off as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested a while ago to read a statement by Senator Richardson about encouraging uranium exports. We know that the Government has decided that it is not going to get rid of the three mines policy until after the next election. We also know that the Government is not going to do anything about removing full price controls. However, we will. We also know that it is about time the Government did something to lift the three mine policy. It does not mean in any way that we will remove adequate environmental controls and international safeguards, it means that we will the industry to compete in a market in which, as all we know, prices are fairly depressed at the moment.

<PARA> The right honourable member for New England whinged a lot about the establishment of the Resource Assessment Commission. He said it would restrict the miners and the oil companies from going about their business of exploiting Australia. He said that approximately 40 per cent of Australia was locked away from the exploiters. The Australian Minerals and Energy Council (AMEC) must have had its figures mixed up somehow to have come to that sort of a determination.

<PARA>The announcement that the Labor Government will establish a new body, the Resources Assessment Commission, represents a major triumph from the Federal Coalition. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Can I be reading it correctly? Yes; the Press release does have the shadow Minister, Christopher Puplick, saying the Labor Government's move is a triumph for the Federal coalition. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The decision to establish a Resources Assessment Commission picks up several of the Coalition's new policy proposals, specifically those related to:</PARA>
<PARA> environment and economic impact statements;</PARA>
<PARA> land inventory proposals and assessments;</PARA>
<PARA> prior evaluation and resolution of environmental disputes; and</PARA>
<PARA> the need for formalised decision making processes to replace ad hoc responses to every dispute or crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>Do not forget that this is not a member of the Australian Labor Party speaking. It is Senator Christopher Puplick the shadow Minister for the environment. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In picking up these Coalition policies I have no doubt the quality of environment policy decision making will be much improved, and this is to be welcomed for Australia's sake. </PARA>
<PARA>This was said on 21 November 1988. Here we have a complete flip flop once again. We have had this with the coalition leader, so I suppose this is a change in their policy. The coalition was all for this just a few short months ago, but here they have turned around. It is strange how the conservative parties work. If the Opposition can see some advantage somewhere it will go for it. I think that probably the AMEC or some such body has given the wink and the nod knowing that there is an election coming up. In today's Australian newspaper there is the heading `Opposition rejects environment body'. The article states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one chairman and he can coopt other people. The honourable member said that the Resource Assessment Commission will override the rights of the States. It does not intend to override State's rights. The States have been informed of the RAC's intentions and progress on details from the beginning. The States are being offered the opportunity to have further discussions. As the RAC is modelled on the Industries Assistance Commission, there will be ample opportunity for the States to contribute to the final advice through the process of consultation which is practised extensively on this side of the House. As we know, it is not practiced on the other side of the House. The right honourable member for New England said that establishing the Commission is an attempt by the Minister to walk away from difficult land use decisions. He said that the RAC will provide independent advice to the Government on difficult decisions. The final decisions on these matters will still be made by the Government. The right honourable member said that the RAC is a mechanism to prevent undue influence where vested interests have high stakes in the results of land use decisions. I could go on a lot about this legislation, but I realise that many people are waiting to retire for the evening. However, I would like to raise a couple of things that the Liberals do when they get into power. Let us have a quick look at what has happened in New South Wales without this Resource Assessment Commission. A heading in a newspaper reads, `Greiner to defy Canberra on logging'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Greiner Government yesterday threatened to defy Canberra in National Estate forests. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Minister for National Resources, Mr Causley, put the Federal Government on notice he would allow sawlogging of the forests-even if Canberra prevented woodchipping. </PARA>
<PARA>In the short time he has been in office, Mr Greiner has broken more than 100 promises. I do not have a couple of hours to list them all; they just go on and on. However, there was one promise that he did keep. He was elected probably on this one promise, and he has kept it. He promised that he would abolish two great national parks-Tantawangalo and Coolangubra, and he is about to try to do that. These parks were of course set up by Bob Carr, the great Labor leader in New South Wales and a great environmentalist. I have heard many of his speeches. He is also a good bush walker. I have read a little bit about him and I enjoy bush walking myself. The only way that one can really appreciate what goes on in our forests is by going and having a look.

<PARA> A NSW minister has urged the forest industry to `crack political heads' and make political threats to ensure its victory over conservationists. </PARA>
<PARA>The article was quoting Mr Causley, the Minister for Natural Resources. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Causley said the timber industry now had a fighting chance to win its battle against conservationists-due to the solid political support it was receiving from the Greiner Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Greiner Government is backing the extortionists who are threatening poor conservationists who are fighting to save this planet. Through the power of big business those people are trying to threaten and crack heads. It is disgraceful what they are doing up there. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the subject of New South Wales let me quote another article headed `Mineral search in proposed park area'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Pickard, has granted mining exploration leases in an area which the Government considered making a marine national park. </PARA>
<PARA>That is near the Solitary Islands near Coffs Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA>The islands are the breeding grounds for many seabirds and the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These are the sorts of things that are now going on in New South Wales. One can only imagine what would happen if a Liberal-National Government got into power federally. The place would be opened up for mining. There would be developments all along the coast. Nothing would be left sacred. As the right honourable backbench member from New England said, 40-odd per cent of Australia is locked away. That would all be opened up, and very soon mining and exploration would be going on there, and further areas of Australia would be ruined. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Any consideration of the establishment of an air link between Australia and Taiwan would take place against the background of terms of Australia's acceptance of the government in Beijing as the sole legal government of China and our acknowledgement of its claim that Taiwan is a province of China. The Chinese government considers that establishment of an air link with Taiwan is a matter concerning China's sovereignty and that countries must consult with China before proceeding. The issue has been raised with the Chinese government.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (4) No. There can be no formal government-to-government negotiations or air services agreement between Australia and Taiwan, as Australia does not have any official relations with the authorities on Taiwan. Commercial aviation interests in Australia and Taiwan are nevertheless consulting about whether it might be possible to establish air services in the absence of such an agreement. It is too early to speculate on the outcome of these discussions.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Visitor visas for Taiwanese are assessed in the same way as those of other applicants. Because Australia has no representation in Taiwan, applications are assessed and visas issued by officers based at the Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong. The Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO) in Taipei, which is operated by the Australian Chamber of Commerce, provides a visa facilitation service which expedites the movement of documentation between Taipei and Hong Kong.</PARA>
