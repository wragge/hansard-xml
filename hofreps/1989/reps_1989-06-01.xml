<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mergers Takeovers and Monopolies: Profiting from Competition? is the first report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It presents the Committee's findings and recommendations in relation to its inquiry into the adequacy of the existing legislative controls over mergers, takeovers and monopolies. The inquiry was initiated in February 1988 following public criticism over the level of takeover activity and industry concentration in Australia. Much of this concern related to the often frenetic takeover activity that occurred prior to the October 1987 market adjustment. The inquiry focused on the merger and misuse of market power provisions contained in sections 46 and 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The effectiveness of the Trade Practices Commission in its implementation of those provisions was also examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the commencement of the inquiry and prior to two very important judicial decisions relating to the key provisions under scrutiny, my impression was that there would need to be significant amendments to the Act. It was also apparent to me that there should be greater opportunity for public scrutiny in relation to the administration of the Act. The Committee nevertheless approached the inquiry with an open mind. It sought and received evidence from a significant number of participants in the trade practices field, including the regulatory agencies, government departments, consumer organisations, business representatives and other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the breadth of issues and opinions which emerged, the Committee conducted a workshop which provided those who made substantive submissions to the inquiry with the opportunity to test and challenge each other's views in an open forum. This workshop was attended by the senior and leading players in the trade practices field. The evidence gathered at the workshop was of great benefit to the Committee in the formulation of its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also took account of the significant developments in the trade practices field in the course of its inquiry. These developments ought not to be underestimated in terms of their importance to the Committee's conclusions. They were, for example, the appointment of a new chairman of the Trade Practices Commission and the announcement of a modified approach to merger regulation by the Commission. Further, the landmark High Court of Australia decision in the Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd case, relevant to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act, proved to be of crucial import. Again, the favourable decision for the Commission in the Australia Meat Holdings Pty Ltd case was of considerable relevance to section 50 of the Act. These developments have strengthened the mergers and misuse of market power provision of the Act and have created a more favourable environment for the enforcement of those provisions by the Commission. In the absence of these developments, more substantial changes than have been recommended in the report would, in my view, have been required. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point it is important to note that the Act has a double thrust. Firstly, it should be seen as a consumer protection Act, based on the presumption that effective competition is simply a means to that end. This fact was emphasised by the High Court in the Queensland Wire Industries case to which I have referred. At the same time, this objective must be balanced against the need to promote efficiency and competitiveness in Australian business and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1977 section 50 has facilitated the rationalisation and restructuring of Australian industry through mergers and takeovers. Where this has increased the potential for anti-competitive behaviour, section 46 has offered protection against the misuse of market powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the report, the Committee has made a number of significant recommendations aimed at improving the enforcement of the merger control provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Chief among these is the Committee's recommendation that the private right to injunctive relief in merger cases be reintroduced to the Act, so that persons other than the Minister or the Trade Practices Commission can apply for an injunction in respect of a contravention of the merger provisions. This is a substantial recommendation for reform, which will ensure that private resources are brought to bear in the war against anti-competitive mergers. It will, as a result, facilitate further development of section 50, allowing it to be tested on an ongoing basis. However, because of concerns that the proposal may be used as a tactical weapon to delay or defeat takeovers, the Committee has recommended that takeover targets and associated persons should be excluded from this right. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also made a number of recommendations to enhance the role and effectiveness of the Commission. In this regard, the Committee welcomes the modified approach to merger regulation enunciated by the Commission in its Statement of Objectives, Priorities and Work Program for 1988-89. This approach, which places greater emphasis on the authorisation procedure for mergers with the potential to affect market dominance, and which subsequently will allow greater public scrutiny of such mergers, will help to allay recent concerns about the role and effectiveness of the Commission. However, as there remains some concern that the approach is at the discretion of the incumbent officers of the Commission, the Committee has recommended that the Attorney-General issue a direction that the current policy of the Commission towards merger regulation be continued, to ensure that there is a consistent and standardised approach to the public scrutiny of public benefit issues in merger regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that the informal consultative process for mergers, which has allowed business to consult with the Commission about mergers which may have risked breaching section 50, should be given legislative underpinning. This will provide significant advantages, particularly in terms of public accountability considerations and the effectiveness of undertakings entered into as part of the process. Essentially, this should comprise legislative backing for extra statutory activities already carried out by the Trade Practices Commission. Any formalisation of the process should be of a minimal nature. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant problem identified by the Committee, arising out of the consultative process for mergers, is that adequate information does not appear to have been made publicly available to allow sufficient public scrutiny of the Commission's decision-making processes. The absence of publicly available information has clearly contributed to the level of criticism generated in recent years as a result of controversial mergers. To remedy this situation, the Committee has recommended that the Trade Practices Commission extend the use of its public register to all merger matters, including matters considered under the consultative process. All matters should be placed on the public register within 12 months, unless there are significant confidentiality problems. </PARA>
<PARA> To strengthen the position of the Trade Practices Commission, the Committee has recommended that the Trade Practices Act be amended to provide statutory remedies in respect of undertakings entered into by proponents of mergers as a condition of both the authorisation procedure and the consultative process for mergers. Statutory remedies will give greater force to undertakings made to the Trade Practices Commission. For example, the need for such remedies was highlighted by the Skywest case involving the Ansett takeover of East-West Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing remedies for contraventions of section 46 and 50 were also found to be totally inadequate as an effective deterrent to any corporation or individual contemplating a breach of the misuse of market power or merger provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The current levels of pecuniary penalty attaching to a contravention can hardly be considered realistic in a commercial environment, and may well encourage firms to engage in a cost-benefit analysis. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended a substantial increase in the existing maximum pecuniary penalty. As the Committee considers that pecuniary penalties may not be the most appropriate remedy in every case, it has also recommended that a range of other appropriate remedies be introduced and that the court be provided with broader discretionary powers in relation to the range and level of penalties which may be imposed for contraventions of part IV of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the courts, the Committee is of the view that the Federal Court of Australia remains the most appropriate forum for resolution of matters under part IV of the Act, and there is a need to enhance the effectiveness of the court in this area. The Committee has recommended options in that context. The Committee has recommended that the Attorney-General develop appropriate procedures for improving coordination between the Trade Practices Commission and other regulatory agencies which deal with various aspects of merger matters. This will help to ensure that other agencies, such as the Foreign Investment Review Board, give consideration to the attitudes of the Trade Practices Commission in relation to merger matters. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point, I must stress that improvements in the trade practices area are sustainable only if there is an active enforcement of the legislation. In this regard, the Committee has recommended that the Trade Practices Commission maintain a pro-active approach to the regulation of the merger and misuse of market power provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The Committee endorses the view of the Australian Consumers Association that the Trade Practices Commission, as the main consumer protection agency in Australia, should `rigorously enforce the provisions of the Trade Practices Act to ensure that consumers' rights are not infringed'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, of course, recognises that a more pro-active approach will entail greater demands on the resources of the Trade Practices Commission. In this regard, the Committee is concerned at claims by the Commission that its efforts to promote competition have been severely hampered by the lack of its resources. The Committee is particularly concerned that, if resource constraints feature as a fundamental part of the Commission's decision-making processes in relation to whether it should pursue breaches, there is a strong possibility that the Trade Practices Commission may eventually represent little more than symbolic reassurance for the community. (Extension of time granted). To remedy this situation, the Committee has recommended that cost recovery measures be introduced in relation to the regulation of mergers.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to sections 46 and 50, the Committee has recommended, on the basis of the substantive evidence before it, that, for the present, the merger and misuse of market power provisions of the Trade Practices Act should be retained in their existing form. The recent High Court decisions in relation to both sections have demonstrated that the existing provisions are capable of achieving the purposes for which they are intended. The overwhelming evidence provided to the Committee was that sufficient time should be allowed to ensure that the force and effectiveness of the existing provisions, as recognised in recent judgments, can be fully realised. The Committee considered at length various proposals for reform, particularly in relation to the merger provisions in section 50. Chief among these was the suggestion to abolish the existing dominance threshold and to replace it with a test which would prohibit mergers which result in a substantial lessening of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the various proposals for reform are inappropriate at this time. During the inquiry, there was considerable opposition to such reforms. Proposals such as a return to the substantial lessening of competition test would involve a significant lowering of the threshold at which mergers would be prohibited. This has the potential to inhibit industry restructuring and rationalisation. Superficially, it may be appealing to alter the wording in the existing provisions to indicate a greater emphasis on consumer protection. However, this ignores the considerable uncertainty which would result if untested provisions were inserted in the Act. The recent Australia Meat Holdings case has clearly demonstrated the capacity of the courts to interpret the existing dominance threshold so as to ensure adequate competition in a market. On balance, therefore, the Committee favours retention of the existing dominance threshold in section 50. The Committee is of the view that the need for improved efficiency and increased international competitiveness has not diminished in the last decade. Indeed, the contrary is the case. Retention of the existing provisions in section 50 will ensure that there is no legislative impediment to the achievement of efficiency and competitiveness through the rationalisation and restructuring of Australian industry. One difficulty which the Committee faced in its assessment of the issues was that the existing evidence on mergers and takeovers is inconclusive. The lack of empirical data was a fundamental problem in the course of the inquiry and the Committee has made certain recommendations to ensure that position does not continue into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending retention of section 50 in its existing form, the Committee was, of course, conscious of concerns about increasing levels of concentration in industry, and the potential for misuse of power which may arise. In this regard, the Committee recognises that an effective provision to prevent misuse of market power is an essential, indeed fundamental, counterbalance to a policy which encourages acquisition and rationalisation. At the outset of the inquiry, it was apparent that varying judicial interpretations of section 46 had created considerable uncertainty about the operation of the section. It was suggested that the narrow interpretation of the existing provisions in recent case law indicated that there may be limits to the section. However, the recent High Court decision in the Queensland Wire Industries case has provided much needed clarification of section 46. While not all areas of concern have been resolved, clearly this case has made a major impact and provides significant guidance to practitioners in the area. The Committee does see a need, though, to clarify some potential areas of concern, and has accordingly recommended that the Trade Practices Commission issue guidelines on the operation of section 46. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee supports the retention of the existing provisions in sections 46 and 50 at this time, it has adopted this position only on the premise that there will be an active enforcement of those provisions by the Trade Practices Commission. I reiterate that this can be achieved only if sufficient resources are made available to the Commission. If sufficient resources are not forthcoming, then serious consideration will need to be given to strengthening the merger and misuse of market power provisions of the Trade Practices Act. I cannot stress that too strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman, I would like to thank the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and my fellow Committee members for the time and commitment they devoted to the inquiry. Thanks are also due to the Secretary of the Committee, Mr Jon Stanhope, as well as to Mr Andres Lomp and Ms Natalie Raine. </PARA>
<PARA> Mergers Takeovers and Monopolies: Profiting from competition? will contribute to a greater awareness of the legislative and administrative controls necessary to ensure genuine and robust competitive behaviour in the business environment in Australia. The recommendations in the report are based on a reasoned assessment of all the evidence before the Committee and have attracted bipartisan support. Adoption of the recommendations will help to ensure a continued commitment to the consideration of public interest issues in the implementation of Australian trade practices legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs until today-I have been translated, in a sense, and will not be able to continue my involvement with the Committee, but I value the time I have spent with it-I am pleased that we have been able to complete this important reference. I join the Committee Chairman, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), in commending to honourable members the Committee's report on mergers, takeovers and monopolies. The report is based on a realistic assessment of the environment in which the Trade Practices Act is required to operate. While protection of competition for the benefit of consumers is clearly a major objective of the Act, the Committee has acknowledged that improved efficiency and international competitiveness in Australian industry are a vital factor in determining the most appropriate approach to merger regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need to promote efficiency and competitiveness through industry rationalisation and restructuring was a catalyst for the 1977 amendments to section 50 of the Trade Practices Act. In introducing the control and dominance threshold to section 50, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There should be no unnecessary impediment, legislative or administrative, to the attainment of rationalisation of Australian industry. It is in Australia's best interest to achieve economies of scale and improved international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>This approach was continued with the 1986 amendments to the Act, which saw the section 50 threshold changed to dominance. In recommending that the dominance threshold test be retained, the Committee has not shied away from the reality that rationalisation and restructuring of Australian industry, in order to improve efficiency and international competitiveness, are as important today as they were in 1977. During the inquiry, there was considerable debate about the most appropriate wording for sections 46 and 50, to ensure that the dual aims of consumer protection and business efficiency are achieved. The Committee received much evidence about the effectiveness of the existing provisions and how they could be improved. Reflected in the various proposals for reform, though, was a significant degree of uncertainty as to their implications for the future operation of Australian competition policy. This uncertainty contrasts with the degree of clarification which has been provided recently by the courts in relation to sections 46 and 50. The Australia Meat Holdings case and the Queensland Wire Industries case are significant developments in the trade practices field. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Meat Holdings case is only the second fully-argued section 50 case since the Trade Practices Act came into force in 1974. It reflects the preparedness of the courts to assess dominance in order that effective competition in the market is maintained. The Queensland Wire Industries case provides much needed clarification of the provisions in section 46. The decision has been arrived at after various judicial interpretations indicated possible limits to the operation of the section. In the light of these developments, the Committee had decided that further time should be given for the testing of the existing provisions. While developments in the law often involve a lengthy process and while some areas of concern remain, there are, at this stage, sound reasons for not rushing in to implement reform. It would, I believe, be unwise to move from a position of some clarity to one of potential uncertainty. The evidence before the Committee has not adequately demonstrated the need for amendments to the existing provisions of sections 46 and 50. Indeed, the overwhelming evidence supports the retention of the existing provisions, as recommended by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to contain my remarks I was going to go on and deal with aspects of certainty and uncertainty. However, I wish to cover some other issues, particularly in relation to the public interest questions that are involved. In conducting the inquiry, a broad approach to public interest considerations in the Trade Practices Act was taken. The Committee did not specify particular industries or markets for special attention. Nevertheless, it did consider evidence which pointed to factors peculiar to the media as justifying a special case for defined restrictions on the level of ownership and control of the print media, principally to secure and maintain freedom of expression. In this regard, it should be noted that the Parliament has seen fit to legislate in relation to radio and television ownership, and it has taken newspapers into account where broadcasting issues are concerned. There is, of course, no such legislation dealing only with newspaper ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is conscious of, and sympathetic to, the heightened public expectations that appropriate levels of competition are maintained and, where possible, improved in the newspaper sector. It therefore considers that an inquiry being undertaken by the Trade Practices Commission into certain issues concerning the degree of concentration of newspaper ownership in Australia, which currently has a narrow focus, should be broadened to enable a serious examination of the extent of the powers available to the Commonwealth in relation to the newspaper industry. The examination should consider what, if any, special provisions are appropriate in relation to newspapers. I would like to have been able to talk about the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>

<PARA> Unfortunately, I was not able to participate in the New Caledonia trip led by Senator Chris Schacht and therefore will confine my comments to the New Zealand leg. This visit was a significant development in the already substantial level of contact between the parliaments of both countries and emphasised the recognition on both sides of the Tasman of the special relationship between our two countries. Discussion has been under way for a number of years to revise the parliamentary contacts, to move away from general fact finding visits to areas that are more specific in their purpose. Following Prime Minister Lange's visit to Australia in August of last year, the subject was again examined and agreement reached to suspend the usual visits conducted under the Fraser-Talboys agreement for a period of two years while the new exchanges were instituted and evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Pacific Subcommittee of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee had an invitation from the New Zealand Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee to visit New Zealand. The Presiding Officers of the Australian Parliament agreed that this Committee be the first to undertake a visit to New Zealand under the new arrangements. A special working group based around the South Pacific Subcommittee, of which I was the Chairman, was formed to undertake the visit. The working group consisted of Senator Chris Schacht, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and myself as leader. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to the members of the delegation for their hard work and the bipartisan manner in which they participated in the visit. The program of the visit is set out in the report and it will become apparent that in the three days the Committee spent in Wellington the delegation was able to discuss many matters of mutual interest in the foreign affairs, defence and trade areas not only with our counterpart committee but also with Ministers of the New Zealand Government, officials and members of the business community. The program was very full and on a number of occasions discussions could have continued well in excess of the time allowed. We have therefore recommended that future exchanges be at least four days in length, and in my opinion probably five days, with a little time off in the middle to catch one's breath, and contain two sessions with the host committee-one at the start of the program, similar to the one we had, and a second at the end where the issues raised in briefings can be discussed in a committee meeting in the latter part of the five-day visit. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to go into detail on all the issues canvassed during our visit, but I would like to refer to one issue that was raised with us many times in discussions-the Anzac frigate program. The delegation's purpose was not to lobby for New Zealand's participation in the program as some New Zealanders thought, but once the matter was raised we engaged in some vigorous discussion and debate on the subject. I must say that we were dismayed at the generally poorly informed level of debate on the whole question and the lack of information about the economic benefits of the program, in particular the $NZ1 billion-plus that would come through the New Zealand defence manufacturing industry, which is a sizeable injection into the New Zealand economy. Unfortunately, New Zealand business appeared to be generally uncertain of the benefits and also reluctant to promote these benefits. On the other hand, I can understand this reluctance as the New Zealand Government has failed to commit itself firmly to the project at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> What was most disturbing to the delegation, however, was to hear the program referred to as the Australian frigate program and to hear claims that Australia was attempting to sell New Zealand these frigates. The program has been a cooperative effort of over two years' standing, reflected in the title Anzac. Tender redesign work was undertaken to modify the design to meet both the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy requirements and a memorandum of understanding on the program was signed in March 1987. The delegation found it difficult, therefore, to understand why the debate in progress in New Zealand on the surface combatant had not occurred at the time of the publication of the New Zealand White Paper or the signing of the memorandum of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> In presenting this report to the Parliament, I wish to commend the concept of committee exchanges. The visit proved to be a most effective way of enhancing dialogue and understanding between the two parliaments on matters of real substance. The Committee fully supports the continuation of such exchanges beyond the two-year trial period. New Zealand is not only a close neighbour; it is one with which we have strong links of language, culture and history. It is therefore important to strengthen the contact between the parliaments of both countries. The continuation and expansion of such committee exchanges should receive high priority from both parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> The exchanges that took place were very frank and informative. Indeed, the flow of information between the two committees was most valuable. As I mentioned before, this not only occurred between the two committees but involved other business people and officials as well. I found some of the discussions with the officials, particularly of the Department of Defence and the Department of External Relations and Trade-which is the equivalent of our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-most informative, and the cross-flow of information most valuable, particularly relating to South Pacific matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of the inaugural exchange was made possible by many people in both countries, and on behalf of the delegation I would like to thank the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the staff of the Australian High Commission in Wellington; the New Zealand Department of External Relations and Trade and Internal Affairs-in particular, Mr Jim Blair for his kind assistance; and, not the least, members and officers of the New Zealand Parliament for their assistance and hospitality. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak in relation to the tabling of these two reports in relation to the visit to New Zealand and the visit to New Caledonia by the subcommittees of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The subcommittees were formed specifically for the purpose of undertaking each of the visits. I endorse the comments made by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles), particularly in relation to the hospitality that we received. In my brief contribution I want to take this opportunity to emphasise to the Parliament the importance of visits of this type within our own region. Honourable members would be aware that the opportunity that is afforded to us to undertake study tours all too frequently means, in relation to the way that those programs are arranged, that we go to those places which are usually more difficult for us to reach, and more expensive in a sense, and thus very often there is little in the way of resources to maintain the important relationships within our own region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> New Zealand, one of our closest neighbours, is one of those places that honourable members do not often get to, and for that reason I think that the exchange program is of the utmost importance to this Parliament. It is of the utmost importance in ensuring that there is a more adequate understanding of the issues that bring us together, as well as of those on which we disagree. We had an opportunity to explore many of these questions. The importance of our common economic relationships was one of those issues which we spent a good deal of time addressing. Defence relationships was another matter that was of importance, and the report itself is valuable for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member who spoke before me in this debate, did not accompany us on the visit to New Caledonia, and so I would like to speak briefly on the report in relation to the visit there. The visit to New Caledonia was not able to be undertaken when the South Pacific Subcommittee undertook its program of visits to a number of nations in the South Pacific, and so we went to New Caledonia after we had in fact reported. </PARA>
<PARA> The report presently before the House covers a good deal of the difficulties that the South Pacific nation of New Caledonia has. I would like to highlight some of those matters. In relation to the matters that have been addressed, the historical background is canvassed and the political future is addressed. Importantly, we commented on our meeting with Jean-Marie Tjibaou, who was the leader of the Kanak people. Our meeting with him took place only days before he was assassinated. In that sense, the visit was of greater moment for us because of his role in the establishment of the accords whereby a modicum of peace has been achieved in New Caledonia at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> We spent a good deal of our visit endeavouring to assess the political future of New Caledonia. I want to emphasise the amount of time that we spent during our visit discussing with the Kanak people the way in which they relate to land, the issue of land ownership and the issue of custom authority and the way in which decisions are made. Those of us who, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have taken an interest in Aboriginal affairs in this country will be aware of the importance of land to the Melanesian people and will appreciate the way in which decisions need to be made, taking into account the special relationship that exists. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interregnum it has become clear that the French are faced with considering the way in which our European background might well bring about changes in attitude amongst the Melanesians in terms of their custom authority, decision-making processes and attitude towards land. One of the important issues to be considered and to keep on top of is this issue of land ownership and custom authority. If the way in which the Melanesians handle these matters maintains a traditional approach, I do not believe the accords will deliver other than a new Melanesian nation in New Caledonia. If, however, the Melanesian culture is broken down so that individual land ownership becomes the norm, I suspect we will be more likely to see the integration of New Caledonia into metropolitan France being maintained even after the 10-year trial period of the accords. Many of us do not have the background and experience to be able to examine these issues. I certainly hope that those who have the opportunity to visit New Caledonia in the future will make the sort of inquiry which we did, which is referred to in this report, as it will give them a better understanding of the future which that country may have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to contribute for three or four-perhaps five-minutes to this discussion. First of all, I would like to endorse what both the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) and my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) have said, which is that there is a tremendous advantage not only in visiting a country which is a neighbour, but in visiting any country. One thing which emerges, which is almost like a conscience vote in Parliament, is that we seem to set aside our political differences. I would like to pay special tribute to the honourable member for Isaacs. I have been on a few delegations with him, and he has a very commendable bipartisan attitude in these matters and a true sense of what is required on these trips.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to pinpoint one or two matters which are of basic importance in relation to our discussion. Much has been said about the discussions regarding the frigate program. One fact which did emerge and which, perhaps, has not been fully aired is that the people of New Zealand-and this became very evident as we spoke to various groups-did not really know what it was all about. They were not aware of the fact that 12 frigates were envisaged-we were to have eight and the New Zealanders were to have four. Over and above that, they were not aware of the most basic consideration of all for a languishing economy such as they have, regrettably, and that is that $1.3 billion would be spent in New Zealand if the agreement were to be concluded.</PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which all of us appreciated very much was the general attitude of the various Pacific islands to both countries. I have always been an advocate for making it a little easier for people to visit this country. I do not mean unlimited migration from the Pacific islands, because the islanders would not want that and I am sure that we would have to give very serious thought to any migration from anywhere. It emerged that, experimentally, a period was set aside whereby people of the Pacific islands could visit New Zealand without any inhibitions such as visas. Apparently, many of those people came and settled permanently, which created a bit of an uproar. The experiment lasted for only six weeks. Another matter of great importance, which does not really concern us-we do not go poking around the world to interfere in other people's affairs-relates to the contributions that Japan has made to assist the Pacific islands. Such assistance is to be greatly encouraged but it was, perhaps, a little misplaced. I refer to financial assistance where much more advantagious contributions could have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the general feeling towards Australia, there have been differences of opinion. Fundamentally, we realise that we are very much of the same ilk and that we think along the same lines.</PARA>
<PARA> A point which is of special interest to me, as one who comes from the remote areas, was the change in thinking in New Zealand in relation to defence and security. The accent had been taken off that to a great extent. We used to think of New Zealand as one of the flag-flying countries loyal to the throne to the nth degree. If we are honest enough to admit it and to face up to the realities, that has been somewhat dissipated. I say with a good deal of pride that that has been put down to the fact that many people in rural areas have drifted to the city. When the hardy, tough people from the rural areas move to the cities to enjoy the comforts that many city people have available, there is a general dissipation of the more rugged characteristics of any country. It is said that that has led greatly to the situation</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with a prophecy. One does not set oneself up as a prophet unless something can be gained from it. Any of us who read the press and observed and met the man would concede that in the not too distant future-perhaps after another election or two-a man named Winston Peters will be the Prime Minister of New Zealand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe from 19 June to 14 July 1988. Given the publicity that this trip has gained, this report may well set a precedent for parliamentary reports by being a best-seller. I hope that all honourable members will find time to read it. I also hope that the unfortunate publicity earlier this year which tended to trivialise the trip will not detract from the important conclusions contained in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to place on record my appreciation to the delegation members, especially my two Labor colleagues, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey), Mamma Crawford and Mamma Harvey. Having two women parliamentarians with us enabled us to gain additional and most valuable insights into many aspects of the countries we visited. To our hard working secretary, Peter Keele, I give a special word of thanks for carrying out his difficult duties under what were often very trying conditions. I thank our foreign affairs adviser, Michael Potts, for ensuring that our view of Australian policy was always correct. I stress this because there has been some criticism. All statements by me and all press releases issued were checked for accuracy with our foreign affairs advisers and local diplomatic representatives. I thank also the parliamentary and departmental officers for their help, especially Bronwyn Allen, whose assistance to the delegation went far beyond the normal call of duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The main objectives of the visit, as outlined in the brief and in the pre-departure briefings, were to foster goodwill and to develop closer ties between the Australian Parliament and the people, parliaments and governments of the host countries. It was also felt important to state Australia's position regarding current events in southern Africa as well as to seek the views of the countries that were visited. I believe that the visit was not only timely but of considerable significance, because many events are unfolding in this part of Africa that will have an important bearing on the future direction and well-being of the entire African continent over the next decade. For this reason it is a matter of personal regret to me that the tabling of this report has been delayed while the Opposition members came to an agreement on their dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is only fair to put in the record that it was a physically demanding trip. The comprehensive programs arranged in each country enabled the delegation to cover a wide range of fundamental issues which were discussed at length during the numerous meetings with heads of state, politicians, government officials, business leaders and representatives from numerous international and non-government organisations. One of the most satisfying things to come out of the visit was the clear and unambiguous message of the very high regard in which Australia is held in all four countries. It was put to the delegation time and time again that, unlike many other countries, Australia has an unblemished record in African affairs and our assistance and support has been very well received and appreciated. Australia must continue to support the development and humanitarian goals of the African people. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue stressed in the report concerns the closure of our embassy in Addis Ababa. All members of the delegation were of the view that Australia should be re-establish its embassy in Ethiopia not only from the point of view of that country's importance because of its population and strategic location but also because Addis Ababa is the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity. We feel the decision to close the embassy was short-sighted and wrong and we urge that serious consideration be given to reopening it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record our appreciation of the hospitality, cooperation and courtesy extended to all members of the delegation. Nothing was too much trouble for our hosts and the itineraries in each country were testimony to their willingness to meet all our wide-ranging interests and demands. The delegation is also grateful to our Australian representatives in the countries visited, especially Mr Doug Campbell and Mr Phil Peters, who helped make our visit a very productive and informative one. I reject utterly the criticism made of our representatives in some statements I have read. </PARA>
<PARA> In no way do I regard this report as the definitive statement on the affairs in each country visited. The report endeavours to give an accurate account of the various meetings and visits undertaken by the delegation. The report has commented on only the matters that were discussed and not on hearsay evidence or second-hand information. Whilst it is regrettable that the coalition members felt it necessary to submit a dissenting report, the Government members nonetheless respect their right to do so. I am pleased that they have no disagreement with the main conclusions of the report. However, the Labor members of the delegation think it is naive that the coalition members would have expected to hold official meetings with opponents of the governments of Ethiopia and Mozambique at a time when both countries were engaged in civil wars. </PARA>
<PARA> The main report highlights the major problems faced by Ethiopia and Mozambique. We believe that Tanzania needs to continue its austere economic recovery program under the leadership of President Mwinyi. We were impressed with the success achieved in Zimbabwe under the astute and conciliatory leadership of President Robert Mugabe. We are conscious that Zimbabwe faces a number of major problems, particularly in relation to investment and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> There were differing views between the Government and Opposition members of the delegation. No restrictions were placed on any members of the delegation at meetings with regard to questions and comments. Naturally, Government members did state official Government policy. It would have been a dereliction of duty if an official Australian parliamentary delegation did not state clearly and precisely current Australian Government policy. What I think upset coalition members was my stress on the bipartisan nature of much of Australia's policy in relation to Africa. As must be obvious to many members, given some recent comments in this House, some Opposition members were outraged by my giving Malcolm Fraser due recognition for his role in Africa and his position as co-chairman of the Eminent Persons Group. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be obvious to any thinking person that if South Africa did commence a program of genuine reform, it would be able to play a key role in economic development not only in southern Africa but throughout the entire African continent. This was a clear message from many Zimbabwean politicians, both black and white. South Africa cannot continue to ignore the rightful demands of the majority of its people. As Nelson Mandela said at the Rivonia trial:</PARA>
<PARA>We want political rights because without them our disabilities will be permanent . . . it is not true that the disenfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and when it disappears so will the domination of one colour group by another. </PARA>
<PARA>Zimbabwe is certainly testimony to this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the coalition members, the Government members of the delegation did not see examples of `Australia's often ill-conceived and inappropriate assistance'. The Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat (ECS) Food for Work dam project near Asmara, the Konso soil conservation project and the Gidole reafforestation project near Arba Minch are good examples of cost-efficient and effective Australian aid projects in these parts of Africa. We are, therefore, somewhat surprised by the statement that `Australia must concentrate its activities on those matters on which it has most to offer-such as in rural skills like prevention of land degradation and reafforestation programs'. These were the very projects we saw. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Labor members were surprised at suggestions that Australian food aid is being diverted. When members of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee visited Ethiopia in 1988 they were impressed by the degree of accountability the Ethiopians displayed towards the proper distribution of food aid. The Labor members of this delegation also support this view. I cannot help thinking that, unfortunately, much of the Opposition members' dissenting report indicates a certain prejudice or hostility by some of them towards current Government policy on Southern Africa. I suggest that this could even indicate a certain hostility by the same members to coalition policies towards Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor members of the delegation have no argument with the final paragraph of the dissenting report. Indeed, we endorse the comments and we would further suggest that all members of outgoing delegations must fully acquaint themselves with the brief prior to departure and if they have any difficulties with that brief they should be raised at that stage of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take this opportunity to put on the record my concern about the need for Parliament, through the Presiding Officers, to establish a set of clear guidelines relating to the conduct and participation of delegation members and any accompanying spouses. I also suggest that it is important that all members of any outgoing delegation arrive together and participate in all official meetings, briefings and functions unless there are extenuating circumstances. A commitment by any member of parliament to participate in any outgoing delegation should be seen as a commitment to participate in the full program that has been set down by the host countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that this delegation was able to forge closer ties with all host countries and this will reflect well on our Parliament and Australia. On a personal level, I believe that members of the delegation have developed strong and lasting friendships with many of our African brothers and sisters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only 2 1/2 minutes in which to speak. Many positive things came out of the visit to Africa of this delegation and it is regrettable that the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who was the leader of the delegation, did not even mention the Opposition members as participants. As deputy leader of the delegation, I pay tribute to the coalition members-the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and Senator Michael Baume-for their participation. This delegation started off on a bipartisan basis but, regrettably, it did not end that way. I will not elaborate on that. However, I will take up a couple of points made by the honourable member for Throsby. He mentioned the question of spouses. Of course, spouses should go on delegations and that practice should continue. Secondly, he mentioned that some members had not attended all official programs. At times there were extenuating circumstances in which members could not attend functions. On one occasion I had to have my blood pressure checked and while I was away having that done attention was drawn to my absence. That is a lot of rot. It is ridiculous even to comment about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our host countries extended the greatest hospitality to us and our visits to these countries have left an indelible mark on most members of the delegation. I mention too that I was one day late coming to Ethiopia. Most people know that an invitation was extended to me to go to South Africa, and I did. Members of the Australian Labor Party go to Cuba and other countries but nobody makes any mention of that. I went to South Africa to look at it and form my own opinion of what should be done there. Of course, I am against apartheid. We wanted to look and make certain for ourselves that the South Africans are trying to overcome that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zimbabwe all we heard about most of the time were the problems of South Africa, that South Africa was the problem of people's downfall in those countries. Socialism is not working there and we all noted on our side that there were problems associated with that. We know that those countries have poverty. We know that they have got problems. We went there to try to make recommendations so that Australia could help in some positive way. </PARA>
<PARA> Two and a half minutes does not give me very much time to elaborate on all these sorts of things but the most important thing that I saw will always be an indelible part of my memory. When we went to Ethiopia we saw the Sudanese coming in their thousands, dying because of the problems associated with their country. Genocide was even mentioned. For a long time that will remain with me and I am sure with the members of the delegation who went with me. I will give the remaining 2 1/2 minutes to my colleague, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a scandalous situation that the leader of the parliamentary delegation, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), has so manipulated the situation as to delay the tabling of this report in the House until almost 12 months after the trip took place, on the very last day of the parliamentary session. Members of the delegation are restricted to a miserable 2 1/2 minutes in which to put their case. In fact, in a breach of parliamentary convention the honourable member for Throsby tried to take up all the time allotted to the debate for himself. I am indebted to the Deputy Speaker for extending the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning in the `Stay In Touch' column that the honourable member for Throsby has even stooped to issuing press releases, without any attribution whatsoever, attacking the coalition's dissenting report before it is even tabled. If the honourable member for Throsby has to resort to what in spirit is a breach of parliamentary privilege in this manner he deserves the House's strongest condemnation. He does not even have the spine to put his name to these releases, which not only attack our report but also make a childish and inaccurate personal attack on me. Surely it is illegal to issue anonymous press releases in this place, especially when making an untrue personal attack on a member of this House. This sort of sneaky, pathetic, behind-the-back behaviour is typical of the sort of nonsense that coalition members had to put up with for the duration of the African trip. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the honourable member's behaviour throughout the trip, it is incomprehensible that anyone who had his eyes open in some of the countries we travelled in could ignore the brutal regimes ruling them and the most appalling human rights records imaginable. Ethiopia's Mengistu regime has slaughtered a million of its own people since it assumed power. It is incomprehensible. It is amazing that a report can be brought down which slavishly parrots the Marxist government lines that were fed to us. We only had to look out the windows at the people in the street, let alone talk to them off the record, to see what they had to put up with. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming impression I got from this trip is that there is no need for these countries to live in poverty. They have a wealth of natural resources almost beyond belief. It is only a failure to utilise them, due to corruption, bureaucracy, et cetera, which causes the problems. We need desperately a multi-party democratic system in those countries. Much of the foreign aid we give these countries is useless. It props up governments over there and prolongs the misery. Evidence exists that much of our aid and that of other countries is going to feed the Ethiopian Army in its 27-year-old war in Eritrea. If we must give aid, it should be given through non-government organisations such as the Red Cross, Catholic Relief, et cetera. The problems of these countries are largely of their own making. Every refugee we saw was created by government rather than by drought. The aim of this Government should be to put pressure on the Ethiopian Government to stop the war in Eritrea and to call for full, fair and free democratic elections in these countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present the report of the Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and to the Republic of Ireland. I am happy to be able to report to the House that the parliamentary delegation to Britain and Ireland was a far happier delegation, obviously, than the one to Africa. I would like to thank the members of the delegation, who worked very well together, and the officials who accompanied us. It was an historic delegation-the first time that a delegation had visited Britain from this Parliament for some 17 years and the first time that there has ever been a delegation from this Parliament to the Republic of Ireland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one recalls that about 30 per cent of the people who live in Australia claim some Irish connection, it is remarkable that there has never been a visit to the Irish Parliament until 1988. It was 17 years since the previous visit to Britain, the country that colonised Australia. It shows that often we take for granted the links between countries where we have had a lot of cultural, economic and family ties. The delegation was very keen to point out to the Parliament that we should ensure that those links are made stronger in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that while we were in Britain we made arrangements for the beginning of a bilateral exchange between this Parliament and that of Britain. I hope that that bilateral exchange will also extend to Ireland. While there is not a great deal of trade between Australia and Ireland, the greatest thing that Ireland has given Australia has been its people. From my point of view and, I know, that of other members of the delegation, it was remarkable that when we arrived in Ireland we really recognised it as being the country in the world that is probably the most like Australia in terms of its people. We most certainly felt that we were at home. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a lot of that had to do with the excellent assistance we were given by the Speaker of the Irish Parliament, Sean Treacy, and the work that was done on our behalf by Ambassador Milne, who was our Ambassador to Ireland at the time. The person who took his place, Brian Burke, is also doing a wonderful job on behalf of Australia. Doug McClelland, who is well known to all of us and who is our High Commissioner in Britain, arranged very high level contacts between the delegation and people in Britain, as did Ambassador Milne in Ireland. We met with both the Prime Minister of Britain and the Prime Minister of Ireland. We met the foreign Ministers of both countries and a number of other senior Ministers. Those contacts were very worthwhile for members of this Parliament to put our view on what Australian people feel-particularly in relation to the European Economic Community and its trade embargoes. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had interesting discussions-and I might complete my remarks on this-with John Hume in Northern Ireland. All of us were saddened by what is happening in Northern Ireland but when we talked to people like John Hume we realised that there is some hope for the people who live there. One would hope that all shades of politics could take note of the view of a person like John Hume, who is willing to put his life on the line for the cause that the people of Northern Ireland should be able to live together in peace with each other. It was a saddening visit to the north of Ireland but the discussions we had with John Hume made us believe that at least there were some people who had the interests of all of that province at heart. One hopes that the current changes that are taking place in that troubled part of the world will be for the better and along the lines of the views of people like Hume. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to thank the delegation once again for the harmonious way we all worked together. Let us hope that future delegations from this Parliament are more like the delegation to Great Britain and Ireland and less like the delegation to Africa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to speak to the tabling of the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. I would like to pay tribute to all members of the delegation, particularly for their 100 per cent bipartisan attitude, unlike that of other delegations of which we hear. It was particularly pleasing for me to visit the land of my childhood during Australia's bicentennial year as an Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of the remarks that I would have liked to make have been made by the delegation leader, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), to whom I pay a great compliment for the way in which he handled the delegation. But that was to be expected from our Deputy Speaker in any case. I would like to pay tribute also to the deputy leader of the delegation, Senator Glen Sheil, who during the tour managed to hide a very personal grief. The members of the delegation would be aware of what I am referring to. </PARA>
<PARA> For me as a product of Ireland, the privilege of arriving in Ireland as a member of the first official delegation ever to go to Ireland was absolutely thrilling. I find it very hard to explain my feelings as I put my feet back on Irish soil once again after 30 years away. I commend the delegation again for its bipartisan attitude and leave the remainder of the time for discussion of the report to another member of the delegation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. I endorse the comments of the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), particularly the thanks he expressed on behalf of the delegation. As one of the members of the delegation, I express my thanks to him for his leadership and the able way in which he undertook the task of ensuring that our program was completed. The learning experience was a valuable one for all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might assume that a delegation to the United Kingdom and Ireland would be a visit of some moment. It was also a visit that enabled us to address very important issues facing both the United Kingdom and Ireland and the people who live in Northern Ireland. It also enabled us to look at matters that are likely to significantly affect Australia. The comments I make are in relation to those two aspects, and firstly in relation to Northern Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA> The visit included a period in Northern Ireland. All of us read about the tragedy that faces families and people who live in that area, and all of us never fail to be moved by the trauma that individuals face. This was not the first time that I had been to Northern Ireland. I had been there earlier as a visitor under a program sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom. I undertook that visit in 1983, so this visit was an opportunity for me to meet the participants on a second occasion. The judgments one makes are very much more valuable if they are formed over time. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the overwhelming impression that I came away with, having talked to political leaders in the United Kingdom and southern Ireland, and having met political leaders in Northern Ireland-although they were different personalities on this occasion-was that everyone on all sides was taking a constructive approach. For me that was the most beneficial aspect of the visit, together with meeting a great human being in the person of John Hume. We heard from him as to his proposals for the future and the way in which others are now prepared to talk with him about the issues, although they are not necessarily of the one view. That was a useful advance on the position I experienced in 1983. I came away very much more optimistic for the future of Ireland than I was on the last occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to address briefly is the importance of 1992. We discussed economic questions. It ought to be clearly understood that the harmonisation program between members of the European Community will be significant. For Australia, which seeks to trade in Europe, the opportunities are there for us now to get involved. If we leave it much later, 1992 will be a period that we will remember for the extent to which it closed off opportunities for Australia in that region. Those issues are addressed in our report. It is a valuable document and it ought to be seen in that context. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Bureau of Statistics Amendment Bill, which we have in front of us for consideration today, is an absolute and abject waste of the time of this Parliament. It is simply nothing more than a reflection of the malicious and small-minded nature of a minority of people who happen to be on the Opposition side of this Parliament in trying to attack an institution that was established in the period of their time in government. It brings to this place no credibility whatsoever. It is an outrageous attack on the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Opposition members have made spurious claims about the Bureau in the past, and the Bill has proven to be nothing more than a vehicle for self-promotion by certain members of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill would have an impact in two ways. Firstly, a detailed proposal, together with questionnaires, would have to be tabled in both Houses of Parliament for each and every collection of information undertaken by the ABS, including the renewal, repetition or revision of the survey. Does the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson), who introduced the Bill, recognise that in 1987-88, for example, something like 1,600 surveys were undertaken by the ABS? If the Bill were passed, every time one of those surveys came into the House or the Senate it would have to be examined. There were 1,600 surveys in 1987-88; how many will there be in the future when we try to obtain further information?</PARA>
<PARA> I say by way of general comment that if this Bill were passed, all proposals would be subject to disapproval and disallowance by either House of Parliament. How ridiculous is that? Basically there are two sides to this Bill: a policy side and a practical side. On the policy side, it should be pointed out that the ABS was set up in 1975 as a statutory authority with the role of providing statistics for governments and the community generally. In fact, in parliamentary debates at the time this statutory authority was established, the government of the day spoke highly about the need for it to remain aloof and not to be subjected to government pressure. This Bill goes entirely against that grain. For clarification of that point, I refer Opposition members to the speeches made when the Australian Bureau of Statistics Bill was introduced in order to create the ABS. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, I refer to some of the features of the Bill and some of the flaws in its approach. In the second reading speech of the honourable member for Page, given on 10 April 1989, we can identify at least 10 areas in which there are not only omissions but also serious errors of fact. Firstly, it is stated in the speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Under present arrangements, if the Government Statistician wishes to make a compulsory survey, he is required to table his proposal in both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA>Under current arrangements the Statistician is required to table only new proposals. This is where Opposition members have tried to generate interest, saying that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has ruled that each new survey must be presented here and that some of the extensions of surveys presently under way will have to come before this Parliament. That is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point raised in the second reading speech of the honourable member for Page referred to the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Statistician did not table the present household expenditure survey . . . </PARA>
<PARA>An extensive campaign has been waged by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) and Senator Shirley Walters on this topic, in particular on the household expenditure survey (HES) of 1988-89. They have said-and they have tried to prove-that, in some way, the existing survey is brand new; that it is totally different from what has happened in the past. In August 1988 the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) ruled that the 1988-89 HES was not a new proposal. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Moreton and his cohorts did not agree with that. In fact, they attacked the Australian Statistician and claimed that he had misled the Attorney-General's Department and sought other legal advice. The Attorney-General's Department sought independent legal advice and got it. In December 1988 the Attorney-General's Department again concluded that the HES for 1988-89 was not new and, specifically, that it was not significantly different from the 1984 HES forms that had been approved by a previous government. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all those claims and counterclaims, legal opinions were obtained by the Opposition to the effect that, basically, the ABS is unaware of where that legal advice comes from. It is referred to by the honourable members for Moreton as an expert statistical analysis. Regardless of that view, clearly legally, from independent analysis and from the Attorney-General's Department, this is not a new survey and, therefore, it does not need to be tabled in this Parliament. Again a further spurious claim is contained in the speech on the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of voluntary and compulsory filling in of surveys has also been raised as part of a scaremongering tactic that is being waged by honourable members opposite and the leader of that scaremongering campaign has been the honourable member for Moreton. Let us look at the term `voluntary and compulsory nature of ABS collections'. I refer the honourable member for Moreton to section 6 (3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . each new proposal for the collection of information for statistical purposes by the Bureau shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament, unless the proposal is for the collection of information on a voluntary basis. </PARA>
<PARA>When that is the case, there are two aspects: by request or by direction. No prosecution has ever been approved in relation to any household income or expenditure survey or any health survey. The honourable member for Moreton has been racing around his electorate claiming that the ABS will take people to court and that they will have to pay a $100 fine if they do not provide this information because it is compulsory. There have been all sorts of scaremongering tactics. Press releases have been put out, but, fortunately, the more responsible parts of the media in this country have not chosen to run with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Moreton, having failed to achieve any sort of media response, starts writing letters to editors and letters to the editor columns have been filled up with nonsense. When that does not get very far he races off to the union and says, `Do you know that your census collectors, who are part of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association (ACOA), for example, are being harassed? People really should not be doing this because it is illegal and legal opinion says that the compulsory filling in of the forms is not the way to go'. What is ACOA's position? ACOA wrote to the honourable member for Moreton in relation to this matter and said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have not had any complaints from members about householders' reactions to this survey. The only complaints we have had relate to activities by yourself and others in Queensland who are opposed to the survey. </PARA>
<PARA> Our members do not find these activities helpful to them, or to the conduct of their work. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have the honourable member for Moreton again using scaremongering tactics, trying to do something about the situation. What is even more worrying in this whole matter is the harassment to which the honourable member for Moreton referred in respect of the census collectors and those who were getting this information for the ABS. That is not where it is really happening. The harassment is coming from people, such as the honourable member for Moreton and others, harassing the collectors themselves and there is evidence to suggest that that is the case. For example, I refer to one letter that was written to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The letter, which was addressed to the person who runs this section of collectors in Brisbane, was a letter of resignation from one of the ABS collectors. I will not refer to the person's name to protect that person from further harassment from honourable members on the other side of the chamber. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> Interviewers are being subjected to an increasing amount of verbal and physical abuse in the field. In some instances, interviewers have been contacted at their homes both by phone and letter by a member of one political party. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members would not have to guess which political party that is. It is not ours. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I consider this is a gross case of Invasion of Privacy and should have been followed up by the Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA>I submit that that is absolutely correct; the Bureau should follow up that accusation about harassment and about the invasion of people's privacy. Let me add the weight of further evidence to this. I have in front of me a copy of a `With the compliments of' slip from Mr D. M. Cameron, MP, Federal member for Moreton. Contained on that slip is a handwritten message to a collector of the ABS. Again I will not read the person's name to protect this person from further harassment. The message reads:</PARA>
<PARA> An HES respondent has advised me you are an ABS collector. In view of past association I wish for you to be aware I am not carrying on about nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>The message goes on. So, in other words, the honourable member for Moreton, who purports to represent the view of the community, is harassing census collectors and subjecting them to all forms of pressure, both at home and through letters. Again, he is bringing this place into disrepute by using these scaremongering tactics. I turn now to another aspect of this barrage that has been launched against the ABS. I go to the issue of letters that have been written to various newspapers around the country. A letter headed `Survey flouting law' which appeared in the Sun-Herald on 14 May 1989-on page 159, for reference-was signed by Don Cameron, member for Moreton, and Shirley Walters, senator for Tasmania. Two very interesting things come out of that article. Firstly, the honourable member for Moreton says:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman from many private citizens and the undersigned, the Ombudsman conducted a six-month investigation, which he has now completed. </PARA>
<PARA> In his report, he states that there are significant legal problems that he is unable to resolve. He states: `If a definitive answer is required, then it would seem necessary for the matter to be tested in court'. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me just go to what the Commonwealth Ombudsman actually said. Let us get the facts right and let us put them on the public record to show that the honourable member for Moreton and Senator Shirley Walters are selectively quoting from the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report. After six months investigation, 15 legal advices, 20 or more written submissions from the honourable member for Moreton, 20 telephone conversations with the honourable member for Moreton, extensive correspondence and discussions with Senator Walters and 2,000 folios on the file of the honourable member for Moreton, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, in paragraph 242 and following paragraphs of his report, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> I accordingly do not consider that the Statistician was wrong to implement the original 1988 HES without tabling it . . . Nor does Senator Walters's complaint provide grounds for concluding that it was unlawful to implement the tabled 1988 HES . . . </PARA>
<PARA>At paragraph 243 he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I further consider that the HES is not oppressive or unreasonably intrusive, bearing in mind the public interest in collection of the information and the protections for privacy . . . It is desirable, however, that the ABS continue to monitor the operations of its interviewers to ensure that there is no undue assertion of ABS powers or harassment of householders. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude: the harassment is not coming from surveyors going out to get information; it is coming from others. Finally, at paragraph 246, the Ombudsman concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> I am satisfied that the Attorney-General's Department properly reviewed its legal advice in the light of other legal opinions and factual information . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the ABS did not mislead anyone but might well have sought an independent assessment of differences between HESs at an earlier stage . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the fact of the matter. It is not as the honourable member for Moreton has suggested in his letters to the editors in the newspapers which chose to run them. It is in no way a reflection of that at all. That is not only grossly misleading but also is stretching the truth to the nth degree and it is doing nothing more than continuing this harassment of the ABS and the census collectors and continuing this malicious vendetta which the honourable member for Moreton and other people in this place seem to want to become involved with. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that one has to be aware of what the information is used for. The household expenditure survey, which my colleague the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) who will speak in the debate no doubt will go to, provides information for such dreadful things as measuring the CPI. Oh, shock, horror-we are going to measure the CPI to find out by how much prices have gone up around Australia! Do members opposite suggest that we should not do that? I would hope not. The other information is used not only by the Commonwealth, but also by State agencies. There is therefore some question about whether the legislation proposed by the honourable member for Moreton and his attack have any relevance whatsoever to the States. We cannot bind the States with this legislation. The legislation is a waste of the time of the Parliament. It is nothing but self-promotion. It is spurious legislation that has no place here. The ABS is continuing to do the job for which it was established by members opposite when they were in government. It is a malicious vendetta conducted by honourable members in this place who should know better. I reject outright the contents of the Bill and believe that to continue with it wastes the time of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the benefit of the assistance of Mr McLennan and Mr Skinner from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), who are here today obviously to support the Australian Labor Party people in trying to distract attention from the real intentions of this legislation. I inform the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), that the letter to which he referred was run in the newspapers and-I want the honourable member to listen to this-its content was approved by the Ombudsman. It was sent to him by Shirley Walters and me and was approved. The Ombudsman advised Mr Castles that this was the case. I notice representatives here from the ABS are asking another Government speaker to come over so they can give him more of their information; it is a battle between the bureaucracy and the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to my alleged harassment of ABS collectors, if the worst I have done is send a Mrs Boardman a copy of a report with a `with compliments' slip, they have been spared by comparison with what happens to many of the people who are chosen to do surveys. The only collector I can recall speaking to was a lady who was at one respondent's home and I spoke to her on the respondent's phone and later contacted her about another aspect. It is my recollection-we are talking about eight or 10 months ago-that that is the extent of this so-called harassment. I ask the previous speaker to accept that the ABS itself is trying to whip up a phoney campaign and accuse people of doing the things at which its officers are most professional. All this is said in the context of the ABS having more people on its staff as a proportion of the population than any other country. I am quite happy to have heard that in 1987-88 the ABS conducted some 1,600 surveys, because it shows the extent of its activities and indicates the truth of my reference to its staff ratios. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics Amendment Bill was introduced into the Senate and passed through it without dissent. It was a private member's Bill which had the total support of Australian Labor Party, Independent, Australian Democrat, National Party and Liberal Party senators. The complex voluntary-compulsory nexus surrounding the conduct of Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys is one that in the past 12 months has created differences of opinion between and has caused a great deal of confusion among such people as the Commonwealth Ombudsman, legal advisers, members of parliament, the ABS and a multitude of survey respondents. This argument and confusion stems from the fact that the powers to conduct compulsory surveys emanate from two separate Acts-namely, the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act and the Census and Statistics Act. Under section 6 (3) of the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act, the ABS is provided with the power to conduct new proposals for statistical collections on a compulsory basis if such proposals are tabled in both Houses of Parliament beforehand. Under sections 10 (4) and 11 (2) of the Census and Statistics Act, the Statistician is given the power to direct respondents to fill in forms and answer questions with the threat of the imposition of $100 per day fines if such a direction is not obeyed within fourteen days. </PARA>
<PARA> The baffling co-existence of the two Acts has led to suggestions that the Statistician can direct people to provide information under the Census and Statistics Act without having first complied with the relevant section 6 (3) provision in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act. That is, it is claimed he can simply ignore the legislative need to table a new proposal in both Houses of Parliament if it is to be conducted compulsorily, and rely on his powers of compulsion in the Census and Statistics Act. Conversely, the Statistician can set in place the framework for a compulsory survey, refuse to confirm that it is compulsory, and then compel any unwilling respondents to answer questions under the threat of a $100 per day fine. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the complex interrelationship between these two Acts and the amount of discretion that is placed in the hands of the Australian Statistician, the respondents to Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys are made to endure a highly perplexing, catch 22 type interviewing procedure which has been ingeniously developed by the ABS with the aim of maximising response rates and minimising adverse publicity. Initially, respondents receive a welcome-on-board letter informing them they have been chosen to be part of an ABS survey which will have a multiplicity of important benefits for a wide array of government and non-government organisations. Soon after, they are visited by an interviewer who will entice their willing co-operation in the conduct of the survey and reinforce the claimed benefits to the community that will be derived from the survey results. If the respondent enquires about whether the survey is compulsory, the interviewer will, on the first two occasions that the question is posed, re-emphasise that the ABS is seeking his willing co-operation. At last year's Estimates hearings Assistant Statistician Skinner said-he is here today and can go to Hansard for confirmation of this if he needs to-on the third occasion the question is asked, the respondent will be told that the survey is compulsory. During that evidence it was also admitted that when household expenditure surveys were voluntary, interview instructions were that people had to ask three times before they were told the survey was voluntary. I object most strongly to the past and present approach of people not being told the truth from the very beginning, and a system whereby interviewers are trained to be less than honest when dealing with the people who provide their salaries. </PARA>
<PARA> If the respondent still refuses to co-operate, things begin to hot up. He or she or the family is forced to endure more letters seeking willing cooperation, phone calls, visits from more senior interviewers seeking co-operation, letters outlining the enforcement clauses in the Census and Statistics Act and even, in some cases, verbal threats of possible fines from frustrated interviewers. If the respondent still continues to refuse, the ABS may allow a cooling period and then return to see if there has been a change of heart. Alternatively, the ABS may decide to disappear altogether, thus making a mockery of the survey's compulsory nature. Then again, that endless seeking of so-called willing co-operation may continue unabated. One Brisbane family reported to the Commonwealth Ombudsman that it had 18 such visits last year because of its disinclination to be part of the current household expenditure survey (HES). I call that harassment of the worst kind. Alternatively, the Statistician may decide to send a person a letter directing him to do the survey within fourteen days and advising him that he is liable to be prosecuted if he does not comply. If he decides to disobey the direction, the Statistician then makes a decision as to whether he will proceed with prosecution-and it sure does happen. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Commonwealth Ombudsman's recent report on the conduct of the HES, I am advised that the ABS has agreed to change its procedures in relation to its interpretation of the compulsory nature or otherwise of the ABS surveys. Whereas previously the ABS admitted that it conducted all of its surveys on a compulsory basis and would eventually tell respondents that a survey was compulsory, it seems it has now decided that it will avoid declaring surveys voluntary or compulsory and will rely on advising respondents of the enforcement powers that are available to the Statistician. This change in policy more accurately reflects the complicated legislative framework the ABS works under. However, I firmly believe that it will result in even greater confusion in the minds of respondents. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the legislation gives tremendous powers and discretion to the Australian Statistician and the ABS. It is he who decides whether the benefits derived from a survey warrant the invasions of personal privacy that are involved in the collection of the information. It is he who decides whether the information is to be collected from respondents on a voluntary or compulsory basis. It is he who decides what techniques are to be used to collect the information, including whether or not he is to prosecute those who refuse to comply. The collection techniques used in the past by the ABS have certainly been reasonably successful in maximising the response rates to the surveys. However, it is most significant that the ABS now appears to be paying a high price for its reliance on a mixture of enticement, persistence and veiled threats. Its integrity as an honest and up-front statistical gathering organisation is being brought more and more into question both in this place and in the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two reasons why this is occurring and in combination these two reasons render it imperative that decisions in regard to the compulsory status or otherwise of ABS surveys be no longer at the sole discretion of the Statistician. They should be made by the people's Parliament which, unlike the Statistician, can more objectively weigh up the need for statistical information against the protection of the privacy and the civil rights of individual Australians. The deterioration of the Bureau's public image has been caused, to a large extent, by its own inconsistent statistical collection techniques. It is necessary to point out that, when one calls a spade a spade, practically all ABS surveys are compulsory. However, in terms of the ABS's collection techniques, its surveys are voluntary if one wants to do them and compulsory if one objects to doing them. If one is willing to put one's bankbook on the line and refuse point blank to comply, one enters a tunnel of darkness and only time will tell the outcome. I contend people are entitled to know where they stand from the first point of contact. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of parliament, I have on several occasions made requests to the ABS that the very elderly, the infirm and genuine conscientious objectors not be required to complete surveys. With one recent exception of a 93 year old widow-I give the ABS marks for this-I have been informed that the ABS could not afford to have its supposedly scientifically-based random selection system put at risk by releasing even one person from the thousands selected. If this is true I can only ponder at the accuracy of the results of the current HES because more than 200 households have so far refused to be part of that survey. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the many statements and threats about the compulsory nature of surveys, the ABS has proceeded to prosecute only 47 non-business survey respondents over the last five years. Far from subscribing to mass prosecution for non-compliance, or suggesting that respondents should attempt to run the gauntlet, this figure shows an incredible degree of inconsistency by the Bureau in terms of enforcing the compulsory nature of its surveys. I again refer to the current HES as a prime example. Despite issuing a myriad of statements about the compulsory nature of this survey in newspapers, in background papers and in letters to parliamentarians, and despite repeated visits and phone calls informing a large number of respondents of the compulsory nature of this survey and the issuing of threats about the danger of their being fined for non-compliance, the ABS has never even attempted to prosecute anyone for failing to do a household survey. By handing to the ABS the total discretion to decide whether a survey should be compulsory or voluntary, and then leaving it to the Statistician to decide whether compulsion should be enforced, the Parliament has allowed gross inconsistencies to proliferate. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the questions now contained in ABS surveys are of a highly personal and intrusive nature. Granted, some people do not care what they are asked, but some do care. It is an outright invasion of an individual's personal privacy to compel him or her to reveal facts about himself or herself to a total stranger; facts which many would not even consider revealing to their closest friends. The ABS has done well in maintaining the confidentiality of the information provided, and I know of only a couple of cases where it has blundered in this respect. Nevertheless, confidentiality is of little consolation when one does not want to divulge personal information. For those compelled to do it, it can be an emotionally traumatic event. Let me take just two of the ABS's current surveys as examples. To complete the HES and the national health survey (NHS) respondents would have to provide an interviewer with detailed information about their current income; their last tax return; their outstanding loans; the value of much of their assets; their expenditure on everything from their weekly donation into their church plate to items of personal toiletries; their bankcard and cheque account statements; their current health status; all their illnesses and disabilities; their recent medical consultations; the extent of their deemed unhealthy habits, such as drinking and smoking; what they eat; their education standard; their trade union membership; and their insurance premiums, just to name a few of the scores of subject areas. </PARA>
<PARA> If one is a women aged between 18 and 64 and one is caught up in the NHS, one will be asked to volunteer information on a range of personal questions which include pap smears, breast cancer scans, hysterectomies and contraception habits, including whether one is fitted with intra-uterine devices (IUDs). These surveys are not only highly personal in nature, but particularly in the case of the HES also very burdensome. Of course, I recognise that some statistics are most necessary and that there is a reliance on people to provide the information truly needed in the compilation of these statistics. I also recognise that many ABS surveys are not of a personal nature and do not place any great burden upon respondents. However, despite these beliefs, I am totally convinced that the conducting of all ABS surveys, with the threat of compulsion and fines, unfairly maximises both the burden involved and the intrusions into the private lives of individual respondents. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the ABS and the Advisory Council have total discretion in regard to the content, size and frequency of the surveys. Obviously, the ABS endeavours to measure up to what it sees as a need for certain statistics against the extent of personal questioning that will be involved in the collection of those statistics. I cast no aspersions as to the ABS's intentions in relation to the making of such difficult decisions. However it is in many respects blinded by a desire to serve every information seeker and seems to find it hard to say no. An excellent example of this was in May 1988 when the Assistant Statistician-he is here!-stated in the midst of a public controversy that there was no way that questions about sex and condoms would get past his desk in relation to the national health survey which commences in October. Unless the ABS drops the section, as I have already mentioned, it is going to ask women about their contraceptive habits, including whether they are fitted with an IUD. If that is not related to sex, what is?</PARA>
<PARA> All this must be seen in the context that the ABS is in the business of collecting and selling statistics in the marketplace and that it is being constantly pressured by a large number of organisations and business houses to increase the number of statistics that it collects. The ABS is competing with a large number of privately-owned statistical gathering organisations which can and do collect information of a comparable quality. It must also be remembered that the ABS is neither held accountable to its respondents nor responsible for representing the many wide-ranging interests of its respondents. For these reasons, I support this Bill to the extent that it provides that the Federal Parliament should have a say in deciding whether ABS surveys, considered on an individual basis, should be conducted compulsorily, voluntarily or not at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is typical of the Opposition. When the Opposition is pressed for its policies on anything it is like poking one's finger in a fog; there is absolutely nothing there. Yet, the time of this Parliament is being taken up with this grubby piece of legislation. The simple fact is that the Opposition does not do the hard work. There is no heart and there is no soul to it. It is all gimmicks. If one wanted an example of that, one would only have to look at the Waste Watch Committee, which is nothing more than cheap populism. The rorts committee fell out of sight: it was launched by the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), it met only once and was never seen again. Perhaps the most damaging attacks are those made on the Public Service. We have seen today attacks by the Opposition on information collected by the Statistician. Many members of parliament are contacted by the public. I have been contacted by the public over these surveys. My experience has been that when one explains to the public why these surveys are necessary and what use is made of the information, the public is more than happy to comply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his contribution, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) said that his letter to the press had been approved by the Ombudsman. What he should have said was this: one paragraph of the letter-not a substantive paragraph-was approved by the Ombudsman. That is the way he misleads, because he has said that the letter has been cleared. The letter has not been cleared; one paragraph only has been cleared and the honourable member for Moreton should be honest enough to admit that. In relation to this alleged harassment of the public, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) has read out to the House the letter of resignation of the collector acting on behalf of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is the sort of harassment that this sort of campaign whips up. As members of parliament we all know that sometimes we get an issue on which we can get a bit of a run and whip up a bit of a story. But this one is most damaging and, what is more, there is nothing in it. It is nothing more than a beat-up, as the honourable member himself concedes. The fact is that everybody complies, and there are figures to show that. </PARA>
<PARA> There were 7,500 respondents to the household expenditure survey. There were no notices of direction and no prosecutions. The biggest survey resulted in only 39 prosecutions out of a population of 16 million. Overwhelmingly the people of Australia do comply with the requirements of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They recognise as we do the importance of the information that is collected. That information goes into making up the consumer price index. The three million pensioners that we have in this country rely on that information to make sure that the pension they get truly reflects the cost of living in Australia. It ill-behoves the Opposition to start this sort of campaign to get a bit of a run in the press. The fact is that that is all it is about. I say to the honourable member for Moreton and to the people who engage in that sort of activity that they would be better placed looking after their constituents if they got onto things that really mattered to them. </PARA>
<PARA> People do not call me a great deal on this issue. The office of a member of parliament is a good barometer as to what is going on in the electorate. I am always amazed when Opposition speakers talk about the flood of issues and the phone calls they have had on this issue. The fact is that they are not telling the truth. The honourable member for Moreton may have had more than the average number of calls on this issue because he has made an issue of it himself. He has not done himself a lot of good and he has not reflected well on the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that anybody with any objectivity who looks at the way the Australian Bureau of Statistics works would understand that, although it is hard getting people to give the sort of information that the honourable member spoke about, it is essential that we have it. What does he want us to do? Does he want us to have no information at all? Does he want us to make judgments on inaccurate information? A government has to make sure that the money spent out of the public purse goes where it is intended to go; that pensions are set at the right level; that departments of this Government receive adequate resources to service the Australian community. A government cannot do that unless it has accurate information. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken about the Opposition's harassment of the Australian people in regard to the household expenditure survey. The worst of it is when Opposition members go into emotive terms. We start hearing about the $100 a day fines even though, by the honourable member's own admission, they have never been administered, and most people undertaking the survey would not even know of the fines if the honourable member had not brought it up. But it is always good for a headline. It is a cheap shot. In the West Australian some time ago there was a headline, `$100 a day fine'. The fact is that it has never been implemented, and the honourable member knows it. It is just a cheap shot at the Bureau's expense. </PARA>
<PARA> How do members of the Opposition think the people in the Bureau of Statistics feel when they see these attacks by a member of parliament on the work that they are doing-work that is required by this Parliament? The Bureau's annual report is tabled in the Parliament. The honourable member can go through that report and offer some constructive criticisms, but we have not had one constructive criticism from him. If a member of parliament wants to make a mug of himself in this place the press is always around to give him a hand. In the honourable member's case, the press has taken him up on his offer. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 September 1988 Milton Cockburn had an article headed `The MP who is last among 224 equals'. I will read this article out mainly because it is a reflection of what the press think of the members of parliament and the sorts of issues in which they involve themselves. Mr Cockburn was asked to list the 10 worst members of parliament. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>If I were game to list my 10 dumbest MPs, it would be hard to leave out Don Cameron, the Liberal MP for Moreton in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on in the article he said:</PARA>
<PARA>So inconsequential is he that he even suffers the indignity of not having his own personal file in the Herald's Canberra library. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cameron's latest contribution to the betterment of public life in this country is to try and stop the Household Expenditure Survey . . . by the Australian Bureau of Statistics because he claims the Statistician has not conformed to the relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on in the article, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The dire warnings issued by such information luddites as Mr Cameron and the CCL appear to have been ignored. The ABS reports that the response rate by participants to this house expenditure survey is greater than the last one in conducted in 1984. Perhaps this gives a clue to the reasons why Mr Cameron has never made it to the front bench. </PARA>
<PARA> I have probably now reduced my Canberra contacts by one but if this is the standard of contribution which Don Cameron makes to public debate in this country I think I can live with that. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an accurate reflection of what the press thinks of the Opposition's campaign. It is a grubby campaign. It is a cheap shot at a government body which has been given the unenviable task of collecting some of the most important and confidential information in this country. It does not like having to do it, but the Opposition's attacks on it make it so much harder. I say to the honourable member: `Wake up to yourself. Get back to Queensland and start looking after your constituents because by taking up issues such as this you are reflecting badly on yourself and you are reflecting badly on the Parliament. It is about time that you got back to looking after your electors'. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) agrees that services provided by government and the community for disabled people should be considered a right rather than a privilege; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on all concerned people and governments to explore every option to ensure that disabled Australians and their carers can enjoy this right to the fullest extent possible. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been said that life was not meant to be easy. For some, this is truer than for others. Many situations exist which try a person's mettle. Our lifespan is one race in which we do not all start with the same handicap. In the context of human endeavour, of striving to enjoy life, to reach our potential of achievement rather than just to exist, the word `handicap' must be defined. It is that which hinders our reaching our full potential. Yet it effectively hinders only where society, or social infrastructure, does not cater to individual needs. For instance, a motorist's mobility is severely hindered without roads along which to travel. A potentially great musical talent is wasted without an instrument on which to express that talent. The overwhelming majority of Australians expect government and community to provide the physical, educational and social infrastructure to enable them to bring their potential to fruition, as a right. As our society becomes more sophisticated, more is expected. The motorist of 1989 expects not only a road on which to travel, but freeways, bridges and roundabouts to facilitate that travel, while the musician's career is hindered without tuition, promoters, venues and audiences. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background of societal expectation, I wish to speak strongly in support of the motion which I have placed on the Notice Paper. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) agrees that services provided by government and the community for disabled people should be considered a right rather than a privilege; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on all concerned people and governments to explore every option to ensure that disabled Australians and their carers can enjoy this right to the fullest extent possible. </PARA>
<PARA>As the expectations of Australians as a whole have risen in tandem with the facilities and options which society, through government and non-government agencies offers them, so too should the expectations, facilities and options offered to people with a handicap be raised. If this is not occurring to the desired extent, we must look for reasons, and we must do so in a spirit of positive intent and cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> Having recently come in contact with some of the fears, hopes and aspirations of many disabled people, their carers, and providers of facilities for disabled people, I wish today to set these down clearly and sympathetically, as the basis of further consideration of what the future holds for them. In looking to the future I do not in any way diminish the past, for it is the work and the dedication of individuals, churches and community organisations which has provided the necessary basis on which to build extensions to the support structure for disabled people in Australia. However, I am most concerned at the apprehension and the lack of confidence experienced by a number of disabled people and their support groups, about the fear of parents in articulating their concerns and wishes, about the providers' fear of criticism, and about a disabled person's fear of not being listened to and of not being heard by those people in whose hands their life options lie. </PARA>
<PARA> Some fears are based on experience and some on perceptions, but all are real to those who hold them. I believe that they must be faced if ever they are to be conquered. I say this not in the sense of those fears being ephemeral and negative emotions which those who experience them must overcome but in the context of the need for all concerned, including governments and heretofore uninvolved sectors of society to find the real basis of the fears and to offer real resources to overcome them. These anxieties-and in the case of mildly to moderately intellectually handicapped people in particular, these frustrations-are being expressed to me by a large and ever growing number of people, who shelter behind what some have called a wall of silence. As I grow in knowledge of the people concerned, the wide spectrum of emotions becomes more clearly defined. This wall must be penetrated, this silence broken. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already expressed in this House some of the concerns of these people. They relate to training or lack of training, a desire to enter the open work force, and a perceived lack of appropriate services and facilities in some activity therapy centres (ATCs) and workshops-including some of those provided by a major provider with an excellent record in Queensland. Some of these concerns are being actively considered by the providers and departmental officers. I look to positive outcomes for disabled people and their carers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have found that some parents do not wish to speak out about these concerns because their self-confidence is diminished: they do not feel that they have a right to demand special attention for their sons or daughters when money is already being spent on facilities, as well as time and effort on overseeing them. Others expect actual retribution if they make any criticism. They are afraid that they will be marked as troublemakers and stirrers. Too many fear that their sons or daughters will lose the support they had if they speak out or hint that they are not satisfied. Some expect actual removal from a residence, a therapy centre or a workshop. There are parents who feel that to express needs would be disloyal to providers or that it could be seen as evidence of disloyalty. Others feel that if they express dissatisfaction they may offend or be scorned by other parents who are satisfied with the status quo. Some believe that they will lose government funding or lose the public's support for their particular provider if they criticise what they have. They are weighed down by the double burden of the unrelenting responsibility of caring for those they love and of carrying feelings of guilt for being recipients of what they perceive as charity. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard of and from people who have started life full of the highest expectations for their children-people who are full of vigour and determination to mould for them the best outcome possible for their capabilities. I have heard of how that expectation has been diminished, how the vision has grown dim against the reality of struggling to cope without adequate support from society. We cannot allow that to continue to happen. The rights of disabled people, as with the rest of society, incorporate provision of facilities and services, access to these facilities and services, and mobility. This means educating disabled people, training them for a job, ensuring that they are not denied access to a job because of their disability, and providing ongoing support, such as monitoring and counselling, to enable them to retain that job. </PARA>
<PARA> This needs the support not only of governments and providers but also of employers. It means provision of particular means of recreation where necessary, ensuring access to generally used recreational options where possible. It means independent living to the greatest extent possible, and provision of support services where that is not possible. For a number of years many of these areas have been serviced in varying degrees by Federal and State governments and non-government organisations. I thank these governments and organisations. However, two specific areas where demand is growing beyond immediate supply are those of independent living and of training for and placement in the open workplace. I will discuss the independent living situation on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of training and job placement is a vexed one, causing much heartburn, as mildly and moderately intellectually handicapped people voice their frustrations at the limitations of the sheltered workshop environment. But training and placement in the work force is central to the full development of a disabled person. It has consequential offshoots of greater confidence, and thus greater mobility, through an enhanced motivation to cope with the problems and to experience the pleasures of the mainstream of society. As one disabled person with Down's syndrome explained succinctly when attaining job placement through a transition project, `I would rather work than sit around at home'. Indeed, not only the client of a conventional workshop, or the disabled person spending his or her days at home, but the fulltime carers are also the beneficiaries of such placement. </PARA>
<PARA> Many providers of facilities and services for disabled people are moving ahead and grasping the opportunities offered under the Disability Services Act to move into the open workplace, but in some cases there has been a breakdown of communication between providers and Department of Community Services and Health officers, leading to a confrontationist attitude towards the Department of Community Services and Health officers, who are seen as predators rather than as arbiters of change. I understand that there were some problems in the implementation of the new directions espoused by the Act, and indeed that discussions are now taking place to seek resolutions to problem areas. I am not denouncing people who may be caught in a breakdown of communication; I am suggesting that they try again in an effort to take advantage of the assistance and resources available to facilitate the move to a new era while retaining the best of the old. Of course, it would not be possible to suddenly remove holus-bolus clients at workshops or in institutions into independent living environments, particularly where the will is not there, nor the capability. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant amount of extra ongoing funding has been made available by the Federal Government to assist organisations with the costs of transition to new service types designed to cater for individual needs and to facilitate the transitional process. In this context, I want to make it clear that I have been assured that the Department of Community Services and Health has absolutely no intention of pulling the rug out from under established providers while they consider the best situation for the purposes of their clients. Some $15m has been made available to assist organisations introducing appropriate new services. That is in addition to the recurrent grants of financial assistance that they already receive. About 11,000 people with disabilities are currently attending Australia's 282 disability services program funded sheltered workshops. The estimated recurrent expenditure for 1988-89 is approximately $35m. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to report that in 1987-88 39 sheltered workshops and 27 activity therapy centres received additional funding to assist with their transition. Thirty sheltered workshops reprofiled their services towards supported employment; nine aimed at competitive employment, training and placement; 24 ATCs received funding for supported employment projects; while three ATCs received funding for competitive employment, training and placement. To the end of December 1988, a further 21 employment related transition proposals had been funded, while 10 sheltered workshops were funded to reprofile towards supported employment or competitive employment, training and placement. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, 11 ATCs received funding to assist them to offer supported employment services. While there is still some timidity or reluctance in some areas, the move to enhanced services for disabled people wishing to have greater independence is really on the way. The lifestyles of a large number of people will be improved by this move as it continues to gain momentum, particularly when one considers the disabilities of clients now attending sheltered workshops. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table detailing figures in relation to disabilities of clients attending sheltered workshops. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members will note the relatively high percentage of people with intellectual disabilities, and the fact that some 33 per cent of all sheltered workshop employees have a mild intellectual disability. I urge those providers who have not considered the new options under the Disability Services Act transition schemes to look at what is now being achieved for such people by many groups, with the support of the Federal Government. For instance, the Competitive Employment Placement and Support Service (COMEPASS) is achieving some great outcomes at Stones Corner in Brisbane. COMEPASS is the baby of the Uniting Church in Australia, and it aims to enable people with intellectual disabilities to retain work in open, competitive employment. The service, which is for people with mild or moderate intellectual disabilities, has enabled 24 people to gain and continue in employment. The wages received by these people range from $226 to $340 a week, the average being $265. To indicate the areas from which people can be drawn for such training and placement, I would mention that four of these people were working in sheltered workshops before being placed in open employment, where the wages range was $6 a week to $40 a week, plus invalid pension.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Honourable members will note that 56.7 per cent of people in sheltered workshops are currently earning less than $20 a week. The Federal Government, of course, provides these people with a pension. Of at least equal and, perhaps, greater importance than the $140 a week increase in income over and above the pension is the dignity and the increased self-esteem and self-confidence experienced as disabled people have learnt to master new tasks in a work environment. Once it would have been considered impossible. Today, it is one of many possibilities open to those who are willing to give it a try. To do so does not indicate disloyalty to past ways; nor it a criticism of the old. Rather, it is a natural development and a celebration of the new.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jobsupport, a Federal Government service established in 1986 to place, train and maintain employees with an intellectual disability in open employment, is another successful program funded under the Disability Services Act. Carolyn Manners, a young woman with Down's syndrome, was one of the early successes of Jobsupport in Sydney. When the program found her a job as a helper at the Summers Hill Children's Community Centre, her ambition to work with children was fulfilled. It took two months' training for Carolyn to master her job involving a series of tasks, and that training was followed by back-up training and consultation once a week. On 7 March 1987, New Idea magazine reported of Carolyn, then 21:</PARA>
<PARA>Until recently, her life would have been restricted to her family and the narrow world of sheltered workshops. Now . . . Caroline has taken her place in the workforce, doing a real job and getting paid real wages. </PARA>
<PARA> This has boosted Caroline's confidence and self-esteem. She now commutes to work by train every weekday, on her own, just like thousands of others in the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>For some, this option may not work. For those who are motivated and are able to take up this option, it offers great opportunities. There are a large variety of transition programs. It is a matter of designing projects to meet the variety of individual needs. There are, or course, degrees of what can be achieved by disabled people, depending on the extent of their individual handicap. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the right of all Australians, regardless of handicap, or all the more because of handicap, to receive the support and resources needed to reach their full potential. Where there are disabled people who wish for more, where there are carers who want greater support, these needs should be met to the greatest extent possible. I do not want to raise expectations needlessly. I do want to raise expectations where people have lost hope, but are amongst those of whom a parent and representative of a support group for disabled people said:</PARA>
<PARA>Out of sheer tiredness, you do get to a stage of saying `It's not what I want, but it's better than nothing.'</PARA>
<PARA>I have spoken today of a yawning chasm which exists in the moral support offered an important sector of our society. I address my comments to that society, not in incrimination but to open further discussion on the need for changes in attitude and in priorities, and to close this chasm. I do not want parents of disabled people to fear change, to fear that there is no support for their aspirations for sons and daughters. I acknowledge that there must be many people whose needs are met-parents and disabled people who are comfortable with their situation. I am happy about this, but this does not excuse complacence towards the many whose needs are not. I recognise and pay tribute to all the people working in centres or at home for disabled people. Many are unpaid, or lowly paid, and their contribution is invaluable. To the silent partners in this work, the public who assist by donation of money or facilities, I record my thanks. To staff members, and to carers, churches and other organisations, to therapists and psychologists and parents and administrators, I pay tribute. But, above all, to disabled people, I register my admiration. I also say, `It is your right to expect services and facilities from a society which certainly views the provision of educational, recreational and social facilities to extend its participation, as a right.' In Australia, 1989, it is your right too. It is not a privilege.'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only do I offer my wholehearted support for what the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) has said in this debate, but also I forgive her for taking up 25 per cent of my time. It should be made clear that we are talking about a vast number of people. While it is so very easy to become involved with statistics-and I would like to use a few very shortly-what we in this Parliament must always remember is that we are talking about individual people. As the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), knows from his portfolio, one can be overwhelmed by the mass of the problem. What it boils down to is that every time we talk about any form of government activity, in reality we are talking about its application to one human being-to one Australian citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of us in the community, unless we have somebody in our own family or among our close friends who is disabled or handicapped, do not appreciate what a disability or handicap is really like. As a small child I spent six months in hospital and 18 months on crutches. I have never spent time in a wheelchair and, quite frankly, I hope I never have to. I wonder how any of us in this chamber would cope if we had to spend a period of days, months or years in a wheelchair. It is not a prospect to which any of us would look forward. Therefore, I commend the honourable member for Lilley for bringing this issue forward because it is most important that all Australians should be made aware of the needs, difficulties and very great problems encountered by people suffering from disabilities and handicaps. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be useful to define a disabled person. It is a fairly cold way of doing it, but a disabled person is somebody with one or more of a number of selected impairments and disabilities which have lasted, or will last, for more than six months. A handicapped person is a disabled person who is limited in ability to perform simple tasks. There are five areas in which both groups are at a disadvantage compared with the ordinary, mobile, able Australian. They are the lack of self-care in that most need able-bodied assistance from carers at one level or another; a lack of mobility; a low or sometimes complete lack of verbal communication skills; opportunities for schooling and education which vary considerably and are diminished to an incredibly large extent for many of these people; and, of course, employment prospects which are incredibly low. Yet, as citizens-as human beings-who need to enjoy the feeling of pride and self-esteem, to be able to achieve, to have self-confidence and, above all, some dignity in their lives, it is most important that we, as a community or society, are caring and compassionate. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a 1988 survey 2,543,000 people in Australia are disabled. That is 15.6 per cent of the population. That figure includes people over the age of 75. Regardless of those, 15.6 per cent of Australians are disabled. That will probably come as a great shock to most Australians. Of this number, 2,124,100-or 13 per cent of the Australian population-are handicapped. When I first saw these figures I was completely surprised because I had no idea that there were so many people suffering in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> Four per cent of people, or 650,000, have a severe handicap and need full time help from another person. Another 3.4 per cent, or 550,000 people, have a moderate handicap and require selected assistance from another person. That necessitates a totally different consideration of the problem. We have to be totally aware of the situation of people who care for people with disabilities and handicaps. In Australia, 92.4 per cent of handicapped people live in households. Of those, 26.5 per cent suffer from a severe handicap. When we look at the way this affects families it is very important that it has our full consideration and awareness. At present 7.6 per cent of the handicapped population live in health establishments: hospitals, institutions for the handicapped, and nursing homes. Of those people, 85 per cent have a severe handicap. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1981 and 1988 the number of disabled people increased by 600,800. This places an enormous strain on our society. Again and again we have to cast our minds to the situation of the carers because the responsibility for providing help with at least one activity, whether it be home maintenance, health care, meals, moving about or transport, falls fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the spouse, the partner, the mother or some other member of the disabled person's family. It is a tremendous responsibility. In many cases it involves seven days a week, 24 hours a day. One of the things said by people is that it is a matter of being seen and not heard. Because of the lack of mobility among many disabled people they are not able to get out and about in the community and, as a result, most able bodied people forget they exist. That is true. We should be more aware. </PARA>
<PARA> Disabled people need more access to facilities which will allow them to participate in the community. About 60 per cent of disabled people need help with transport, which includes access to wheelchairs and vehicles. Let me reiterate that we need the facilities for disabled people to participate in the community. That comes back to what I spoke about at the beginning of my speech: pride, self-esteem, confidence, a sense of achievement and a sense of dignity. Every human being should enjoy these as a right. I am sure there is no debate on the fact that an out of sight, out of mind mentality has existed in the community. That is why it is so important that we take every opportunity to discuss this issue. Indeed, this debate, sponsored by the honourable member for Lilley, might prompt not only those people who will read the Hansard but also those who are listening to the debate to stop and think about people who are not as well off as they are. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of access, many developers are now taking disabled people into account in designing and planning public areas, such as shopping centres and malls. But much more still needs to be done. There needs to be a much greater awareness of the need for ramps besides steps and elevators in steep areas, particularly in business districts. Disabled people have the same need as other people for contact and communication with insurance companies, real estate agents and any other activity within our society. Further emphasis must be put on that area. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned before, education and employment opportunities are very few. Special consideration needs to be given to that. I again refer to home carers. No-one who is not in that situation would know what those people go through. Respite must be provided for carers. We recognise that this need exists for the community of elderly Australians and some progress is being made in that area. But it needs to be extended. The need for respite for carers of disabled and handicapped people is equally as important. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither I nor the honourable member for Lilley have introduced politics into this debate. As a member of the Opposition, I can say that members of the Liberal and National parties agree with what I am about to say. I am sure that the honourable member for Lilley would agree as well. We acknowledge that disability does not lessen the right or desire of people to participate in society and to enjoy its opportunities. We agree that people, whatever their handicap or disability, should have the right-not the privilege; let me be quite certain that I am using the words of the motion-to participate in society and to enjoy its opportunities. We are concerned that people with disabilities are often troubled by isolation. They are isolated from society. They are frequently isolated by programs designed to help them, not by any desire on the part of those people operating and involved in the programs but merely because of the institutional overtones attached to them. We need to give a great deal more consideration to removing the isolation suffered by disabled people. Disabled and handicapped people must have greater access to society-more effective integration with the community. There needs to be flexibility in the way this is achieved to allow the views of the individual and his or her family and care providers to be considered. There needs to be adequate consultation and full communication. It is not a question of care being provided or imposed from above by government alone. There needs to be full communication throughout the whole of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies of government and political parties should assist people with disabilities to achieve their full potential and exercise maximum control and independence over their lives, to ameliorate the effects of disability and to provide continuing support to help manage the pressures and stresses of daily living. I suggest that those of us who are not in a bed or a wheelchair for 24 hours a day do not really know what those stresses and strains are. I salute, as did the honourable member for Lilley, those people who are struggling and striving-and living and doing well-and the people and the organisations which help them. They are very brave people with a great deal of courage and they deserve all the consideration this Parliament can give them. Disabled and handicapped people need independence and security. Every Australian has a right to be independent and to enjoy some security. </PARA>
<PARA> Independence and security are fundamental and are important not only to disabled people but to everybody. It is important to have a place in which to live. We take that for granted but often it is not available to people. It is important that disabled people have access to paid employment. We have vast numbers of unemployed people. I do not know the percentage of unemployed among disabled people, but we can bet our bottom dollars that that percentage is far worse than it is for able people. </PARA>
<PARA> The disabled and handicapped need to be able to feel confident and self-reliant and to participate in community activities at various levels. We need the infrastructure to enable them to do that. They need to feel secure in their lives, and most importantly, to have choices and options. I suppose that I have mentioned people in wheelchairs because they are the most visible people. However, people with all sorts of disabilities are prevented from participating fully in the choices and options that we take for granted. If we are stuck, our options are limited and our choices are almost nil. If we as a parliament can do no more than to provide more choices and more options for people suffering from handicaps and disabilities, we could do much worse. If we can give these people, through whatever action we can take, a positive self-image, we can feel we have achieved something for our fellow Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to this debate today stems, at least in part, from my particular interest in one of Australia's most popular institutions-fish and chips. My first introduction to the epicurean adventure that awaits the fish and chip devotee was as a boy in Footscray-when sixpence worth of fish and chips was a well-established after school ritual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I digress here for just a moment to record my unbiased opinion-as an experienced, long term consumer-that newspaper is a better presentation medium for this simple but exquisite food combination than little cardboard boxes, or even fine china. The newspaper packet, which some years ago unfortunately fell into disrepute as a fish and chip container, had many advantages including its recycled nature, its portability, the delicious uncertainty of never quite knowing when the treat was going to end and the fact that the meal stayed hot right to the last tasty morsel-and when you were finished, you had something to read. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years, I have taken advantage of every opportunity to indulge my predilection for the fruits of our Australian aquicultural industry and have developed my knowledge of, and appreciation for, fish and chips to a point where I believe I can claim the status of `connoisseur'. I have sampled numerous up-market versions and varieties, far removed, in price if not in flavour, from the flake, couta and flathead of my youth. At this point I would like to compliment the staff of the parliamentary dining room, who serve a very crisp chip and moist fillet. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the newest names appearing with increasing regularity on the menu-and to which I unashamedly admit a current addiction-is orange roughy. In regard to this superb fish, it is appropriate to recall the words of Shakespeare about roses by any names smelling just as sweet. I am reliably informed by my local fishmonger that orange roughy is marketed under other names, and considerable cost savings may be achieved-at least in Victoria-if one asks for the rather less romantic sounding sea perch. The fact is, however, that one may not be able to ask for orange roughy-by any name-for very much longer. And this brings me to the extremely serious aspect of this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that Australia is surrounded by water, our relatively slender fishing resources are most vulnerable and under constant, and in many cases increasing, threat. The present gravity and future implications of the overfished, under-researched situation confronting our billion dollar fishing industry were brought home to me recently in an article by Julian Cribb which was published in the Australian of 16 May. This article, entitled `The fishing harvest for which there may be no tomorrow-the deep sea disaster on our doorstep', makes sobering reading. It concentrates on the uncertain fate of the orange roughy, whilst at the same time highlighting other disasters, or near disasters, which have resulted from over exploitation of a resource of unknown magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I represent a landlocked electorate, and therefore do not have the same direct interest in the commercial fishing industry as do those with watery boundaries, as one who is concerned about environment and conservation issues as well as being a fanatical end product consumer, I was prompted by Mr Cribb's article to find out more about the Australian fishing industry. The news is not good. Poor fishery management techniques, irresponsible industry and government practices and attitudes, insufficient data on existing resources and breeding patterns, and inadequate funding for and encouragement of vital scientific research have all contributed to marine stocks decimated by overfishing. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent years we have witnessed last-minute salvage attempts to protect the rapidly dwindling stocks of southern bluefin tuna, shark, abalone, prawns, rock lobsters, scallops, ocean leather jackets and gemfish-to name just some of the more obvious examples. Orange roughy has now been added to the list. Julian Cribb described the orange roughy's plight in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> A creature once unknown to the Australian dinner table has become, almost overnight, one of the nation's most prized marine delicacies. But the roughy is in many cases older than the humans who feast on its flesh. Scientists now believe individual roughies may live for 50 and 75 years, breeding only rarely in the slow, stable rhythm of the deep-sea world. </PARA>
<PARA> More and more they fear that the rich hauls of orange roughy taken from `hot spots' may be a harvest without a tomorrow. If the breeding stocks are ravaged beyond repair, as in so many of Australia's fisheries, the ruffe may vanish as quickly as it came. </PARA>
<PARA>Julian Cribb provides some alarming statistics to illustrate the reasons for his concern. These include the fact that the catch rate of southern sharks has fallen by half since 1982, and that fishery now comes within the seriously imperilled category. The abalone harvest has dropped by 40 per cent over five years. The Tasmanian shark fishery is virtually gone. There are fears about the survival of the gemfish fishery off New South Wales, hauls of tiger flathead are down, concern is mounting about future stocks of redfish and ling, and the northern barramundi fisheries remain under heavy pressure. Cribb uses the jack mackerel to further emphasise the point he is making. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA> Jack mackerel, a virgin fishery five years ago, exploded into prominence as the nation's biggest commercial species, with 40,000 tonnes taken in 1987-before the fish literally disappeared and catches crashed to zero. </PARA>
<PARA> Why the jack mackerel vanished illustrates the fundamental flaw in Australian fisheries management today: the knowledge to forestall disaster simply does not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The fish may have gone because of huge fishing pressures, because of a change in the cycle of their food chain, or because of a combination of both. Nobody knows. </PARA>
<PARA>What we do know, however, is that in most cases the damage to our commercial fisheries will take a long time to repair. For some species, and/or in some locations, the damage may even be irreparable. Only in two cases-the Western Australian rock lobster fishery and the northern prawn fishery-can it be confidently claimed that the threat to their commercial survival has been contained. International experts who have reviewed all the available evidence on bluefin tuna have come to the conclusion that the only safe catch is zero. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Dr Peter Young, a senior research scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) fisheries division in Hobart, the commercial scallop fishery in south-eastern Australia is to all intents and purposes wiped out. Dr Young says the exploitation of scallops has been so severe that, even with a total halt to scallop dredging in Bass Strait, it will take years before any recovery could occur. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates it will be 15 years before abalone numbers return to safe levels; and Perry Smith, of the ABARE fisheries research section, believes the problems which led to restrictions on gemfish and orange roughy catches are also long term in character. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>The rapid increase in fishing capacity in the south-east trawl fishery, resulting from industry expectations of a more substantial sustainable yield than has so far been justified, is likely to remain a major long-term problem with fish stocks put under greater fishing pressure. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the problems for those involved in fisheries research is the fact they are dealing with an imprecise science. Dr Robert Kearney, Director of the New South Wales Fisheries Research Institute argues that problems of working in an environment such as the sea, where one cannot even see the animals one is studying, are exacerbated by insufficient and often inaccurate industry provided data. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is unreasonable to expect a physician to make a diagnosis when he is not allowed to examine the patient, is not told the truth, or worse still, is given misleading information. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should managers-</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to fisheries managers-</PARA>
<PARA>expect more of fisheries scientists?</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Peter Young emphasises another aspect of the challenges facing those involved in fisheries research in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> The difference between us and America is that in the US they have a dozen scientists studying a single species. In Australia, we have one scientist studying a dozen species. </PARA>
<PARA>As Julian Cribb points out:</PARA>
<PARA> Fisheries scientists are themselves an endangered stock. The CSIRO Division of Fisheries has been forced to cut its staff by 29-nearly a third-in recent years. Its appropriation funds have been cut by 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In the fishing industry the odds are heavily in favour of the hunter rather than the prey. Modern fishing technology, the understandable and reasonable desire of fishermen to receive an adequate return on their considerable investments and ongoing costs, and the lack of adequate and appropriate resources to ensure the required scientific data is readily available to assist in the proper management of our marine resources all combine to pose significant problems for the Australian fishing industry. The concept of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted or, more accurately in this instance, hauling in the net after the fillet has been battered, has never been regarded as an appropriate or acceptable management technique. And yet it seems we are all too frequently tackling the problems confronting our fishing industry by reacting after the event. Time after time we wait until the point of no return has been reached, or almost reached, before any action is taken to stop the unrestrained plunder of our commercial fishing grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of those who enjoy their fish and chips, as well as the fishermen, managers and scientists, not to mention the fish themselves, is it not time we took another look and adopted a new approach to the management of our significant and endangered fishing industry?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Minister at the table while I am speaking is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), who I consider to be one of the more intelligent and very much less fanatical members of the so-called Left in the Australian Labor Party. As I approach the end of my political life as a member of the House of Representatives I want to use a couple of occasions to state or re-state my views on important issues. I say re-state because, remarkably enough, on re-reading my maiden speech given on 10 March 1970, I found a number of points I made then which I still consider extremely important. I shall quote three extracts from my speech. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I arrived in this country in my early teens from fascist Italy, at a time when Hitler was about to spread an even more totalitarian regime over nearly the whole of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Fascism in all its successful aggressive forms was defeated, but freedom is far from secure. There are obviously a number of reasons for this. One is the threat of another expansionist totalitarianism claimed to be Socialist or Communist by its supporters and some of its opponents. I would, of course, deny that it is anything but a complete perversion of these ideologies. As a reaction to this clear threat there has been, in many of the democracies, an excessive over-reaction. I bracket these so-called Communist and anti-Communist threats to our freedom together, as they have much in common and share the same lack of faith in human beings making a correct decision when given all the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in my speech I said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I would suggest that they use-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>the method of a not excessively democratic organisation-the Roman Catholic Church during the last few centuries-and employ a devil's advocate. I would be happy to offer my services in such a capacity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I think I have done that for the last 19 or 20 years. Those who have seen me act in Caucus would certainly agree on that. I was speaking then at the height of the Vietnam War. I went on to refer then to radicals and the new left:</PARA>
<PARA> One of my great disappointments is that many of them are unable to see that today-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, back in 1970-</PARA>
<PARA>this country, and for that matter even more so the United States, are to the `left' of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and of China as of today. Anti-authoritarianism, the right to dissent, the possibility of being able to change the governments, the general level of civil liberty are the issues which should be the main internal concern of the `left'. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is easy to understand their fierce opposition to this government's war in Vietnam it is depressing that so many of them are prepared to argue that the North Vietnamese regime represents any of the values they hold dear in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go any further in quoting from my speech because otherwise I will not be able to say what I meant to say today. </PARA>
<PARA> I have now been here for nearly 20 years. I have been political for about 55 years-undoubtedly longer than most in this chamber. I do not want to go into details, but my first political memories are from the age of 10. What is more, I have been at least superficially consistent in that I have always supported what are loosely called social democratic attitudes. I have always supported the quickest amelioration of the condition of those in most need consistent with an overwhelming opposition to totalitarianism-whether of the so-called Left or Right, which are usually undistinguishable. Having come from Italy and watched events in Germany, I was aware that Mussolini had been a prominent socialist and that Hitler's party was the National Socialist German Workers Party, the NSDAP. Both of them claimed to appeal to youth. The fascist anthem was called Giovinezza. I wonder how many honourable members have seen the film Cabaret which features the German Nazi song, The future belongs to us. I make this point because especially during the Vietnam war and since we have had similar appeals to youth. During the Vietnam conflict there were appeals-especially at universities in democratic countries-to support peace and the North Vietnamese against the `old' democratic values. The so-called Left became extremely totalitarian, trying to prevent-and often succeeding in preventing-rational discussion of the very complicated issues. These people often behaved like the worst fascist rabble-rousers. My main argument with them was obviously not that they claimed to support peace, but that those in the leadership, at least, were active stooges for the North Vietnamese and Soviet Union and in due course held victory celebrations for the Vietnamese and Pol Pot. These people, who in many cases consciously supported Soviet foreign policy and pretended to be for peace, are the people who gave us Stalin, Pol Pot, the Ayatollah and many of similar ilk. In each case they supported these allegedly `democratic, gentle, peace-loving people'. </PARA>
<PARA> Even when I was very young I was intelligent enough not to approve of the Hitler-Stalin pact. Of course I was surprised, but in retrospect I should not have been. Even though, broadly speaking, I was a Left activist, I was never a member of the Communist Party. The Hitler-Stalin pact, the Moscow trials, reading James Burnham's The Managerial Revolution and especially Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon-the best political novel ever written in the way it explains the Moscow trials-all made me strongly anti-Stalinist. Professor John Anderson's free thought movement encouraged my spirit of critical inquiry and later Professor Partridge introduced me and later converted me to an acceptance of pluralism. Yet it is undoubtedly true that those interested in politics but not actually in the Sydney University Labour Club considered me an obvious card-carrying Communist Party member. Yet I believed in socialism for a fairly long time, not for economic reasons but because I believed that capitalism was the only cause of imperialism and war. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, of course, we have seen many wars or new wars between self-proclaimed socialist states, beginning with the confrontation between the Soviet Union and Tito's Yugoslavia. Then there was the Soviet invasion of Hungary and Czechoslovakia and lately the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the China-Vietnam conflict. It is interesting to note that since 1918 there has been no war between democratic states and those who are opposed to war-and I assume that includes all of us-would do best to support the democratisation of all countries instead of attacking the United States of America and other democratic countries. The depressing aspect of many so-called left wingers is their belief in conspiracies and secret controllers of society-the Central Intelligence Agency, Wall Street, the military-industrial complex, the zionists, Murdoch, Packer and so on. According to them people are regularly polluting, poisoning, pillaging, corrupting and carcinogenating. With all that it was a wonder that listeners to PM and Late Night Live and readers of the late National Times could get any sleep at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point I am trying to make is the overlap of the extreme Right and so-called extreme Left as illustrated by their behaviour. Patrick White, the rather simplistic aristocrat adopted by the Left-I do not know whether he considers himself part of the Left-speaking at Monash University last year, supported a proposition put forward by Peter Sawyer and others of the lunatic Right. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the cloak of Telecom we have what is ostensibly a telephone exchange at the Deakin Centre in Canberra but which is in fact a surveillance headquarters invading the nation's privacy on an unimaginable scale. </PARA>
<PARA>This is of course a hoary myth, spread and possibly even believed by what I call the lunatic Right, including Peter Sawyer, Brian Wilshire of 2GB night time radio, and such groups as the Citizens Electoral Councils and the League of Rights. The so-called and wrongly described Left joins with the Right in believing in such quick fixes. I emphasise that in the case of the members of the so-called Left, very few, if any, Federal parliamentarians share their simplistic economic views, though some of them may still accept the proposition that Nicaragua is a democracy or that the Philippines run by the New People's Army would be an improvement on the current position. </PARA>
<PARA> Last evening in Canberra allegedly some 1,000 people agreed with Katharine West and other similar economic gurus-and I am not suggesting for one minute they are members of the Left-that the way to reduce the cost of money reduce interest rates-is to withdraw money currently on deposit with the lenders. I have concentrated on the so-called Left and I keep on emphasising `so-called' because it has much more influence in the media and therefore gets much more publicity than the Right. But the Right's attack on the fluoridation of water and the Left's on the irradiation of foodstuffs have much in common. They are ridiculous scare tactics by people, usually without any scientific training, who have an apocalyptic view of the world. God or earthly conspirators will destroy us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, I want to reflect critically on the Government's acquired immune deficiency syndrome policy and on its AIDS education program, in particular. There were media reports last month of an AIDS survey of university students in Sydney. The survey revealed that approximately 90 per cent of the students had absorbed the technical information about AIDS and the Government sponsored approach to the problem, `Safe Sex', based on condom use. The survey also revealed, however-and this is the crucial point-that only about one-quarter to one-third of the students actually made decisions-that is, practised safe sex-based on that information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987 I drew the attention of the House to research in the United States on adolescent sexual behaviour and pregnancy. That research showed that teenagers are handicapped in assessing the personal risks of their sexual behaviour because of cognitive immaturity. It argued that many teenagers are incapable of thinking abstractly and of relating actions to specific consequences. They cannot make the right decisions in terms of contraception specifically, or sexual relations generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that the Government's education programs are inadequate to the threat that AIDS poses is that they focus on technical information and pull their punches in the area of morality. AIDS is essentially a question of the breakdown of authority in morals amongst our young people and, secondly, the moral immaturity and nihilism of many adults and policy makers. In my own submission on the AIDS Green Paper, I argued for an amendment of two of its basic principles along the following lines: Principle 2a-essential to our understanding of the nature of the epidemic is our acceptance that it is primarily a spiritual and moral problem; it is fundamentally a matter of the sense of self, of right and wrong and of personal and social responsibilities being affirmed and nurtured in our society. Principle 5b-the primary objective of education and prevention strategies and programs should be the affirmation and promotion of abstention from sexual activity outside marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me stress again, the Government's education programs are not working because they duck the central dilemma-a collapse of moral clarity and authority in our community. They assume promiscuity; they assume individual maturity and responsibility; they take the coward's course of hiding behind a moral-neutral policy approach. Let me give an example: in the Green Paper there is the apparently harmless statement that adolescence is a time of sexual experimentation. The reality, of course, is that the extent of sexual experimentation among adolescents is not a `given'-it varies culturally. The question to be addressed is the nurturing of a cultural value disposition which would minimise sexual experimentation and activity amongst adolescents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's education programs endorse moral relativism and assume promiscuity. In so doing, they legitimise both. They give our young people, and indeed adults, false confidence. In the Green Paper the Government sets as an objective abstention from drug use, but not abstention from sex outside of marriage. The inconsistency here, and when compared with public crusades against smoking, is quite obvious. We do not tell young people to use drugs in moderation; we simply say, `Do not even try them'. We do not say, `Smoke in moderation'; we actively stigmatise smoking altogether and ban it in many instances. It should be the same with homosexuality and with sex outside a faithful marriage, especially in view of the current AIDS crisis. Let us be morally responsible. Let us state the fact bluntly. Let us tell young people that if they fool around it is very likely they will die a lonely and miserable death. They should be warned that through the self-abuse of drugs and sexual irresponsibility they can break a trust with the community, forfeit certain rights and expect certain social sanctions. This is what should also be put bluntly to adult heterosexuals or homosexuals who, in the context of the AIDS crisis, are acting like children. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been concentrating on education. I want to now focus on the broader weakness in the set of principles mooted by the Government for AIDS policy in general. On the questions of the rights of the community and of non-infected people and the social obligations of infected individuals, we need a stronger statement-one which shifts the balance back to the common interest. We have all heard this week of inaction in Perth on deliberately irresponsible sexual behaviour by a number of known AIDS carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest the following restatement of principles: First, each person must accept responsibility for preventing himself or herself becoming infected through sexual intercourse, or through sharing of needles, or for preventing further transmission of the virus. Secondly, an individual with an infectious disease has certain social responsibilities and obligations which may, in certain circumstances, be enforceable. Thirdly, the Australian community has the right to access to appropriate protection against infection. On the subject of an infected person's rights and privacy and on testing, I would state, firstly, a very basic principle: No individual has a right to do a wrong; privacy cannot be morally or therefore legally justified in the name of a freedom to do things which harm others or put them at risk. There are a number of consequent principles for policy. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of testing, I think the jury is still out on the feasibility or utility of compulsory universal testing. The basic principle on testing must, however, be strengthened. I would suggest as follows: specific informed consent should be obtained before any test is performed to diagnose a person's AIDS status, except in those circumstances where an individual's behaviour, circumstances or past suggest an overriding public right to know. Under this principle, testing would be mandatory for groups such as prostitutes, drug users, people involved in accidents or public incidents involving blood loss and people entering prison. </PARA>
<PARA> A philosopher has described values as personal preferences so central to our collective lives that as a political community we cannot properly be neutral about them. This Government wants to be neutral about AIDS, just as it has been about excessive violence and pornography in videos, on television and in magazines. It is not an exaggeration to say that this Government's value neutrality on AIDS will cost hundreds of lives. I challenge it and State governments to restore the role of government, parliament and the law to that of affirming and nurturing the values which sustain social life and human relations. They are the traditional values embodied in the Judaeo-Christian ethic. </PARA>
<PARA> One clear test in this regard would be to emphasise abstention from sex outside marriage and to stigmatise homosexuality in education material. One clear political test would be to come out publicly against the annual gay Mardi gras, for example. The portents for our society because of the AIDS epidemic are grave and frightening. The emotional and social costs of this epidemic will be catastrophic. Yet we have the counterproductive `let's party for tomorrow we die' mentality of the annual gay Mardi gras. We cannot continue to accept an annual celebration of anal intercourse, `gay' misogamy, lesbian misandry and sexual promiscuity which is what the Mardi gras is about. We certainly cannot tolerate such events when they include effigies of those in the community who take a principled stand on AIDS. I refer to the disgraceful portrayal of the Reverend Fred Nile's head on a platter in this year's Mardi gras. I believe that the Mardi gras must be banned. AIDS policy must be based on clear moral principles, based on traditional values and the common interests. My call today to my colleagues is for parliament to begin to champion that common interest, those traditional values and those policy principles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government of Queensland and the Queensland Premier are not renowned for their support of electoral justice or good practice when it comes to electoral matters. However, in late April of this year, the Queensland Premier decided to make certain allegations against myself and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in relation to the conduct of the 1987 Federal election in the seat of Fisher. Those allegations were, in substance, that I was improperly elected because of the practice of multiple voting or cemetery voting, which occurred to an extent which would have materially affected the result. These allegations are baseless and without a grain of truth. However, for the record I would like to answer them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first allegation concerns that of multiple voting. The report prepared by the Australian Electoral Commission on this question reveals that there were 200 apparent instances of multiple voting-that is, dual voting-in the electorate of Fisher at the last Federal election. Of these 200, some 188 were found to be mistakes by poll clerks-that is, the polling clerk ruling off the wrong name when someone came to claim the vote. A further 11 cases were investigated, but there was no conclusive evidence of any electoral fraud. In one case, and in one case alone, the matter was referred to the Australian Federal Police for consideration. To get some perspective on whether this figure of 200 is an inordinately large number and peculiar to the electorate of Fisher, it is interesting to note some of the figures in surrounding seats and throughout Australia. For instance, in the seat of Maranoa, held by the National Party of Australia, there were 222 instances; in Groom, 166 instances; in Fairfax, 175; in Kennedy, 220; and in the Liberal-held seat of Moreton, which is very marginal, 225. In the seat of Richmond, held by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt), there were 200 cases-exactly the same number as in Fisher. In the seat of the former Leader of the Opposition, Bennelong, there were some 260 cases-that is 60 more than occurred in Fisher. In the seat of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) there were 205 cases; and in the Kooyong seat of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), some 259 cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that if the Queensland Premier believes that the reporting of 200 apparent cases in Fisher by the Australian Electoral Commission warrants an allegation of electoral fraud against me, he might like to level the same allegation against the Leader of the National Party, the Leader of the Liberal Party, and some of his National Party colleagues in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly he did not raise it and it was just a cheap, grubby little stunt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other little furphy the Queensland Government came out with was the idea of cemetery voting-that is, people voting in place of those who had died but whose names at that stage had not been removed from the electoral roll. Unknown to me at the time, that was apparently referred to the Queensland division of the Australian Electoral Commission by Senator Stone shortly after the Federal election. I was not aware of this, but a full investigation of the allegations was made and not one solitary case was found. The Queensland Electoral Commissioner, Dr David Muffitt, reported that not one case was found. It was also alleged that some 50 names had been submitted to the Electoral Commission of people who were thought to be `phantom enrolments'. Those 50 cases were investigated individually and, again, not one case of fraud was found. </PARA>
<PARA> In the lead-up to the Merthyr by-election, where it suffered a huge rebuff, the National Party in Queensland under the leadership of Mr Ahern, who is known as a weak and indecisive man, tried to throw some mud at the ALP and myself. That is what it was all about. Since the National Party, and Mr Ahern in particular, are now taking some sort of interest in matters electoral, may I suggest there are a few other things a bit closer home that they may want to canvass. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not go into the gerrymander, but I will mention Broadsound in a minute for the benefit of the honourable member for Hinkler. Let us not talk about the gerrymander. Everyone accepts that Queensland has the most corrupt electoral system in the Western world, but let us forget about that. Let us also forget about the comments of Mr Don Lane when he went to the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct and quite freely admitted that the Queensland Electoral boundaries were rorted. Let us also forget about his practice of falsely enrolling Jack Herbert's son in his seat of Merthyr. Let us forget about all those things-they are well known. Let us talk about the compliance of the Queensland National Party with the disclosure provisions under the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For instance, I received information in the lead up to the 1984 Federal election that the National Party received a sum of some $300,000 from a company called National Free Enterprise Ltd. That much was disclosed in the National Party's return for that election. However, what was not disclosed in that return and what a search of the Corporate Affairs Office in Brisbane revealed, was that National Free Enterprise Ltd was incorporated on 27 September 1984. The $300,000 donation by the company was made to the National Party some eight days later, on 5 October 1984. Now this company has a paid up capital of $2 and no apparent assets. The only reasonable inference anyone can draw from that is that this company was used for the purpose of laundering money into the Queensland National Party so that the disclosure provisions under the Commonwealth Electoral Act could be avoided. That was typical of the National Party and in a way this was a forerunner to the events of the 1987 Federal election when we had the creation of the company Kaldeal Pty Ltd, which was formed under the directorship of Sir Edward Lyons and a few other knights of the realm in Queensland for the purposes of bank rolling the abortive `Joh for Canberra' campaign. The `Joh for Canberra' campaign really never got off the ground and the funds paid into Kaldeal Pty Ltd were not actually spent in that election. Under the third party provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which now exist, the funds paid to Kaldeal Pty Ltd will not have to be disclosed if they are spent by the Queensland National Party in the 1990 Federal election. Therefore, the National Party can again avoid the financial disclosure provisions under the Commonwealth Electoral Act by having donations made to this third party company and the third party company making donations directly to the National Party. In that way the actual disclosure provisions are avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> That is very interesting and it is even more interesting when one compares the sum total of the expenditure by the National Party in the last Federal election in Queensland with its admitted donations-that is, those donations and gifts which it has declared on its return. These figures, which are available from the Australian Electoral Commission, show that the Queensland National Party declared some $337,000 by way of donations and gifts in the 1987 election campaign. Yet it spent $1,904,000-nine times the amount it received. Now let us get that into some sort of perspective. In its return the ALP showed that it received some $434,000 in donations and spent $483,000. The Queensland Liberal Party admitted to receiving $326,000 worth of donations and spending some $348,000. That means that obviously during election campaigns all political parties spend money from sources other than donations received in the lead up. But the National Party spent nine times the amount of its disclosed receipts. That followed the events of 1984 when a bogus company was formed with no paid up capital and no assets and which, just eight days after it was formed, paid $300,000 to the National Party. When those events, together with the role of Kaldeal Pty Ltd in the `Joh for Canberra' campaign, are considered, they all point to the fact that the National Party is trying to avoid these electoral requirements. If Mr Ahern is serious about electoral matters he should not go around mudslinging and throwing wild accusations at Labor members. Instead, he should clean up his own act and he can start with his Party's compliance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Then he might even condescend to start looking at his own electoral boundaries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), who has been complaining so loudly, I must point out that he has some facts wrong. First of all, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Ahern, has nothing to do with the Federal elections, and at that time he would not have done that. Secondly, I am getting complaints from around the place-and particularly from the honourable member's area-about the excessive phone bill that must be mounting up as he rings all his constituents to try to find out, on the basis of a survey from somebody else, how they feel about the way things are running. I think that a close look at his telephone bills would confirm that this is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today in this grievance debate, I wish to refer to the spate of liquidations and company collapses around Australia that are, unfortunately, becoming more and more prevalent, and in which the real losers are the small investors of Australia. These are family people, frugal people who are trying to save for future needs. Australia needs more savers and in being able to put money aside, these people are providing benefits. About November of last year we had the spectacle of Rothwells Ltd, which is a Queensland registered company trading out of Perth and supported by a major bank, the Western Australian Government, through Western Australia Inc, and many big business investors, going into liquidation, despite major efforts to save it. On that occasion quite a few depositors, who had been assured of security of the investment by the company and financial advisers, had invested some $32m in the company. More than $5m of that came from investors from around my own constituency and my own city. Fortunately, there was a happy ending for those investors. Through the excellent work of Mr Ian Ferrier, the provisional liquidator, an arrangement was made for the National Australia Bank and Western Australia Inc to contribute certain funds. So the security for these people who had deposited $32m was maintained and they will be paid in full, but without interest. That is an example of investors being led to believe that their funds have been properly secured. They were assured by brokers and the company that they were protected and they then found themselves in a virtually unsecured position with these deposits. As I said, fortunately all has ended well with the Rothwell's depositors and, again, I pay my highest commendation to Mr Ferrier for all his efforts in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of depositors in another recently failed group which involved the Sunmark Corporation and Sun Sovereign Corporation is entirely different. A report by the provisional liquidator, Howarth and Howarth, dated 16 May, recently came into my hands, and this shows the great intrigue relating to the intercompany investment. This schedule of Sunmark Corp shows a tremendous diversity of deposits and interest in subsidiaries that is almost a nightmare to try to follow. Also attached to that report is a schedule indicating intercompany transfers, intercompany loans, and in many cases where these loans have been made to subsidiaries they are marked in the provisional liquidator's mind as `recovery unknown' or `recovery at nil.'</PARA>
<PARA> This is a timely report. Sun Sovereign had recently received approximately $45m on deposit, $21m being from many small Australian investors, of which almost $500,00 came from persons living in and around Mackay. These deposits were received through agencies of Sceptre Management Services Pty Ltd, a company now in liquidation and also a subsidiary of Sunmark Corporation Ltd. Some of these depositors are personally known to me. An amount of $5,059 is being held in trust for a blind child, who is only six years old. Another amount of $37,181 represents the savings of a young chap who has worked hard and diligently to buy a house. Another amount of $20,323 has been put in trust by parents for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> This list indicates many smaller deposits. In fact, I think that in this area there are about 230 depositors altogether, many of whom are conscientious savers. However, the list itself does not reflect the misery, the trauma and the anger at the loss of their retirement plans, their education and housing plans for the family and the nest egg for survival in these uncertain economic times. These are just normal, everyday Australians planning for their future and that of their children. They had been advised by Sceptre that their deposits were secured against bank bills and Commonwealth equities, where Sun Sovereign covered all deposits from these investments by about 80 per cent. As a result of this report, these deposits are now worth 4c in the dollar and advice is now being received that it was company policy not to exchange securities unless depositors were from Sydney or Melbourne. Apparently it was the company's policy not to recognise people outside these centres as Australians worthy of security. Since when has a company policy overridden corporate law and the need for companies to trade within that law? Advice has also been received that only deposits of $100,000 or more would be secured. However, any security is in doubt as the liquidators test the Supreme Court of New South Wales with a validity of some 30 of those deposits amounting to $5.93m. A result in favour of non-acceptance of those deposits as secured, will increase the proposed dividend to 17c in the dollar, still a loss of 33c.</PARA>
<PARA> However, in spite of the assurance given by Sceptre and the company that there was security and that there were bank bills and government bonds, there was no security and there were no bills to cover the deposits. But a Western Australian investor has claimed that four days before the company went into liquidation, a representative from Sun Sovereign had called at his home to collect a $4,000 cheque. One has to ask where the money went and what happened to the bank bills. The company was apparently milked through a system of intercompany transfers and these funds placed offshore. The whole group of companies has been under the control of a Mr C. K. Yap, who was Hong Kong based until very recently. I understand that Sun Sovereign was owned primarily by Chancery Nominees, with 90 per cent, and by Sunmark Corporation with 10 per cent, both with ties back to Mr Yap. Apparently the provisional liquidator has not been able to interview this gentleman as he has transferred his residency to London. On 1 February this year, depositors received letters from Sun Sovereign Limited under the Money Market Corporation logo. One was to confirm a repayment of the deposit with accrued interest, another was to accept that same deposit and the third to say that these were a result of the necessity to conform to National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) regulations, but no advice was given as to why this was all necessary and there was no option given for the withdrawal of the deposit. </PARA>
<PARA> Depositors are asking the question: How is it that under Australian corporate laws, the NCSC and the Foreign Investment Review Board Australian companies can come under the control of an offshore enterprise and have their assets stripped? These people can still encourage Australian investment in what could amount to a deliberately fraudulent action in asking for those deposits. The message must be for any investors to insist on the production of the security in any company that opens itself up for an investment of this nature. I believe that any investor would be foolish to take, on face value, the assurances given by those companies and some of their investment agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to assure the House that this is not a business bash. I note that in the Australian on 29 May 1989 Gerald Henderson suggested that a business bash was being conducted by certain people within the Corporate Affairs Commission and the NCSC. I do believe that there is a degree of accuracy in reports that the financial reporting by some companies throughout Australia has reached an all time legal and moral low. How can a representative of a company collect deposits only days before a collapse, when it would have been so obvious that the whole financial structure of the company had collapsed. It is obvious that the standard of reporting set would be sufficient to deal with these matters, but in cases such as this where the standards have been wilfully disregarded, some authority must pursue them relentlessly. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest that the NCSC should investigate this particular collapse thoroughly through the corporate affairs departments within each of the States, and do it with a view to prosecuting those who have deliberately misled these very genuine, small Australian investors and to ascertain whether any professional negligence insurance could be recovered from the agents of Sceptre. This is very important because there might be other companies which have not yet collapsed but are in this same situation. Many more small investors may have invested their life savings in these companies, so it is important that the NCSC carry out that investigation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak today on the housing debate. The way that things have been going a lot of people are hurting in the community, but perhaps not as many as we are led to believe by some spokesmen for people who are suffering from interest rate rises. The tenor of the present debate about interest rates and home purchase is understandable in Australia. I know that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), would have a particular interest in this problem, given that she is the honourable member for Canberra and that Canberra was the site of a very loud and well attended meeting last night. But the tenor is also one of frustration and fear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to denigrate the motives or concerns of any participant in the debate when I say that it could be assisted by the addition of a few facts about the housing situation in Australia as a whole. Some people may have watched the Couchman program on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television last night-those who did not attend the meeting in Tuggeranong. If so, I hope they were not as annoyed as I was about the contribution of the Business Review Weekly's representative. I found his comments unhelpful, politically partisan and particularly emotive. I recollect that he actually carried out a similar role once before just after the April statement when he appeared on an ABC television program. I hope that the ABC does not continue to use him because I do not find his contribution particularly helpful to any debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 there were 3,586,405 owner-purchaser households in Australia; that is, 70.4 per cent of the Australian household population. By comparison, 5.5 per cent of households rent housing authority accommodation, that is, State housing in some places, and 19.4 per cent rent privately. Other forms of tenure, including some other government tenures, apply to the remaining 4.7 per cent of households. The latest owner-purchaser figure, from April 1989, I think, is 72 per cent compared with 68.4 per cent in 1976 and 70.1 per cent in 1981. It can be seen from these figures that by far the majority of Australian households either own their own home or are in the process of purchasing it, and that percentage is obviously increasing. In fact, the increase in the last few years has been quite outstanding. In 1988, 83.3 per cent of couples were owner-purchasers, 42.5 per cent were single parents and 56.4 per cent were single people. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people who are concerned about the impact of present interest rates on recent home purchases have gone so far as to suggest that the ceiling of 13.5 per cent, which this Government quite correctly placed on existing bank home loans in 1986 at a time when the freeing up of the banking system was having more of an impact, should be removed so as to equalise the burden on home buyers. I believe that this suggestion overlooks the fact that these loans do not represent a very large volume of bank home lending and, therefore, the removal of the ceiling would not assist to any measurable degree the interest rate applying to post-1986 purchasers. It would, of course, increase the pain to pre-1986 purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out for the interest of the House that in terms of the percentage of 13.5 per cent loans held by the banks-not in money terms but in the percentage of their loans that are regulated-the ANZ Bank has 20 per cent of its loans at 13.5 per cent, the National Australia Bank Ltd has 22 per cent, Westpac Banking Corporation has 20 per cent and the Commonwealth Bank has 50 per cent. As I have said, the value of those loans is not great; they were, of course, smaller loans. Obviously, as was pointed out by Carolyn Hirsh, MP, last night in the Couchman program, many of those loans were cocktailed, that is, those people had the majority of their bank loan at 13.5 per cent, but they also had personal loans. Of course, a large number of people were never protected by the 13.5 per cent because they were paying through building societies which were never covered by that ceiling. So it is a fallacy to say that the removal of the 13.5 per cent ceiling would assist existing home purchasers who are experiencing interest rate difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The demand for housing in Australia is extremely strong. The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry estimated underlying demand for dwellings in 1988-89 at 144,800. Its estimate for the five years to 1992-93 will average about 153,000 per annum. Any honourable member here will realise that is an extremely high dwelling rate. These figures need to be looked at in comparison with the dwelling commencement in past years, which has fluctuated between 105,000 in 1981-82 and 152,000 in 1984-85, which coincides rather closely with the last time that interest rates really started to bite and the last time that housing costs really started to escalate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Graphs of dwelling commencements and underlying demand seem to indicate that 135,000 to 140,000 dwelling commencements per annum is a reasonably sustainable level of activity for the housing construction industry in Australia. Once we get past that point we come up with a lot of problems. In fact, buoyant levels of housing activity in major State capitals and also in south-east Queensland have placed pressure on industry resources. High levels of activity in the alterations and additions sector and in non-residential construction have also contributed to the tight resource situation, particularly for labour. Pressure on resources, particularly land, has caused substantial increases in prices of house and land packages in major housing markets. Whilst Perth has been affected by increases in housing, it has not been affected to the degree that some of the other States have, particularly New South Wales and Victoria, because obviously the pressures are greater in those States. </PARA>
<PARA> Several other solutions, apart from this 13.5 per cent ceiling removal, have been floated in recent months. They have included the encouragement of savings, tax deductability on home loan interest payments and things like housing bonds. I think all of these ideas need to be looked at but some are obviously more appropriate than others. One point that is continually overlooked in all of this debate seems to be the assistance that has been provided to home buyers through the first home owners scheme and, also, the $140m which the Commonwealth Government put in to the original 13.5 per cent ceiling protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing bond idea would depend to a large degree on the tax-free status of interest earned on bonds, which would then allow bond money to be lent also at low interest to first home buyers. I presume that people proposing this scheme mean that it should apply to those buying moderately priced homes, or else there would be no money left to lend to other people. However, it must not be overlooked that the tax-free status would cost the community money from what are essentially public savings through tax forgone. </PARA>
<PARA> One benefit of this system which I think needs to be pointed out is that it would take first home loans out of the profit making market, that is, the banks, and this would be a relief to a large section of the community, particularly those who are concerned about their ability to pay in the longer term. The Government has made several attempts to assist these people before, not only through the first home owners scheme but also through the low start loans and key start loans and so on in certain States and across the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the prospect-I am not sure how many people have discussed this with banks-of getting some sort of contract tightening, some contracted deviation in the rate of interest, or an acceptable interest rate fluctuation within a contract. Many of my constituents have raised with me that perhaps they ought to have, when they sign a contract with the bank, a method that would involve banks in quarantining interest rates on first home loans of an agreed moderate value, where a loan taken out at, say, 14 or 15 per cent could have a variation of 1 or 2 per cent either way. That would give the bank the opportunity to hold the interest at a slightly higher rate once interest rates dropped, with the agreement of the borrower to cover the cost of interest over the allowed limit. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fairly sure that some of these policies should be looked at. There is a cost to the broader community, but with 72 per cent of households actually either owning or buying their homes, it is something that we, as a Government and as members of parliament, definitely must consider. However, we should not forget that public housing is a very important element of policy--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bureaucratic muddling and government inertia are causing very serious frustration and inconvenience for the Inala Rudolf Steiner School and Residential of West Pennant Hills. Certainly, frustration and inconvenience are also affecting many other schools which cater for physically and intellectually disabled children in the community. Right at the start I declare that I have a special interest in the Inala school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The background to this disturbing and totally unacceptable situation is as follows: In early 1986, responsibility for the education, training and educational support services for children with disabilities was transferred from the Department of Community Services and Health to the Commonwealth Schools Commission. The Department of Community Services and Health retained responsibility for recurrent funding of certain services, or aspects of services, such as those relating to residential facilities attached to schools. Subsequently, in May 1987, the Commonwealth Disability Services Act 1986 was introduced, but children's residential facilities did not fit into any of the eligible service types which can currently be funded under that Act; nor did they comply with the principles and objectives gazetted with the Act. Since 1986, the Department of Employment, Education and Training has provided funding for the capital costs of such residential facilities, but the issues of their recurrent or operational funding remains unresolved to this day. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just consider this situation for a moment. Legislation which has the most important financial implications for children in the physically and intellectually handicapped community is assented to in December 1986; it comes into effect on 5 June 1987, and yet in June 1989-two years later-the question of responsibility over recurrent funding is still not resolved, and that is despite constant efforts on the part of administrators of these schools to have the Government resolve this unfortunate situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to outline the inconvenience that this is causing the Rudolf Steiner School at Inala. In 1988, Inala built a new $263,000 residential training facility, which was funded up to 80 per cent by the Federal Department of Employment, Education and Training. In other words, this $263,000 residential training facility was built not only with funds from the Government but also with the blessing of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It was built to provide a program for severely intellectually and physically handicapped young people whose families have extreme difficulty coping with their needs. It was designed to set up a structured residential program to give these intellectually and physically handicapped children as many living skills as possible, and also at the same time to provide respite care for the parents. Of the cost of the building, more than $50,000 has already been raised by the parents and supporters of the Inala school. This facility was finished in December 1988. In other words, it was ready for occupation in December of last year. It still has not been used. There is a very long waiting list and anyone who has any understanding of the situation of those children in the community who are intellectually and physically handicapped will know that the facilities simply do not provide enough spaces for the number of children seeking those spaces. There is a very long waiting list-at present 25 to 30 children are on the short list to go into this facility. The children have been waiting to go into this program between 12 and 18 months already. What do we find? We find a situation in which the facility has been completed and no children have moved into it. </PARA>
<PARA> As the new facility neared completion, Inala applied to the Department for a 1989 recurrent grant to assist in meeting the costs of salaries and other administration associated with the operation of the new building. I mention at this stage that as is the current thinking, the program of this new facility is structured on a family style environment. It is not an old fashioned institutional-type establishment at all; it is right in line with current thinking on the best way to deal with these types of situations. In April 1989 the Department advised Inala that it would offer a one-off payment of $86,000 for 1989, but only on the condition that Inala signed a formal agreement undertaking not to seek money from the Department for this purpose beyond 1989. I just mention at this stage that I have been involved, as have a number of other members, in trying to get some decision from the Government and from the departments involved for many months now. I have not stated the situation publicly because I had hoped it would be resolved between the two Ministers or between the two departments. It simply has not been resolved, and we have had this totally unacceptable offer of one year's funding for $86,000 for the year 1989, but with the requirement that Inala signed a formal agreement undertaking not to seek money from the Department for recurrent expenditure beyond this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs of running this facility at present are $86,000 per year-obviously, totally beyond the resources of the Inala school. Yet we have this Government and these departments saying, `You must sign an undertaking not to seek money from the Department in the future for recurrent funding purposes'. The situation is totally unacceptable because the facility was built with the encouragement and support of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It is there ready to be occupied and it cannot be occupied simply because the question of recurrent funding has not been settled, the offer being made being totally unacceptable. How could any responsible organisation commit itself to the employment of staff, house parents, and the enrolment of children, knowing that it would be impossible to continue their employment and enrolment into 1990? It would be cruel, it would be heartless and it would be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> What is also unacceptable is that the Federal Government can offer a considerable financial support for additional school facilities and then, through sheer inertia, force those same facilities to lie idle as this new $263,000 facility is presently lying idle. That such a wasteful and, I think, blatantly stupid situation has occurred can only be due to one thing-a complete breakdown in the management between those government departments charged with the responsibility to coordinate funding arrangements for residential schools. This breakdown in management has been aptly described by the New South Wales Minister for Family and Community Services in a letter to a ministerial colleague on 1 May 1989, and I quote from that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> At the 1989 Autumn conferences of social welfare administrators and social welfare Ministers, one of the agenda items identified the disability services area as one which is increasingly becoming a major issue in the provision of Commonwealth State community services. The funding anomalies affecting-</PARA>
<PARA>and here a particular school is mentioned-</PARA>
<PARA>provide another clear example of the lack of clarity in the roles and responsibilities of each level of government; in the way that major initiatives by one area of government impact upon others in the absence of any formal planning frameworks; and the multiplicity of funding arrangements and differing accountability requirements for non-government organisations providing services for people with disabilities and their families. </PARA>
<PARA>The Social Welfare Ministers' conference noted that the disability services area is characterised by complexity, overlap, duplication and gaps, and urgently requires clarification of responsibilities to ensure that rational and coordinated services are available to people with disabilities. That such a serious breakdown in the management of disability services occurred at all is bad enough, but there is simply no excuse for such a totally unacceptable situation to remain unresolved for two years after the legislation came into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This has caused needless distress and anxiety for children who are already under stress. It has caused needless distress and anxiety for families and administrators involved in residential schools for disabled children. I would ask, on their behalf, for the Government to address this problem urgently and take whatever remedial action is necessary to ensure the resumption of normal recurrent funding for residential schools for disabled children. Not to do so will be the greatest indictment on the so called caring and responsible attitude that the Government and its Ministers boast so much about. We have two Ministers involved in this situation, neither of whom have been able to make a decision. It is simply an appalling and unacceptable situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that the beast of the colosseum is still with us, because in Perth, over the past week or two, we have had this spectacle of a number of media commentators suggesting that it was their right to reveal personal details of the medical history of citizens in Western Australia. Indeed one wonders at the motivation; whether it is to up the ratings or just the pursuit of hysterical populist beliefs. But clearly, the messages that have been put across in respect of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus have been misleading and deserve commentary. Indeed, responsible authorities in this country have been saying for some time now that what we aim to do is arm people with information about this most frightening and terrifying disease, allow them to make responsible decisions about their own behaviour and about the way in which they conduct their affairs. And indeed, it is most distressing that commentators in Western Australia should suggest that all rights of confidentiality and individual privacy should be cut across in this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can accept the suggestion that we should be taking up the cudgels for quarantining people who are shown to be recalcitrant in their behaviour in respect of AIDS. But we have to be able to prove the fact. Innuendo and guess-work are not sufficient. The concern is, of course, that when we are looking at the control of AIDS-and this is a difficult problem-we have to look at the larger problem. The overwhelming majority of cases of AIDS come from infection from individuals who did not know they were at risk. One of the most important mechanisms of control of this disease is being able to chase down cases to find out those who are at risk. For that to happen, people need to submit themselves to testing. if they are to submit themselves for testing, then we must be able to provide counselling and assistance for them. If they submit themselves to testing then it is important that they be sure that the system protects their confidentiality and protects them from discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, that is the most important issue that is at stake in this debate. Nobody catches AIDS because someone sneezed on them, coughed on them, shook hands with them or talked to them in the street. A person catches AIDS because he or she consented to a particular intimate activity with another person. And the key word here is `consent'. If, indeed, there was no consent then there would be a criminal charge of assault or rape. So if we are talking about the consenting activity of adults in these particular cases, it is most important that we ensure the privacy of those involved. Indeed, the suggestion or the innuendo that we can name individuals without significant or sufficient proof, is abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Western Australian Health Department has the power and will take action if it has significant or sufficient proof of recalcitrant behaviour by individuals-individuals who are maliciously infecting others with this most telling virus. But it does not have that proof and, in the absence of that, media commentators should not be taking the opportunity to breach the confidentiality of those people who are involved. The innuendo that is involved is very damaging and dangerous. The media issue is very important and we need to consider it. Are these commentators suggesting, for instance, that everybody who suffers from a sexually transmitted disease should have his or her name made public? What we think of as harmless sexually transmitted diseases play a significant part in causing infertility in females. And, indeed, significant harm can be done to an individual's future and prospects as a result of contracting a disease. But the important thing to remember here is that these diseases are only contracted through consenting adult behaviour which is not forced or--</PARA>

My comments are exemplified by an excellent article by Glennys Bell in the Bulletin magazine of 30 May titled `Breast cancer: a medical scandal'. She makes the points that about one in 16 Australian women develop breast cancer; that one in 45 risk dying from it and that about 2,200 actually die each year from it. While diagnostic mammograms requiring a doctor's referral are covered by Medicare, breast scanning mammograms for women who have no symptoms or who are in a low risk category are not. Perhaps the Minister perceives greater electoral appeal from the homosexual community than from Australian women as a result of his recently announced limited screening program for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. His reluctance to provide a similar program for breast cancer is indeed a scandal. The Bulletin article concludes:</PARA></TALK.START>

Its activities will be reduced by incorporating the greatly diminished research program into the division of forestry research. Funding will drop to a minuscule $27,000 a year. CSIRO claims that the NBRU is too expensive to operate as a separate entity without outside financial support. Bushfires are a regular and calamitous feature of our landscape in the south-east of Australia, particularly in the urban rural fringes such as the Dandenong Ranges and the Blue Mountains. It is six years since the infamous Ash Wednesday fires and on the balance of probabilities, given the strong rains and consequential lush growth, another conflagration will soon be upon us.

Commercial ventures could be explored with a contribution from beneficiaries or users of bushfire research on a user pays basis and some of the national and overseas consultancy work done on bushfires by the National Safety Council of Australia could be assumed by the NBRU. As a member of the NBRU steering committee, I place on record my appreciation of the work done in the unit by Mr Phil Cheney and his research team.

The list of criticisms about inequities in health and the lack of sensitivity and compassion grows longer every day. An important example is the decision to reduce the Medicare rebate applying to the treatment of a generic disorder commonly known as port wine stain. Three in every 1,000 babies are born with the abnormal complexes of veins that cause these unsightly face and body markings. Laser technology is available to treat those children and until 1 February a rebate of $210 could be claimed for the argon laser method. But after that date the Government scrapped that item and created a new one covering all three laser treatments. The rebate is now a pitiful $81.60. As a result of that draconian decision, hundreds of Australian children and adults will be denied treatment because they can no longer afford it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Monday is World Environment Day, a day that I hope all Australians will observe. The Ahern National Party Government in Queensland is no different from the former Bjelke-Petersen regime, particularly on the environment. It is simply a case of the same dog, different bit of string. There is clear evidence of the Ahern Government's lack of commitment to the environment in my own electorate. At present a radioactive waste dump is being proposed at Redbank and a toxic waste dump is planned for Willowbank near the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Amberley. The Redbank radioactive dump site was decided on without any consultation with the locals and without any environmental impact study being carried out. All evidence indicates that the site is environmentally unacceptable because of its closeness to residential areas and the Brisbane River and the fact that the area is subject to soil movement. Understandably, locals are protesting against this project and many have been arrested, including a 79-year-old grandmother on Mothers Day. The rumoured site for the Willowbank toxic waste dump could destroy a national environmental park where many birds and animals live amongst the trees and enjoy clear water from the natural water course. This site is also close to the residential areas of RAAF personnel at Amberley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Monday is World Environment Day it would be a very good day for the Ahern Government to terminate all such ill-conceived projects and to establish set guidelines to include environment factors and community interest before proceeding with any project of this type. I call on the Ahern Government to do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Next year, 1990, will be the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign-an occasion when Australia attained nationhood and when the blood of young Australians was shed in the defence of freedom. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has recently announced that veterans of that campaign will be taken back to Gallipoli to celebrate this milestone in our history. Many of those who fought and many of those who lost their lives in the Gallipoli campaign were teenagers or only a little older.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The seventy-fifth anniversary provides an ideal opportunity to make all Australians, particularly young Australians, more aware of the significance of Anzac. A contingent of young army cadets and Australian students should be sent to accompany these veterans. They should act as aids and, in the process, they would be sure to absorb some of the Anzac tradition and spirit. There are thousands of young Australians visiting Gallipoli in Turkey every year. There is a great need for tourist information and for guides in the battlefield area. Canada has a scheme where by students act as volunteer tourist guides at Vimy Ridge on the Somme battlefield in France during the summer vacation. Australia should establish a similar scheme for Gallipoli on Anzac Day 1990 on an on-going basis. </PARA>

That memo, which I passed on to the relevant authorities, highlighted the drought rorts that have been going on in Queensland under the incompetent administration of the State Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Neville Harper. But further, information has come to me this week from a departmental officer who has been frightened to come forward himself because the Special Branch has been brought into the Department of Primary Industries. That information highlights the fact that cattle from a drought-stricken property in Queensland went on to win the fat cattle section at the Townsville show. This demonstrates the totally ludicrous situation we have in Queensland where taxpayers' money has been misused; winks and nods have passed for capable administration. Is it any wonder that we have the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct? What we really need is Mr Fitzgerald to put on an Akubra hat, come up into the bush and clean up the rorts that have been bedevilling primary producers for so long.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A question on wheat from the Opposition is about as rare as a question to the Government on the environment. That one question from the honourable member means that he has asked me half as many questions as the entire Opposition this year, and more questions on wheat. The fact of the matter is that the Opposition is trying to wriggle out of the commitment by the former Leader of the Opposition to ensure that there is a deregulated domestic wheat market after 1 July this year. This was repeated by both the new and former Opposition leaders, but they obviously did not know what they were talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is trying to amend the Wheat Marketing Bill to require a higher underwriting and a grower chairperson for the Australian Wheat Board. Opposition members have adjourned the debate in the Senate in a stunt to try to place pressure on the Government to accept their amendments. I want to advise the House-and tell the Opposition directly to its face-that the Government will not cave in on this issue. We will not give the wheat industry a level of underwriting so high that it will never have any incentive to stand on its own feet; a level that also discriminates against other products, and other grains in particular. We will not accept that the Australian Wheat Board-a $3 billion enterprise-will be led by anyone less than the best person available. That is what the Opposition says it wants, but that is not the real issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The real issue is that the new Leader of the Opposition has ratted on his mates who supported deregulation and has returned to the days of Liberal toadying to the backwoods regulators of the National Party of Australia. The National Party wants the sunset clause in the current legislation to trigger, because that would mean that compulsory acquisition of the wheat crop would continue for two years. The National Party does not care about wheat growers. The loss of underwriting under the sunset clause would cost the industry the best part of $100m in extra interest alone.</PARA>
<PARA> Wheat deregulation is a necessary part of the Government's program to meet the economic challenges facing Australia. By reducing costs to both growers and users it will increase exports of both wheat and wheat products. The National Party is interested only in the comfort of the status quo of regulation, kneecapping the Liberals and sabotaging the Government's program of micro-economic reform. It is to the eternal discredit of the present Leader of the Opposition that he wants to let it do that.</PARA>

Since 1983 the Government's social justice strategy has significantly increased the provision of services for the aged. In October 1988 the Social Security Review issued a report on retirement income.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two distinct features of the Government's approach to aged care; firstly, the recognition that most old people would wish to remain as independent as possible for as long as possible. Indeed, we have designed programs, particularly the home and community care program, to attend to that matter. Secondly, there is the Government's clear commitment to the development of a retirement income policy that is adequate, fair, sustainable and secure. In fact, details of that policy will be released by my colleague the Minister for Social Security in the course of his response to the inquiry, and it will relate both to those who are at present in retirement and to those who are approaching retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that last year the Opposition announced its retirement income policy, but the policy tends to concentrate on those yet to retire, with very little emphasis in the Opposition policy on those people already at pensionable age.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told it is Old Testament. Out of 109 pages only four pages have any reference to retirement. Again, the focus is on those approaching retirement, rather than on the 1.7 million people who are at present age and service pensioners. We are told that we have a Liberal Party hotline which will enable people to find out the answers if they have concerns in any of those areas. Of course, there is not one scrap of information of it for anyone, including the aged. All the hotline does is to provide a recorded message asking people to ring the Liberal Party in Canberra. At present, confusion would only mount if anyone did that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We debated in this House quite recently the amendments to social security legislation; amendments which directly affect the aged and families in relation to the April statement. The Government always welcomes debate on these issues, but the shadow Minister for Social Security, when I read his speech on that matter, failed to make a single mention of the aged in that speech. His excuse was that he did not have time, even though the two major elements of the legislation which was passed concerned the aged and families. Of course, the shadow Treasurer who-as I have repeated time and time again, and will go on repeating-threatens to slash expenditure in that area. When one puts together that package, looks at Future Directions, looks at the statements from the shadow Minister for Social Security and listens to the remarks from the shadow Treasurer, then clearly under a coalition government the aged would be vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to compare that with the policies which have been pursued by this Government. We have had a major report from the Social Security Review on the income needs of the aged and a massive consultation exercise with the aged on the issues raised by that Review.

Before going to that, I point out that we have maintained our commitment to increase the aged pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings; a commitment we have made and maintained to index aged pensions. Since 1983 the aged pension has increased in real terms by more than 7.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the point raised by the honourable member for Bradfield, the recent April economic statement was the first stage of the phased retirement incomes policy. Contrary to the interjection, it provided significant advantages to all age pensioners. We have a commitment to bring forward the indexation of age pensions by 12 weeks. So, from 1991 indexation adjustments will be the speediest we have ever had for age pensioners in this country. A commitment was also made that, by July 1990, all income received by age pensioners within the income test free area would be 100 per cent tax free. Not only have we seriously undertaken to address the major issues across this field but also practical legislation is in place, which is a clear response. We will continue to consult with the aged and effectively respond to them.</PARA>

This Government and I will not interfere in that process as, quite clearly, the Tribunal is an independent tribunal. I am sure that Deputy President Riordan and the other people on the Tribunal are well aware of the workload in front of them and the importance of this case-it is important for the delivery of health care in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A point that needs to be made is that, currently, our system of remuneration for pharmacists, which basically, has existed since the introduction of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, remunerates pharmacists for selling pills. This Government is concerned not simply about the fact that more and more pills can be sold and that that is the basis for remuneration; this Government believes that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme should be there for a variety of reasons, principally to ensure that those who require pharmaceuticals will be able to afford them and get access to the best drugs. We will continue to do that in our submissions and in our efforts. It is not simply a matter of remuneration for selling pills. We believe that pharmacy plays an important role in the delivery of health services. I believe that a lot of work has to be done to re-emphasise and develop further the role of pharmacies as health deliverers; not simply as people whose whole being and place in the health care system depend on their selling more and more expensive pills. There is certainly a lot of work to be done. But it is not my place, nor is it the place of any other member in this House, to tell the Tribunal what to do.</PARA>
<PARA> After talking to pharmacists right around Australia-and I have had the opportunity to do that quite a lot in recent weeks and months-it has become apparent to me that, in concentrating simply on the remuneration of pharmacists, we do not get the best overall idea of ways of dealing with the pharmaceuticals issue. I will be making a significant announcement later today about ways in which we can improve the consultative process between all players involved in pharmaceutical benefits-whether they be pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmacists, consumers, doctors or workers. Whilst I take on board the honourable member's question, I think it is also important to recognise that this Government's health care policy is second to none in the history of this country.</PARA>

<PARA> This Government is delivering health care services, through Medicare, aged care and, in particular, through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I believe that this delivery of services ought to be taken properly into account, as it has been by millions of people-the pensioners, the chronically ill and those on low incomes as well as every other Australian. A point that needs to be made is that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth, quite clearly has signalled that there should not be tax cuts and that there should be spending cuts, particularly in the health area. I think everyone will be awaiting his pronouncements of where health care and, in particular, pharmaceutical benefits will be going under any government of which he might be a part.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the question from the honourable member for Fowler, I am glad to say that at least in words the policy of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) is in complete accord with that of the Government on general practitioner (GP) training and continuing education. I will quote from the 1988 version of the policy platform of the AMA; I do not believe there has been any alteration. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Postgraduate education</PARA>
<PARA> Adequate postgraduate training is a pre-requisite for unsupervised medical practice.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of general practice the Family Medicine Programme of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners provides one avenue for appropriate postgraduate vocational training.</PARA>
<PARA> Access to the Family Medicine Programme, or comparable training, should be available to every medical graduate wishing to undertake unsupervised general practice.</PARA>
<PARA>This is most important:</PARA>
<PARA> No medical practitioner should ever enter unsupervised general practice without having completed such training.</PARA>
<PARA>Those words on training of GPs by the AMA in its own policy statement are in complete accord with Government policy. Similarly, on continuing education the AMA policy states:</PARA>
<PARA>Practising doctors have a professional obligation to maintain their standards, skills and efficiency by continuously updating their knowledge. To this end regular participation in continuing medical education is essential-</PARA>
<PARA>the words `is essential' are those of the AMA-</PARA>
<PARA> The provision of continuing medical education programme and selfassessment programmes for the above purpose is the responsibility of the medical colleges and specialists societies.</PARA>
<PARA>In the legislation the Government introduced and which is now before another place, we have done exactly what the AMA has seen as necessary and essential and we provided financial incentives for GPs so they can do that vocational training and have continuing medical education. Indeed, the New South Wales branch of the AMA has made clear that it believes there should be differential fees between those GPs who have had vocational training and those who have not.</PARA>
<PARA> The AMA, despite its words being clearly in accord with Government policy, has done its best to prevent the passage of the present legislation. I remind members of the Opposition that if there are some minor finetuning problems in the proposals, as I indicated in my second reading speech, we would introduce further legislation to refine the processes in the next session of the Parliament. There would be every opportunity for any amendments to be made. There is no reason whatsoever to prevent the establishment of registration and the medical benefits that will flow from that both to patients and to doctors. There will be higher medical rebates for patients and the vast majority of GPs would have improved annual incomes. If there are any finetuning difficulties they can be fixed in the legislation which necessarily has to come before this House and the Senate in the next session.</PARA>
<PARA> There is wide support for the proposals that have been made both from GPs and the public, and I just refer to that. There is increasing support from pensioner groups because they recognise that these proposals will provide better care for pensioners and, as I said yesterday, will assist doctors to maintain bulk billing. The Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia has written to the honourable member for Tangney pointing out that the Federation is particularly concerned since a sizeable and growing proportion of those who will be adversely affected are from the ethnic communities. The people with whom the Opposition has allied itself are people like Dr Shepherd who this week wrote a letter to all GPs in New South Wales suggesting that they should consider ceasing bulk billing for the disadvantaged, including the unemployed and low income families. The AMA itself is advising GPs to change the new levels and use the content-based fees, but is supporting the Opposition in refusing to allow those rebates to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA> I make a last effort on the last day of the meeting of this House, at least for some weeks, and I quote from a joint release from the Australian Pensioners Federation and the Combined Pensioners Association of Australia. I quote this because those organisations sum up very clearly the intent of the legislation, the support of the Royal College and the reasons they support the legislation and the reasons the AMA in its statement advocates these sorts of policies. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>We are supporting the proposed reforms to general practice because it will allow doctors to put the care back into their practices. By reimbursing doctors willing to undergo further training and quality assurance measures people will receive better quality care and the local doctors better rebates-consumers and doctors win.</PARA>

Was the Acting Treasurer informed that this error rate was calculated on the number of letters-that is, 140,000-actually returned to the Tax Office and that the real error rate is likely to be as high as double that, which means that Australia-wide possibly some 170,000 letters containing tax file numbers remain unaccounted for?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. Has the Federal Government been providing the Australian National Railways Commission with a revenue supplement over the past 10 years? Was $51m of taxpayers' money provided in direct subsidy last financial year? Why does the Government continue to support Australian National (AN)?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3418" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CHARLTON" MINISTERIAL="LAND TRANSPORT AND SHIPPING SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the question asked by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I acknowledge that, as a member from South Australia, where Australian National chiefly operates, he has shown a continuing interest in the operation of AN and the functions it fulfils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> AN started to operate in the way in which it operates at present in about 1978, when we brought together the Tasmanian Railways and the Australian National Railways operating through South Australia. The honourable member's figure of $51m as a revenue supplement to Australian National last year is correct, but I emphasise that since 1983-84 that revenue supplement has been reduced by 60 per cent. AN is now in the process of showing that there is an important role for railways and rails services to play in Australia. There has been a significant number of improvements in the extent to which AN has been operating. Of course, we have provided whatever assistance we have been able to in connection with the upgrading of tracks and terminals, but the changes that have taken place quite clearly reflect a great deal of credit not only on the management of AN but also on its staff and on the responsiveness of the unions involved. These changes have been very substantial.</PARA>
<PARA> It is expected, as I mentioned a couple of days ago, that the Rail Industry Council, which brought together a lot of interests involved in rail services in Australia, will report by the end of this year. We hope that, as a result of that type of inquiry and that type of council operation, together with the improvements that have taken place in AN, there will be a substantial improvement generally in the way in which rails services operate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting that AN has been able to bring about an increase in the freight it carries of in excess of 35 per cent and an improvement in productivity of about 150 per cent. I am delighted with what AN is doing. I am delighted that the Government has had the opportunity to indicate, by its support for AN, that it endorses the role that rail transport can and should play in Australia. I have no doubt at all that those improvements will continue to occur. In short, the answer is yes, we did fund AN by way of revenue supplement last year to the extent of $51m. That supplement has been reduced by 60 per cent in the last five or six years. It is improving and it will continue to improve as a result of the initiative and the cooperation of all the parties involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories and concerns Australia's premier export growth industry-tourism. Does the Minister hold figures indicating a dramatic fall in the number of international tourists arriving in Australia during the first quarter of this year? Are the major declines from the United States of America and Japanese markets? Do the Minister's intelligence sources indicate that the principal reason for the sharp decline is the tragedy that is Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport? Have the constant delays and shutdowns in the inadequate international terminal all featured as a root cause for the decline in growth of the Japanese and United States tourist traffic?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. From the very nature of the question let me say that my intelligence sources are probably much better than his. On the basis that there was a major increase in tourism last year, mainly related to the Bicentennial, I think we would be over-optimistic to expect to maintain that flow of tourism this year. Such information as I have at the moment seems to indicate, on the figures available, that the tourism figure is plateauing at a level below that. I will be taking up the details of that next week. But, certainly, to say that all the problems of Sydney Airport can be laid at the feet of the Government is palpable nonsense. As to whoever has informed the honourable gentleman in those terms, all I can say is that he should perhaps try to establish better intelligence sources.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G4">Mr DUNCAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that she has a very keen interest in this matter and the associated jobs, education and training program. It is certainly early days as far as the new start program is concerned. It has been operating for only three months, but it has been doing so quite successfully. The cooperation between my Department and the Department of Social Security to ensure that people who have been unemployed for a long period, for 12 months or longer, have a fair go and are able to get assistance to get back into the work force has been quite successful. I can tell the House that 5,000 people in the target group-those between 21 and 54 years of age who have been unemployed for 12 months or longer-have found work as a result of the operation of the program. As I say, that is a very satisfactory result, given that the program has been in its formative stages. I am very confident that the program will continue to be successful and that we will see a quite dramatic drop in the numbers of long term unemployed as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we have a particular difficulty with long term unemployment as a result of the 1982 recession. Many of the people who are still unemployed long term became unemployed during the shakeout that occurred in the 1982-83 recession under Treasurer Howard. Those people are now receiving particular support from this Government to ensure that they will be able to take their place in the work force.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the question that has been asked by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I know the importance of this matter not only to the Northern Territory and northern Australia generally, but to the whole of Australia. As a result of opening up that particular passage we have been able to establish a much cheaper and safer navigational channel between Groote Eylandt and Newcastle to get the manganese down to Newcastle and also bauxite from Weipa around to Gladstone. As the honourable member knows, the previous passage that was used up there was the Gannet Passage, which was quite a dangerous passage. The Varzin Passage has been identified as a result of the studies that have been carried out by the Royal Australian Navy and it goes through some of those areas in the Gulf which had previously been believed to have been shallows. It is a much safer passage now to connect the Gulf of Carpentaria around to the east coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the interesting things about the process of identifying where we should best place navigational aids was that it normally had to be done by a trial and error system. On this particular occasion we have been able to use a simulator at the Maritime College in Tasmania in order to build up the channel contours in the area through there. We were then able to call on experienced navigators who were with the college and the Department. Some of them were also associated with the Queensland Coast and the Torres Strait Pilot Service. In effect, they were able to navigate a simulated mock-up of the Iron Whyalla, about 147,000 tonnes, through the new passage, and to identify where the navigational aids should go. The advantage of siting our navigational aids in this manner is that it can be done a lot more efficiently and cheaply than may otherwise have happened. I am delighted with the way in which the Australian Maritime College has been able to participate in that. I understand the importance of it to the honourable member for the Northern Territory. It is a great boon as far as we are concerned not only for the Northern Territory but for northern Australia and for Australia generally.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The new Act will replace the existing legislation I think early this month. It provides additional protection for land owners when the Commonwealth wishes to acquire their property. The desirability of major changes to the Commonwealth's land acquisition legislation was identified and recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission some time ago. In fact, that inquiry was instigated by the former government and this Government has accepted and acted on the vast majority of the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission. The Act will provide more open procedures in the acquisition process. It will provide for greater public accountability for the decisions to acquire people's land in the first place and it will provide for improved appeal procedures both on the primary decision to appeal and also on matters of individual compensation for specific properties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions of the new Act-I think that these are very important transition arrangements-will apply to all acquisitions that are not completed by the time of the commencement of the new Act. Some owners whose land has already been acquired will also benefit because the transitional provisions provide that where a property has been compulsorily acquired after 26 May last year the compensation provisions of the new Act will apply. This includes the ability to have the Administrative Appeals Tribunal make a binding determining on the amount of compensation to be paid on all those acquisitions that have been commenced but not completed since 26 May last year.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards Badgerys Creek, the first major application of this new Act will be seen in the acquisition of the remaining properties on the Badgerys Creek site for the second Sydney airport. The Government has already announced its intention to acquire all the remaining properties at Badgerys Creek by the end of this year. So from early 1990 we will be in a position where construction can start on a general aviation facility and, if necessary, on a much more substantial airport depending on the findings of the environmental assessment of the third runway option at the Kingsford-Smith Airport.</PARA>

<PARA> An otherwise sleepy Question Time was enlivened yesterday by a mischievous intervention from the outgoing Labor Member for Robertson, Barry Cohen. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Cohen seems more interested these days in selling books and telling jokes than in the fortunes of the colleagues who might have treated him badly when he was dropped from the ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> There was not much humour in the situation when, after several enthusiastic attempts, he attracted the Speaker's eye for a question to acting Treasurer John Dawkins. </PARA>
<PARA> His question began with a reference to the many young people who had bought land after September 1985-a significant date in the life of the capital gains tax-with the intention of building a house on that land. </PARA>
<PARA> Was it a fact, he asked, that such young people who did not proceed with their plans for reasons such as not going on with their marriage were subject to capital gains tax when they sold their land?</PARA>
<PARA> It was a more difficult teaser than anything the Opposition put to the Government on the day. It also appeared to be genuinely without notice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, I have written this letter on behalf of the Opposition to enable us to discuss matters which have been debated in this Parliament for some time and which were put before us yesterday in such a very clear manner by the shadow Treasurer. I also felt that this would be an opportunity for a significant event if the bait were taken-and it has been taken. For the first time, since the last election at least, the man at the table, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), is prepared to have a debate with the Opposition on the economy as a matter of public importance. One might think that he is here because of the crippling state of the economy, but every member of this Parliament knows that this ego-driven man, harmed and hurt by the reviews of the two debates last week, has felt compelled to come into the chamber today and debate the issue. This is the first time that the Prime Minister has participated, and it is no coincidence that the dent in his ego last week has brought this about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I will ask the Prime Minister is whether he can tell us why he has not requested the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to return to Australia-at least at the end of the current ministerial council meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). </PARA>
<PARA> If the Prime Minister regards a sojourn through the Soviet Union as being more important than the Treasurer executing his duties at home, he will allow him to go to the Soviet Union. However, if he regards the reality of the debt figure released yesterday-which exceeds $100 billion-as being important enough to warrant the Treasurer executing his duties, he will say, `Yes, I am bringing him back'. We will get our answer and we know in advance what it will be. The reason for the Opposition's bringing on this debate is not merely to bring in the Prime Minister as a participant in the chamber in a real debate, but also it is due to the fact that yesterday's announcement that Australia's net foreign debt had exceeded $100 billion is a sharp reminder of the state of the economy under Labor, that is, under this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1983 our net foreign debt was less than 14 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). It is now over 31 per cent of GDP. I recommend that honourable members look at a table headed `Australia's Billowing Foreign Debt' in today's Australian Financial Review, and the contrast between now and only nine years ago. In 1979-80 the net debt was 5.7 per cent of GDP; now, in this financial year, 1988-89, it is 31 per cent. Honourable members will see that for the last four years it has been stuck at over 30 per cent. There has been no progress and restraint has been urged by the Government without result. </PARA>
<PARA> This has taken place in a climate in which the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia has said that there has been a `major miscalculation' in economic management. Never in the history of our country has the Governor of the Reserve Bank been forced to admit that there has been a major miscalculation in economic management. The reality is that the majority of Australians actually did not need the Governor to tell them that. They have felt it. They have copped it as inflation and interest rates have wound up. Put simply, if one wants to use a different expression from that used by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Government has blown it. It has done the unthinkable. It is building up Australia's foreign debt at an ever-increasing rate. It is building up Australia's foreign debt at a time of record high commodity prices. One could comprehend a nation such as Australia, which requires profitable trade in its commodities, being in difficulty if the commodity market were down, but at a time of record commodity prices we have record debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me draw attention to three facts only. Despite the arrogance and disdain of this Government for what is transpiring, at least three salient facts ought to be put. Fact one is that the current account deficit for August of this financial year was the worst on record. It was followed by the worst on record in October, the worst on record in November and the worst on record in January, February and March. The latest figures, namely those for April, gave the Government cause for a sigh of relief. The April figures were not the worst on record; they were the second worst on record. We have had six months of the worst current account deficit figures on record and, in the seventh month, the second worst on record. Yet the current occupant of the Prime Ministership went to a press conference yesterday and said-not under the guise of specific evidence; without any at all, but with the normal recourse to hyperbole that we are becoming accustomed to-that real living standards will rise. That observation ought to be consigned to the same basket as his undertaking earlier this year that interest rates would fall. </PARA>
<PARA> Fact two is that, even after the fiddle with the consumer price index, inflation is running at about 7 per cent compared with the Treasurer's forecast of 4.5 per cent by June this year. Fact three is that home mortgage interest rates were 13.5 per cent in June last year and are now 17 per cent. This is despite the fact that at around the beginning of this year, in February, when they increased to 15 per cent the current occupant of the Prime Ministership said that they would fall. The recent spate of distressing economic statistics comes after years of restraint for many in the community-years which I would call restraint without results. </PARA>
<PARA> To rub salt into the wounds, this Government has absolutely no sense of urgency. It has not changed policy to correct the situation. It has just implemented a tighter and tighter monetary policy-that blunt instrument that raises interest rates, ruins the chances for young couples to buy their own homes and threatens to abort the recent, albeit long overdue, pick-up in investment. The outlook for next year is for another huge current account deficit, a stubbornly high inflation rate and continued high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very serious charge to make against the Government. It has grossly mismanaged the economy. It has hiked interest rates. It has plunged Australia into foreign debt when we have had one of the longest sustained recoveries in the world economy and when we have had record high commodity prices. That is in stark contrast to the banana republic period in 1986 when our terms of trade fell sharply. One would have expected our economic performance to have improved. The Government has driven Australia backwards-backwards on the balance of payments, backwards on foreign debt, backwards on inflation, backwards on interest rates and backwards on the living standards of the overwhelming majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> This Australia of ours is not the nation it was when this Government was elected. To the smart alec who wishes to say, `No, it is a better one', I say, `Test it out with the majority who find it difficult to meet the basic requirements of residing in this community-food, clothing, health, education and, above all, housing, which is crippling the majority of Australians today'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has the hide, in circumstances where it is relying on but one economic lever, as it puts it, or instrument, namely monetary policy, to say that this Opposition has no policies. I will tell the Government what the Opposition would do if faced with these problems. We make no bones about it. We would have, not a draconian, but a tighter fiscal policy. That the Government will not do. We would have a wages policy to ensure that we were directing our efforts on that front towards increased competition and productivity that reflected productivity at either the enterprise or the industry level. Wage increases would be set in relation to productivity increases, and where people did not wish to negotiate we would amend the Industrial Relations Act to ensure that the Industrial Relations Commission took account of productivity, international competitiveness, inflation and employment. The Government cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at a press conference, with those two settings in place we would then have a steadier monetary policy to bring down inflation and interest rates. The Government will not move on fiscal policy; it cannot move on wages policy; it will not move on monetary policy; and it cannot go into the area of micro-economic reform which is essential for Australia if we are to cope with the international environment of competitiveness that we face these days. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight this Government will bring down a statement on coastal shipping and the waterfront. Senator Button, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, has already indicated that it is inadequate. Simply to deal with coastal shipping and the waterfront, whilst a gigantic step forward, ignores the other areas that we are prepared to advance across on behalf of the great trading industries in this country to ensure that the non-trading industries that serve them-such as railways, road transport, power generation and telecommunications-bring about the essential reforms that are required. The Government will not do that because it cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Over and above that, we have our schedule of privatisation, the benefits of which the Government has talked about, which the Government has recognised as needing to be undertaken, but which the Government could not get through the Labor Party Conference outside this elected chamber. Whether it is on fiscal policy, wages policy, monetary policy or the whole area of micro-economic reform, including privatisation, the Government has not a coordinated approach. We have. We know, on the best and most objective of economic advice, that our approach will work. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government we are reliant solely on the one blunt instrument-monetary policy. Essentially, members of the Government are sitting on their hands. The Government just raises interest rates. It makes all sorts of vacuous statements about micro-economic reform. The reality is that at the end of the day the Government has created a nation-a nation which was viewed as one of the most egalitarian in the world-for the very few. That might cheer the Prime Minister and some of his mates, but it does not cheer the overwhelming majority of Australians who have suffered at the hands of the Government's arrogance and disdain in failing to address, either at the micro-level or at the macro-level, the policies that are required to turn Australia around. </PARA>
<PARA> The foreign debt has quadrupled, and the Prime Minister goes before a press conference and tells people that their standard of living will rise. There has been a rejigging of tax rates-a form of tax reform without any substantive tax relief. The Government has been unable to tackle inflation and thereby reduce interest rates. The Government has ensured that, tragically, standards of living continue to fall until the Opposition returns to government with its wide-ranging set of coordinated programs which are essential to Australia's economic recovery. The Government will continue to rely, with the disdain that we have noticed, on the blunt instrument of monetary policy which forces interest rates higher and higher. </PARA>
<PARA> I would love to conclude on the note that I felt confident I would get the message to the Prime Minister so that he would understand that his responsibility is not just to the labour movement and to the Labor Party but that he occupies the highest position in the land with a responsibility to all Australians. I abandoned that notion some time ago because, in the abject manner in which he has pursued economic policy, he has revealed himself as a sectional Prime Minister prepared to depress living standards in this country to a level never before known. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Opposition members walked out of government in 1983 so many things were left to judge them by as people who had been derelict in their duty of looking after the interests of this country that it was almost impossible to pick the item about which we could say, `This is the worst indictment'. If I had to choose, it would be in the area of education. In the last five years of the Opposition's tenure of government in this country, the participation rate in education moved up by one percentage point, from 35 per cent to 36 per cent. The former Government walked out of office with one of the lowest education retention rates anywhere in the developed world. That meant that the children in this country who came from the homes of low to middle income families had a significantly lower chance of participating in the education system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is one issue which will determine whether there is something approaching egalitarianism in this country, it is the policy of the government in determining whether kids, from whatever level of family income, are able to stay on in the education system. In the former Government's last five years in office, the participation rate rose from 35 per cent to 36 per cent. When we came to office we said, `There will be an end to this'. If there is one characteristic of a decent society, a society which talks about equality of opportunity, it is the government's attitude to giving the kids the chance of going through the education system. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that the comparison be made between a one per cent increase in the participation rate in the last five years of the conservative Government and an increase from 36 per cent to 58 per cent-a 22 per cent increase-in the participation rate under this Government. That goes right to the heart of egalitarianism. If there is one thing in any society which goes to the question of equality of opportunity, it is whether our children are to have an equal opportunity of being in the education system and of having their talents developed. That is the comparison: a one per cent increase in the participation rate in the former Government's last five years of office; in ours, a 22 per cent increase already. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to health. The Opposition walked out of office leaving two million of our fellow Australians-the people for whom members of the Opposition now shed crocodile tears-with no health cover at all. Those people were faced with the tragedy of expenses which may arise in regard to medical or hospital treatment. Out of a population of fewer than 16 million, two million Australians had hovering over their heads at all times the possible tragedy of unmeetable expenses in the medical and hospital areas. In one stroke, the Government removed that tragedy, that spectre which haunted two million of our fellow Australians, by producing a situation where not one of our fellow Australians any longer has that spectre over him. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to the question of taxation. As I had cause to say yesterday, the former Government walked out of office leaving the most dilapidated, inequitable taxation system to be found anywhere in the Western world. That is not my judgment alone. It is the judgment of independent people. It is the judgment of the former Government's own Royal Commissioner who was appointed because the former Government sought to bash the trade unions. But its own Royal Commissioner, Commissioner Costigan, said after the former Government's period in office that the fastest growing industry in Australia was the tax avoidance industry. The Opposition was so concerned about the interests of ordinary Australians that, as Professor Mathews of the Australian National University-not the Australian Labor Party-said, under the former Government it had become a question of choice as to whether the wealthy would pay their tax. That is how much disregard the former Government had. It was a vandal in regard to the conduct of taxation policy. It was no wonder that the former Government walked out of office with a top tax rate of 60c in the dollar. It was not collected from those who should pay. It was imposing a burden upon the ordinary working men and women of this country. Those people cannot hire tax lawyers and accountants. Every week or fortnight they pay their tax. The former Government let the people with the greatest capacity to pay avoid paying. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the three central areas of education, health and taxation. The former Government inflicted a travesty of justice upon this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition has talked about what has happened to the economy. I am glad he has. I want to spend the rest of my time giving a detailed analysis of what the Government has done and comparing it with what the former Government did. The Leader of the Opposition started his speech by going back to 1983. Under the former Government the current account deficit was worse than it is now. In 1981-82 the current account deficit was around 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). In 1988-89 it will be between 4 1/2 per cent and 5 per cent. When talking about the current account deficit, the Leader of the Opposition lists off the bad months and says, `Look what has been happening to the current account deficit'. He cannot avoid the fact because it is indisputable. In the former Government's last year in office the current account deficit, as a percentage of GDP, was worse than it is now. So do not give us this nonsense, reeling off the August, September, October, November and December figures. It is about the only thing that the Leader of the Opposition can get in sequence.

<PARA> Let us talk about what has happened to the economy and whether there is growth and whether things are being done to benefit ordinary Australians. Do honourable members opposite know what their achievement was? It had never before been equalled. No government in the history of this country had been able to achieve what they uniquely did. At one and the same go they had double digit unemployment and double digit inflation. That is what we inherited-a preceding 12-month period with 250,000 of our fellow Australians thrown onto the unemployment scrapheap under the vandalist policies of those opposite. For the first time there was negative growth in this country. As they mismanaged the Australian economy, and as they reaped the most inegalitarian society this country had seen, they stopped the economy in its tracks, something that no-one had ever done before. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me contrast the performance of this Government with what honourable members opposite did with the economy. What we did was to say, when we came into office, `First of all, we will start to remove this blot of an inegalitarian society which you foisted upon us', and we did that in the ways I have indicated, in regard to education, taxation and health. Most importantly, we said that we would get Australians back to work. In the last 12 months of the previous Government a quarter of a million people were thrown onto the unemployment scrapheap. What did we do? I can tell honourable members opposite what we did. They do not like to hear the facts, but they have no answer to them. In our term of office we have put 1.4 million of our fellow Australians back into work. There are two things to be said about that figure, a staggering figure-of 1.4 million of our fellow Australians put back to work. The first thing to be said is that it represents a rate of job creation that is four times faster than the rate of job creation in the Liberal term of office. Let those opposite dwell upon that. We have created jobs for Australians four times faster than they did. If they want to talk about an egalitarian society, if they want to remove the problems of a situation in which people are not able to look after themselves, the first thing they must do is to create jobs for them-and we have created jobs four times faster than they did. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing to be said about that statistic is that that rate of job creation is more than twice as fast as that in the rest of the world. If we want a judgment about the appropriateness of our economic policies, let us look at the judgments that have been made recently and last year by the people who have the authority and the responsibility to look at the conduct of economic policy in countries around the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition says `Moody's'. I will give him Moody's. He should look at every other statement that has been made since the statement by Moody's Investor Services Inc. came out. Standard and Poor's, the Australian rating agency-everyone has come out and contradicted Moody's. The Leader of the Opposition quotes Moody's because he wants to do something that should make him despised by all Australians. He wants to seize upon the one statement which would knock his country and which would say of Australia, `Australia is down.' He picks on the one-Moody's-that puts his country down. Obviously, if we are to ask who the Opposition will look at, we must answer that it will look at Moody's. Why? Because Moody's puts Australia down. That is what the Opposition wants-to put Australia down. Against the Opposition's Moody's which puts Australia down, I will give it Standard and Poor's and the statement by Bill Chambers, the Australian analyst for Standard and Poor's. While honourable members opposite want to grab Moody's because it puts Australia down, I will give them Standard and Poor's. Let us see what the Australian analyst says about this. On the Australian Broadcasting Commission AM program yesterday, the announcer, talking about Bill Chambers of Standard and Poor's, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On general economic policy, he claimed the Government was broadly on track, adding that in reality there's very little argument about the direction of policy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of Standard and Poor's. But, of course, this miserable Opposition would not refer to Standard and Poor's. Why? Because Standard and Poor's says good things about the country. It says good things about Australia and about the conduct of economic policy. But the miserable people opposite, inheriting the mantle of their previous Leader, who said, `The times will suit me', have seen their new Leader try to grab hold of Moody's because it puts his country down. If they want to go on with that sort of tactic of putting their country down, they can do it. I can tell them that poll results such as they saw in yesterday's Bulletin, which show that they have already been rejected and repudiated by the Australian people, will get worse and worse. I will have Deep Throat coming to me in the next couple of months telling me what the Howard count is. At the moment I am told that it is 25, but it will rise rapidly, if honourable members opposite go on like this. According to Deep Throat, it will only be a question of when, not if. </PARA>
<PARA> Having disposed of that matter, let me go to the question of the debt. The debt is something that has excited honourable members opposite. We are not trying to say that the issue of the debt is something that we ignore or run away from; it is something that must be faced up to. But let us analyse it. Honourable members opposite will not want to do that. What they have tried to do is mischievously and callously to frighten the Australian people about this issue of debt. They take the figure of just over $100 billion of net foreign debt, and then they take the number of households in the country, divide that into the first figure, and say to the poor people of Australia, `Look, you are up for that enormous amount of money. That is the debt with which you are saddled.' It is a lie; it is a gross misrepresentation, and everyone who knows anything about economics knows that. How the good, decent, gentle Professor Edwards could sit back and accept that sort of nonsense, I would not know, because the fact is that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the sensitivity of the Government. Let us deal with the facts, because the Prime Minister did not. Let us deal with the Government's own standards: people are entitled to be judged by their own standards. Let us quote the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who is absent; he is out buying clocks. Let us address what the Treasurer said just after the last election. That is what we will address in this debate, because this debate is about foreign debt; it is about economic policy; it is about management, something that the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is trying to learn about rapidly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the Government the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is winning on inflation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What have we got? We have an inflation rate of 7 per cent but the forecast was 4 1/2 per cent. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . its winning on interest rates . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What are interest rates now? They are 17 per cent if one is buying a house and 23 per cent if one is running a business and they are rising. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . its winning on growth and is winning on the most important thing of all the current account deficit and our external debt. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Treasurer said-`We are winning'. He promptly left the country. Where is he when the Government is about to debate this issue? He is in Leningrad or Paris or somewhere. The Prime Minister might not want to acknowledge or even be measured against his Treasurer's statement because he knows that the Treasurer seeks to replace him. Let us measure the Prime Minister against his own statements. This statement was made in April 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>But what I'm saying to the workers of this country, and what the Treasurer, Paul Keating, is saying, is that the worst of that time is over. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The worst of that time is over? My goodness! He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Looking at this next year, and the year after that, we will be able to maintain and gradually improve standards. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just absolute pious rubbish. He does not believe it and he should be condemned for saying it. The Government hopes that on the last day of this Parliament it will be able to escape from this place and the backbenchers will be able to go back to their electorates. The Prime Minister will be able to visit three shopping centres a week and gladhand the community. At some point in the future, when he asks people to vote for him, he hopes that they will. Let me tell the Prime Minister and the backbenchers that when they go out into the electorate the people might be there but they are not going to be smiling. They are angry. They have to pay the mortgage rate that keeps going up. They are going to have a series of questions. They deserve answers to those questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The first question that the Prime Minister will get the first time he walks into a shopping centre is, `Why is my mortgage rate so high? Why can't I send the kids on a school excursion because I have got to pay the mortgage rate?'. There will be other questions: Why is the dollar behaving like a yoyo? Why is the current account deficit more than we spend on roads? Why is inflation 7 per cent after the Government has fiddled the consumer price index (CPI)? What would it be if the Government had not fiddled it a few times? Why is the inflation rate applying to goods on the supermarket shelves more than 10 or 12 per cent? What is this rubbish about a 7 per cent inflation rate and what about this ridiculous forecast of 4 1/2 per cent? That is what members of the Government will get when they go back to their electorates. They should not kid themselves that they will not. They know they will. They get it every day and they get it in the mail. We all do. Every time we go to our electorates people tell us of their concerns. They are worried. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something else to honourable members. It is what we all know. Australia today is not the Australia that we had in 1982. Australia today is the creation of two men-Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. One of them likes the place so much that he cannot get to Leningrad fast enough. People understand exactly why we have the country we have today. It is because of the policies of this Government, a government that has reduced the value of our dollar by 50 per cent against the yen in the time that it has been in power. </PARA>
<PARA> We are discounting our assets, selling at a discount of 50c in the dollar to people who want to invest in this country. We are going backwards. The great ploy of this Government was the tax cuts in the April economic statement. The reality is that inflation and bracket creep mean that even with the tax cuts the Government has offered-cuts that spend $5 billion worth of surplus-in one year's time people will still need an increase of $56 a week in income to be where they were when this Government took over. That is an extra $3,000 a year in 12 months time, after the tax cuts, just to be where they were when this Government came to power. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's speech was long on rhetoric and short on facts. He failed to acknowledge that this debate is about foreign debt. Let us talk about the facts of foreign debt. Foreign debt has increased from $95 billion at the end of December to over $103 billion when the Statistician brought the figures out the other day. That is over $10 billion in the past year. It is four times the level of debt that this Government had when it came to office. Australia's capacity to deal with that debt is what is worrying everybody. The Acting Treasurer may be sitting there shuffling through his papers but when he goes to the shopping centres-if he ever does-people are going to say, `What is this debt?'. It is $6,000 a person or $24,000 a household. In the time that we are talking here it goes up by $90,000 a minute. What will the Acting Treasurer's answer be-or is he hoping that Mr Keating will be back in the country by then and will be handling the whole issue? The Government's capacity to handle that debt level is the worrying thing. There is no recognition of it on the part of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 interest payments on our foreign debt as a percentage of exports were 9.2 per cent. Today they are 17.9 per cent. They have doubled. But another measure is even more frightening. It now requires 62 per cent of our export earnings to service that debt. These are numbers. Perhaps if we put them into tangible examples honourable members will understand just how serious the situation is. Interest payments in the past nine months have added about $6.6 billion to our foreign debt but our export earnings from our major industries have got to be seen against that. The extra interest is $6.6 billion. Total wool exports last year earned $5.7 billion-less than the interest for six months. Meat only brings in $2.5 billion. Grain brings in $2.1 billion. One might say, `What about the minerals and energy sector?' The total value of exports of those resources was only $7.2 billion. The margin between the value of that and the interest payments is getting narrower every month. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows that and knows that there is a major problem. It knows that the debt servicing ratio is worse than that of any other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country. It knows the ratio is worse than some Third World countries-not the countries the Treasurer keeps picking on but some of the ones that people recognise have got a fundamental problem-countries such as Colombia, Venezuela, Indonesia and the Philippines. Heaven only knows what it is like when our country gets compared with those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the last day of this session of Parliament but it is also five minutes to midnight for this economy. It is also five minutes to midnight for the Government. The Acting Treasurer knows exactly what the problem is. The Government knows that, because it cannot deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, it has only got one arm of policy, and that is monetary policy. It knows what the consequences of using that are. It knows how unselective that policy is. It knows that we desperately need to do something about fiscal policy and address the wages policy question. But it cannot do so. The Government knows it also needs to bring to an end to the featherbedding that exists in our economy. It needs to address the competitiveness of our economy. It needs to go down the track of exposing protected sectors of the economy to international competition. But the Government knows it cannot do it. The Acting Treasurer knows he has got no answers and he knows that his Government is doomed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) was trying to make the point that this is a serious debate. To sustain that argument he should have found someone a bit more competent and effective than the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), to participate in this debate. I have been sitting here patiently trying to find exactly what the Opposition wants to debate. Let us go back to the terms of the motion which the Opposition put before the House. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The failure of the Hawke Government to make the necessary changes in economic policy to reduce our exposure to foreign debt and to provide the basis for a sustainable improvement in living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is saying to us that we ought to make changes to policy. Yet where have the suggestions been as to how we might change policy? It is very well known where our policy is. This question about the debt is not something which the Opposition has had to point out to us; it is a question which we have referred to constantly. It remains the focal point of where our policy is directed. We recognise that the debt is too large, and that is why all our arms of policy are dedicated singlemindedly towards first of all stabilising the debt and then reducing it. It should be unnecessary for me to repeat what our policy is but again and again we have a farrago of misrepresentation from the Opposition, using total untruths in relation to what our policy is and trying to exaggerate massively the consequences for Australia of the statistics which have become available in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> The arms of policy which we are using are quite clearly those of fiscal policy. Not only have we got fiscal policy extremely tight as a result of decisions which we took in the context of the April statement, but even since the April statement we have further tightened fiscal policy. As a result of the meeting we had with the States we have reduced the public sector borrowing requirement by a further $2.7 billion to the point where the net public sector borrowing requirement has gone into surplus. Where is the Opposition's policy in relation to that matter?</PARA>
<PARA> Fiscal policy is an extremely important arm of policy; it is not, as the Opposition would have it, that we are relying only on monetary policy. Fiscal policy has always been central to the approach this Government has taken. If one looks around the world, one sees that we have a peerless record in terms of being able to run a tight fiscal policy. We have been running a tighter fiscal policy and have been more successful in turning around fiscal policy than any other country in the world. That is a matter which the Opposition will not acknowledge because it knows that its record in this area was so abominable and appalling. Our fiscal policy is even tighter than that which was announced in the April statement. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made it quite clear that we have had to resort to the tightening of monetary policy because demand in the economy is outstripping the ability of the economy to produce. That has meant an increase in the inflow of imports; therefore, we have to diminish demand in order to curtail that level of imports. That is not a permanent feature. We have said that we will keep monetary policy tight until such time as there begins to be a turnaround on the imports side. </PARA>
<PARA> Wages policy remains the third important arm of policy that we are employing to manage the economy. The Opposition likes to deride the fact that we have a close relationship with the trade union movement. That close relationship has resulted in our being able to reach an agreement with the trade union movement to restrain wages in the coming year to just 6.5 per cent, at a time when there is very strong demand in the economy. When those circumstances existed in the past, particularly under the policies of the Opposition, we saw wages blow out in a way that caused a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says in its matter of public importance that we have to make the necessary changes. What changes does it suggest? We had a few feeble suggestions from the Leader of the Opposition. He had the nerve to refer to Government members as being vacuous. I have never heard a more vacuous speech than that of the Leader of the Opposition. It was particularly vacuous when he came to the question of what his policy would be in the unlikely event that he ever becomes Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition said that there should be tighter fiscal policy. How much tighter? Has he decided to abandon his shadow Treasurer who, I notice, has been sidelined in this particular debate? The Opposition has gone to a lot of trouble to sideline the shadow Treasurer, but the shadow Treasurer has said that the tightening of fiscal policy should amount to at least $5.5 billion. Despite the fact that the Opposition has yet to identify where that $5.5 billion will come from, that will be its target. The test, when the Opposition comes out with its detailed policy, will be how to make up that $5.5 billion that the shadow Treasurer says, in his view, is necessary to neutralise the tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's tax cut policy? If the Opposition wants tighter fiscal policy, would it really abandon the tax cuts, as Senator Stone, the shadow Finance Minister, has said? Would the Opposition commit itself to retaining those tax cuts? None of those matters was raised; we just heard a throwaway line about tighter fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition talked about linking wages to productivity and decentralising the process of wage fixation in this country. The Opposition thinks that, as a result, it would get wages flexibility. If it thinks that, I can tell it in which direction the flexibility would go; it would go up very strongly. That is the fatal flaw in the Opposition's approach, because it simply does not have a clue about how to run that kind of wages policy, how to restrain a wages blow-out of the kind that occurred in 1982 when the Opposition was last in charge of wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition went on to talk about micro-economic reform, as if this were something that he had just discovered. The three examples he used of railways, roads and electricity are, of course, matters which are firmly in the hands of the States. Those are not matters which are central to Commonwealth Government policy. Perhaps, therefore, he should have gone a stage further and said what he would do to force changes on the States in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There was one missing component in the recitation of what passes for policy on the part of the Leader of the Opposition; that is, that the Opposition's real objective is to screw this economy into the ground, to bring about the recession which, in the end, is the only instrument it has to deal with the current circumstances. The Opposition would kill demand by forcing the economy into recession and forcing hundreds of thousands of Australians back onto the dole. We have, of course, rescued some 300,000 families from the dole queues and put them back in the work force. That has been a major contribution to the increase in living standards that Opposition members have decided is a new discovery of theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> These questions must be addressed to the Opposition. It has called upon us to make the necessary changes, but when it comes to getting any sensible suggestions from the Opposition about what those changes might be, all we get, once again, are blank page promises that some time in the never-never it will come up with some kind of suggestions. In the meantime, the Opposition can only resort to disparaging the Australian economy and disparaging Australia in the eyes of the world. The Opposition might have lost confidence in Australia, but we have not and will not. </PARA>

<PARA> In answer to the honourable gentleman's question as to whether there will be a normal sitting day on either 15 or 16 June, if we are recalled, I cannot at this stage give him a direct answer to that. I will certainly take on board his view that he would like to see a Question Time. The nature of those sitting days is that they are almost invariably abnormal, as we may well be involved in bouncing legislation to and fro between this House and the Senate, as on the last occasion that Parliament was recalled. </PARA>
<PARA> If we meet on Friday, 16 June-which is currently not a Senate sitting day, but which on all accounts is likely to be, as that would seem to be the most sensible day on which to meet to facilitate passing the legislation as rapidly as possible-honourable members may well have an inclination to get matters over quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a general point about this: we are in a very unsatisfactory situation in the House of Representatives. We are in a situation where, at a certain point each year, sittings of the House of Representatives largely become meaningless until such time as we have got from the Senate the amended legislation that the Government deems is of sufficient urgency that it must be passed. Basically, the Senate declared that the House of Representatives had no relevance from 26 May. That was the cut-off date after which the Senate said that any legislation passed in this House would not be considered by it. This is a very unsatisfactory situation and demeaning of the dignity of this House, but we persist with it. As a result, I think until that view is reviewed we will forever have a situation where we will have sittings and then there will always be the threat of having to come back for a weird sitting day a fortnight or three or four weeks later. I take on board what the honourable member said in his desire for normality. I shall convey that view to my colleagues. I guess that it will depend on who is in the country and who is not at the time the House sits as to whether there is value in proceeding with the normal order of business. </PARA>

<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Late in 1987 the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters received a reference from the then Minister for Home Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, to inquire into:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>all aspects of the conduct of elections for the Parliament of the Commonwealth including legislation governing and the operation of the Australian Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's predecessor, the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, has reported on previous elections. This report concerns the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and is the product of a committee representing both Houses of this Parliament and all shades of political opinion. This report contains over 50 recommendations which will bring about reform and improvement in Australia's electoral system. With the exception of the small number referred to in the minority comments, the recommendations were unanimous. I would like to place on record my appreciation to all members of the Committee for their diligence and constructive contributions. The provision of free time for political advertising will be examined in a separate report which will be released in several weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to some of the Committee's recommendations in this report. A number of submissions received expressed concern about electoral fraud, particularly the accuracy of the rolls and the possibility of cemetery voting, multiple voting and impersonation. The Committee examined allegations of electoral fraud but was unable to obtain any factual evidence to support them. In one case the allegations turned out to be based on hearsay evidence and were anecdotal in nature. Senator Bishop's allegations about cemetery voting in the Castlereagh by-election were found by the New South Wales Cundy inquiry to be `without substance'. </PARA>
<PARA> While no evidence of organised electoral fraud was obtained, the Committee has suggested a number of ways to improve the accuracy of the rolls. Some members of the Committee have called for the introduction of locality voting which would allow electors to cast ordinary votes at only one polling place in their electorate. Prior to 1984 electors had to vote within their subdivision. Voters who attended a polling booth within their electorate, but outside their subdivision, were forced to cast a declaration or absentee vote. In the view of the majority of the Committee locality voting would result in large numbers of electors having to cast declaration votes increasing congestion at booths and dissatisfaction and confusion amongst electors. </PARA>
<PARA> Another suggestion was that a computerised electoral role be introduced to prevent multiple voting. This would require an on-line terminal at every table in every polling booth in every electorate and, in our view, would be prohibitively expensive. The Cundy inquiry calculated that it would cost New South Wales alone more than $20m to introduce such a system. Given the seriousness of allegations of electoral fraud, the Committee has recommended a substantial increase in the penalties for electoral fraud. For example, the Committee recommends that for multiple voting and impersonation the penalties set at $1,000 or six months imprisonment should be increased to $12,000 and/or two years maximum imprisonment. This hike in penalties reflects the fact that electoral penalties are well overdue for review. The recommendation will also put Australia in line with other countries which have a history of much higher penalties for electoral fraud than we do here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Commonwealth Electoral Act was amended in 1984 only Australian citizens have been eligible to nominate for election to the Commonwealth Parliament. British citizens enrolled before 1984 are eligible to vote but not eligible to nominate unless they become naturalised citizens. After being declared elected to the Senate in 1987 Mr Robert Wood was found to be in this category, although he believed he was an Australian citizen at the time of nominating. To reduce the possibility of persons who are not Australian citizens nominating, the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to require candidates to declare on their nomination forms how they became Australian citizens-that is, whether by birth or naturalisation-and if naturalised where and when the ceremony took place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee rejected a proposal to excuse aged voters from compulsory voting as occurs in Victorian local government elections. The Committee believes most elderly voters would take exception to the idea and supports the continuation of uniformity for Federal, State and local voting to minimise confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has received a submission from the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) suggesting that it was in the public interest that candidates be required to declare their political affiliations when nominating. To overcome the difficulty in determining which organisations are `political', the Committee has recommended the candidates be required to declare their membership of any registered political party at the time of nominating. The Committee received a report from the Australian Electoral Commission on an audit of six divisions and was concerned at the number of errors revealed. The Committee welcomes the AEC decision to expand staff training and to conduct future audits using the strictest audit standards to ensure uniform electoral procedures are being followed throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on behalf of the Committee I wish to thank the Committee Secretary, Mr Trevor Rowe, and other members of the secretariat who have assisted in preparing this report, in particular, Denise Denahy, Helen Misa and Lexia Noakes. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Chisholm)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-At the outset, I commend the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who has just spoken, on his work. It seems that committee chairmen often go unnoticed, but he has done a lot of work on this report and has handled very well what is potentially a very difficult area. I also acknowledge the work of the Committee secretariat and the Secretary, Trevor Rowe, in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report makes recommendations, some of which will have, hopefully, a quite large impact and others of which will have a very minimal impact. For example, as was mentioned, we made recommendations that we hope might prevent a repeat of a situation where a person not an Australian citizen was elected to the Senate. We have proposed that infringement notices be issued to people who do not vote. They should significantly speed and ease the work of the Australian Electoral Commission, even though my personal view is against compulsory voting. </PARA>
<PARA> We have concerns in some areas. I am one of three people on this side of the House who made a dissenting report. Our concerns relate to the three-month rule and to locality voting. The other concern that we have, which was shared-members of the Committee were unanimous about it-was the problem with additions to the roll. These three things all reflect our concern with the integrity of the electoral rolls. Questions arise with respect to what might happen immediately before an election when a large number of names are added. There are concerns about the integrity of the way declaration votes can be made and concern about the possibility of fraud. The Committee has made a recommendation about additions to the role. It is that for the next Federal election the Australian Electoral Commission conduct before the election a thorough examination of those persons added to the rolls of two marginal divisions and after the election an examination of those persons deleted from the rolls of the same division, one division to be a Government-held seat, the other to be an Opposition-held seat. </PARA>
<PARA> We were concerned because of the experience of members across the spectrum of the Committee. In my case, more than 2,500 people were added to the electoral roll for Chisholm between the time the election was announced and the rolls were closed. I wrote to every one of those and more than 10 per cent were returned with `Not known at this address' written on them. If that is not bad enough, a significant number of the returned envelopes had written on them things like, `Not at this address for three years' and `Not at this address for five years'. In fact, the treasurer of my electorate committee received a letter I had written to the person from whom he had bought a house five years ago. Prior to the election, this person had put himself back on the roll, giving his previous address rather than his present address. There is no check on that. We hope that by doing a thorough audit of the two divisions, we may actually quantify the extent to which this happens. </PARA>
<PARA> Our dissenting report relates to the three-month rule. Our concern was with a submission by Mr Trevor Owen, the Victorian Operations Director. He said that people who had left their address several years earlier but had not removed their names from the electoral roll because of the audit and review activity were allowed to cast an ordinary vote. He suggested three reasons why this might happen: because people were simply lazy; because they did not want to be found; or because they believed their vote was worth more in a marginal division. As in my division I have a majority of 500 votes, honourable members can understand my concern about that. We believe that this happens because the three-month rule was removed in 1987 and that if it were reintroduced the problem would be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of our dissenting report regarded locality voting. We nearly had locality voting when we had subdivisional voting before 1984. We believe that worked very well. In fact, the Electoral Commission told us that 90 per cent of people vote at the polling booth nearest their place of residence. I was in the United States of America in October during an election campaign. A system of precinct voting is followed there, with 1,000 people to a precinct. People have to vote at a given booth. It works very well there; it would work well here and it would significantly reduce any possibility of fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-After the election of the Hawke Government in 1983 there were a number of very major rewrites of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Those rewrites encompassed reforms in a number of areas. A significant one was to ensure that people who were entitled to vote were able to do so and were not excluded from voting by technicalities or formalities which were included in the Electoral Act as it then stood. Since then, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, particularly in this investigation, has looked at how those very major reforms have impacted on our voting system. A number of the recommendations of the Committee and a number of the submissions which the Committee received are concerned with the extent of the reforms and whether they may have gone too far and made it too easy to get a vote, which could lead to an incidence of fraud. A large part of the Committee's work was on that subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly, there is no dispute between members of the Committee and, I believe, any member of this House, that we require an electoral system which is accurate, which enables people to enrol and to vote easily, and which at the same time ensures that the result reflects the will of the people and cannot be manipulated. However, despite allegations of fraud, multiple voting, cemetery voting and things of that nature, no evidence was put forward to the Committee which suggested that such things occurred to an extent that would influence the election result in any single division. Until such time as evidence is brought forward, it is difficult for the Committee to make recommendations to attack a problem which may be a figment of the imaginations of people for whom an election result was unwelcome rather than based on fact. Nonetheless, some of the recommendations, particularly those dealing with penalties in relation to fraud, make the system more strict, as does a change in relation to people who had moved during a habitation review being able to claim a declaration vote. That field has been tightened up, as have the new audit provisions for marginal seats-government and opposition seats-which should ensure that if there is any incidence of fraud it can be picked up and severely dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole, I believe that the Committee's recommendations are sound. They largely fine tune the existing electoral system. I would also like to extend my thanks to the Committee secretariat and to the other members of the Committee. It certainly was an enjoyable experience. There was good cooperation among all members and it was a very worthwhile experience to have served on this Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am delighted to be associated with this constructive report on the 1987 election. I wish to pay tribute to members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, with whom I worked. I was not on the Committee from its inception. I replaced the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), who was the Deputy Chairman of the Committee. He has since, of course, gone on to higher things. I wish to pay tribute in particular to the Chairman, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who has been very cooperative. At all times he was courteous and helpful in accommodating any suggestions I made. I also wish to thank other Government members, such as the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), who are in the House today. I have found that they have been excellent to work with. I also wish to thank the Deputy Chairman-I had the honour of moving that he accept that position-Senator Short, as well as the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who has already spoken. They both provided wide knowledge and diligence on matters in the report and their contributions were of enormous value. I also found the staff very cooperative and pleasant to work with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Chisholm has already spoken on the dissenting comments. Most other issues have been canvassed in the report. I would like to comment briefly on two issues. The first is in relation to cardboard boxes, which were introduced at the last election. They have caused some concern and have been the subject of a great deal of comment in the community. This Committee has been particularly concerned with the integrity of the cardboard boxes so that no fiddling may go on. We have recommended-I think quite correctly-that relevant polling staff be given particular emphasis on assembling the boxes and emptying them in their training. This recommendation is not one we wish to see set in concrete forever. In the discussions which took place, we expressed the wish that the use of cardboard boxes, while saving the taxpayer a considerable amount of money, should be monitored. If need be, in the future, further recommendations could be made to change the situation, but at this stage they seem to be working reasonably well. </PARA>
<PARA> I was particularly interested in postal votes. I am delighted to see this recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post make arrangements to receive and postmark all mail addressed to the Australian Electoral Commission or officers of the Australian Electoral Commission and lodged at Post Offices up until 5.00 p.m. on the Friday immediately preceding an election. This includes mail lodged in locked mail bags. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem in the past has been that people who lived in remote areas in my electorate could not get their vote in, particularly if it were a short election campaign. Also, they could not have it postmarked before the election had concluded, even though they may have made their vote a week or so before. Now, as long as that vote is in the locked mail bag it will be counted, even though it may not arrive until the Monday after the election. Also, I had an anomaly in my electorate where people in the town of Bourke could put a postal vote in the post box at 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon but, because the mail closed at 2 o'clock, that mail would not be postmarked until the following Monday. Obviously, that was quite wrong. I am delighted to see that that problem has been overcome. All mail in Australia, which is posted before 5 p.m., will now have to be postmarked and those votes will count. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased to see that the Australian Electoral Commission will have to provide full information to postal voters when they receive their forms on the procedures for making postal votes, including these special postal arrangements made by Australia Post so that they will know what they have to do and where they will stand. I think this is a big step forward in this area which was deficient before. I congratulate all who have been associated with this report and I believe it will be a very valuable one in providing a freer and fairer system in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I would very much like to thank the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), for his excellent contribution to the Committee and for the fine way in which he handled the proceedings of the hearings and the compilation of the report. I would like to thank Mr Rowe and the members of the secretariat for their assistance. They were certainly very professional in their job and they managed to accommodate as many members as was possible, for example, in small changes to the working of the report as required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important to note the point made by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) in relation to the three-month rule and locality voting. These things were considered by the Committee at some length. The three-month rule has not been recommended to be reinstituted, but the polling staff has been given the power to ask whatever questions need to be asked-this is in terms of the current legislation which is before the Senate-to ascertain an enrolled person's current address. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with the three-month rule, as some members of this House would be aware, was that it was never asked of people turning up to their own local polling booths. In the previous Committee which recommended its removal, both Sir John Carrick and I were able to say that in all the years that we had been voting-he had been voting for many more years than I-we had never been asked the question whether we had lived at that place of residence within the last three months. That question mainly seemed to apply to people who had been struck off the roll or to people seeking an absentee vote. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the absentee voting provision has tended to be misapplied by polling staff. Whilst the Committee did not make a recommendation as such, it drew to the attention of the Electoral Commission the actions of polling staff in sending people who attended a polling booth near the one they were enrolled for, back to their division across the road to vote. This was not, strictly speaking, the way the Act was supposed to prevail. People ought to be able to lodge an absentee vote in whichever polling booth they turn up to, if it is not in their own division. I think this is very important, because a person going in to lodge an absentee vote may be sent away and may not actually get to a polling booth within his division. This person would then be subject to a fine. I think the polling staff ought to have a very firm instruction that it ought not proceed along these lines. I wish to say that it was a pleasure to be on the Committee. It was one of great interest and great bipartisanship, in general. The recommendations are comprehensive and well-founded and I trust that the Government will find them useful. </PARA>

I would hope that, in the future, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will address the question-which may seem like a simple matter-of whether pens or pencils ought to be made available at polling booths. Whilst one has not heard of allegations, or makes allegations of this kind, I always think there is a possibility that ballot papers can be interfered with and tampered with if pens are not used. I have a similar feeling that cardboard ballot boxes are not as substantial as they should be. They also have the potential to be tampered with. In our society and in our democracy we are remarkably fortunate to be free of corruption, but the potential is there for those who might wish to tamper with ballot papers and boxes. This is a matter which I think in future ought to be taken on board.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The Bill would implement administrative assessment of child support obligations under a formula set out in the Bill. It would implement stage 2 of the child support scheme. The Bill would have an entirely prospective operation-affecting only people who separate or have a child born on or after its commencement. Under stage 2 of the child support scheme:</PARA>
<PARA>Procedures to obtain child support would be dramatically simplified; the level of child support obtained would be directly in line with the capacity of parents to provide it; there would be annual updating of child support levels; the processes of application for sole parent pension and for child support would be closely integrated; the right of parents to apply to the courts to resolve disputes in their particular case would be retained; the facilities for parents to make private agreements between themselves about child support would be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA>The need for reform of child maintenance was identified by the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, of which I was privileged to be a member. In 1980, only four years after the commencement of the Family Law Act, that Committee identified four key problems with the system of child maintenance: first, the levels of maintenance were inadequate; secondly, the enforcement of maintenance liabilities was ineffective; thirdly, the system of updating child maintenance liabilities was cumbersome and seldom used; and, fourthly, the maintenance and social security systems were poorly integrated. On the question of child maintenance the Joint Select Committee's major recommendation was the implementation of a scheme under which the amount a liable parent should contribute would be administratively assessed in line with his or her capacity to pay. This contribution would have gone to the Department of Social Security. Experience in other countries has shown such schemes to have limited effectiveness-only the revenue benefits so neither parent has any reason to assist in administration of the scheme. Intrusive and expensive mechanisms are therefore required to make them work. Further, because such schemes operate only when a custodian is in receipt of a pension, difficulties arise when custodians find work or repartner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government therefore has not fully endorsed the approach of the Joint Select Committee. I imagine it was for similar reasons that the Fraser Government did not act to implement this aspect of the report. After the Joint Select Committee reported the next major development was the establishment by the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, of the national maintenance inquiry. That inquiry recommended in 1985 the establishment of a national maintenance collection agency to improve the enforcement of maintenance orders. Following work by the Family Law Council the Government decided not to proceed with the national maintenance collection agency because it would not have addressed the issues of: levels of maintenance; updating of liabilities; or interaction of the maintenance and social security systems. A more fundamental reform that synthesised the best of both the Select Committee report and the national maintenance inquiry report was required-a reform that adopted the principles of administrative assessment, integrated private and public provision for children and achieved effective collection of liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the Government published Child Support: A Discussion Paper on Child Maintenance. It proposed a system of: setting of child support levels under a formula related to the income of parents; initial assessment under that formula to be by the Child Support Agency-part of the Australian Taxation Office; access to the courts in contentious cases; annual updating of assessment by the Child Support Agency; collection of child support liabilities by the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Following extensive public consultation, the Minister for Social Security announced in March 1987 the introduction of the child support scheme in two stages. Under stage 1 of the scheme, which commenced a year ago today, maintenance orders and agreements made, registered or approved in the courts can be enforced by the Child Support Agency. In his March 1987 statement the Minister announced that he would establish the Child Support Consultative Group, to advise the Government on a legislative formula to apply under stage 2. The group, chaired by Justice Fogarty of the Family Court of Australia, was established in May 1987. This Bill would substantially implement the report of the child support consultative group: Child Support: Formula for Australia. Justice Fogarty described the formula which would be implemented by this Bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The formula preserves the right of parents to reach their own agreement (with suitable protection for the revenue when the custodial parent is on a pension or benefit);</PARA>
<PARA>It ensures that each parent has an unqualified right to have the matter determined by the court if he or she is not satisfied with the administrative assessment. It continues the right to go to court but will remove the need to do so in many cases;</PARA>
<PARA>At the same time it provides a method which will remove the present obligation on parents to go through expensive court proceedings and relieve the courts of the burden of many of these cases;</PARA>
<PARA>It provides for the automatic updating of orders annually in accordance with any changes in the financial or other circumstances of the parties;</PARA>
<PARA>The percentages which have been chosen have regard to evidence of the proportion of income ordinarily spent on children who live with both their parents and are aimed at achieving reasonable levels of orders proportional to income. </PARA>
<PARA>This approach, combined with the enforcement procedures already established under stage 1, should go a long way towards overcoming the unsatisfactory state of child support in Australia and benefit both Australian children and the Australian community generally. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Bill administrative assessment of child support would be available to people having the ongoing daily care of a child from the natural or adoptive parents of the child. The Bill would apply only when the parents have a child born on or after the commencement of stage 2 of the scheme or the parents separate on or after that day; and provided that the applicant is not cohabiting with the parent against whom the claim is made. In all other cases maintenance rights and liabilities will continue to be determined under the Family Law Act. For example, applications by children in their own right would remain under the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Following an application, the Child Support Agency could proceed to issue an assessment against a person only if the person was a party to a marriage during which the child was born; the person has adopted the child; or the Agency is satisfied that under the law of the Commonwealth, a State, Territory or prescribed overseas jurisdiction: the person is recorded as a parent of the child on a register of births or parentage; a court has found as a fact that the person is a parent of the child; or the person has acknowledged paternity of the child in writing. The parties would be entitled to have any dispute about eligibility for assessment-such as parentage-decided by the courts. Where an applicant is entitled to assessment under the Bill the basic formula to be applied by the Child Support Agency would be: the income of the liable parent minus the liable parent's exemption multiplied by the relevant child support percentage. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first year of assessment the income of the parents will be the taxable income of each parent in the financial year ending on 30 June in the calendar year preceding the assessment. This would be adjusted by a factor prescribed by regulation to take account of inflation. The liable parent's exemption would make provision for the support of the liable parent and any natural or adoptive children of whom the liable parent has ongoing daily care. In accordance with recommendations of the child support consultative group the level of the exemption will be fixed according to the level of social security pensions. The group recommended, and the Bill would provide, that where a liable parent does not have the ongoing daily care of natural or adoptive children the exemption would be equivalent to single adult rate pension; and where there are natural or adoptive children the exemption would be equivalent to the maximum rate pension payable to a married couple plus the additional pension that would be payable in the social security system for each of those children. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with this principle the Bill would provide that where a liable parent is caring for a 16- or 17-year-old child additional allowance of 25 per cent of pension payable to a married couple would be made for that child. This is close to the rate at which Austudy is payable for children of that age. The child support percentages provided for in the Bill are as recommended by the Child Support Consultative Group. They would vary with the number of children in respect of whom child support is paid: for one child, 18 per cent; for two children, 27 per cent; for three children 32 per cent; for four children 34 per cent and for five or more children 36 per cent. In recommending these percentages the consultative group noted:</PARA>
<PARA>In determining appropriate percentage levels to apply above the liable parent's exemption, available evidence that might indicate the proportion of family income normally devoted to children in a two parent family was taken as a starting point. However in arriving at percentage contribution rates a number of other factors need to be taken into consideration. These include additional costs of rearing a child where parents do not live together, indirect costs of children to custodial parents, access costs incurred by non-custodial parents, retention of appropriate incentives to earn for non-custodial parents and the views of the community on what would be considered a fair level of child support. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts that, taken together, the exemption levels and percentages recommended by the consultative group produce a fair and equitable formula for child support. The Bill would provide, in line with the recommendations of the child support consultative group, that the income of a custodial parent would be taken into account under the formula when it exceeds the sum of average weekly earnings and an allowance for child care costs. The level of liability of a liable parent would be reduced having regard to the amount of this excess. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic formula contained in this Bill would achieve a fair assessment of child support liabilities in the great majority of cases. The Bill would make provision for a range of more complex cases such as where ongoing care of a child is shared between parents or where care of the children from one family is split between parents. Other cases dealt with are where a child is cared for by a person who is not a parent of the child and both parents are liable to pay child support; and cases where one liable parent is liable to pay child support to two or more custodians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would retain the rights of parties to approach courts in child support matters. Under the Bill the courts that exercise jurisdiction under the Family Law Act would have three functions. First, they would determine applications for declarations that an applicant is, or is not, entitled to an assessment under the Bill. Second, the courts would determine whether an assessment by the Child Support Agency is, on the facts of the particular case, a correct application of the formula contained in the Bill. Third, the courts would determine applications to vary assessments in cases where assessments in line with the formula would not produce a fair result. To obtain a variation from a formula assessment, an applicant to a court would be required to establish that the case falls within specified grounds for departure. </PARA>
<PARA> These grounds for departure broadly relate to cases where: first, a parent's capacity to provide support for a child is reduced by special needs or commitments of the parent or another person the parent has a legal duty to support; second, where the costs of supporting a child are affected because of the special needs of the child or the high costs of access of either parent to the child; and third, where the assessment is inequitable because the income earning capacity, property or financial resources of either parent or of the child which have not been taken into account as `income' under the formula mean that the formula assessment does not produce a fair result. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing whether to vary an assessment the courts would consider in each case the nature of the duty of parents to support their children; the relative hardship to the custodian or non-custodian and their children in the particular case and whether, despite the clear primacy of the duty of parents to support their children, it is proper to make an order that could increase payments to the custodian under the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of the child support scheme has been marked by full and open consultation. Because of time pressures this Bill does not contain all of the provisions needed to make stage 2 of the scheme work. In order to achieve the substantial benefits to separating parents and their children and to the revenue that stage 2 entails the Government proposes that it commence from 1 October. Because stage 2 is entirely prospective, any delay beyond this date does not merely cause temporary inconvenience. It locks out forever people who would otherwise be eligible. This would be inconvenient to them and costly to revenue for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government therefore has introduced this Bill to ensure that all interested people have an adequate opportunity to consider it and comment on it before parliamentary consideration of it early next session. The Government intends to publish the remaining provisions as soon as they are finalised. These remaining provisions will cover:</PARA>
<PARA>The procedures for assessment of child support in second and subsequent years of a parent's liability-including modifications to taxable income to achieve a definition of income more in line with family law notions and the procedures for lodgment of returns to enable the assessment of income with these modifications;</PARA>
<PARA>the mechanisms to enable the continuance of private agreements about the amount and the form of child support through a mechanism along the lines of section 86 of the Family Law Act and the introduction of a system of consent assessments lodged by the parties with the Child Support agency;</PARA>
<PARA>the rules to apply when circumstances of the parties change-such as changes in income or care arrangements for children;</PARA>
<PARA>a secrecy provision that will balance the need to protect the confidentiality of tax information as it relates to each parent, with the need for all parties to be aware of the matters taken into account by the Child Support Agency in making an assessment;</PARA>
<PARA>consequential amendments to the Social Security Act, Family Law Act and Child Support Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The child support scheme has seen a unique display of unity of purpose among all legislators in Australia. Legislation for stage 1 of the child support scheme passed through both Houses of this Parliament with unanimous support. Its full operation depends upon legislation passed by the parliaments of all six States. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would provide for stage 2 to operate pursuant to Commonwealth powers and pursuant to the reference of powers already made by Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. Queensland and Western Australia would be able to have it fully operate in their States through a reference of power, adoption of the legislation or making a corresponding law that the Commonwealth agrees to have apply. The Government looks forward to full national application of this legislation through these mechanisms. We also hope that we will retain the unity of purpose within this Parliament on this most important area. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important motion that we are being asked to concur with, because it is an integral part of the compromise that has been reached in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, which we will be discussing later today. Whilst I will detail in full the Opposition's view of that legislation, in relation to the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations I think it is important to understand the circumstances in which it will be working. The terms of reference make it clear that the Committee is to be established:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to inquire into and report upon the extent to which draft regulations and tabled regulations under the Migration Act 1958, which relate to decision criteria for the grant of visas and entry permits:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) reflect current and announced policies in relation to the grant of visas and entry permits as at 1 June 1989; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) are likely to achieve the goals of the policies referred to in subparagraph (a). </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of that reference is that the Parliament will be able to look at regulations before they are put to Parliament for formal consideration in relation to either allowance or disallowance. The normal procedure is one that does not allow comment, feedback or amendments to be made but, rather, requires the rules to be struck down and the Government to re-present its proposal after a further period of time and further deliberations. Clearly, in the usual situation where regulations are not contentious that procedure may be in order, but not in relation to those regulations which the Parliament has not yet seen and of which it does not know the details but which will implement policy which we all know and understand now. There is a great deal of interest in this matter, and it is important that the Parliament have an opportunity, through this mechanism of a select committee, to look at those regulations and ensure that the decision to implement the policy, now stated and known, for the granting of visas and entry permits is properly achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an extra element here which is unstated but which, in the discussions between the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) and me has been made abundantly clear: the present policy for granting visas and entry permits contains a number of discretions which officers have to entertain when compassionate circumstances are involved and which would otherwise be beyond the stated policy. The Opposition is of the view that that discretion is important as the capacity to deal with compassionate circumstances is something that needs to be maintained. We see this Committee as being an important mechanism for ensuring that, in relation to the regulations we are now being asked to put in place, the element of entertaining compassion is maintained in the legal framework. That is the crux of the matter. It is important. It was an important part of the compromise which is leading to this legislation. For that reason, I certainly commend the establishment of the Committee to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply point out that the membership of the Committee reflects a very close balance between the Government and the Opposition. The Government has a majority through the casting vote of the chairman. All parties may be involved in its membership. That is important because we are desirous, in this important and sensitive area, of ensuring that, so far as possible, contention is minimised and that these issues on which we hold a common view are properly addressed. The Committee is another mechanism for doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will note that the reporting time is specified. The Committee will have to carry out its task in quick order, and I think that is appropriate. There is a period of within five days of the tabling of regulations for the Committee to furnish its own report to the Parliament. There then remains a further 10 days for the Parliament to be able to disallow the regulations. It is in that sense that the Parliament still has control of the law because the regulations, even after they are approved by this Committee, will still be subject to the normal disallowance procedures. I welcome the message from the Senate, and I certainly commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I have some comments to make on the statement made by the shadow Minister for immigration, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), about this message from the Senate. The formation of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations is, in a very real way, the most practical illustration that the Parliament has moved back to a position where, as a parliament and an institution, it is concerned to get right the regulations which govern people's rights in terms of legislation. From the very beginning of what has been a long, often complex and sometimes, unfortunately, bitter debate the Government has been anxious to maintain a bipartisan position. Anyone who has been a Minister for immigration knows the difficulties and complexities of making decisions which can affect people's lives. The regulations are an important and integral part of the legislation because ultimately they will, in many ways, govern the basis upon which those very important decisions are made. The Opposition and the Government are agreed that it is the right of a government to choose the basis of the selection of its immigrants. We are also agreed that in making what have always been difficult judgments, a balance has to be struck between the rights of a sovereign state and the rights of an individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish the Committee well. Its task will not be a simple one-it will be onerous in many ways-but I am hopeful that at the end of the day we will have produced not merely a Bill which represents the most significant set of amendments since Australia, in the post-war period, embarked upon a massive migration program, but a Bill which embodies, in a very genuine way, the spirit of bipartisanship which has governed our approach in dealing with the question of immigration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill gives legislative effect to a number of the major policy changes which were announced by the Government in the Senate on 8 December last year. These changes flow from the review of immigration undertaken last year by the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies (CAAIP) under the chairmanship of Dr Stephen FitzGerald, the intensive analysis of policy options which followed the tabling of the Committee's report on 3 June, and the wide-ranging community consultations which also took place. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I address the Bill in detail I would like to give honourable members a broad overview of it. There are three major features of this Bill. The first is a radically revised approach to immigration decision-making. Currently the Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs portfolio has decision-making discretions which are totally unfettered. That is, the migration legislative scheme is essentially machinery legislation. It gives the Minister power to determine who can enter Australia and who must leave. There is no provision in this scheme for parliamentary guidance of the exercise of the power. A Minister can make decisions on these matters virtually at his or her discretion. Thus, legally, a Minister has the power to determine and change policy in the immigration field as he or she wishes independent of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The wide discretionary powers conferred by the Migration Act have long been a source of public criticism. Decision-making guidelines are perceived to be obscure, arbitrarily changed and applied, and subject to day-to-day political intervention in individual cases. Accordingly this Bill proposes a decision-making system in which policies governing entry to and stay in Australia will, for the first time, be spelt out in the migration legislative scheme. Parliament, then through its powers of disallowance, will be able to monitor those policies. </PARA>
<PARA> A major feature of the Bill is the introduction of a new two-tier review system. There has been dissatisfaction with the former review system, with the end result that in some instances, a number of applicants have considered that the only way they can gain an independent review of their case is to pursue judicial review. A new two-tier review system is therefore proposed in the Bill. The first tier will be a review by specialist officers of the Department, specifically authorised and guaranteed independent by legislation to undertake this task. Applicants dissatisfied with a decision by that tier will be able to appeal to a second tier of review. This tier will be a statutorily based independent review body: the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT). I am confident that this proposal will not only ensure independent review, but also be fair, economical, informal and quick. Thus, applicants will be the main beneficiaries of this new system. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major feature of the Bill is that it spells out mechanisms for ensuring that planned immigration program intakes are not exceeded. Honourable members will understand that though the rights and entitlements of the individual must be protected, it is equally important that the restrictions which have to be imposed on the overall numbers and categories of people entering Australia in the public interest, also be spelt out in the regulations. In this way the Government will be able to balance the entry requirements against the overall planned intake levels and quickly correct any unforeseen fluctuations. Other significant features of the Bill include provisions for shifting the cost of detention and deportation onto the offender, and for making commercial immigration advisers accountable to their clients. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now address the main features of the new decision making regime in more detail. Under current legislation, the issue of visas and entry permits is governed by a wide discretionary power. Guidelines governing the exercise of this power are set out in policy and are scattered through departmental instructions. As these guidelines are policy rules they are not binding in law upon the decision-maker. This uncertainty can be both unsettling for the applicant and disruptive of the efficient management of the immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach to resolving these problems consists of two basic steps. First, provision has been made in the Bill for listing in regulation the various classes of visas and entry permits used in controlling the flow of people into Australia. For the information of honourable members, I am tabling a provisional list of the visa classes to be included in the regulations. A corresponding list of classes of entry permits will also be included in the regulations. I should emphasise that the list of visa classes is simply a list of the various categories of visas which are currently in use by the Department. Honourable members will see from the list that it simply describes the various categories of people coming to Australia, for example, aged parents, skilled workers, entertainers and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The second step is to spell out in regulation the decision making criteria which apply to each of these classes of visas and entry permits. For example, the regulations will say who may enter Australia as an aged parent, who may enter as a brother, as a skilled worker, and so on. This means that both the rights and entitlements of the individual, and the necessary public interest restrictions on entry will be clearly stated in the legislative scheme. It is true that the regulations determining who can enter and stay in Australia for each visa and entry permit class have not been drawn up. It is planned, however, that the regulations governing many of the major classes will be drawn up by the time this Bill is proclaimed. Honourable members will see from the provisional list of visa classes tabled, the order of priority which has been decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that in drawing up these regulations it is intended that they will reflect only current Government policy, which in turn reflects the Government's public response to the CAAIP report, and the extensive community consultations which took place. In presenting this Bill the Government is not, therefore, asking for a blank cheque to place new policies into regulations but a legislative base on which to order and rationalise existing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that given the scope, the complexity and the interrelationships of immigration rules, translating them into regulation will be an extremely lengthy process: in part this will reflect the fact that the approach is a completely novel one, and will involve the development of new skills and processes. Accordingly, it will take up to 18 months to complete regulations for all classes of decisions. It was decided, therefore, that in order to accelerate the process, the Bill would be put forward at this stage to obtain legislative backing to what is a fundamental rethinking of the administration of the Migration Act. The intention is, given that legislative backing, to draw up regulations for the major classes of decision as a matter of urgency, so that these can be implemented and have the force of law as soon as possible, rather than wait for every minor issue to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, when the Bill is proclaimed, there will still be some gaps in the policy criteria as set out in the regulations. These areas will continue to be discretionary until policy criteria for these areas can be incorporated into regulation. It is also the Government's intention that should there be a need to make a change in policy direction, that there be public debate on that matter before it is mirrored in legislation. The Government will, of course, continue to hold its wide ranging discussions each year prior to determining the size and the composition of the annual intake. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the criteria for decision making should be built into this Bill, I make two points. First, as I have already pointed out, we would have to wait a very long time before legislation could be introduced. Second, the important difference is not whether decision making criteria are in the Bill or in regulations. It is that legislation will replace the current system of ad hoc policy making. This will, as I said earlier, give Parliament the involvement hitherto denied it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also heard many arguments that ministerial discretion should be retained in all cases. In the final analysis, these arguments are little more than a plea for special treatment. Hundreds of thousands of decisions are taken within the immigration jurisdiction each year. Of these, the Minister can only decide a tiny fraction personally. The concern is to ensure equity and consistency in decision making. The belief was held that this was best done where a Minister concentrates on determining overall policy directions, and limits decision making to those classes impacting most on national well-being. However, consistent with the bipartisan approach of the Government it has been agreed that the Minister should remain the principal decision maker. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major element in the new decision-making regime is the introduction of an independent two-tier system of review of decisions. Although there has been a formal mechanism for the review of immigration decisions since 1982, its basis has been administrative, not legislative and its powers only recommendatory. The doubts recently raised about the authority to collect fees for such review have demonstrated the frailties of an administratively based system. Further, the absence of a demonstrably independent system of review, drawing its powers from statute, has led as stated initially, to dissatisfied applicants pursuing the costly and lengthy route of judicial review. </PARA>
<PARA> The system of review developed in the Bill is designed to provide a mechanism that is fair, economical, informal and quick. First tier review will be by specially appointed review officers within the Department. The Bill provides that they should operate as a discrete and independent unit and not be subject to direction on individual decisions. Review officers will not be limited to an examination of cases on the papers, and communication of the basis of unfavourable decisions to clients will be an important aspect of their role. Second tier review will be by a statutory body within the immigration portfolio, to be known as the Immigration Review Tribunal. Its members will be appointed by the Governor-General and it will have its own administrative infrastructure, unlike the current immigration review panels. </PARA>
<PARA> Informality and the absence of legalism will be the key to the Tribunal's operations. It is designed to permit claimants to put the merits of their case in a factual and straightforward way, without the need for formal representation. The means of achieving this is the non-adversarial structure for case determination. The Department will not be represented at the hearing of the case, unless called as a witness by the Tribunal. The matter to be resolved is between the claimant and the Tribunal as decision-maker, bound by legislation and guided by policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Immigration Review Tribunal will work broadly as follows: First it will examine the papers relating to a case, namely the material put forward by the applicant and the material prepared in the course of the primary decision and the first tier review processes. If the Tribunal can make a decision favourable to the applicant on that material, it will do so, and that will be an end to the matter. If, however, the Tribunal cannot make such a decision on the papers, then it will invite the applicant to give oral evidence before it makes a final decision on the appeal. In these circumstances applicants may be accompanied by an adviser, for example a friend or their solicitor. It is intended however, that this adviser will not orally address the Tribunal on behalf of the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> The jurisdiction of the new two tier system will extend to certain classes of decision prescribed in regulations and will be phased in as regulations setting out detailed decision making criteria are introduced. Broadly speaking the people who will be able to appeal under the new two tier system will be the same categories of people who could have appealed to the Immigration Review Panel. There is provision in the Bill for the regulations to specify whether the Tribunal should have determinative or recommendatory powers in relation to a particular class of decision. Review will, however, normally be determinative, and there is no intention at this stage of prescribing any categories of decisions for which the Tribunal will only have recommendatory powers. The recommendatory powers have been introduced only to allow for the possibility that in the future, criminal deportation decisions which are recommendatory may be transferred from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the Immigration Review Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the Minister to declare a decision non-reviewable if a change in the decision would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia, or if reviewing it would require consideration of deliberations or decisions of the Cabinet or a committee of Cabinet. The Minister may also override a decision of the Tribunal. This power may be exercised, however, only in cases where the Minister wishes to substitute a more favourable decision. Further, where the power is exercised, the Minister must provide a detailed statement to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a specific provision for the early setting up of the Immigration Review Tribunal. It is intended that these particular provisions will come into effect around the beginning of September, ahead of the rest of the Bill. Accordingly members of the Tribunal can be appointed, procedures developed, training of members in immigration policies and procedures undertaken, and so on, well in advance of the rest of the Bill being proclaimed. This means that as soon as the Bill is proclaimed the new review system can come into operation immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose that the fee for application for review by the second tier, the Immigration Review Tribunal, shall be no more than that levied by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, while the fee for the first tier, the statutory independent units in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, will be less than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Immigration is an unusual jurisdiction in that delay in decision-making can work to the advantage of the applicant, at least where the applicant is already in Australia. Delay is compounded where the same matter is repeatedly reopened through fresh applications, reviews and appeals. The new review system proposed in the Bill aims to ensure the cases are resolved fairly and speedily. It provides that once a decision is taken, and where relevant reviewed, the applicant should leave Australia within a set period. After the case is determined, a further application may be made only where the circumstances of the person have changed significantly. A decision on any such further application will not be reviewable. If the person fails to leave within the period provided, the Minister would be required to issue a deportation order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for mandatory deportation for the following reason. The central issue in relation to a person is whether he has any claim to remain in Australia. This issue will have already been tested in the decision-making and review processes. No fresh decision on any claims to remain in Australia is therefore required. All that is at issue is the simple question of fact: Has the decision process been completed and has the statutory period for voluntary departure expired?</PARA>
<PARA> The second major feature of the Bill is its mechanisms for ensuring that immigration objectives are achieved in an orderly manner. Individual immigration decisions must be taken in a fair, consistent and accountable manner. At the same time, we should not lose sight of the fact that these decisions are simply the component elements of an overall program designed to serve national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> International law recognises the sovereign right of nations to determine who may enter and remain within their territory. Australia cannot simply open its doors to all those who wish to enter, either temporarily or permanently. The Government has an obligation to the Australian people to have regard to the domestic labour market, public health and safety, and the capacity of the economy to provide adequately for the needs of the population. While Australia has a vigorous immigration program, annual intakes must be kept within planning figures, and the profile of those selected as immigrants and temporary entrants should conform with program objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Demand within the immigration program far exceeds the number of available places. There are well in excess of one million inquiries annually whereas this year's program for permanent entry provides only 140,000 places. The case in relation to temporary entry is rather different. Here, demand is normally actively encouraged. Australia's vigorous marketing of tourism and of education and health services, are examples. However, even in this area demand in certain categories may become problematic where numbers are out of step with other national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Effective management of intake levels is essential to ensure planned program outcomes are not exceeded. Governments have traditionally relied on their ability to turn the tap on and off. The alternative is an immigration program out of control. The Bill also addresses this management issue. It includes a provision to suspend receipt and processing of applications in certain classes until a nominated date. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the application of a competitive points test in the selection of some classes of permanent entrants. To contain demand for entry in each class subject to the points test, a floating passmark will be used to select only those applicants scoring the highest points related to the number of available places. </PARA>
<PARA> The system will operate as follows. Applicants in the points tested visa classes will be scored against set criteria. Depending on the mark achieved, applicants will be treated in one of four ways. If they achieve a sufficiently high score, referred to as the priority mark, they will move on to the next stage of processing. If they achieve a lower mark, referred to as the pool entry mark, they will be placed in a pool for further consideration against a variable passmark, determined on the basis of the number of available places and the marks of applicants in the pool. If they fail to reach this passmark, their applications may be rolled over for reconsideration when the mark is next varied. Applicants who fail to meet the pool entry mark will be rejected immediately. The various marks may be altered from time to time by gazettal and must be tabled in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the operation of this selection system to applicants for prescribed classes of entry permits. Where the system is used for applicants in Australia, there will be no pooling system and no rolling over of applicants within the pool. Rather, an applicant who fails to achieve the priority mark will be rejected outright. This approach is necessary in order to avoid delays in processing within Australia and the manipulation of the system by persons simply seeking to engineer a protracted stay. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to provide honourable members with some explanatory background for the other provisions of the Bill which I mentioned at the beginning of this speech. A feature of the Bill which I mentioned at the outset was the provisions in relation to compliance with the requirements of immigration legislation. The detention and deportation of prohibited non-citizens, renamed in the Bill as illegal entrants, is at considerable cost to the taxpayer. Often detainees and deportees have been working illegally in Australia, and have accumulated considerable assets. The Bill provides for freezing the assets of a deportee, within a framework of adequate protection to the individual. Provision is made, naturally, for people to retain sufficient funds for basic living costs and legal expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a person is deported, the Commonwealth can recoup the costs of detention and deportation from the person's assets. This will improve debt recovery and help defray the cost of detention by producing revenue estimated at $200,000 in a full year. The Bill also prohibits the subsequent issue of a visa at any stage to a person deported unless that person has met or has made satisfactory arrangements to meet any outstanding debt to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important provision of the Bill relates to persons providing immigration advice for a fee. This is a burgeoning enterprise, where clients are susceptible to inflated charges and false claims of influence. The current legislation simply requires the notification of an intention to act as a migration agent. These provisions are outdated and the Bill provides for their repeal. The Bill substitutes provisions whereby the operation of persons providing advice for a fee will be governed by sanctions aimed to ensure a responsible commercial relationship. Advisers will be committing an offence where they claim they can influence or have influenced the making of a certain decision, either in their own right or through a third person. The Bill also requires advisers to provide a detailed statement of account. Where the adviser has made false claims, or failed to furnish an account, no fee is due.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also addresses other initiatives announced on 8 December last year in response to the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies. Among those are the balance of family test which applies to some parents; tighter provisions for the assurance of support; and the release of illegal entrants on bonds which would be forfeited in the event of non-compliance with their conditions. The existing provisions for the grant of resident status to people temporarily in Australia are to be strengthened by requiring applicants on the basis of marriage, being the dependent child or aged parent of a citizen a resident, to be holders of a valid temporary entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions of the Bill will allow for the search of persons at entry about whom there is a reasonable suspicion that they will, on or after entry become an illegal entrant or will breach a condition of entry, or otherwise where a person has been arrested or taken into custody pursuant to the Act. The purpose of the search is to ascertain if the person is carrying a concealed weapon or documents material to their status. Section 16 of the Act will be amended to remove existing doubt as to whether the intention of persons deceiving officers must be proven. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains a general provision for the charging of fees. The Government has accepted the user pay principle where it is more fitting that the user, rather than the taxpayer, bear the cost of a particular service. Fees are set according to the cost of the service, and often are well below the true cost. Fees would be charged only in relation to specific services and processing activities, such as application, sponsorship, assurance of support and each tier of review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not be amending Section 36a of the Act, which allows for undocumented arrivals to be deemed not to have entered Australia. Removing this provision, which halts refugee claimants at Australia's frontier, would, on the experience of other countries such as Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland, attract to Australia tens of thousands of frontier claimants, many of them dubious. It would thereby effectively shift our major refugee effort from overseas to onshore. Since introduction into the Senate the Government has, however, decided to amend Section 36 of the Act to deal more properly with the situation of illegal fishermen, et cetera brought to Australia for the purposes of prosecution and/or repatriation. </PARA>
<PARA> Again in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation, several amendments to the original Bill were moved by the Government in the Senate. These amendments were made in response to the separate concerns of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, the Opposition and the Federation of Ethnic Communities of Australia. The most important of these amendments were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) as noted already, retaining the Minister as the principal decision maker;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) providing for interpreters to be used in the IRT and for decisions where the IRT is constituted by two members to be made according to the view of the presiding member:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) increasing the possible period to apply for review where the subject of the application is outside Australia to a total of 70 days;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) provision for the regulations concerning decision making criteria to lapse after two years after commencement unless the regulations themselves otherwise provide;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) provision for renumbering of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains many other detailed provisions which I do not have sufficient time to outline. These are set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been prepared to accompany the Bill. The Bill represents, as I have already said, a fundamental change to the administration of the Migration Act. This change, in turn, represents the most significant review of immigration policy and procedures taken over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the approach to the determination and expression of policy, to the reviewing of decisions, and to the overall determination and control of the size and composition of the entry of people into Australia, particularly the migrant intake, which flows from the present migration legislative scheme, is no longer appropriate. The current legislative scheme reflects an era when the overall numbers of people entering Australia were far smaller than they are today, when the rights of individuals were not protected by administrative law, and the general administration of the Migration Act and the formulation of policy reflected the unfettered nature of the decision making powers conferred by the Act. Developments in administrative law and the need to control the flow of people into Australia in accordance with overall economic and social policies have led to costly tensions between these objectives and the current legislative scheme. This Bill resolves these tensions and, further, gives Parliament power to monitor the changes in policy direction which inevitably emerge from the day to day administration of the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a package and its constituent elements are closely integrated. If this total package were not adopted, the Government would be faced with the piecemeal introduction of some of its provisions. The end result would be that the current situation would simply continue. This is unsatisfactory from the point of view of those affected directly by the operation of the Act and from the point of view of determining policy and protecting the wider public interest. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of the Migration Amendment Bill 1989 is to give effect to elements of the Government's master plan for passenger processing as they relate to the Migration Amendment Act (No. 2) 1988 which, as I will explain, cannot be proclaimed in its present form for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 6aa of that Act was intended to implement part of the master plan by allowing any visa issued after the commencement of that provision where a person enters Australia in certain circumstances to operate as an entry permit upon that person's entry. The Act was to be proclaimed when the computer support systems for such visas were in place. The computerisation of visa issue is now in place at most, including the major, overseas posts; however, some posts are not yet so equipped and will remain so in the near future. Given the pivotal role of electronic records and systems in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in the task of processing passengers for entry to Australia, it is necessary to take full advantage of the computer technology already installed at overseas posts at considerable cost. As section 6aa currently refers to all visas issued after its commencement, the Act cannot be proclaimed and the procedural and administrative benefits to be conferred by it are not available in relation to a large number of visas which could otherwise be operating in accordance with section 6aa. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons this Bill is essential from an administrative point of view in order to amend the Act so that section 6aa may be proclaimed and thus brought into operation immediately. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The House will be aware that the Government has been developing a comprehensive program for reform of the shipping and waterfront industries. I am pleased to be able to advise the House today of the measures we will be taking to implement these major elements of micro-economic reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through various reports commissioned by this Government, it is now common knowledge that Australia has been poorly served by its shipping and waterfront industries. The gross inefficiencies which have been allowed to develop in these industries have restricted our economic growth, reduced our living standards and impaired our capacity to develop export markets. In part, our balance of payments difficulties are directly attributable to the acute inefficiencies in these key industries in the export chain. The reforms I am announcing today will dramatically transform these industries. They will lead to quantum increases in efficiency over the next three to five years and will in turn enable our industries, which depend on sea transport, to become more flexible and more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of all, our reform package is practical, based on commonsense and developed through consultation. It is not based on abstract theory or ideological dogma. It is a practical agenda for cooperative and effective reform which will reap maximum long term benefits for the industries, their customers and, indeed, all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The structure of our inquiries reflects our commitment to consultation. The Shipping Reform Task Force, which we established to investigate the scope for developing new reform initiatives, was chaired by Mr Ivan Deveson, Managing Director of Nissan Australia, and comprised senior representatives from shippers, ship operators, the unions and government. The report was agreed by all members and released on 20 April. </PARA>
<PARA> We also asked the Inter-State Commission, an independent statutory body within my portfolio, to report on measures to reform the waterfront. During its inquiry the Commission took evidence from stevedoring industry employers and unions; commercial operators; Federal and State interests; and importers and exporters. The Commission's report was released on 6 April. In proposing a detailed strategy for reform, the Commission recommended an in-principle agreement between Government, waterside unions and employers as a central element of its plan. It has therefore been necessary for the Government to hold intensive discussions with industry parties to ascertain their views before finalising its position. </PARA>
<PARA>Shipping</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Our work on shipping builds on earlier reforms introduced by this Government. In 1984, in response to the report of the Crawford Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping, we introduced taxation incentives which led to new ships coming into service in 1984 with crews as low as 26, well below crew levels for such ships of an earlier generation which were in the low to mid-30s. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crawford scheme represented a critical turning point for the industry. It introduced a pattern for reform with ship owners and unions working together in a constructive way, for users and the economy as a whole. It made possible the establishment in 1986 of the Maritime Industry Development Committee (MIDC), representing ship owners, unions and the Government, which, in turn, initiated a radically new approach to operating Australian ships using the concepts of multi-skilling, broadbanding of jobs and the integration of functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The MIDC initiatives resulted in crew sizes on new ships being further reduced, for example from 26 to 21 on a dry bulk carrier. There are now five ships operating in the Australian fleet with MIDC crewing levels and a further 15 ships are on order. These reforms have been achieved in a period of unprecedented industrial harmony in the shipping industry. In 1982, 4.1 per cent of ship time, or 1,593 ship days, were lost through industrial disputes. Last year only 0.2 per cent or 72 ship days, were lost. This dramatic change has been brought about partly by the reduction in demarcation disputes through union amalgamations and partly by the industry's determination to improve its efficiency and public image. </PARA>
<PARA> The shipping reform task force, which recently reported to the Government, has proposed a three-year reform strategy which will not only close the competitive gap between Australian shipping and its Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) counterparts, but also lead to further efficiency improvements after 1992. The Government has accepted the task force proposals and will work with the industry and its users to implement the reform strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> At the heart of this strategy is a program for reduction of the size of crews on existing ships. This is a major step forward which, taken together with the Maritime Industry Development Committee initiatives, will transform the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian flag shipping over the next three years. These crewing initiatives will save a total of $80m in crew costs by mid-1992 and at least $50m per year thereafter. They will reduce the average crew size on major trading ships from 29 at present to 21 over the next three years. When we came into office the average crew size on such ships was 33. Initiatives taken by the Government will therefore reduce average crew sizes by 36 per cent in less than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will support this recrewing program by contributing up to $24m of the estimated $80m required for voluntary early retirement schemes for the 1,000 jobs which may be lost over the three-year reform program. This contribution will ensure that shipowners can quickly pass on to users the benefits of crew cost savings. </PARA>
<PARA> To recrew pre-MIDC ships, we will expand the skills upgrading programs currently in place. The Government will fund up to half the cost of retraining seafarers required to operate such ships, up to a total of $5m over the three-year program. With existing training programs it will be possible to reduce crews on the most modern ships to 17 or 18 before mid-1992. To reduce crews even further it will be necessary to integrate officer functions; that is, to train officers in both navigation and engineering skills. The Government will work with the industry to design and introduce the necessary training courses before July 1990, so that suitably trained personnel will be available by 1993. This will allow Australian ships to operate with crews of between 14 and 16, or even less. The magnitude of this achievement can best be illustrated by looking at the crew sizes on dry bulk ships; the mainstay of the Australian fleet. Such a ship, introduced in 1983, would have had a crew of 32. A decade later a new dry bulk carrier will be able to be introduced into service with a crew of 16 or less; at least a 50 per cent reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> The task force also recommended the abolition of first-class air travel for seafarers; adoption of measures to reduce waste in victualling; development of a more efficient and, therefore, less costly compensation system; re-examination of study leave arrangements; and further development of dispute settlement procedures. The Government strongly supports the implementation of these measures, which would further reduce costs and cut the crew to berth ratio by about 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Shipping is a highly capital intensive industry and the fiscal regime is therefore critical to ensuring continued investment. The current fiscal regime for new ships of 7 per cent taxable capital grants and accelerated depreciation, introduced in support of the MIDC scheme, puts Australian shipowners in a broadly comparable position with their OECD counterparts. To provide a stable framework that supports the reform strategy for the industry, the Government has decided to extend the current fiscal regime for new ships for five years from the scheduled expiry date of 30 June 1992. Also, the 7 per cent taxable grant will now be available until 30 June 1992 to cover the cost of any necessary modifications to existing ships for operation with smaller crews. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present fuel excise arrangements, 26 per cent of the excise on marine diesel is hypothecated to land transport development programs at an approximate cost of $3m a year and, therefore, directly subsidises competing modes of transport. The Government accepts the task force's argument that this is an unfair burden on coastal shipping and has agreed to rebate the hypothecated component of the excise from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the 1920s successive governments have maintained a cabotage policy which requires that coastal cargo be carried in Australian controlled and crewed ships, whenever possible. This policy has not prohibited foreign flag ships from the coast. Where no suitable local ship is available, permits are issued for single voyages to allow foreigners to enter the coasting trade. In the 12 months to the end of March 1989, 38 permits were issued allowing a half a million tonnes of coastal cargo to be carried in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The cabotage policy was carefully examined by the shipping reform task force. No member recommended its withdrawal but it was suggested that changes be made to the application of the permit system to increase its flexibility. The task force pointed out that almost all major maritime nations have a cabotage policy, including our leading trading partners, Japan and the United States. The only exception to this is the United Kingdom, although even there legislation imposing cabotage restrictions has been recently passed, but not proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments almost everywhere consider that coastal shipping is part of the domestic economy and that it should be treated no differently from other domestic transport sectors. The Government agrees with the task force that the permit system should be made more flexible and has decided that new guidelines will be issued for the operation of the permit system. These will apply to single voyage permits and will also include the use of permits for continuous trading which, although allowed for under the Navigation Act, have not been issued for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> These continuing voyage permits, which can be issued for up to three years, will improve efficiency and competitiveness in the coastal shipping market in a number of ways. For example, small, irregular shippers, particularly those operating from remote locations, will be given greater choice when undertaking coastal voyages. The risks associated with new trades will be reduced because the use of continuing voyage permits could establish viability. This will encourage the development of new raw materials processing opportunities. When existing raw materials processing is experiencing an upsurge in demand, the continuing voyage permit process could be used to supplement local coastal tonnage to ensure that short term needs are met from domestic sources. The continuing voyage permit system could also be used by shippers to improve the overall efficiency of their shipping through promoting a greater integration of coastal and international trading. For example, an Australian shipper might relinquish part of its coastal trades to foreign ships in exchange for greater access for its shipping in international trades. In this way both Australian and foreign flag ships could minimise their ballast voyaging, thus benefiting both domestic and international users of Australian raw materials through lower freight rates. </PARA>
<PARA> These examples illustrate ways in which the changes to the permit system will provide greater flexibility and hence benefit shippers. Providing a better deal for shippers has been a key objective of the Government, which has been concerned to ensure that the efficiencies resulting from crew reductions and the other benefits of the reforms announced tonight are passed on. The Government will therefore ask the Prices Surveillance Authority to inquire into and monitor coastal shipping rates. If, nevertheless, it becomes clear over the next three years that shippers relying on others for their coastal shipping are not benefiting from reform through lower freight rates, the Government will give serious consideration to including price as one of the criteria used when assessing permit applications. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three areas where the task force did not reach a final position but where the Government considers that further action is desirable. The first of these is trans-Tasman shipping. When the closer economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand was reviewed and renegotiated in the middle of last year, both governments agreed that it was vital to pursue measures to reduce the costs of shipping across the Tasman. In trans-Tasman shipping, onshore costs represent 50 per cent of total costs-routes are short, cargo volumes are low and port visits are frequent. In addition, shippers expect continuing high and stable service levels. Both governments therefore agreed that reduction of waterfront costs is essential to reduce the cost of trading across the Tasman. High priority was also given to the introduction of low cost, more efficient vessels. The shipping needs of fledgling and specialised trades were put at risk because of the high costs of Australian and New Zealand shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> The waterfront and shipping reforms which I am announcing and reforms which are being introduced in New Zealand will have a substantial beneficial impact on trans-Tasman shipping costs. In addition I will be holding discussions with the New Zealand Government to determine the scope for further reductions in trans-Tasman shipping and waterfront costs prior to the achievement of free trade between the two countries on 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area where the task force did not reach a final position involved company employment for ratings. Unlike the waterfront, there has been little consideration of the issue. In any case the lack of company employment has not impeded recent, major changes to work practices on ships. In fact, both shipowners and unions acknowledge the value of the engagement system and recognise that, even with company employment, some use of supplementary labour would be required to overcome occasional shortages. Nevertheless there may well be advantages in moving to company employment and this issue should be kept on the longer term reform agenda. Finally, there is the towage industry. I will be referring to further reform in this area later in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Waterfront</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Twenty years ago containerisation was introduced to Australian ports. It fundamentally changed the face of the waterfront. The number of cargo handling waterside workers has reduced from 21,000 in the years before containerisation, to a little over 5,000 now. Between 1965 and 1985 the amount of non-bulk cargo handled by each waterside worker increased from 1,000 tonnes to over 5,000 tonnes a year. Despite these large increases in labour productivity the fact is we have not kept pace with our overseas competitors. The last major set of changes to industry arrangements was in 1977 but these did little to improve the performance of the industry, which has remained grossly inefficient. Apart from the changes forced on the industry by technological developments, both employers and unions on the waterfront have failed to adapt to meet the demands of a fiercely competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission has found the waterfront industry in urgent need of fundamental change. It is right. It is characterised by ineffective management and poor work force motivation, introspective industrial attitudes, high costs, endemic unreliability, poor response to user needs, abuse of monopoly power and a pervasive lack of competition. This is not a situation that has developed recently-it is how we found the industry when we came into office. Soon after coming to office the Government therefore brought the industry parties together through the Webber task force to identify the causes of waterfront inefficiency and unreliability. In response to the issues raised by the task force the Government in 1986 directed the Inter-State Commission to examine all aspects of the waterfront and develop an integrated plan to improve its performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has pointed the way toward thoroughgoing reform of the waterfront. The Government accepts the fundamental thrust of its findings. Reform will be complex and contentious but it is essential to our economic well-being that it be achieved. Success will depend on allowing the competitive forces of the marketplace to operate more freely, and on active cooperation between the major interests. Competition and cooperation are hallmarks of our reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be pursuing change in three broad areas in line with the Commission's recommendations: the stevedoring industry where there will be a fundamental change in employment arrangements shifting from the current practice of industry-wide employment to enterprise-based employment for stevedoring labour; port authorities, where the Government is pursuing with the States and the Northern Territory measures to improve the efficiency of port authorities and services they influence; and measures to create a more competitive commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission made recommendations on a range of other issues, including improvements to land transport access to ports, documentation procedures and the introduction of electronic data interchange to the waterfront industry. The Government has accepted the vast majority of the Commission's recommendations in these areas and will be pursuing them in consultation with relevant parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to the Commission's proposals for the stevedoring industry is the negotiation of a three-year in-principle agreement between the Federal Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), stevedoring unions and stevedoring employers on restructuring the stevedoring and international container depot operations. Following detailed consultation with industry parties the Government has concluded it should be possible for the industry parties to negotiate an in-principle agreement acceptable to the Government. This will be the foundation for the achievement of substantial waterfront reform. As proposed by the Inter-State Commission, the Government is providing the industry parties with up to three months to negotiate this agreement. Provided there is an agreement satisfactory to the Government we will be prepared to commit up to $154m on a dollar-for-dollar basis with employers towards the costs of redundancy payments, training, retraining, skills audits and job redesign projects. We are prepared to allocate this money as an investment in the future. The costs involved are substantial, but there is a critical need for change in this vital sector of the economy. The benefits envisaged by the Inter-State Commission of at least $620m per annum in terms of cost reductions and improved reliability are essential to our export competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The central elements of the Inter-State Commission's proposals for the in-principle agreement involve the transfer of employment responsibilities to individual enterprises. This will improve competition, enhance employer-employee relationships and reduce costs to the shippers. But in moving to enterprise employment we must ensure the work force has an adequate level and mix of skills and that its working environment motivates employees to accomplish their tasks effectively. Regard must also be had to the high proportion of older workers in the industry where the work force has an average age of over 50 years. We have therefore accepted the Commission's recommendation that rejuvenation of the industry requires a special retirement and redundancy scheme coupled with a recruitment program to bring trained workers into the industry. This will involve 3,000 existing employees leaving the industry over three years and the recruitment of 1,000 new employees no older than 30. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that a satisfactory agreement will need to include firm commitments from the industry parties on the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The introduction of enterprise employment arrangements into the ports of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Fremantle within three years. Employment arrangements in Adelaide will need to be consistent with the principles of enterprise employment. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Flexible supplementary work force arrangements must be developed on an enterprise basis for major ports consistent with the Commission's recommendations. Compatible arrangements will need to be agreed to for small and intermediate ports. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Awards and agreements must be restructured consistent with the structural efficiency principle of the 1988 national wage decision. This will enable improvements in work organisation designed to increase productivity, efficiency and reliability through the negotiation of specific implementation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Employers are to provide, on a dollar for dollar basis with the government, $0.5m for workplace restructuring projects to facilitate agreements on changes to work patterns and arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. New employees are to be recruited directly into individual enterprises with recruitment in the first year being in accordance with existing industry procedures. In subsequent years each enterprise should determine the recruitment procedures to be followed in consultation with relevant unions. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Consistent with the Commission's recommendations current industry arrangements regarding compulsory redundancy for existing employees are to be retained. Arrangements for compulsory redundancy as a last resort for all new recruits are to be allowed at the end of the three year implementation period.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Employers and unions must commit themselves to develop and support industry-based training schemes and enterprise-based training programs. The development of the programs and schemes should ensure they are appropriate to the needs of the stevedoring and international container depot industries, linked to the introduction of new job structures through retraining of existing employees, and related to the recruitment program. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Federal Government will provide up to $8m for improving training facilities, the training of new recruits and the retraining of existing employees to facilitate job restructuring. Employers will be required to provide a matching amount. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. A one-off early retirement-redundancy scheme for the next three years is to be established based on the entitlements recommended by the Inter-State Commission. In negotiating the in-principle agreement parties will need to develop arrangements to more specifically `target' redundancy offers to meet the needs of the industry. Supervisor categories will be covered by these arrangements and this should facilitate reduction in excessive layers of supervision. </PARA>
<PARA>10. Employers are to provide up to $145m on a dollar for dollar basis with government to fund the early retirement-redundancy offers. The Government is prepared to facilitate the collection of employer contributions through statutory levy arrangements for a period that is demonstrated to be necessary and subject to the levy rate not exceeding present combined statutory and industry levy rates for this purpose. It is expected that the levy would apply for no longer than three to four years. </PARA>
<PARA>11. The parties must accept that permanent inclusions of stand-down provisions in awards is a matter to be pursued through normal Industrial Relations Commission processes. </PARA>
<PARA>12. The parties must make a commitment to develop and adhere to agreed disciplinary and dispute settlement procedures to improve industry reliability and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>13. They must also agree to arrangement to enable the effective contracting out of maintenance work where it is more efficient than in-house facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>14. The Government will be phasing out the existing cross-subsidisation of stevedoring labour costs in small ports through statutory levies over three years. The parties will therefore need to commit themselves to introduction of measures to improve the efficiency of small and intermediate ports through revised employment arrangements including enterprise employment, commercial port labour pools and use of port authority labour. </PARA>
<PARA>15. Constraints that limit competition in international container depot operations must be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>16. Where stevedoring employees are employed in association with the loading and unloading of bulk vessels employment arrangements will be in accordance with efficient operational requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>17. Finally, agreement by the stevedoring and international container depot unions must agree to rationalisation of union coverage at small ports, international container depots and bulk terminals. Agreement is to be reached through consultations under the auspices of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA>A firm timetable for progressive implementation of specific elements is an essential requirement of an in-principle agreement. Government assistance will be provided only when specified objectives within the timetable have clearly been achieved. Conditional on the conclusion of a satisfactory in-principle agreement, the Government will also provide up to $100,000 towards the conduct of a special study for the development of safety proposals for the industry, $250,000 for union research staff to assist unions in the implementation of the in-principle agreement and $100,000 towards consultants for skills reviews. </PARA>
<PARA> The second broad area where the Government will pursue reform is in relation to port authorities and their roles in the waterfront industry. The operations of port authorities are matters of direct State and Territory responsibility and we will be seeking to pursue reform in this area in cooperation with the States. I wrote to State and Territory Ministers on the release of the Inter-State Commission's report asking that they give early consideration to the Inter-State Commission's recommendations. I will be meeting with them soon to discuss their reactions and what actions they propose to implement the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government endorses the broad thrust of the ISC's recommendations in relation to port authorities. It is clear that there is room for substantial improvement in their performance. Port authority managements need to operate at maximum levels of efficiency. Port pricing practices need to be modified to reduce cross-subsidies and reliance on cargo based charges. The Government is convinced that port authority efficiency will be best achieved by commercialising their operations; that is, government port authorities should be put on a business-like basis as far as possible-along the lines of the reforms which the Federal Government is currently implementing with regard to its own business enterprises. Because of their monopoly powers port authority pricing is a particular area of concern to shippers and shipowners. The Government agrees with the Inter-State Commission's recommendations aimed at ensuring greater transparency in port pricing and a closer relationship between costs and services provided. This issue will be receiving close attention during my discussions with State and Northern Territory governments. Port authorities can play a central role in encouraging a more competitive environment in ports for such services as stevedoring and towage operations through leases and licensing arrangements. The Government believes that port authorities should be taking a more effective, pro-competitive approach than they have in the past in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Commission's role in this industry will also be enhanced. The Government will ensure that the TPC has the additional resources and backing necessary to apply the Act to those areas identified in the ISC report. The most important of these are the international container depot and towage industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prices Surveillance Authority can also play an important role in monitoring prices and ensuring that the benefits of changes in the waterfront industry flow through to their customers, the importers and exporters. The Government will therefore be requesting the Prices Surveillance Authority to monitor prices in the waterfront industry with particular attention being given to the stevedoring, international container depot and towage industries. Formal surveillance or inquiry processes will be put in train if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission found on the basis of evidence given to it and research undertaken by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics that the towage industry is not competitive. The Bureau concluded that harbour towage charges were high, tug utilisation low, crew sizes high by comparison with other countries and there was a lack of competition between tug operators. There is clearly room for major improvement in this industry. The shipping reform task force called on the towage industry parties to develop a reform strategy for the industry and report to the Government within three months. The Government will expect it to produce major improvements in line with those proposed for commercial shipping. Furthermore, in my discussions with State and Territory Ministers I will be examining ways to improve competition in the towage industry, such as the introduction of licensing by port authorities to encourage greater competition. Additionally the Government agrees with the Inter-State Commission's recommendations that the Trade Practices Commission should consider reviewing the authorisations that it has granted in relation to towage operations at a number of ports to assess whether these continue to be in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that implementation of the radical reforms which I have announced for the waterfront industry will bring about the restructuring necessary to generate the large productivity improvements predicted by the Inter-State Commission. In our view, these prospective productivity increases would be further enhanced by the introduction of profit sharing or employee share ownership schemes. The joint ventures initiated by the Waterside Workers Federation in some small ports have highlighted the efficiency gains to be achieved by profit sharing arrangements. Such schemes would also reinforce the concept of enterprise employment by promoting closer identification by waterside workers with their enterprise and its financial viability. </PARA>
<PARA> The comprehensive program I have just outlined will bring substantial and highly beneficial change to the waterfront industry. It offers benefits to the customers, the industry participants and the nation. In line with the Inter-State Commission report, the program's achievement rests substantially on the cooperation of the parties. If, however, that cooperation is not forthcoming, the industries should be under no illusions about the Government's firm commitment to achieve significant waterfront reform. I will report back to Cabinet within three months on the results of the negotiations on the in-principle agreement. If a satisfactory agreement is not achieved, we will pursue alternative measures to change these industries structurally. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of Shipping and Waterfront Reforms</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As I have already mentioned, the shipping reform task force and the Inter-State Commission both recommended three-year implementation periods for the shipping and waterfront reform strategies. They also recommended independent authorities to oversee the detailed development and implementation of these reform packages. The Government has accepted this approach and will shortly establish the Shipping Industry Reform Authority (SIRA) and the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) which are to run for three years. Both will bear major responsibilities of overseeing and monitoring the day to day implementation by the industries of the reform plans that have been agreed to by the industry parties and by the Government. I expect both authorities to work cooperatively with the industry parties to meet the agreed objectives. Disbursement of government restructuring assistance by the authorities will be contingent upon achievement of strategy targets. Reform will have to be carried through in a systematic and comprehensive way. </PARA>
<PARA> The first task of the Waterfront Authority will be to supervise the negotiation of the in-principle agreement. The Authority will also monitor other industry negotiations in order to ensure that they are consistent with government requirements for an in-principle agreement and prepare for an immediate start to reforms once an agreement is signed. It will also ensure that the arrangements for recruiting new entrants will conform with government requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Maritime Safety Authority</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> To further enhance efficiency and contain costs to industry the Government has decided to establish an Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The Authority, which will replace the Maritime Operations Division in my Department, will administer the standards and procedures for the construction, equipment and safe loading of ships; the qualification and training of crews, the provision of marine navigational aids and the complementation of anti-pollution measures. Such an Authority will be more responsive to industry needs, while remaining properly accountable to government. The Authority will be controlled by a board with membership drawn from industry and government to bring appropriate management skills to the conduct of these important commercial and safety functions. The Authority will be largely self funding through user charges payable by the industry. The cost of providing and maintaining marine navigational aids is already fully recovered through light dues. Similarly, the costs of the national plan to combat oil pollution are paid for by a levy on commercial shipping. The Shipping Registration Office recovers over 80 per cent of its costs on a fee for service basis and is expected to achieve full cost recovery by 1990-91. Charges are made to recover the costs of marine survey, except where the surveys are for regulatory purposes. The Authority would also continue to provide a seamen's engagement system as long as the industry wanted it. The Government's aim is to bring the Authority into being by 1 September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Light Dues</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The system of marine navigational aids provided by the Australian Government for the safe and efficient movement of vessels in Australian waters is paid for by light dues charged to commercial users. Traditionally light dues have been paid at a single rate per net registered ton. This is the practice for light dues around the world. The rate is currently 53c and has remained unchanged since 1983. Following representations from certain sectors of industry, the Government has reviewed the basis for payment of light dues and the formula used to set the rate for individual ships. It has decided that there is a case for providing relief for some of the largest vessels. The new formula provides for a sliding scale of charges by tonnage ranging from 63c to 33c per net registered ton. This will lead to a reduction of dues for large vessels of about 20 per cent and has been achieved without imposing any large increase in fees for the smaller vessels. To illustrate this point, a small coastal vessel of 200 net registered tons will pay only $20 per quarter more, while a large bulk carrier of 72,000 net registered tons will pay $6,900 per quarter less. Ships in the middle tonnage range will experience no change. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> These measures represent the most wide-ranging package of reforms ever introduced for Australia's waterfront and shipping industries. They establish a firm basis for continuing reform. On the basis of the findings of the Inter-State Commission and the Shipping Reform Task Force, these measures will greatly increase productivity and create a more competitive environment in our shipping and waterfront industries. They will reduce costs to our exporters and import competing industries, will create new job opportunities and will bring benefits to all Australians by ensuring a more competitive economy. Such improvements are not simply desirable; they are crucial to our future economic well being. Australia has paid dearly for the benign neglect of those opposite who, during their three decades of postwar Government of this country, allowed these industries to become a burden on the nation and a barrier to economic progress. The reforms I have outlined today will ensure that these industries will have a far more positive impact on the economy in the years to come. I commend the reforms to the House. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us this evening two separate but very much interrelated issues which the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) has brought forward in his statement this evening. I know that later this evening he will bring down another statement which the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) will deal with in a more than adequate way. The two issues to which I refer relate to both the waterfront and coastal shipping services. It is my intention to commence in the opposite manner to that of the Minister in his statement this evening and to start first with the waterfront issue. Perhaps the fact that I am doing everything the other way around to the way the Government is doing it is indicative of the way we would attack the whole problem when we got into government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are extremely disappointed at this statement, because we see in it that the Government has proved to the people of Australia that it is nothing more than a pack of wimps. The statement, is very cleverly worded to ensure that the Government looks as though it is pursuing the path as approved and recommended by the Inter-State Commission. However, when one looks at the numbers of `ifs', `buts' and `maybes' written into it, one soon starts to realise that this is not a statement that pursues the full recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. Rather, it tries to wriggle out of so many of those recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> One must remember that the Inter-State Commission's recommendations are, themselves, a position of compromise. Yet from that position of compromise the Government has further compromised those recommendations and watered them down. That is what causes us to be disappointed and what will cause so many people throughout the coastal shipping and waterfront industries of Australia great disappointment. It proves to us that this Government is prepared to put the interests of its mates ahead of the interests of the people of Australia. The mates of this Government are, of course, the members of the trade union movement. We all know that the Inter-State Commission report was released a little while ago. We have seen comments made by members of the trade union movement. I note that Mr Tas Bull is back in Australia again today with some elightening comments to add to the debate. I notice that over the last few weeks some of his colleagues have made a number of statements; statements which indicate that, unless this Government has an extreme amount of courage, it will not accept in full the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Minister's 38-minute statement, we heard that the Government lacks the courage to implement those recommendations and lacks the courage to stand up to the trade union movement and to people such as the Tas Bull's of this world. We have been alerted to the Government's changing position from the Inter-State Commission's recommendations over the last few weeks. Comments by trade unions and by spokesmen for the Minister indicate that certain difficult issues that the Government is trying to deal with in these recommendations are being watered down to try to make them look less important to the people of this country. Tonight, the Government has proved two things: firstly, that its machinery for micro-economic reform has ground to a halt and with it, secondly, that it is not worthy to retain government. I say that because several key issues have not been adequately addressed by the Minister in his statement on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I will start by talking about the first issue; that is, union coverage at the waterfront. Union coverage is one of the key recommendations made by the Inter-State Commission. If we look at what the Minister has said tonight, we discover that what the Inter-State Commission said was necessary is not what this Government is doing. The Government has failed to accept the Inter-State Commission's recommendations on union coverage in bulk handling container depots and the smaller ports. These recommendations are a key element of the Commission's strategy of reducing costs and ensuring greater competition on the waterfront. They go to the very heart of the Waterside Workers Federation's monopoly power. The Government's failure to bite the bullet in this area shows its total lack of commitment to introducing greater competition when it is at the expense of a union with the support of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also not adequately addressed the area of enterprise employment. Despite the Minister's assurance that the Government will ensure there will be full enterprise employment in the stevedoring industry, employers will not be able to determine their own manning levels. Employers will still be severely restricted in deciding whether to hire and fire employees. The existing prohibition on compulsory redundancy for current employees will remain and be extended to new employees for three years. Furthermore, the Government's plans do not ensure that employers are given unrestricted access to supplementary labour. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Willis" NAMEID="ZJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was the ISC recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister interjected a few minutes ago in relation to compulsory redundancy for current employees that will mean, as I understand it, a moratorium for a period of three years. At present the industry is going well, but what will happen if there is a downturn in a few years time? Will those companies be compelled to keep all their employees on their books, despite the fact that they do not have the business to justify maintaining them on their work force? That is one issue which we are very concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other issue relates to compulsory stand-downs. In our opinion, the Government has failed to agree to the Inter-State Commission's recommendation concerning the standing down of employees who are unable to work because of industrial action by others. The waterfront is notorious for rolling stoppages. The inability to stand down employees who cannot be usefully employed imposes a massive cost on employers. The Inter-State Commission found that employers needed speedy access to stand down provisions if there is to be effective settling of disputes and in order to ensure that unions comply with agreements. The Government's failure to agree to this key recommendation means that unions will continue to exert enormous industrial muscle on the waterfront which in the past has been used to extract restrictive work practices. So it is in those key areas that the Government has failed to pick up adequately the full intent of the recommendations by the Inter-State Commission. It is in those key areas that we say the Government has failed in its endeavours properly to reform the waterfront. It is in those key areas that we believe this whole issue of reforming the waterfront will fail. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had 12 inquiries into the waterfront since World War II. I think that this now makes the thirteenth inquiry. Despite the fact that the 12 inquiries have been given worthy support by Ministers of governments in the past, they have not helped to ensure that Australia's waterfront is any more productive than any other countries around the world. Is it any wonder, with the reform that is being proposed in the Minister's statement tonight, that we are not seeing anything better? We all know that the Australian Labor Party is the product of the union movements. The unions do not want change; they are part of the status quo because change equals a loss of power and privilege. It is unfortunate that the present Minister has been given the task of dealing with this particular issue because we all know that prior to coming to this place he worked for the ACTU. I wonder what the difference would have been if the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, had been the Minister handling the reform of the waterfront and the coastal shipping services today? I believe that his more aggressive approach would have led to a substantially different statement being brought down tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed its test in micro-economic reform. It is important to remember that the Government set its own agenda. It declared that it would be a main plank in its platform of economic management. We can all recall prior statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other Ministers of this Government in the past that micro-economic reform would be one of the main issues that would be the measurement of success of this Government's management of the Australian economy. The Minister for Transport and Communications was given the task to enact this important section of micro-economic reform and I am afraid that he has failed. The Government has not given a guarantee that there will be proper progress on reform of the waterfront in his statement tonight. Over the last few months we have heard the Prime Minister make such statements. He said, `We are determined not to shirk the challenges that micro-economic reform presents us'. </PARA>
<PARA> The cop out today is an example of a government shirking its responsibilities. In his opening remarks the Minister stated that the Australian waterfront is hopelessly inefficient. If we compare our own waterfront to the waterfronts of Europe, we find that our productivity levels are half of its productivity levels. If we compare ourselves with  the waterfronts of Asia, we find that our productivity levels only reach 40 per cent of its productivity levels. We are recognised as some of the most cost-efficient producers in the world of various products, particularly primary products today. Australia is known as having some of the most cost-efficient farmers, and yet we find it so difficult to compete in the world market simply because when we take our cost-efficient products to the waterfront we find that the cost of getting them from the Australian shores to the world market prohibits effective competition for our Australian exporters due to the inefficiencies and wastage that is incurred on our waterfront today. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that adequate reform on the waterfront will add $1.1 billion to the gross domestic product of Australia. This would be a crucial injection of income for the Australian economy at a time such as this. Therefore, we realise today just how crucial reform is. Our foreign debt has grown by more than $7 billion over the last quarter. It has now cracked the $100 billion mark; indeed, I think it is $103 billion. Our shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) said only today that Australia is fast going broke. Home owners are going broke and are facing record high interest rates of 17 per cent which we understand will soon rise to 18 per cent. Balance of payments deficits have hit record high levels, the current account is a disaster and inflation is up despite the attempts by the Government to fiddle with the figures. Exports are dropping and imports are rising. Moody's Investor Services Inc. is now reviewing our credit worthiness. It is reviewing it partly because of our slow pace of reform-a slow pace which will be made even slower by tonight's statement by the Minister. I am sure that tonight's statement will help impress upon Moody's why it has decided to review our credit worthiness. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment Australia faces disaster. It is time for action. The Government was right to highlight the importance of micro-economic reform. It was right to target the waterfront as part of that micro-economic reform arena. We all know of the rorts that exist on our waterfront. The Waterside Workers Federation and its activities are well known to us all. The approach of the Liberal and National parties has been to support the Inter-State Commission's recommendations. We recognise that they are not perfect; we recognise that they do not fit properly every one of the aspects that we would like them to. However, we do believe that they are a good basis for fundamental structural reform. We believe that this recommendation by the Inter-State Commission represents a framework for achieving real improvement on the waterfront, and it reflects the coalition's emphasis on increasing competition and a more enterprise-based approach to employee relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Competition and delivering the benefits of it to the user, and thus the Australian people, is the key to this reform. Creating the environment for competition is where the Government has fallen down. Fundamental in all of this is a move to full enterprise employment, which I mentioned a few moments ago. Waterfront employers must have the right to hire and fire, just as employers in other industries have. Employers must also be able to be free to hire supplementary labour without having to go through a pool. It means that employers, when they need reserve labour forces, have the right to pick people of their own choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Any reform of the waterfront must include compulsory redundancies as a last resort. Of course, we believe that compulsory redundancies should start earlier than the Government has stated tonight. Any government contributions to fund redundancy payments should be paid progressively and be made more dependent on progress in implementing reform on an enterprise basis. This should include complete elimination of restrictive work practices and the introduction of flexible rosters. The Inter-State Commission's recommendations on union coverage and stand-downs must be properly implemented. That is essential if there is to be greater competition and improved industrial relations. We believe that these stand-down requirements are not confrontationist. Employees on the waterfront still enjoy extremely generous pay and conditions by anyone's standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The redundancy proposals being put forward in tonight's statement mean that a 55-year-old waterfront labourer who has had 30 years service will receive the equivalent of 247 weeks-nearly five years-of pay as part of his redundancy package, plus, of course, his superannuation package from the superannuation fund into which he has been paying, together with his employer, for all those years. So waterfront labourers will also be able to take early retirement on terms far more favourable than those that are available to the rest of the community. Unions, of course, will continue to play a major role in the waterside industry, but current restrictive work practices must be eliminated. Multi-skilling should be introduced. To enhance the chances of proper competition, we must tackle the monopoly power of the Waterside Workers Federation. Like so many monopolies, the Waterside Workers Federation has enjoyed immense power and privilege but has done nothing but abuse it, to the eventual cost of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> One final comment that I make in relation to the waterfront concerns the implementation authority, which I note was not addressed in any great detail in tonight's statement. I take this occasion to say that the members of it must be totally independent of the interests involved in the industry and must have a background which will ensure a proper appreciation of the need to improve efficiency and productivity. We have offered the Government its support for genuine reform of the waterfront. We have stated that we will assist in the passage of any necessary legislation, including appropriations. We will also commit a future coalition government to continue implementation of a genuine plan of waterfront reform. This will provide a climate of predictability and certainty for those involved in the industry, including users. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not taken up our bipartisan offer, an offer that would have taken the political heat out of any tough decisions that the Government was going to announce in its statement tonight. It was an offer ignored, an opportunity lost. The Government has failed its own test. Once again it has been bullied by the unions and the left wing. This inquiry, like the 12 others that have gone before it, will end up producing no net gains in productivity on our waterfront. Australia has missed a golden opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the other part of tonight's statement, the part that deals with coastal shipping. This has aroused a great deal of debate over the past few days. The press and industry expectations were that the Government would walk away from genuine reform on coastal shipping-and guess what? It did. I am afraid to say that only a few days ago in this House my colleague, now National Party leader, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) said in a matter of public importance debate that the comments of Mr Ross Gittins, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, claiming that the Minister for Transport and Communications was the Minister for wimpishness, were too harsh and pre-judged the matter. I do not often disagree with the Leader of the National Party, but I am afraid the honourable member for Richmond was wrong and Mr Gittins was right. On the matter of coastal shipping, the Minister has been most wimpish. Why? Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is to look at the comments of Michelle Grattan, a journalist with the Age newspaper, in an article that she wrote 12 months ago. She set the test by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Coastal shipping is the test for Mr Willis. He either delivers on this or he acknowledges that the Government has no commitment to genuine reform. </PARA>
<PARA>By that test, the Minister has failed the reformist's test. Indeed, his performance tonight would qualify the Minister only for the `carry-on regardless' brigade. I am quite sure that the Minister would have fitted in very well as the gentleman conducting the orchestra on board the Titanic as it sank. He will carry on regardless despite the economy sinking. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Minister's statement a failure to deliver reform? Simply, it does not address several key issues. One of those key issues is that of cabotage, and the other is that it does not adequately deal with company employment. First, in relation to cabotage, I refer to what the Prime Minister said but a few short months ago:</PARA>
<PARA> I can think of no reasonable argument why employers and unions in our manufacturing and export sectors must adjust to international trading conditions while stevedoring and shipping remain shielded-efficient coastal shipping is vital. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister said-`efficient coastal shipping is vital'. The Business Council of Australia said after its review of coastal shipping:</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of competition from foreign flag vessels is a fundamental element of any plan to encourage and maintain a competitive Australian industry and must be supported with removal of cost impediments unique to Australian shipping. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Bulk Commodities Group wrote recently expressing its view:</PARA>
<PARA> Competition on the coast is essential to provide the ongoing market stimulus to improve efficiency and to ensure that the benefits of reform are passed on to shippers. </PARA>
<PARA>What cabotage does is protect Australia's shipping industries from competition from foreign vessels. Cabotage is one of those issues which has not been properly addressed in this evening's statement by the Minister. Because of it we have seen a tremendous increase in costs to Australian shipping industries. The Industries Assistance Commission estimated that Australia's shipping costs are as much as 50 per cent higher than they should be. It estimated that the losses to our economy are between $250m and $550m per annum. Putting that loss into context, every Australian pays for this through higher prices, lower economic growth, a weaker balance of payments, lower job growth, lower standards of living, higher interest rates, and an increasing foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> One can find a number of examples that highlight the additional costs to Australian industry as a consequence of maintaining cabotage over the years. For example, it is cheaper to ship skimmed milk from Tasmania to Taiwan at $72 a tonne than from Tasmania to Melbourne at $82 a tonne. Newsprint from a major European port to London was less than $50 a tonne compared with almost double that amount to ship it the same distance from Hobart to Sydney. Coal is cheaper to transport from South Africa to Tasmania than it is from Tasmania to Port Kembla. Of course, all these things lead to the loss of vital income. For example, Australia has a very efficient salt producing industry, but we cannot compete with the salt market of the Pacific because it is cheaper to ship salt from Mexico than from around the coast of Australia. The need for proper reform is obvious, indeed, vital. Cabotage is one of those issues which has not been properly addressed. Trans-Tasman shipping is another that has not been properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Minister indicated in his speech tonight that discussions would be held between this Government and the New Zealand Government to see what can be done. I am afraid to say that that means that the Government will let this issue fade away into obscurity. It must be remembered how important this issue is. Trans-Tasman shipping is not an official agreement between the governments of Australia and New Zealand-there is nothing written which makes the present arrangements stick. All it is, is a situation that exists as a consequence of union control over our waterfronts and shipping services. Recently, Australia lost some important sales of wheat to New Zealand. Why did we lose them? The Turkish Government was able to provide those wheat sales at a cheaper price than Australia. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) pointed out, it was our high shipping costs that stopped the sale of wheat from Australia to New Zealand and forced New Zealand to go to Turkey in order to get its wheat cheaper. One of the reasons why we are so disappointed is that this statement tonight does not address the problems involved with trans-Tasman shipping; it leaves them to another day, a day that will never come. </PARA>
<PARA> One other very important issue is that of direct company employment. The Deveson report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The question of company employment be left on the long term agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what the report is saying is, `Let's hide it in the too hard basket, especially as we have an election coming up some time soon'. The industry realises that direct company employment should commence immediately. For the Government just to accept the shipping reform task force's paper is not good enough. I must admit that the odds were stacked against the shipping reform task force bringing out any positive statements when one looks at the people who made it up. As Ross Gittins has said of its recommendations:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Government wants to squib on coastal shipping all it has to do is accept the report of the Shipping Reform Taskforce. It surfaced last week and it's a dud. </PARA>
<PARA>Ross Gittins goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The report shows a willingness to continue changing at a snail's pace, provided the taxpayers subsidise the change and provided the benefits of change stay in the industry and aren't passed on to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's claims that it will bring down manning levels are not in keeping with what the rest of the world is doing. The Minister highlighted some changes to be made to manning levels on board our coastal shipping services. I would like to point out that because of the leave arrangements that Australian crews have-it requires about 2.2 crews to keep a ship at sea throughout the year compared with other countries which require fewer crew members to keep their ships at sea-Australia will not be within a bull's roar of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries when it comes to manning levels on board ships. I understand that we will be going from 46 to 37 crew members, which is what it takes to man a ship all year round in Australia, compared with European shipping services which require about 22 people in order to keep their ships at sea. Australia is a long way behind the OECD countries when it comes to manning levels for our Australian coastal shipping services. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, our costs will be higher. Our position on coastal shipping is now well known. It was only a month or so ago that the honourable member for Richmond, who is now the Leader of the National Party of Australia, introduced into this place, and published for all to see, our position on coastal shipping. We have said that we will tackle the whole issue of introducing foreign competition to our coastal shipping industry. We will tackle direct company employment. We will do it over a five-year period. We will provide visible protection for the shipping industry to ensure that it has a fair go. Indeed, the point has been made by a number of people within the industry over the last few days with whom I have been in contact that it would be better, in order to bring out the real cost of protecting the Australian coastal shipping services, to have a tariff of around 10 or 15 per cent so that people of Australia can see exactly what it costs in order to protect our coastal shipping services. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in his comments tonight the Minister talked about extending the current licensing arrangements for foreign shipping services. I have had the point made to me already today that the extension of that system is just an extension of something that has not worked properly in the past; an extension of something that has been a failure. Why do we do it? Why do we wait three years before a pricing element can be brought into the cost of coastal shipping services? Why do we have to wait that time? These are good questions that the Minister has not answered in his statement tonight. If we did bring a pricing element into our coastal shipping services today, the cost of it would be there for all to see. International competition would bear down on the cost of our coastal shipping services. As a result we would have cheaper shipping services along the coastline of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, our policy in our coastal shipping position paper will bring down the cost of shipping and transport throughout Australia. The Industries Assistance Commission has estimated that through transport deregulation alone savings of some $3.2 billion will be available to the Australian economy each year. There could be an extra $6 billion to the gross domestic product as a consequence. Indeed, $1.1 billion of that growth could be made available from the waterfront and coastal shipping industries if they are properly reformed. As Anne Davies writes in the Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA>For the Government it is a balancing act. But if it decides to retain cabotage then marketing the decision as a reform is going to be difficult. </PARA>
<PARA>Because of the Government's refusal to address properly the issue of cabotage in its statement tonight I am afraid to say that, according to the tests which it has applied and, indeed, according to the tests of media commentators over the last few months, it has failed in its desire to properly and adequately reform the coastal shipping services. It has failed its own tests, it has failed the people of Australia and, as a consequence, it has failed every single Australian who is looking for a rejuvenation of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a couple of points in my concluding remarks. If the Government were to adequately carry out transport reform it would provide a stimulus to the Australian economy that would be bigger than if we abolished all tariffs and quotas-that is, if this Government had the courage to implement adequate reform in our transport industries. I might also say that during the last few weeks we have seen the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy beating his chest in this House and saying how tough he is in the way in which he has deregulated the Australian wheat industry. That is not tough. The Australian Labor Party has no friends in the wheat industry in Australia, but it has many friends in the waterfront industry and many friends in the coastal shipping services of Australia, and when it comes to properly reforming those industries this Government is a wimp. This Government will back down. It has backed down on this particular occasion and, as a consequence, the Australian economy will not get any better; it will continue to have an inefficient and wasteful waterfront and it will continue to have inefficient and wasteful coastal shipping services. I am afraid that today we have seen the wheels fall off the cart of the micro-economic reform that this Government has been trying to push around this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-My portfolio contains 10 major government business enterprises (GBE) operated by the Commonwealth. They are Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines Ltd, Australian National Line (ANL), Australian National Railways Commission, Telecom Australia, Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), Aussat, Australia Post, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). These latter two enterprises were established last year to radically restructure safety regulation, the provision of aviation services and related infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the past six years the Government has systematically worked to put the operations of its transport and communications enterprises on a sounder financial footing and to make them more efficient, more flexible and more businesslike. We have given that task a high priority because of the strategic importance of the GBE in the Australian economy. It is not a task that we have only recently started. Throughout the Government's three terms we have focused on micro-economic reform, including deregulating the financial system, reducing levels of protection and reshaping the GBE. In our third term we have given greater prominence to micro-economic reform and accelerated reform of the GBE. </PARA>
<PARA> The eight GBE-excluding the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation-are important in their own right. They account for over 9 per cent of total public sector employment. They take up more than 15 per cent of all government investment-which comes to more than two-thirds of the investment by the Commonwealth Government. Their revenues equal 19.7 per cent of Commonwealth Government revenues, and their expenditure is equal to 18.7 per cent of Commonwealth spending. Their assets are worth over $22 billion and government investment in the enterprises, through loans and equity, amounted to in excess of $8 billion as at June 1988. Moreover, the GBE are of strategic importance to every other sector of the economy. They are an essential part of the economic infrastructure on which efficiency gains and export efforts in other sectors of the economy depend. Reforming the GBE is integral to our micro-economic reform agenda because those reforms have a multiplier effect on productivity and competitiveness throughout the economy. They help to determine the speed and efficiency with which goods and services can be exchanged, markets can be developed, trade can be expanded, information can be processed and decisions can be made in every industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Streamlining the GBE</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> We have progressively modernised and streamlined the GBE. The work on reforming the GBE started early in the life of the Government with essential capital injections for the government airlines, Qantas and Australian Airlines, and for Australian National Line. The ministerial statement on guidelines on government statutory authorities and GBE operations of November 1987 placed the reforms in a comprehensive policy framework. This framework was further consolidated in another ministerial statement of May 1988 on re-shaping the transport and communications GBE. These reforms are now being implemented on a number of fronts, including exhaustive overhauling of legislation, new regulatory arrangements, revaluation of assets, calculation of community service obligations, the preparation of detailed corporate plans and the setting of financial targets for all GBE. The Government has now put in place coherent and comprehensive change to the GBE. The changes are coherent because they are all aimed at making the GBE more enterprising and more businesslike. They are comprehensive because they affect every aspect of the GBE structures and functions. This statement explains more specifically what these changes to our GBE are designed to achieve and reports on the benefits which are now flowing to the economy and to the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA>Objectives</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> All the changes to the GBE are designed to serve the same critical objectives. These objectives are:</PARA>
<PARA>To enable the GBE to perform more efficiently and effectively, on a commercial basis, in an increasingly competitive environment;</PARA>
<PARA>to make the GBE more financially viable, so that their demands on the Budget are reduced and they have a secure financial base from which to expand and diversify their operations;</PARA>
<PARA>to focus the Government's involvement in the operations of the GBE on their strategic direction and financial accountability-put simply, to shift the emphasis from inputs to outputs; and</PARA>
<PARA>to ensure the GBE provide substantial and growing benefits to the community, including through a strong emphasis on quality and service, fulfilling the designated community service obligations, where appropriate, and prices that have been constrained in various ways. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not imposed change according to some ideological bureaucratic blueprint. In each GBE, the reforms made have been specifically adapted to the particular service the enterprise is providing, the market it caters for, the competition it faces, the assets it holds, the investments it has made, and the returns it has been able to deliver. The changes have been pragmatic and flexible. We have taken pains to make sure that in each case we have adopted the most effective approach to achieve reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of reform is not yet complete but the policy framework we have established will ensure that the GBE will always remain responsive to the need for change. But our achievements have already been substantial and thorough. They are achievements on which all sectors in the Australian economy can build in the years ahead. Those changes will facilitate and accelerate the structural adjustment on which our future competitiveness-which means, among other things, our ability to create jobs and to maintain our standard of living-will depend. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Base</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The GBE are now financially viable and have a solid base for future growth. When we came to office, Australian Airlines, Qantas and the Australian National Line were grossly undercapitalised. They had been starved of equity capital and their scope for future development was severely restricted. At the outset we took decisive action to provide the injection of equity so badly needed, which allowed the airlines to take advantage of the tourist boom and the massive growth in air traffic which came with it. In 1983, Australian Airlines had a paid up capital of only $40m and $25m of that had been injected only in the very last days of the Fraser Government. The Airline's debt to equity ratio was over 90:10, which imposed a severe burden of high interest payments at a time of declining business in the airline industry. In the two years 1981-83, Australian Airlines's losses amounted to more than three-quarters of what had been its paid up capital. This situation was completely untenable, and was immediately addressed by the Hawke Government through an equity injection of $90m in our first Budget. That made the Airline financially viable and put it on a competitive basis. It has not looked back. </PARA>
<PARA> Profits earned by Australian Airlines since 1945 when it was established from all sources amount to $176m. Eighty per cent of this amount, $143m, has been earned since 1983. Since 1945 its dividends to the Commonwealth have amounted to $66m of which $28m has been paid in the last two years. In 1987-88, Australian Airlines earned $1.1 billion in revenue for an operating profit of $66.6m before tax. After tax, and extraordinary items, that amounted to a return on equity of 21.5 per cent. The Airline has been able to expand and diversify its operations, and to improve the quality of its service. None of that could have been done without the Government's early financial support. </PARA>
<PARA> The improvement in the performance of Qantas is also striking. The Hawke Government has provided Qantas with an injection of $60m in capital, more than two-thirds the amount that had been provided in all the previous 37 years in which the Airline had been operating in government hands. Since 1947, when the Commonwealth acquired all of the shares of Qantas, the company has earned profits from all sources amounting to $564m, of which a staggering $485m, or 86 per cent, has been earned since the Hawke Government come to office in 1983. A similar picture applies to dividends. Since 1947 the company has declared dividends amounting to a total of $137m, with $92m out of this amount being paid since 1983. In the 15 month period ending 30 June 1988, Qantas earned revenue of $3.9 billion, for an operating profit of $272m before tax and an 11.6 per cent rate of return on assets. Obviously these indicators of Qantas's performance within the environment created by the Hawke Government are quite spectacular. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the government-owned railway, Australian National, government reform has again resulted in a significant improvement in performance. In our term of office, Australian National's call on the Budget for funds has been cut by 63 per cent in real terms. In 1987-88, for the first time, Australian National recorded a small operating surplus on its commercial freight operations. We have gone further than any State government in giving our railway a commercial charter and its performance in the past few years has been unmatched by any other publicly owned rail system in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar picture emerges with the Australian National Line, where we inherited an enterprise which was effectively bankrupt. ANL, in 1983, was a debt ridden, heavily subsidised loss maker, without any clear functions or direction. It is not that now. We increased ANL's equity base by $160.5m, to correct its undercapitalisation and high gearing. It has since implemented a rationalisation program which has involved hard decisions about the sale of some ships and termination of some services, and its performance has improved significantly. ANL has recorded a profit in each of the past four years and, in the next few weeks, it will be bringing forward a corporate plan designed to enable it to trade effectively in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> For the legislated monopolies, Telecom Australia, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), Aussat Pty Ltd and Australia Post, profitability is not by itself an appropriate measure of performance. Other factors, such as service performance standards, real decreases in prices and levels of capital investment, are important performance indicators. Taking all these measures together, the GBE are performing well by international comparisons. To enable better measurement of financial performance in the future, we are vesting, for the first time, a proper capital structure in Telecom and Australia Post. Also our complementary telecommunications policy reforms contain mechanisms for monitoring many of the non-financial performance measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Corporate Structures</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The communications GBE have been given the commercial structure necessary for them to deal with the challenges of increased competition, continuing technological change, and new demands and opportunities in the marketplace. Telecom and Australia Post have been converted from commissions into statutory corporations. Each has been restructured along modern lines, and established with a board of directors. Aussat has been given scope for expanding and diversifying its activities. OTC was transformed into a public company in April 1989 and now trades as OTC Ltd with a better capital structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Airlines was set up as an incorporated company in April 1988. Australian National's Act was further modernised to give greater emphasis to the commission's commercial charter. ANL will be converted into a public company in July of this year. It was unnecessary to change the incorporated company status of Qantas Airways Ltd, as it already suited its commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Strategic Direction</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government's involvement in the operations of its GBE is now largely confined to two basic strategic management controls-the discipline and accountability of a forward looking corporate plan, and of an agreed financial target. Corporate plans set strategic directions for the enterprises. They establish the business priorities that enterprises will use each day in guiding their decisions. They provide the Government and the enterprises with a clear sense of direction and a clear awareness of their common purpose and shared interests. </PARA>
<PARA> This has created a context for more innovative and creative commercial decisions. It is reflected, for example, in Qantas's acquisition of a minority share in Air New Zealand, in Telecom and OTC's successful bids for international contracts, in Telecom's initiatives in value added services in the telecommunications field, in Australia Post's work on electronic mail transmission, and in Australian National's continued exploration of opportunities for increased efficiency in inter-system railway operations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the community's assets are used in the most effective way by the GBEs. The setting of financial targets gives a basis for measuring their performance. The targets can include the rate of return on assets or shareholder funds, lump sum aggregates or profitability measures related to turnover. In making these assessments, we are taking into account past earnings, industry competition, the opportunity cost of capital, the cost of meeting community service obligations and the performance of similar private sector companies. No single indicator has been arbitrarily imposed on all the GBE. </PARA>
<PARA> A prerequisite for setting financial targets has been the revaluation of GBE assets. That task will be completed by 1 July, with the exception of Australian National, the assets of which will be revalued over a five-year period. We have also had to assess the financial value of community service obligations. In Telecom's case, that task is being undertaken by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics under my portfolio in cooperation with the enterprise, and is now near completion. </PARA>
<PARA> In all cases, decisions on the financial target are a matter for extensive discussion between the Government and the enterprise. The targets are being set at a level which will oblige the enterprise to improve its performance and, in doing so, to ensure that the Australian people receive full value for the money they have invested in the GBE. We will have an interest in making sure that these enterprises use their great resources as efficiently as possible, and that taxpayers-like shareholders in any business-obtain a proper return on their investment. </PARA>
<PARA>Loosening Other Controls</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has removed a large number of day-to-day controls on the GBE. Most of those had outlived their usefulness and inhibited the taking of commercial decisions. The controls, which covered such matters as opening bank accounts, letting contracts, major purchases and construction programs, are now a thing of the past. At the same time the Government is loosening up a number of strategic controls. The enterprises have recently been given greater autonomy and independent responsibility in managing their industrial relations arrangements. Most of them have also advertised for, and appointed, chief executives under new terms and conditions which include new employment arrangements involving the abolition of tenure and more market related remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet in this regard it should be noted that the extent to which remaining strategic controls can be relaxed must take account of the macro-economic context in which we are operating. The interaction between macro-economic settings and micro-economic reform will continue to affect the timing and scope of further changes to government controls. </PARA>
<PARA>Community Service Obligations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> For the GBE, as for all other businesses, profits and return on assets are critical indices of performances. But they are not the only indices we use in assessing the performance of Telecom and Australia Post, which perform important community service obligations (CSO). A CSO is a service that the enterprise is obliged to perform in the interests of the entire community, in circumstances where an enterprise acting solely commercially would not provide the service. Hence we have ensured that all Australians can have access to the high quality telephone service we have built up. Likewise, we have guaranteed that standard letters will continue to be carried at a uniform tariff within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will retain control over the CSO through the ministerial power to direct variations to the strategies and policies to be followed by Telecom and Australia Post in carrying out their CSO. We have defined these obligations more clearly through new legislation. Provision has also been made for the corporate plans of Telecom and Australia Post to include the strategies and policies they intend to pursue to fulfil those CSO. In addition, their annual reports will include an outline of these strategies and policies. We are breaking new ground in measuring the extent of the CSO. The GBE will be required to give an account of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecommunications Efficiency Gains</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> All members of the community will benefit from the greater efficiency of our GBE, in the ways already specified and through lower prices. Telecom has recently implemented a $100m per annum cut in subscriber trunk dialling rates, and OTC has also announced a $50m annual reduction in tariffs. A three-minute phone call between Brisbane and Perth now costs only 55 per cent of what it cost when the Government came to office. Increases in standard postal charges have been kept well below the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of telecommunications services, we are now going further to ensure that efficiency gains flow through to every consumer of the service provided. That has meant determining new price control mechanisms. As a result, we will be applying price cap regulation as well as setting target rates of return for two of our telecommunications carriers and infrastructure providers, Telecom and OTC. Our aim has been to combine the price gap and the rate of return targets so that the carriers are pushed to achieve further gains in efficiency in delivery of services. Consumers will gain directly, and the whole economy will gain indirectly, from real price reductions for a basket of standard services and improvements in service efficiency generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The price gap will operate for three years from 1 July. After examining available productivity gains, and the various factors which influence the rate of return targets for the carriers-Telecom and OTC-we have set the formula for that period at consumer price index minus 4 per cent. The price control arrangements also include ways of ensuring that proposed price increases for specified non-standard services will be subject to scrutiny by Austel, our new independent regulator. At the end of this statement I will be seeking leave to table a detailed account of the price control arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Our formula means that, overall, consumers of the standard telecommunications services are guaranteed to benefit from substantial real price reductions in each of the next three years. Efficiency gains will enable the carriers to meet the financial targets which have been set. The 4 per cent figure may be increased in subsequent years to take account of a different mix of rate of return requirements, increases in available productivity gains and greater efficiencies resulting from technological change. </PARA>
<PARA> We are making major complementary changes to the regulatory arrangements in telecommunications. More market segments are being liberalised. For example, customer equipment and value added telecommunications services are open to full competition. The activities reserved to the carriers-Telecom, OTC and Aussat-are more clearly defined in legislation. Telecom will no longer be the industry regulator as Austel will take over this task. Under legislation currently before the Parliament, Austel will be charged with a number of functions including protection of carrier responsibilities, protection of competitors from unfair practices of carriers, protection of consumers from unfair practices, promotion of efficiency of carriers and technical regulation of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Reforming the GBE would achieve only limited results if it were not synchronised with other micro-economic reforms. I have referred already to our thorough-going review of the telecommunications policy framework. A package of reforms on the waterfront and coastal shipping is the subject of a separate statement which I have already made today. Those policy steps complement other moves already taken in the transport and communications portfolio including the termination of the two airlines policy; liberalised liner shipping arrangements; the new national arterial roads category of the Australian centennial road development program focusing on roads of economic significance; steps towards nationally uniform weight and speed limits for interstate road vehicles; and liberalisation of international passenger and freight charter flights. In addition, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation will soon be subject to the same GBE reform process as other enterprises in the portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Our approach has been flexible and pragmatic. We have deliberately chosen the best way, which means the most effective and equitable way, to set the GBE up to do their business. Our approach is, therefore, quite different from that of the Opposition which, during its terms in office, did virtually nothing to reform, or even to maintain, the GBE. They were content to let these enterprises operate in an unbusinesslike way, producing minimum returns on capital and insufficient levels of customer service. As for the future, the Opposition has nothing to offer except a doctrinaire, ideological commitment to privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have placed the GBE at the cutting edge of micro-economic reform. We have pursued reform of the GBE in the firm conviction that the upgrading and reshaping of our public enterprises will greatly assist Australia to become more efficient and more competitive in world markets. We are demonstrating that government enterprises can be efficient, even dynamic, and can compete strongly with the private sector. I commend the GBE reforms to the House. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the sun sets on the Thirty-fifth Parliament, first session, fourth period, and as the sun sets on this Federal Government, finally the Government has produced two statements on micro-economic reform. There was one earlier this afternoon, essentially on shipping, and tonight the statement by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) on the implementation of government business enterprises (GBE) reports, reforms and telecommunications pricing. It is a privilege to respond to the statement on behalf of the coalition and, in particular, on behalf of the shadow Minister for business and consumer affairs, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Richard Alston, and my colleagues the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In so doing I have to say that this Government has really produced minuscule micro-economic reform. As the honourable member for Gilmore said this afternoon, the micro-economic reform bandwagon has derailed and come to a dead halt. In respect of the statement the Minister has tendered to the House on this occasion, to a large extent it has broken no new ground except on the capping of Telecom Australia pricing policy-I acknowledge that that is new ground-and expanding the powers of Austel. As I track through, as I will shortly, the large number of other government business enterprises referred to by the Minister, we will see that there is nothing new. There are just three in-principle directions for those GBE. Essentially there is nothing new. Above all, there is nothing new with regard to the ownership and staff access to the ownership and with regard to the capitalisation arrangements as they stand at this moment, notwithstanding the fact-again I acknowledge it-that this Government has certainly increased capitalisation for a large number of the GBE covered by this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Micro-economic reform, particularly with regard to the transport sector, is absolutely essential if our economy is to survive in the next decade. This nation faces in the 1990s the most competitive decade it has probably ever seen throughout this century as a consequence of the formation of large trading blocs around the world. As we now know so well, from 1992 we will have fortress Europe. We will have the giant market of the European Economic Community and the synchronised energy which will flow from that as the EEC trades as a colossus and strides the world as a trading colossus-which may yet be to our detriment. That remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly it means that we must become more competitive if we are to survive against the colossus of fortress Europe post-1992. Across the Atlantic we have the growing links formed between the United States of America and Canada. An historic election in Canada saw the people there vote for a free trade situation and vote for that trading bloc formation between the United States and Canada. Australia in the 1990s, right down the other end of the world, faces this huge colossus in Europe and an equally large colossus in the United States and Canada. If that is not enough of an incentive to get our transport efficiencies in order, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> In my Australia Day message to my electorate earlier this year I emphasised that time was fast running out to rectify our transport infrastructure inadequacies be they in relation to road, rail or air. The Minister's statement tonight addresses in oblique ways the structure of our transport infrastructure, particularly with regard to government business enterprises. In responding for the coalition to the Minister's micro-economic reform statement, let me say that statement falls far short of what is required as we approach the decade of the 1990s, the fierce competition of the 1990s and the need to maximise the efficiency of every mode of transport if we are to survive economically and produce the exports required. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of considering the statement, I think it is desirable to examine some previous statements made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). On 23 May 1988 the Treasurer made a statement in relation to privatisation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . basically, I don't think the Government ought to be running airlines and that's why I think their equity ought to be sold down. We can't afford to continue providing subventions for their capital base. </PARA>
<PARA>. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Now with scarce Cabinet Room budgetary dollars, we can't be putting billions into Qantas and Australian Airlines and the like. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of the Treasurer; the words pointing in the direction of privatisation. This was the micro-economic reform package which was meant to be delivered in those comments by the Treasurer, and which clearly has not been so delivered. The Prime Minister's comments were reported in the Age on 29 February 1988 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke said public assets had to be considered case by case. He reaffirmed his opposition to the sale of Telecom and Australia Post, but added: `I do believe that it is reasonable to ask does it make sense to tie up public resources in, for instance, running an airline. I have a prima facie view that it doesn't.'</PARA>
<PARA>It was the Prime Minister making that statement. The Government, in its statement here tonight, has walked away from those comments by the Prime Minister. It is not hard to find out why. If we pick up the Melbourne Herald of 30 May 1989 we see the headline, `Victoria ALP blow to PM on Qantas'. The Minister may well smile. It is nice to see him smiling in the twilight hours of the Thirty-fifth Parliament, first session, fourth period. He might well smile, because his own segment of the Australian Labor Party has dumped on him and on the Government with regard to the privatisation of the airlines. The Victorian ALP has produced a 60-page report which it paid some $6,000 to two academics at Flinders University in Adelaide to produce. The report argues chapter and verse that Qantas and Australian Airlines must remain publicly owned, preferably as one public-owned airline, with a single superannuation scheme covering both organisations, and rejects completely the case for really reforming government business enterprises by privatising our airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> We know why the Government has failed in terms of its priorities with regard to the airlines. It is because the Victorian ALP is meeting tomorrow to adopt this report and lock it in at the national level. I am pleased that another luminary of the Victorian ALP, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), has arrived at the table. He is also smiling in this twilight hour of the Thirty-fifth Parliament, first session, fourth period. The tragedy is that the nation will pay a price for this lack of progress with regard to the Government's policy vacuum on the onward operation of Qantas and Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Well one might ask: What is the policy of the coalition? On this occasion, I am proud to say, it is in black and white and blue. It is a published document and I have a copy of it right here. It addresses each and every one of the government business enterprises dealt with by the Minister in his statement, which the honourable member for Ryan quite accurately described as something of a fizzer. The coalition is not going to muck around with the future of Qantas and the other airlines. With regard to Qantas, our policy is 100 per cent privatisation. Why not let the staff of Qantas have some shares in its operation? Why not give them some basis for incentive in the 1980s and 1990s by being part-owners of their airline? Surely that would appeal even to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on a Sunday morning. Why not give Qantas, the nation's overseas airline, the charter to leap into the twenty-first century by giving it clear-cut private ownership and the right to go out and raise capital, unrestricted by the Loan Council and the Premiers Conference-which, incidentally, dealt Qantas another body blow just a fortnight ago? This is not a laughing matter, because Qantas has suffered more than most from the restriction of being owned by the Government instead of private shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened to the Qantas mechanical and engineering base at Mascot. Its productivity has collapsed. We face the acute embarrassment of seeing Qantas in 1989 having to ferry its jumbo jets around the world empty, to Amsterdam, Dublin and elsewhere, to have them serviced because this Government has not set Qantas up on a basis which enables it to maintain its engineering base. When the coalition was in power, so successful was the Qantas engineering base and so proud were its staff that aircraft came from Asia to be serviced there. Aircraft came from the north-east corridor of the United States to be serviced by Qantas. That is not the case today, six years later. </PARA>
<PARA> Last weekend a Qantas crew was flown from Sydney to Melbourne, first class, as crew members perhaps deserve to travel. The same crew was flown from Melbourne to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles the crew members got off their jumbo and utilised the facilities that were quite properly made available for them. Then they picked up an empty Qantas jumbo, with less than 20 people on board-because Qantas cannot carry passengers on a route for which it does not hold a licence-and became perhaps the first ever crew to fly in a jumbo direct from Los Angeles across the Hudson Bay near the North Pole, across Iceland to Amsterdam. There was not a paying passenger on board that jumbo. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did that happen? It was because Qantas no longer has the capacity to maintain its own jumbos, due to the restrictions placed on it by government ownership. That jumbo was positioned in Amsterdam for maintenance, as that was the only way it could be done. What a disgrace that we have reached the stage where last weekend that crew had to fly on that empty jumbo at great expense-it was no doubt an exciting route for the crew involved-from Los Angeles to Amsterdam because Qantas can no longer provide the capability to service its own aircraft at its base in Sydney. The Government cannot be proud of its progress on micro-economic reform in relation to Qantas. The Opposition's policy is clear cut: 100 per cent private ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking across the seas to British Airways we see the tremendous success of privatisation in terms of productivity. Likewise with Australian Airlines, the coalition has a clear-cut policy of 100 per cent privatisation. Likewise with the Australian National Line: 100 per cent privatisation; no equivocation. The Australian National Railways Commission clearly would need to be reviewed in government. I welcome the great strides that have been made with revamping Australian National and I give credit to the Government for part of that package. It has previously made a profit. The Minister indicated in his statement that Australian National has not previously made a profit, but it made profits for several consecutive years when it first went to diesel from steam. That was back in the Menzies-McEwen period of government. Australian National has a big role to play in the future because rail-mark my words-has a very big role to play in the future right around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to Telecom Australia and Australia Post. The Government and the coalition are as one in terms of their ownership. For the Overseas Telecommunications Commission the Opposition has a strong policy of privatising 49 per cent. Likewise with the Federal Airports Corporation, we would sell the terminals. Our policy is laid out very clearly in Privatisation, The Australian Way, the position paper released by the shadow Minister on behalf of the coalition. The bonus in this document-people can write to the honourable member for Ryan for a copy of it-is the graph which shows the profit performance of privatised companies, essentially in the United Kingdom with its move to privatisation. Pre-privatisation most of them were on just a break-even or a narrow loss. Post-privatisation the graph clearly shows-even though the shortest line between two points might be a circle of infinite radius-that there is a huge uplift in the profits of companies such as British Cable and Wireless, the National Freight Consortium, British Aerospace, British Telecom, British Airways and even Rolls Royce. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that the Government has botched its approach to micro-economic reform in dealing with these eight key government business enterprises. It has stopped short of making the one decision which would provide the basis for a leapfrog into the twenty-first century, for an expansion of capital, for a boost to productivity, by altering the very ownership of these government business enterprises. The reason is that members of this Government are the ones who are tied to party policy and ideology. They are the ones who are locked into Victorian Australian Labor Party committee reports which block progress down the privatisation path. The tragedy is that the nation has to pay the price of the Government's lack of progress in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. No-one, because if people are not given the opportunity to buy them they cannot buy them. But experience around the world has shown that, if we put Qantas on the market and we offer it on reasonable terms to the staff of Qantas for starters, we will find an extraordinary take-up rate. We will find smiles on the faces of the flight attendants and the administrative staff in Sydney and elsewhere because they would be part-owners of the company that they work for. They are injecting the extra effort into their daily labours because they are being given that basic incentive. There will be a leap in productivity and profit as a consequence of that change in ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, essentially the statement does not break new ground with regard to the eight big government business enterprises, but it breaks new ground in relation to Telecom, to Telecom pricing and the capping of Telecom price controls. I know that the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) has pursued this policy area with a great deal of interest. So we are to have a formula applied to Telecom's pricing policies of the consumer price index minus X. For the first year the Government has declared that X will be 4 per cent. So it will be 6.9 per cent minus 4 per cent which, even on my mathematics, equals a cost increase for the subscribers to Telecom of 2.9 per cent. Honourable members might think that that is reasonable. But is it, when we consider that Telecom had to pull almost every trick in the pack to get its profit figures below $1 billion for the last year covered by its annual financial report. Try getting a new service connected through Telecom, especially one which requires some additional effort and additional distance. Honourable members will soon find why Telecom makes that sort of profit. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have this twinning policy of the Government in relation to Telecom where, on the one hand, it will apply the rate of return regulation and, on the other hand, the price cap regulation. A colleague in the Senate, Senator Richard Alston, will have more to say about this new policy development, probably next week when the Senate deals in detail with this statement. Suffice to say at this stage that we are concerned about aspects of this capping policy. Whilst we are not opposed to the role of Austel, the Australian Telecommunications Authority, we will watch very closely the practical ramifications which flow from the capping policy in relation to the role of Telecom Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Related to this are the moves to further highlight the community service obligations of organisations such as Telecom Australia and other government business enterprises. Again, in one sense, that community service obligation ought to be shown clearly in the reports involved. In another sense, the Government should not take this opportunity to wind back on those parts of the community service obligations which are essential to providing a fair go in this country and essential to providing a fair go for the large, decentralised export industries located over much of inland Australia which face other burdens and pay additional taxes in the process, directly and indirectly, in providing exports. That fact should be taken into account in determining community service obligation policies in respect of government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we have seen a statement which is nothing more than a blinkered approach by the Government to micro-economic reform. It represents a sham and, in my ways, it represents a shambles. It locks out the staff of Qantas, of Australian Airlines and of these other organisations from any form of ownership which would be the driving force for a big boost to the productivity of our government business enterprises. In short, it is a policy which fails this nation as we enter one of the most competitive decades we will ever face as a nation, as the giant trading block form around the world. As such, this Government must be condemned for failing the test with its micro-economic reform package here tonight. It is a bitter disappointment for those who are looking for the blueprint which would drive these government business enterprises into the 1990s and into the twenty-first century and, at the same time, boost the export performance and help reduce the foreign debt. For these reasons I say to the House that the Government should think again. It should not give up the battle, particularly with regard to privatising Qantas and Australian Airlines before it is too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Patents Bill 1989 is a complete redraft of the Patents Act 1952, which it repeals and replaces. It has two main thrusts. First, it implements a number of policy changes flowing from an expert report reviewing the Australian patent system from an economic perspective. Second, it brings the language and structure of the Act down to earth, so that mere mortals without law degrees have some chance of understanding what it is all about, at least in general terms. </PARA>
<PARA> When the former Liberal Minister for Productivity, the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee), was faced some years ago with criticisms of that complex legal and economic policy instrument which is the Patents Act, he asked for expert advice from the Industrial Property Advisory Committee (IPAC). The Committee was then chaired by John Stonier, a patent and licensing expert from Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. The Committee wrangled over the issues for a few years. When its report Patents, Innovation and Competition in Australia came to me in 1984, it contained a brief statement by economics professor Don Lamberton, dissenting from the majority's findings on a number of central issues. Even Professor Lamberton, however, must have suffered some internal wrangling. With co-authors Tom Mandeville and Jean Bishop from the University of Queensland, he had prepared a separate report, commissioned by IPAC, Economic Effects of the Australian Patent System. The authors gathered and considered some important empirical data on the use of the patent system and tried to assess its effects on the Australian economy. They concluded that the economic costs of the patent system probably exceeded its benefits, but only after first acknowledging that the question was `ultimately a matter of judgment'. </PARA>
<PARA> I felt it would be unwise to act on a divided report without first calling for public comment on it. In the event, after considering a wide array of submissions, the Government accepted the bulk of the Committee's recommendations. I tabled the Government's response in the House on 28 November 1986. IPAC's report did not wholeheartedly embrace the patent system, but it by no means rejected it. Some view the system as some kind of mysterious sacrament which has to be observed if we are to proceed along the path to economic heaven. The Committee took a more pragmatic view. Faced with conflicting opinions on economic questions, IPAC recognised that it is imperative that Australia continue to operate a patent system and to participate in the international patent system. IPAC outlined its approach in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The policy approach to review and change should be to seek to optimise the net benefits arising from the operation of the patent system in the national interest to the extent possible consistent with international conventions, having regard to the particular circumstances of the Australian economy. We should seek to modify the Australian patent laws, adjusting the length, strength and breadth of patent rights so as to maximise the social benefits and to minimise the social costs to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> More specifically this implies seeking-</PARA>
<PARA>to gain increased benefits for Australians by fostering indigenous innovation, and utilising the international patent system in development export markets to improve Australia's international competitive position;</PARA>
<PARA>to reduce unnecessary social costs including those resulting from undesirable anti-competitive conduct involving patents; and</PARA>
<PARA>to improve the efficiency of the administration of the patent system with consequent reduction of direct costs. </PARA>
<PARA>It needs also to be recognised that the patent system is a blunt instrument of industrial policy and cannot easily be fine-tuned to take account of particular cases. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the most important and constructive measures recommended by IPAC was an adjustment of the standards of novelty and inventiveness required of standard patents. Under the present law, standard patents are tested for novelty only against prior disclosures in Australia. Under the Bill, they are to be tested against disclosures in documentary form anywhere in the world. This change will make it harder to get a 16-year standard patent, but it will bring the requirement into line with similar requirements in most of Australia's trading partner countries. The six-year pretty patent, which is designed more for use by smaller enterprises, will still be tested against the lower `domestic' prior art base. The Bill thus makes a sensible distinction between a patentee which is an export-oriented company, which will benefit from a degree of parity between Australia's patent laws and those of our trading partners, and a smaller company whose ambitions are more restricted to the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill comes at a time when Australian researchers are particularly anxious to obtain a return on their investment. Intellectual property issues are likely to be more important when funding is harder to come by, in both private industry and public institutions. There is increasing concern about technological competence and the need to make the use of new technology when it appears. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) in his former incarnation would have been very interested in this. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. There is a dilemma for the researcher, however, in balancing the need for protection, and the desire to obtain recognition at the earliest possible stage, against the fear of premature disclosure before commercialisation is realistically possible. Early publication can give other people the edge, but waiting too long can mean loss of intellectual property rights. The patent system does at least address this problem by providing for delayed publication for a period of up to 18 months from filing an application. There is a buffer zone built in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of international developments which inevitably place this Bill in a wider context. Honourable members will be aware that Australia is taking a leading role in a number of negotiations involved in the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). One of the most difficult of the subjects under negotiation-one in which Australia is actively participating-is on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property, TRIPS for short. These negotiations recognise the value of intellectual property as a traded commodity. Parallel negotiations are dealing likewise with trade in services, in agricultural commodities, and in a number of other areas. The newness to many GATT participants of the concepts of intellectual property, and of intellectual property as a commodity, seems to be making TRIPS the most difficult of the so-called new issues upon which negotiations are proceeding. Generally speaking, the developed countries are seeking greater universal recognition of these concepts. They are also seeking a set of rules under the GATT to facilitate trade in intellectual property on a fair and equitable basis and under agreed rules. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, within the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO)-the United Nations specialised agency responsible for intellectual property-there is a range of related negotiations. Most significant among these, so far as this Bill is concerned, are a proposal to develop a treaty providing for international harmonisation for patent law, and the protracted attempt to negotiate a revision of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Intellectual Property. The latter has been proceeding since the mid 1970s. This Bill, by strengthening Australia's patent law and by incorporating more universal standards within that law, will place Australia in a sounder position in relation to the negotiations in both GATT and WIPO. It is also relevant that many of Australia's near neighbours, particularly the rapidly expanding economies in East and South East Asia, have recently modernised their patent laws or are reviewing them. Until this Bill, Australia's Patents Act has been suffering from a series of amendments which have given rise to undue complexity. Our law is therefore somewhat out of kilter with other countries' more recent laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Patent law has also been included for discussion in the current round of closer economic relations negotiations with New Zealand. Once again, this new Bill, by simplifying the expression of Australia's law, should assist in clarifying Australia's position. It will be interesting to see whether New Zealand will contemplate taking similar action in relation to its law. Both Australian and New Zealand patent laws, of course, ultimately derive from English law as that once was, but they have diverged over time. The question now is whether that divergence has resulted in any impediments to fair and equitable trade across the Tasman. There are studies on foot to ascertain whether or not such impediments exist. Again, the simpler expression of patent law which this Bill embodies should assist consideration of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> One of IPAC's recommendations was `that the patents legislation be reviewed and completely redrafted to streamline procedures, particularly with a view to eliminating unnecessary steps and procedures, avoiding special categories, and establishing appropriate sanctions for non-compliance'. The Government accepted the recommendation, and announced that the Commissioner of Patents would invite the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia to participate in a working party to review the legislation, particularly with a view to relegating procedural matters to the regulations. That working party was formed and it met more than a dozen times. The Law Council and the Institute of Patent Attorneys each nominated two representatives. The Government is grateful to those organisations for their cooperation, and to the individuals concerned for giving their time and for their devotion to the job. As things turned out, the working party did not formally finalise the text of its draft report, although it had reached firm conclusions. Drafting of the Bill had been delayed while it waited its turn for priority in the Government's legislation program, so when a slot appeared in the drafting program, the working party's conclusions were fed immediately into the process in the form of an informal issues paper. While the Bill as a whole contains many things apart from the working party's conclusions, those conclusions have been incorporated so far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The drafting style in the Bill breaks some new ground. The definitions in the back are in the form of a dictionary in a schedule, reducing enormously the amount of sheer verbiage to be waded through before getting to the central concepts. And there is a flow chart, right up front, which sets out most of the typical steps involved in getting and maintaining a patent. It explains some difficult procedures in graphic form. This is the first legislation known to me anywhere with these particular features. I am very grateful to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Patents Office for the quality of their work. It is a splendid piece of drafting and a Bill that is notably easy to read. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do deserve congratulations. It is simply not possible, of course, to express most complex and detailed ideas in a few monosyllabic words. Grunts and snorts worked fined for cavemen-and they still have their uses-but the evolution of complex societies and complex ideas inevitably carries with it the use of some complex language. I have used some myself, on occasion. But language seems to have two simultaneous but contrary habits, and they are both evident in old Acts of Parliament. First, it tends to atrophy, so you find a plethora of archaic expressions. Second, and paradoxically, language seems to proliferate without cause at times. Too many words and over complicated expressions get used, with the result that the principle or idea behind them can get lost. Both these phenomena seem to have been propagated by the seminal pen nibs, if we can mix the metaphor, of the lawyers, in particular, with the result that the law can become inaccessible to the people it is trying to govern and to serve. I am delighted with the way this Bill attempts to counter the degenerative linguistic evolution of both kinds which has been characteristic of much legislative drafting in the past. No doubt there will be a need for some adjustments, but we are prepared to make them if they are needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Archaic words with hidden meanings are found even in the most central provisions in the present Act, which set out what rights are given by a patent. Present section 69 reads;</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to this Act, the effect of a patent is to grant to the patentee the exclusive right, by himself, his agents and licensees, during the term of the patent, to make, use, exercise and vend the invention in such manner as he thinks fit, so that he shall have and enjoy the whole profit and advantage accruing by reason of the invention during the term of the patent. </PARA>
<PARA>One will need expensive legal advice to find out what is meant by `exercising' an invention. Compare this with subclause 13 (1) in the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to this Act, a patent gives the patentee the exclusive rights, during the term of the patent, to exploit the invention and to authorise another person to exploit the invention. </PARA>
<PARA>The word `exploit' here bears a sensible, usual meaning. There are, of course, some inherent complexities, and the definition of `exploit' in the dictionary attempts to clear some of those up. One of the more excessive examples in the present Act of words for their own sake can be found in subsection 121 (1), which enables people to take legal action against someone who threatens patent infringement proceedings without justification:</PARA>
<PARA> Where a person, by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with an action or proceeding for infringement of a patent, or some other like proceeding, then, whether the person making the threats is or is not entitled to or interested in a patent, or is or is not interested in an application for a patent, a person aggrieved may bring an action against the first-mentioned person and may obtain a declaration to the effect that the threats are unjustifiable, and an injunction against the continuance of the threats, and may recover such damages (if any) as he has sustained, unless the first-mentioned person satisfies the court that the acts in respect of which the proceedings were threatened constitute, or, if done, would constitute-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an infringement of a patent in respect of a claim in the specification which is not shown by the plaintiff to be invalid;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an infringement of rights arising under section 54c in respect of a claim in a complete specification that is not shown to be a claim that would be invalid if a standard patent had been granted in respect of the complete specification; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) an infringement of rights arising under section 54d in respect of the claim of a petty patent specification that is not shown to be a claim that would be invalid if a petty patent had been granted in respect of the petty patent specification. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, it is not always a fair test to read complex language aloud. The words do, in fact, make sense. But that is not the proper test for whether they should be retained. Subclause 126 (1) of the Bill deals with the same subject matter, with the same results, using fewer words and a straightforward grammatical construction just by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Where a person, by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with infringement proceedings, or other similar proceedings, a person aggrieved may apply to a prescribed court, or to another court having jurisdiction to hear and determine the application, for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a declaration that the threats are unjustifiable; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an injunction against the continuance of the threats; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the recovery of any damages sustained by the applicant as a result of the threats. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a very good piece of drafting. The question the provision deals with is not exactly earth shattering, although it would matter a lot to a person affected by it. The revised wording still has a few alternatives built into it. But its meaning is transparent rather than obscure. Because the Bill will devolve many matters found in the present Act to the regulations, it will be necessary to redraft the patents regulations in their entirety. I expect that some patent attorneys and lawyers will feel apprehensive of an attempt to somehow pull the rug from under their feet. Well, that is not the case. The terms of reference for the working party encompass the patents regulations as well as the Act itself. I would hope that the working party will make as significant a contribution to the next stage of legislative reform in reviewing the regulations as it has to the first. Work has already started on the preparation of implementing regulations, and I intend to invite public comment on them before they commence, just as we are doing for the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> One of IPAC's recommendations related to patent term. The Government decided to abolish the present procedures for extending patent term, and to replace them with new, simpler, procedures enabling four-year extensions only for pharmaceuticals for human use. The latter decision was announced in September 1987 as part of a package of policies designed to encourage development of the pharmaceutical products industry in Australia. A Patents Amendment Bill to implement that particular matter was introduced last year and is presently awaiting consideration by the Senate. The Bill which I am presently introducing contains the same provisions as the Bill which is in the Senate. Should the other Bill be passed with further amendments, this Bill will need to be amended to take account of those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill represents the end of a lengthy process of consultation. I think that the word `lengthy' can be underlined. Members of the public were invited to make submissions to IPAC as it formulated its report, and to the Government in considering its response to the report. The members of IPAC itself were drawn from a cross-section of interests and view points. The working party on streamlining included representatives of the Law Council and the Institute of Patent Attorneys as well as the Patent Office. The operational areas of the Office have had the opportunity to make their contribution to streamlining the legislation they work under. Even though it meant that there had to be delays, I am sure that the consultation will be reflected in the quality and acceptability of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is not merely a redraft, since it implements the Government's policy as outlined in our response to IPAC's report. We recognise, however, that the Bill does represent a thorough overhaul of the Patents Act with all its complexities. By disposing of some of the archaic language, and relegating procedural matters to the regulations, we hope that the Bill will be more accessible to the non-expert. But it would be remarkable if a redraft of this magnitude were perfect, despite all the care which has gone into its preparation. Some bits of the baby might have accidentally gone out along with the bath water. I would therefore be grateful to have any comment on the way in which the Bill goes about implementing that policy. No doubt there will be some diehards who would prefer to keep all the bath water in the tub-to stick to obscure terminology because it is time-honoured and familiar to their expert gaze. Obscure language may even become meaningful with the benefit of the pronouncements of generations of judges in law cases. I hope, however, that practitioners in the patent field will embrace both the policy and drafting objectives which the redraft is pursuing, and provide constructive comment on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked the Commissioner of Patents to prepare a proposal for amending the Bill if, as we expect, further redrafting is needed. I invite the main interest groups, and anyone else who has a contribution to make, to make their views known to the Commissioner by 14 August. The intention is to get the legislation carried in the spring session so that it can be implemented before 1990. The Bill does not yet contain any transitional provisions. They will be separately drafted and introduced as amendments to the Bill or as a separate transitional provisions Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the patents legislation creates property rights, it spends a great deal of verbiage on protecting the public interest and the interests of affected third parties, as well as those of inventors and patentees. The transitional provisions will therefore need to be complex, and I hope that interest groups will direct comments to them as well as to the substantive provisions of the Bill. I do not expect the Bill to have any great impact on the level of resources needed in the Patent Office. The Bill does involve streamlining of procedures as well as drafting style, but it also adds further requirements in some areas, such as by introducing a broader prior art base. The changes brought about by the Bill will require no net additional expenditure. The Patent Office, in accordance with Government policy, operates on a full cost recovery basis. Any additional costs will be recovered, just as any savings in costs which might eventuate will be reflected in future official fees. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill and the Migration Amendment Bill, which were introduced into this House today, were, of course, passed in the Senate. I give the Government an assurance that tonight the Opposition will be supporting this legislation. Once we pass the legislation it can then proceed to follow its normal route for implementation. The Bills are important because they considerably expand the law as we know it in relation to migration to Australia. Of late, there has been a good deal of comment about immigration. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has offered some comments; we have had some debate in the Parliament about a resolution; and in one way or another we have muddled to the point where we have clearly on the record an affirmation of the bipartisan principles of immigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that sense I am pleased to be able to participate in a debate where, as a result of what is called a bipartisan approach we have been able largely to agree on important legislation and important amendments to improve that legislation. I think it is important that people understand what is meant by `bipartisan'. First, it does not mean that the Government hands down on tablets its view and can immediately assume that in all respects it will be accepted by the loyal Opposition. Nothing could be further from the truth. Bipartisanship can only be obtained through the proper methods of consultation, discussion, accommodation and agreement-certainly not through silent acquiescence by the Opposition. In relation to this legislation, we have seen that that process has worked. I shall put before the House those issues in relation to which there was a degree of disagreement and where the Government and the Opposition have come to an accommodation that I see as being important. The fact that we have agreed on this legislation does not mean that from time to time there will not be other issues on which the Opposition and the Government will disagree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says, `It's bound to happen'; and I think it is. However, I assure the House that it will be on those issues which do not arise out of the fundamental principles of migration, such as those that have been endorsed by members on this side of the House in the vote that we took only last week. I think it is important for the House to understand that, because it will then understand the very basis upon which the Opposition will go about making its decisions, in relation to the legislation before us and to other issues that the Government puts before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second issue that I want to address concerns the role of my predecessor in the shadow portfolio, of immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced into the Senate a month or so ago. We had on record the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum presented by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). That was withdrawn after there was an indication from the Opposition and the Australian Democrats that there were objections to various aspects of the legislation, particularly in relation to the system of review proposed and the question of ministerial discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister indicated that he did not propose to redraft the Bill, but discussions were initiated by my predecessor. Although I have had very useful discussions with the Minister and have certainly found it possible to negotiate with him in a constructive way, most of the work was done before I was charged with the task. I commend my colleague for his diligence in pursuing the views of his colleagues and for seeking to have the Opposition view adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation that we are debating is important because it represents the Government's response to the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies. In that sense it deals with a number of questions. Firstly, it deals with the broad discretions currently found in the Act and develops criteria, both by statute and by regulations, which we will see in due course, for determining migrant entry. The criteria for classes of application which have been prescribed for a decision maker will bind those persons who are making decisions in relation to immigration questions. Decisions will be reviewable only under a new two-tier system, and the people who review these matters will be bound by the same legislative and regulatory framework. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also gives legislative effect to the modified points system applicable to classes of visa decisions and entry permit decisions that are taken by officials. Points will be allocated for criteria satisfied and aggregate point scores will be derived for each application. There will be a program of control, with a pooling system to operate in relation to visa applications, with specified marks being varied by notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. The Minister will have certain discretion to provide for the cessation of receiving applications-`capping', I think, is the word that is used-if the migration program objectives are being achieved. They are important aspects of the reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a statutory two-tier system of review of certain immigration decisions. The first tier of review is conducted by specially authorised review officers within the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. It is followed by an appeal to an external review body called the Immigration Review Tribunal-one especially created for this task. The present jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to certain matters will not be affected. They are mainly criminal deportation questions. Of course, the present access to the Federal Court in relation to matters of procedure will apply, as it has before. The Bill also provides for mandatory deportation orders in relation to certain illegal immigrants, in addition to the current discretionary deportation proceedings that the law has in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Once all avenues for review of an illegal immigrant have been exhausted, if the person has not departed Australia within a certain prescribed time-I believe it to be 28 days-the department can then action a mandatory deportation order which will be signed against that person, and there will be no further review. There are provisions allowing for the release of illegal immigrants from custody under certain conditions, particularly ones for debts owing to the Commonwealth for keeping them to be paid. There is provisions to deal with the assets of persons who owe money as a result of their being in custody and their deportation. To assist in the recovery of funds for keeping such people, if they seek to come back to Australia provision is made for them not to be granted visas or entry permits unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the debts owing. There are also changes relating to the way in which persons who conduct themselves as migration agents are paid, and also in relation to the representations they make about what they can achieve. These provisions are a form of elementary consumer protection. New search provisions have been included, and the act is being amended to increase penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the broad statements by the Government as to what its Bill is endeavouring to do. It is against that backgroung that the Opposition was asked to look at the legislation, and we came to certain views about aspects of it. I want to deal with those now. Firstly, it was important that the Bill be able to be reintroduced during this session and debated, and that the development of regulations be started. Although it may be some time before the total legislative framework is put in place, nevertheless if it went past the Budget session the prospect of this legislation coming into effect in the next year or two would have become most problematic. In terms of the timetable for this Bill, the Opposition wanted to accommodate the Government's demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The outstanding issues related, firstly, to the place of ministerial discretion. As the Government proposed the matter in the first instance, it was seeking to provide for all decisions that would normally be made by the Minister to be placed in the hands of the Secretary to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. The Opposition was of the view that it was inappropriate for the Minister to divest himself of that discretion, a discretion which was seen by us to be important and, certainly, was seen to be important to ethnic communities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the arguments that the Administrative Review Council had sought legislative changes and a certain framework in law for the making of immigration decisions, and that it saw it as being important to have a statute and regulations arising from that statute, rather than the old system of policy announcements and departmental instructions and manuals, which had long been used. I was interested to read chapter 3 of the report entitled `Review of Migration Decisions' by the Administrative Review Council. It became clear that although the Council was of the view that there was a need to have in place a much more structured framework for decisions, it was by no means certain that it was determined that its particular framework ought to be used.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the House through some sections of the Administrative Review Council's report. Firstly, the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council accepts that not all areas of government activity are equally suited to the stipulation of detailed rules designed to guide the exercise of discretionary powers in primary decision making. It has considered the specific characteristics of migration decisions and, in the light of past administrative experience in the area and for the following reasons, it concludes that the administration in the field of migration requires the formulation of a range of criteria and principles which need to be of a clear and detailed character. </PARA>
<PARA>It gave four reasons, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>First, the Council is firmly of the opinion that as a matter of individual right and justice those who are affected by decisions made in the exercise of discretionary powers in the area of migration should be able to ascertain readily the considerations relevant to the exercise of those powers . . . A second, related factor tendering in favour of the more detailed and formal structuring of migration powers is that compliance with rules and procedures relating to migration can be expected to become more widespread where their content is accessible and, it is hoped, relatively easily comprehended . . . </PARA>
<PARA> A third factor persuading the Council to favour the structuring of migration powers is the need for consistency and fairness in the administration of the large number of decisions made in the migration field . . . </PARA>
<PARA> A fourth factor is the need, in the Council's view, to give the greatest possible guidance to review bodies in which it is proposed to vest the power to review migration decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council notes that the aim of structuring more precisely and formally the exercise of discretionary powers, by means of the specification of detailed criteria and principles, may be achieved in a variety of ways of which the following are among the most significant in the context of migration decisions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Council then suggested matters such as inclusion in the statute and inclusion in the regulations, but it went on to suggest that there were other administrative systems that were equally appropriate. It was not necessarily wedded to that one system. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> What the Council proposes in this section is the principle of greater formalisation of the structuring of the discretionary powers, to be achieved wherever possible through incorporation in the Act or Regulations . . . the Council believes that the Government should be principally responsible for determining the details of such structuring. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that there was plenty of discretion in relation to those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I also had a look at what the Committee of Review had to say on much the same subject. It has been put that we ought to be very much guided by what it has to say. In relation to the question of the role of the Minister, the Committee of Review has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Minister is pivotal. As the elected person responsible to the Parliament for the administration of the immigration program and immigration and citizenship legislation, his/her authority must receive paramount position in the Bill. Accordingly, our model recommends the following provisions:</PARA>
<PARA> Powers under the Act are to be vested in the Minister. Departmental officers have no separate statutory discretions, but act under the powers of the Minister, and with the authority of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will have powers to make rules, subject to Parliamentary scrutiny, that define the criteria for decision making under the Bill. All powers will be exercised under the decision making regime determined by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Our view that the Minister's place ought to be maintained was very proper. It was supported by the Government's own inquiry as being the appropriate route to take. When one looks at the Administrative Review Council's report, one finds that there was great latitude in the solutions that were offered. The rigidity attributed to them in the Minister's initial remarks was an assumption that ought not to have been made, given the independent comments on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to address is the regulations. Honourable members already know that this afternoon the Parliament approved of the establishment of a committee to review regulations. I spoke briefly then about the purposes of the committee, its terms of reference and the matters that the committee was to consider. It is important to note that the way the regulatory framework is to be put in place is an important part of the compromise. The committee is charged with very specific responsibilities to ensure that compassionate circumstances are taken into account. Existing policy provides for discretion on the part of decision-makers. That discretion is to be maintained in the new and formal regulated system. The committee, of which I hope to be a member, will be charged with that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to make it very clear that we accept that the Government is responsible for the making of decisions in relation to immigration; that is, who should be able to come and the number of people who should be able to come. The government of the day should be able to make those determinations in the way in which it has done in the past, that is, it should be unfettered by having to have its views checked by one or other chamber of the Parliament. That is our view and I believe it is the Government's view. I understand that the Minister has agreed to the inclusion of sunset clauses in the regulations that deal with migrant entry criteria so that if the regulations come to an end the House is not in a position to say that those regulations must continue as they have before, particularly if they led to an outcome which was unacceptable to the government of the day. Certainly if we were in office we would want to be in a position to make those decisions. We do not deny that ability to those who are in office at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I want to address is the system of review. The model the Government has chosen is inquisitorial. It is new. It has been the subject of a good deal of objection, particularly from those who are used to the traditional adversarial methods, especially those available in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and before our courts. I understand the nature of their objections. I understand why they emphasise the need for legal representation. Much of the material from law councils and the immigration forum with some of it being picked up by organisations like the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia raise questions which suggest to us a reintroduction of the adversarial approach. We know that the Government is wedded to its inquisitorial model. We have told the Government that, in effect, it can have it on trial. </PARA>
<PARA> We are prepared to see how that model works. It may go the same way as the inquisitorial model that was proposed for the family courts. We expect a review in two years, as promised by the Minister. It can either be by a parliamentary committee, by the AAT-as the Minister said to me in our discussions-or it can be independent of those two systems. But there must be a report to this Parliament. I give the assurance on behalf of the Opposition that we would similarly seek, in government, to undertake a review of the system to see that it is providing adequate review of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a number of matters incidental but important to the Opposition. I would like to mention them because they have been accommodated in amendments moved in the Senate. The Government wants to ensure that its program-that is, the target that it sets each year when it specifies how many immigrants it wants in particular categories to come to Australia-is adhered to and not exceeded in any one year. There has to be a capacity to cut off the program in any particular area. I understand that the technical term used is `capping'. The Bill enabled the closure of all or any part of the program if the numbers exceeded the annual program targets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has agreed to two specific amendments. One was to exclude the immediate family category-that is, spouses, dependent children and aged parents. I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through the year, `We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia-no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. We have saved the Government great agony had it persisted in that area. It is certainly a matter which would have attracted a great deal of adverse criticism. It is important also that the Parliament have available to it the relevant statistics, the capacity to look at the program, the extent to which the program has been achieved and an ability to determine the basis upon which the decision reached by Government has been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter I want to address relates to the 28-day rule under which people are able to access the review process. Originally, it was proposed that all those who had a reviewable decision would have to access that by making a request for review within 28 days. The Minister has agreed, if the applicant involved is overseas, to extend the period to 70 days. I want to make it clear that the decision we have reached on this matter is predicated on advice that we have received from the Minister. I have written advice-which might take me some time to read if I wanted to put it fully before the House; but the Minister might acknowledge this when he closes the debate-which makes it clear that the form of application for review is merely a request. A person may only have to write a letter saying, `I would like to have my decision reviewed'. He can then put together his evidence and information with assistance from advisers at a later date. He is not bound by a time limit. </PARA>
<PARA> All the Government needs to know is that that person is to appeal, and nothing more. I have received advice from the Department as to how it believes that situation is arrived at. However, I would like formal acknowledgment because if it is not proven to be the case, I would expect the Government to amend the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to appeals to the Federal Court, the Minister assured me that amendments would put beyond doubt that any period, while a matter is before the Federal Court, will be included in the term `excluded days' for the calculation of the 28 days used for accessing the review process in relation to deportation, which is also determined by 28 days. The Minister has also agreed that access to qualified interpreters will be provided to all who are involved in the review process. Similar provisions to those in the Social Security Act were to be put in place. The Minister assured me-and the Minister at the table, the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) may like to confirm this-that recognising the cost of obtaining advice in relation to the review process and to decisions made in the Department of Immigration support would be given to advisory bodies which are able to assist migrants. There is a real dilemma in that because of court cases, one of them involving Shaddock and Parramatta Council in my own area, officials often feel constrained not to offer advice in response to immigration questions over the counter. Often those people are then sent away to get advice from agents who might charge for it or receive it from other people in the community who have very little skills in assisting those who wish to access the system. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other matters I would like to mention. The Opposition accommodated the Government by agreeing to additional amendments to facilitate the prosecution of illegal fishermen who might be brought into Australia. We did not want to see those who are not Australian citizens or permanent residents but who are charged given rights under the immigration law that they would not otherwise have simply because they are to be prosecuted for committing offences here. We facilitated the Government in relation to checking for migration, embarkation and disembarkation purposes those people who interline, that is, those people who travel within Australia, on what would otherwise be international flights. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I mention relates to some of the requests that have been put to the Government and the Opposition in relation to the handling of refugees and the operation of section 17a, which deals with mandatory deportation. I note that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) read into Hansard in the Senate a statement that was given to me in relation to this question, and I would like to put it on the record again. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>It should be borne in mind that the protection of the Convention and the authority to remain pursuant to the Migration Act are two distinct streams. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who come as immigrants come under the Migration Act and those who seek to come as refugees obtain protection under certain international conventions. There are two separate streams. While the two streams are joined at various places for the sake of administrative convenience, they are nonetheless separate and apart. There can be protection and asylum in Australia without the benefit of an entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister quoted the two provisions of the convention in relation to the status of refugees which are relevant. The first is paragraph 1 of Article 31, and the second is Article 33. The Bill allows a period of grace for refugee claimants, if they present themselves without delay. I am assured that the making of a section 17a mandatory deportation order does not prevent or preclude an application for refugee status, and, if that status is obtained, the refugee has the protection of Article 33 of the Convention. I have received certain representations, including representations from Professor Crawford of the Faculty of Law at Sydney University raising possible difficult cases, and all I ask is that, if the law does not protect refugees adequately, this matter be looked at again. In other words, if the undertakings that have been given to me prove to be ill-founded, I hope that the Government will be willing to open up this question again to amend the law. </PARA>

I welcome the new immigration system, because, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has recognised, this is an historic Bill. It sets out enormous changes in the immigration system while, at the same time retaining, the good features that we have learned from the experience of the past 30 years. Before I refer to the Bill, I welcome the appointment of the honourable member for Dundas as the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs. We look forward to a period of cooperation on a bipartisan basis in relation to immigration matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might say, in relation to the comments of the honourable member for Dundas, that at no stage in the debate last year did we say that the Government was trying to prevent the Opposition from putting forward issues on immigration. That was not the question at all, and on many occasions the previous Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Holding) and the current Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) said that we were ready to countenance suggestions from the Opposition in relation to the Migration Act and the operation of the system. I believe that our good faith in this matter has been shown by the fact that we accepted a number of important amendments that came from the Opposition. We did that to achieve bipartisanship. I hope that that spirit will continue in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I have described this as an historic Bill, and it certainly is that, because for the first time the legislation will provide a substantial legislative base plus a regulations base for the immigration system; that is, both the legislative and regulations base will provide a thorough and objective basis for the selection of immigrants. However, the Bill also changes completely the review process to make it thorough and objective. In doing both those things the system tries to take account of the two basic goals of immigration, namely, the consideration of Australia's national interests, including our economic interests on the one hand, and on the other hand our social and humanitarian obligations, both to our own people in terms of their relatives coming here and to refugees around the world. There is no doubt that those basic principles have been balanced well in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> So successful has this approach been that other major immigration countries are looking at copying the Australian model. Recently I returned from a visit to the United States of America where I spoke to the head of the Immigration Division, Commissioner Nelson, who said that he and members of the Congress, including the head of the congressional committee, Alan Morrison, were looking at the Australian system as a possible model for the American system. They are considering it seriously. One reason why that is happening is that we have learned from the experiences of the past and we have tried to instil those elements in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill did not come about overnight; it came about in a process of deliberations over two years, starting with the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies and then the Government's protracted discussions of those recommendations, including the acceptance of some and the rejection of others. In those deliberations, the Committee that I have had the honour to chair met more than 20 times in four months to consider amendments, changes and different ways of dealing with the problem. In addition, the Ministers have played a clear role, and I want to pay tribute to the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding), and to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs for their persistence in working hard to get this system into place. </PARA>
<PARA> Other people were involved. We must pay tribute to the National Population Council, which is headed by Professor Castles, who developed the new points system to which I will refer later. The National Population Council was asked to undertake this development because the FitzGerald inquiry did not stipulate a points system as such and left it to the Government to develop. Many other people were involved, people from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Tribute must be paid to Wayne Gibbons in the Department and Ron Brown, the head of that Department. This has been a collective effort, but it has produced an historic Bill, which we believe, will set the pace not only for Australia but, hopefully, as we move towards greater coordination of our policies, for Canada and the United States. Those countries are looking at a system that is very similar to this system. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the positive features of this system? One of the most important positive features I will refer to, because obviously I cannot mention them all in the time available, is that the family reunion category and the economic category are now separate. We have rejected the FitzGerald recommendation that there be one open category. Instead, we have specified that there will be two categories, one for family reunion, and one for independent economic immigration. But we have gone beyond that. We have said that there will be independent point systems. There will be a point system that applies for the concessional family category and a point system that applies for the independent economic category. This is the first time that we have had separate systems for the two categories which recognises their differences. </PARA>
<PARA> In additional to that recognition, obviously there is a different emphasis. When one is looking at the issue of family reunion, humanitarian and family factors are important; when one is looking at the issue of economic independent immigration one's emphasis is primarily on skills and employability. This is not to say that the family category has no skills or employability element. It also contains that element. I think it is important in this context that honourable members familiarise themselves with the two new point systems. Mr Deputy Chairman, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which lists the new immigration points system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. As can be seen from the table, additional points will be given for kinship and family relationship. In particular, there will be additional points not only for the actual relationship of brother and sister and nephew and niece but in relation to the circumstances of the sponsor. This is the first time we have introduced this. In particular, if a sponsor has for the last two years been continuosly employed in Australia and has not claimed benefits for the last month in that period, that person will be eligible for additional points. Why have we put this criterion in? We have put in a criterion that will ensure that relatives who are being sponsored will come to a situation in which the sponsoring relatives are not in difficult economic circumstances themselves. They will be able to assist them. You cannot force people to assist the relatives that they are bringing into Australia. That has been tried and failed. However, we can say, `Look, those people who want to sponsor their relatives should try to ensure that they themselves are in reasonable economic circumstances, and we have chosen this particular criterion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to that, there is another very important criterion. That is the criterion which looks at certain regions which have low migration patterns. We have chosen those designated regions, as they are called in, for example, the State of South Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory and part of Queensland. If a sponsor comes from that particular region, he will get additional points.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted, as I said earlier, that the family category will continue to incorporate points for skills, education and work experience. We are not saying that simply relationship itself is sufficient; we are still keeping that factor. Of course, the age factor is also important. The system is directed towards emphasis on younger applicants, and this is intended to ensure that we deal with the problem of the ageing of the population. Previously we had an age consideration but we have strengthened it in order to take even more account of the problem of the ageing of our population. We are directing our immigration program-both family and economic-towards younger migrants because of the age problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The new family category will deal with a problem that has concerned the ethnic communities for more than a decade. I refer to the fact that implicit in the previous system was the criterion that English language was required for family immigration. We have said that in the economic independent category English language is an important factor, but in the family category we have altogether taken out English language as a criterion. Now if we have somebody who is skilled, employed and educated and who has a relative from another country with little or no knowledge of English, that does not count against the relative. We say, `Let's bring that person here and help him to learn English quickly'. We are going to have programs to assist those people to learn English. In doing that we have ended an unconscious or indirect discriminatory element that existed in the previous system. We have said that if those people meet the criteria they can come here as relatives and we will deal with the English language problem for the family reunion category. But we have said that in the economic independent category English language is an important criterion. If people want to migrate under that category they should learn English. I think that is a very important distinction. It is one of the major distinctions between the two point systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important factor is the interminable problem of the last 40 years-the recognition of qualifications. If we have a points system which emphasises so much the question of skills, education and employability, we need a reasonable system of recognition of qualifications. For the last 40 years governments of all persuasions have said that this problem is too hard. One of the disappointing factors of the FitzGerald report was that it did not deal with this problem. We have said that we are going to deal directly with this problem and we have set up interdepartmental task forces to do so. We are considering it at a ministerial level and we are talking to the unions, professional associations and other groups in the community in order to get a new system that will deal directly with this very difficult problem of the recognition of overseas qualifications. We hope that within 12 months we will be able to put into place changes which will really deal with the heart of this matter. If we do not do that, the new system will not operate as well as it needs to. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the emphasis on qualifications it is very important that the recognition of qualifications issue be resolved. We ask the Opposition for assistance on a bipartisan basis in helping to get especially those particularly difficult groups in the community that do not want recognition of overseas qualifications applied here to recognise that they have an obligation to this nation to recognise the qualifications of people who are duly qualified. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the Parliament does not in itself set down the new selection process. It establishes the general framework. Under this general framework we will establish regulations to govern the system. Those regulations, as the honourable member for Dundas has mentioned, will not be arbitrarily determined by the Minister but will be reviewed by a parliamentary committee. We have made that concession to the Opposition. We were happy to make it. The importance of that concession is that we now have a situation in which the parliamentary scrutiny, both in terms of law and regulation of the immigration system, is the most comprehensive that it has ever been and probably the most comprehensive of any system in the world. As the honourable member for Dundas said, the parliamentary committee has a very important responsibility-to look at whether the actual policy's intentions are met through the specific regulations and their implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the consequences of this whole legislative and regulation process is that the powers of the Minister will be substantially reduced. That was almost unavoidable. If one looks at the Migration Act 1958, one will see that the Minister had almost absolute power to do anything. He could virtually admit anyone on any criteria. The Minister's powers were almost total and absolute. Even the actual system was not legislated, but was determined by the Minister himself. Under those circumstances obviously, given that there will be a legal and regulatory framework, the Minister's powers will be reduced. But the reduction of the Minister's powers does not mean that he has no powers at all. We have taken out the references to the Secretary of the Department within the framework of the regulations and the legislation and replaced it with references to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We have achieved a very fine balance. The Minister will still have discretion, but his discretion will not be absolute; it will depend upon the law and the regulations. In this context the honourable member for Dundas quoted the FitzGerald inquiry as saying that it was very important that the Minister should retain most powers. The passage he quoted is a little ambivalent as to how many and what powers the Minister should retain. We have now achieved a fine balance between the importance of parliamentary scrutiny and giving the Minister substantial power. That balance should be retained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not, but on the other hand we do not want him to have absolute power, as some people wanted him to have. Changes are made to the review system. The honourable member for Dundas mentioned that he has had representations from lawyers. Who has not? We have been bombarded by lawyers ever since we suggested the new review system. The revolutionary point about this system is that it is not an adversary system. We will take the lawyers out of the immigration process, although not completely. They can be advisers, but they will not be making thousands of dollars fighting what are very often hopeless cases on behalf of people who, quite often, they have misguided, having given them hope that they can get through an adversary system. That will not happen. A lawyer can assist a person to prepare his or her own case before the Immigration Review Tribunal at the second tier level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first tier deals with the internal review by the Department. Some people have said that, if a review is internal, surely it will not be objective. We have been given assurances that those who will be doing the internal review will not be the people who have made the decision on the selection. </PARA>
<PARA> The second tier is the important one. It is revolutionary in that we will set up an independent Tribunal which will judge people after asking them to come before it. There will be no interrogation by lawyers; a person will simply be asked to explain his or her case. The important thing is that the Department will not be able to appear before the Tribunal to argue against a person's review. That means that the review process will be much more sympathetic than the one that exists at the moment. We highly commend this process to everyone concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) for his kind remarks. Having acknowledged that, I move on to the remarks of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who made great play of the Government's willingness to negotiate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill. The fact is that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats had blocked this Bill and it was dead in the water in the Senate. The Government had no option but to negotiate or lose the legislation altogether. So much for the willingness of the Government to negotiate on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As shadow Minister for immigration at that time, I had not had an indication of the Government's intention in regard to the legislation until the legislation hit the floor of the Parliament. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) made a statement in December which broadly outlined the Government's intention. But the level of consultation to which the honourable member for Calwell adverted can hardly be considered broad and wide-ranging when the Opposition was not consulted prior to the Government's decision and had to use the powers of the Parliament to stop legislation which was abominable and not in the form that even the honourable member for Calwell wanted. </PARA>
<PARA> I know and the whole Parliament knows that the Caucus immigration committee was rolled time and again on this matter. As always, on such matters, it was swept to one side. There cannot be a more ineffective committee of any party in this Parliament than the Caucus committee on immigration. In this instance, but for the Opposition, it would not have won a single round. The Opposition, by blocking this legislation, brought back into the legislation the ministerial discretion that the Caucus committee so dearly wanted. Many other amendments that we have brought forward are receiving wide support because they are sensible and sound. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for new legislation in regard to immigration has been obvious for some time. There are a number of reasons why it is needed. The means of modern transportation and the systems that have been adopted for gaining entry to a country have changed dramatically over the past 10 years. The old Migration Act was deficient in a number of areas, particularly in regard to visas, the treatment of illegal immigrants, entry permits and a range of other issues. </PARA>
<PARA> However, an additional matter was causing the Government problems. In 1983, early in the Government's career, the Government had to refer to a decision it had reached with the Australian Council of Trade Unions that the basis of migration to Australia should be family reunion and refugees. The union movement did not want a skilled migration program. The accord entered into in late 1982 or early 1983 locked the incoming government into a program of migration that suited the union movement but, frankly, did not suit the rest of Australia. The Government was obliged to follow the commitment that it had agreed to in writing. It quickly moved to a program that was based on humanitarian concern, not on the skills and expertise that this nation needed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member shakes his head. He has not even looked at the statistics. It is not acknowledged by anybody but him that this is not the case. The Government, under Minister West, quickly reversed the Fraser Government's trend towards a fairly high level of skills with a significant family reunion component which attracted those productive, economic migrants who are critical to the advancement of Australia. Australia does not need in this day and age large numbers of factory employees. Australia needs skilled, competent people who are job creators, who have the capacity to generate downstream employment for others, who are aware of modern technology, who can communicate their skills to others, who are capable of assisting Australia to gain export markets and who can bring an entrepreneurial spirit to the Australian ethos and environment. The type of migrant that Australia needs today is vastly different from the type of migrant that Australia needed 20 or 30 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, at a critical time, adopted a most inappropriate immigration policy. There were successive and rapid changes of Ministers-five Ministers in five years. No Minister really had the chance to come to grips with his department and the demographic changes that had occurred in Australia, nor with the needs of the Australian community. Some of those five Ministers showed little interest in what they were charged to do, and so avoided carrying out the oath of their office. That was regrettable, because this is a most significant and important area, locked in with the training of Australians to acquire skills and locked in with the growth of families and family development-the birth rate of Australia. No area is more significant for Australia's future than this one. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a shame that, through the accord, through neglect and through rapid change, that very high semi-skilled or unskilled immigration program was continued for a number of years. I remember the honourable member for Calwell saying in regard to one of the changes that were made by one Minister that the concessional category was so desirable that it would be locked in place for ever and that certainly no government would dare change it for the next 10 years. Within 18 months his own Government was forced to bring about changes and impose restrictions to the concessional category of immigration. The fact of the matter is that it was so broad and so loose that, late in 1987, the program blew out to an annual rate of about 197,000 people a year instead of the targeted 120,000 a year. The Government just had to stop that program; it could not carry on. It cancelled the program and stopped officers around the world processing applications for migration. </PARA>
<PARA> So the successive changes the Government adopted brought about by inappropriate policies, a lack of attention, an out of date Act and some interesting reports-some produced by bodies such as the Administrative Review Council-necessitated an examination of the Act. The FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, which was so critical of the Government's immigration program, also indicated that the Government needed to take charge of Australia's immigration program; it needed to exercise control; it needed to be fair; and it needed to have a balanced program, but one which was predominantly based on skills, knowledge and educated migrants. That was a stinging criticism from the FitzGerald Committee. At that point the Government had two options: either to have its Minister take charge of the program, as he was charged to do under the Act and by his oath of office, or to do what it has done-that is, to codify the system. We have seen this practice in many areas of the current Government's operation: when we run into a problem, write more laws and appoint more public servants. It has happened in the Income Tax Assessment Act and a similar technique has been used here. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I recognise some of the difficulties that have occurred in administrative law since the introduction of the administrative review procedures and access to the Federal Court of Australia, I am not sure that the Government's decision to codify the Migration Act is the most desirable decision. I venture to predict what will occur. There will be extended court cases on the Act and regulations, and interpretations of the Act and regulations, so we may have delays similar to the delays that are experienced in Canada-of up to four years-while decisions are made in particular cases. A body of case law will have to be built up so that the court's interpretation of what the Parliament means will be established. So the legislation, the codification and the writing down of all these matters in the law books will produce a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very difficult to be critical of the programs and the immigration practices of most Ministers since World War II. These have been carried out by sheer administration, by the Minister making a declaration of what the Government thinks is best for Australia's immigration program and that directive then being put into action around the world by Australian immigration officers. I cannot point to too many instances where those officers, working under administrative systems, have made many mistakes. So I guess I am saying that the Government has chosen a new direction for Australia's immigration program-one that is legal; one that is complicated for most people; and one that is also impersonal for most people. </PARA>
<PARA> After seeing a lot of difficulties with these proposals, the Opposition decided that, if possible, it should not allow the Government to proceed with the legislation. We decided that that decision should hold on two grounds basically, because the Minister was almost completely withdrawing from his responsibility to supervise and to keep in his hand the affairs of Australia's immigration. Australians want the Minister to be responsible. They want him to take up that charge. It is no good drawing parallels between this area and areas such as social security as the current Minister has done at times. It is a matter of people who are not in Australia being granted entry into Australia and becoming Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The population of this country wants to know where the buck stops. It has to stop with the Minister. The Government has decided to cast that to one side and totally regulate the area. The Opposition did not feel that that was the best way to go. I am very thankful that Senator Robert Ray has chosen to be flexible and thoughtful in regard to changes to the Act and to bring in some significant changes-if fact, all the changes that the Opposition held the Bill up to achieve. Changes in regard to ministerial discretion, in regard to the review processes and in regard to many other matters have been recognised by the Government. It has completely changed its attitude in all these areas from the time that the legislation was introduced until now. I think that is an important achievement on the part of the Opposition. A sensible balance has been struck. As my colleague the honourable member for Dundas has said, in two years time we will have a look at it again and we will see how well it has worked. That is also a sensible suggestion and concession from the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that is new in this legislation is the area of reviewing decisions. The process that Australia has had up until this point has been one of immigration review panels. That was established first of all by the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) as a way of assisting the Minister to make difficult decisions on individual cases. If those review panels were established in the pattern that the Minister suggested at the time and if they had been followed in the way in which he enunciated them, I do not think we would have got into the strife that we have got into with review panels, delays and all sorts of problems. In those days review panels were supposed to be completely remote from the Department; they were supposed to work on the papers; and they were supposed to give people a fair consideration. Generally, they have but I guess that that community which depends on those decisions has not seen them as objective. Now we have a regulated process as set out in the Act, that is the way in which immigration review decisions will take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that it is an innovative approach and one that I generally endorse. It is modelled on the original French process of administrative law. It is simple and somewhat different from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I think those who have expressed concern ought to give it a go. They ought to let everybody see how it will work out. It could work out so well that, in two years time, nobody will want to change it. It could well be that a decision is then made to refer all reviews of migration decisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It could well be that it does not work well but there will be an opportunity in two years time to make changes if necessary. The appointment of the first Chairman and that first panel will be the critical factor for the Immigration Review Tribunal. The attitudes that they adopt, the methods that they use to hear cases, the sympathy that they express and their firmness in making sure that the policies in the law are followed, will be a critical test. I trust that the Government will take a great deal of care in the selection of those personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in regard to migration in general, by this process a greater emphasis is placed on the primary decision-maker-the person who conducts the interview and makes the first assessment. That is welcomed. It is time that some of the decision-making capacity went back to those people at the front line and that the importance of their role in selecting migrants for Australia and implementing government policies was recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the risk of legislation delays and costly processes there is another risk in the approach that the Government is adopting. There is a real risk of having a system that is so rigid, so computerised, so controlled that Australia may not receive the migrants that we would like to see come to this country. I do not know how computers can measure attitudes; a willingness to cooperate and become involved in our society. I do not know how computers by the simple points score system can effectively judge character and willingness to settle, to stay, to make a contribution. Those sorts of judgments used to be made by officers of the Department, but now, as honourable members would know, the computerised system that we are about to see will be a matter of buttons being pushed and programs being cut off. It will be absolutely rock solid tight with little flexibility. The person who pushes that button on the computer will run Australia's immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA> The points score system and the computer have become this Government's policy for immigration. It has little else but a points score and a computer. What used to be the tools of immigration have become the policy. That is a great shame because the most marvellous group of people has come to Australia over the last 40 years. They have made a tremendous contribution to this nation. We will throw a lot of that away because of the lack of attention by the Government, the lack of diligence by Ministers, the lack of care by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Those are the reasons we need a change and those reasons will bring about a highly sterile, rigid system which is so legalised that it will cause massive delays. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the Government well in the approach it has adopted. It has shown a fair degree of commitment; it has shown a fair degree of willingness to come to grips with some of the basic problems. I feel that some of the answers are wrong, but I give the Government credit for trying. I also give the Opposition credit for sticking to its guns and forcing the Government to make essential changes to the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on this landmark legislation, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill and the Migration Amendment Bill. Unfortunately, I missed the contribution of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), but I appreciate his thoughtful and consistent contributions here and I have no doubt that tonight was no exception. The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) blew hot and cold. In one breath he praised the legislation and in the next he was critical of it. He cast some doubts on the effectiveness of the Caucus subcommittee in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs. That is perhaps unfair because the devotion, enthusiasm and, indeed, conscientiousness of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) in pursuing this issue and representing the Caucus subcommittee before the Cabinet was well understood by those of us who were on that subcommittee, and the Caucus subcommittee had a significant input into this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation is very complex because it is the sort of legislation-like taxation legislation, I suggest-through which everybody is trying to drive a hole; everyone is trying to look for a loophole or an escape mechanism. For that reason I suggest to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) that in view of the complexity of the amendments and the already complex nature of the Migration Act, reflecting the many changes that it has had over the years, it will be almost impossible for people wishing to use this legislation to do so in the absence of a consolidated Act being available. This problem has already been recognised by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. As a result the Government has sponsored an amendment to the legislation to enable the Migration Act to be renumbered. This has our support. However, I ask the Minister to give an undertaking on behalf of the Government that a consolidated Migration Act will be printed and made available for sale as soon as the legislation is enacted. All of us with an interest in this area would appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us is the result of very sensible negotiation. It has come together after considerable consultation between the major parties in this place and with some input from the unfettered idealism which the Australian Democrats tend to show in the other place. The suggestion by the honourable member for Mitchell that immigration legislation when the Opposition was in office was very tidy and neat and that in some way it has lost its way over the last four or five years is something to which I take exception. My own experience and that of many other members is that of consistently seeing constituents in our offices about migration inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> When we came to office there were enormous problems. Day after day people who had come to Australia on a working holiday, for a holiday or to visit their friends came to my office and said that the story they had been told at Australian posts all over the world was that if they came out, stayed for a while and decided they wanted to change status, it could be organised, `Nod, nod; wink, wink'. They came to our offices day after day expecting some sort of special privilege, some sort of loophole to be found-and they were successful in large numbers. This Government said, `We will stop this change of status rort. You wait in the queue in your country of origin; you cannot keep coming out here, making some sort of excuse and trying to slip past the system'. It is still the case that people take advantage of the change of status requirements. I accept that and believe that we need to be very careful about it. We are all aware of the arranged marriage or de facto relationship which is manufactured as a means of getting around the legislation. However, the Government was faced with a basic problem and it did something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems with the immigration review panels include massive waiting periods; all sorts of different legislation; adversarial situations; and immense difficulty and heartache for people. Again, the legislation tries to do something about it. With respect to the area of discretion of the Minister, previously the legislation was run on ministerial discretion. He variously did as he wished. Indeed, it is the case that those who ask that there be unfettered discretion for the Minister are really pleading for privilege; they are pleading for exceptional access to the Minister which is not available to everybody else. They are pleading for particular opportunities for parliamentarians to approach the Minister to get some benefit, so they can gain kudos in their electorates or elsewhere. I am very proud of the fact that on this side of the House there was considerable discussion about this and although there were people who were for discretion, in the end we came down on the side of trying to make the system as objective as we possibly could because we were looking for a fairer and more objective way of deciding these things. I believe that is a considerable improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of illegal immigrants is an immensely interesting and divisive issue in the electorate. Various estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in this country put the figure between 50,000 and 70,000. That seems like a very large number, which it is. Very often these illegal immigrants are exploited by employers and variously they exploit our social security system and other structures within this country. The numbers are not surprising. We think that between 50,000 and 70,000 illegal immigrants is a lot for this country. If one goes to Canada and the United States, one will see that the problem is massively greater than that, but it is still a considerable difficulty here. In the macro sense it is very easy to be hairy chested and to say, `Well, those people are illegal immigrants; we should do something about them; they should be sent home'. But day after day, in fact, members of this House are responsible for the sorts of tear-jerking stories that the media turn up which suggest that a particular case is different and these people should be allowed to stay. It is an area which needs to be addressed. Indeed, this legislation pays attention to the ability of the Government to act on deportation and to make those who are to be deported pay for the cost for their activities to the Australian Government. It also allows for those who are genuine refugees, who deserve the most fair and honest consideration by this Government, to have the best chance to have their cases heard. So it is sensitive and compassionate legislation also. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the areas that particularly concerns me within my electorate of Perth is that we have a large number of immigrants of all description but in particular in the inner city area a large number of immigrants have come recently from South-East Asia. These people very often tend to be preyed upon by what I would call very doubtful migration agents. Over the last three or four years there has been a significant increase in the number of these people. To become a migration agent, all a person had to do was fill out a standard form that was produced, pay $50 and the Secretary of the Department was required to classify that person as a migration agent. Then that person was able to put up a board outside an office stating, `I am a qualified migration agent'. In various ways these people in my electorate for a long time have been taking advantage of those who would want to be reunited with their families. Time and time again we see the names appearing when people come to a member's office as a last resort. They have been through the migration agent who had promised that he could fix this or fix that and unfortunately failed. Very often they would come to the member's office and at the same time they would be going to the migration agent. When the member was successful with the case the migration agent would conclude that it was due to his ministration and he would take the credit and charge a very hefty fee for the work which was very often done by the Department or by the local member. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that migration agents had some special expertise or skill was very doubtful. Certainly the suggestion that they often made to their clients that they had some special privileged position was extremely questionable. If we look at the figures, it is very interesting to note that this became quite a lucrative business. In 1987 there were 284 new migration agents in the country. In 1988 there was a mushrooming to 474. We find that the same thing occurred in the area of business migration. In late 1987 and during 1988 there were literally hundreds of applications and 203 new business migration agents were approved in 1988. So we saw a considerable push in this area, considerable movement amongst those who would seek to benefit from their position. Many of them were very worthwhile advocates for their clients, but my suggestion is-and I think it is validated by my experience in the electorate-that very often the unsuspecting sponsor was ripped off by the migration agent. This legislation says that there needs to be an annual audit and review of these agents and, indeed, a schedule of fees for the agents which is reasonable and adjusted so that they can charge what is fair. Claims of influence and the sorts of spurious things that we heard in the past will be outlawed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three principle changes to migration policy brought about by this legislation which I believe are most significant. In the time left to me I will endeavour broadly to pass across them. The first is immigration decision-making which I have already touched upon. Within the legislation and through regulation we will spell out the decision-making criteria. People will know how an aged parent is identified and what is necessary within that category to be successful. Whatever the criteria-whether it be for a brother or skilled worker-it will be possible to understand the position. During the period of the development of those criteria, there will be discretion in the areas which have not been set out in the regulations once the Act is proclaimed. This will be the case until those areas have come under regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> More than two million visas are supplied by the Government every year. It is absurd to expect in any way at all that the Minister can have anything to do with that sort of magnitude of decision making. What we need for these people is some equality in the way decisions are made. The Minister needs to have discretion in some circumstances but, more important than that, and what was originally entailed in the legislation before amendment, he also has a responsibility. That was always the case. He would always have responsibility, but the fact that he should have unfettered discretion was what we opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I would say that those who ask for unfettered discretion are asking for a plea or privilege. In the past, by ministerial decree, the Minister could decide whatever he liked. There was no parliamentary scrutiny; there was no control. We are saying that we are going to set down regulations that can be disallowed by this Parliament-regulations that will now become a fixed body of law. When those regulations become law, they will be able to be overseen by the Select Committee of both Houses of this place. Indeed, that Committee will be able to see that these regulations fit within policy requirements and that Committee will be able to judge the flexibility of these regulations. A sunset clause of two years has been applied to them, after which time we will be able to assess progress. I suggest that the ministrations of the Opposition have in this way improved this legislation. Certainly, the consultation that has been undertaken has improved it. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part is the new review system. The old Immigration Review Panel was a former mechanism or review for immigration decisions and it operated from 1982, but it was an administrative form. It only had powers of recommendation and there were many fragilities in the system. There was the fragility about whether it was legal to charge a fee, and that has been addressed in this legislation. The new system will apply two tiers: the first will be applied by specifically appointed review officers. The review officers within the Department will be separate from those who make the original decision. There will be an independent and discrete unit of the Department and, as such, its reviews will be undertaken only on the paperwork and the information that is available. It is hoped by that system that many of the present jams will be cleared up. It is hoped that the old adversarial judicial approach will be broken down. </PARA>
<PARA> The second tier will be resolved between the claimant and the Immigration Review Tribunal. The Tribunal, as the decision maker, will not be adversarial. There will be no representation of the Department at that stage and, in my belief, it will provide more natural justice, more efficiency-certainly I hope it will speed up the operation of the Tribunal-and it will provide fairness and objectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we are saying within this legislation that we want to review that system in two years. That is a sensible approach for both the Government and the Opposition to take because, as has been mentioned by the honourable member for Mitchell, in one sense this is new ground. I endorse what he says. It deserves to be given a chance. We need to look at how it performs. The Minister will have the power to override the decisions of the Tribunal, but only when it is more favourable for the claimant. When he does do that, it will be necessary for him to report the circumstances to the Parliament. Again, I suggest to the House that it is a very fair and reasonable approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The final aspect of this measure that I want to talk about is the mechanism to ensure that a planned migration program is undertaken and is not exceeded. It is Australia's right to decide who comes to Australia to settle. Within the various categories that we have set out we see ourselves as perhaps having the ratio of 50 per cent family reunion to 40 per cent skills and 10 per cent compassion. Australia's record as being a compassionate country in the migration area is well understood overseas. The management of the intake is something that is very important. We have heard examples of how, in the past, it has been overshot. Indeed, the program needs to be planned so that the outcomes are not exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many considerations for Australia. There are economic considerations. For too long, all around this country the consideration has been that migration takes jobs, that every migrant who arrives on Australia's shores takes the job of an Australian, when it is clear that the net benefit of migration is probably the creation of jobs in this country. That is well understood. But there is concern when the economy is bubbling along in the way that it is that migration is a net growth factor. Some could argue on economic grounds that there should be a change in the numbers. I suggest that the figure of 140,000 that we have set is fair. There is a domestic labour market to consider, there is a public health consideration, and there is an infrastructure consideration. People who arrive have to have housing, places to live and jobs, and other aspects of our infrastructure are important for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there is a different consideration when it comes to providing visas for people for tourism purposes. However, in each category, for those people who wish to come and stay in this country there will be a points system with a floating pass mark. If a person reaches the priority mark his application goes straight to processing. If he reaches the pool entry mark his application is recycled, and if the floating pass mark changes he might be successful the next time around. If he fails, his application will be rejected. The pass mark will be altered by gazettal and consideration will be given in the categories of skill, age and, for independent applicants, language. </PARA>
<PARA> There are one or two other things I wish to say about this Bill, but my time is running out. I believe that it returns objectivity. It provides for a fair system; it provides for a system that can be managed; and it answers many of the doubts about immigration that have come from both sides of this House over the past few years. In my view, this historic legislation will greatly improve the fairness, equity and objectivity of our immigration program. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EG4">Mr PETER FISHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope so, although it is getting very late at night. I acknowledge that this legislation will greatly improve all those issues relating to migration. I acknowledge that many of the circumstances to which the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) referred certainly need correcting. All of us in our roles as elected members of parliament go through the same sorts of representations and difficulties to which the honourable member has referred. While I acknowledge the Government's intent in this legislation, I make the point that I believe that the Opposition was correct in ensuring that ministerial discretion was not totally removed. I believe that it would be a great disadvantage to our democratic system if a Minister responsible for immigration did not have some sorts of discretionary powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I have not done any research on this issue, I believe that in the 17 years I have been here I have probably taken personally to Ministers only five or six cases concerning applications that I believed may have been unfairly dealt with. I remember one case in particular of an African student and his family. He had finished his studies here in Australia and he came to me in the belief that, due to some past political affiliations, if he returned to his country of origin there would be reprisals and he and his family would be severely disadvantaged. The Minister of the day and his Department did a very detailed brief on the case. I was very impressed with what they did. I believe that they gave the case every consideration. The ultimate decision was that the student return to his country. It was very sad that subsequently and tragically the student and his family were murdered upon returning to their country of origin. I make no criticism of the Minister of the time or the Department because they did an excellent job. I just recite this case to show that I believe there are circumstances where a ministerial discretion is perhaps the only way a particular injustice can be determined. We must never reach a situation where regulation and control and circumstances are so strict that that sort of capacity to provide discretion does not operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I also find it surprising tonight that, having been a member of parliament for quite a long time and having an electorate where somewhere in the vicinity of 40 per cent of the people are either new settlers or first or second generation children of new settlers, this is probably the first occasion on which I have spoken on matters relating to our immigration policies and programs. I really set myself to thinking about why that is the case, particularly as a very large part of our office work-as the honourable member for Perth would be aware-involves assisting with passport applications and applications for migration. The reason is that up until recently-and to a large degree it is still the same-my region, the north-west part of Victoria, the Murray Valley horticultural area, has been one of Australia's most successful and excellent examples of the integration of new people into our country-people who are still proud of and are practising their own cultural ties and heritage. They are also people who recognise that they are part of this new country and have adapted rapidly. They have adopted Australia as their own nation and have worked very hard to make a success of their lives as individuals and to contribute to the economic and social values of their new country. Therefore, it is worrying to me that the very reasons why people wish to come to this great country-our freedom of speech and our democratic principles-should be the reasons for this Parliament on occasions using opportunities to misrepresent, to misinform and to create social and racial divisions for purely political or perceived political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I would like to state, briefly and in precis, the principles under which I believe the coalition has every right to operate and to portray its policies in the Parliament without fear of misrepresentation. Of course we have a bipartisan policy. However, it is fundamental to national sovereignty that the Australian government alone should determine who will be admitted to Australia. In my view, no person other than an Australian citizen has a basic right to enter this country. Apart from people admitted as refugees and for family reunion, migrant entry criteria should be developed on the basis of benefit to the Australian community and the social, economic and related requirements within Australia. Australia should not admit people for settlement who would present an economic burden to Australia through inordinate claims on welfare, health or other resources or who would endanger the community by criminal or other anti-social activities or whose entry would be to their own detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the size and composition of migrant intakes should not jeopardise social cohesiveness and harmony within the Australian community. It is also important that immigration policy be applied on a basis which is non-discriminatory. I think all parties and individuals in this place would agree with that. Applicants should be considered for migration as individuals or family units and not as community groups. It is essential that eligibility and suitability standards for migrants should reflect Australian social mores and Australian laws. Polygamous unions should not be accepted, nor should the entry of child fiances or fiancees. Migration to Australia should be for permanent settlement although, of course, there can be no barrier preventing the departure of persons wishing to leave. While migrants should have the same rights as other Australian citizens to choose their place of residence individually or collectively, I believe enclave settlement should not be encouraged. Finally, I believe, as does the coalition, that policies governing entry and settlement should be based on the premise that migrants should integrate into the Australian society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No ghettos at all. Consistent with this premise, they should be given every opportunity to preserve and disseminate their own ethnic heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now refer specifically to this migration legislation, which includes two Bills-the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill and the Migration Amendment Bill. This is now better legislation, servicing both migrants and the general community alike, because of the mature discussion that has taken place and the debate and consultation that has taken place between the Government and the Opposition. I will briefly mention some of the changes that have occurred to this legislation and some of the major tenets of it. The changes we are debating tonight, of course, flow from the review of immigration undertaken last year by the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies under the chairmanship of Dr Stephen FitzGerald. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three major features of this legislation. The first is a radically revised approach to immigration decision-making. Currently, the Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs portfolio has decision-making discretions which are totally unfettered. They give the Minister power to determine who can enter Australia and who must leave Australia. This, of course, has been accepted by the Government in the debate that has taken place as being too restrictive and amendments have been moved and accepted. As I mentioned earlier, I believe the Minister should have some discretion as, of course, should ethnic communities in our country. I acknowledge the fact that very largely the Government has accepted this view. </PARA>
<PARA> A second feature of the legislation is the introduction of a new two-tier review system. There has been dissatisfaction with the former review system, with the end result that in some cases a number of applicants have considered that the only way they could gain an independent review of their case was to pursue judicial review. A new two-tier system has therefore been introduced. The first tier will be a review by specialist officers of the Department specifically authorised and guaranteed independence by legislation to undertake this task. Applicants dissatisfied with the decision made by that tier will be able to appeal to a second tier of review. This tier will be a statutory authority, based independently as a review body. It will be called the Immigration Review Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> In their consideration of this section of the legislation the Opposition parties believed that the Government model was too inquisitorial. Some objectors prefer the maintenance of traditional adversarial methods such as are available in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Most of the material from law councils and the immigration forum raises questions which would reintroduce aspects of this approach. The Minister was strongly of the view that he would not compromise on these questions, particularly as they related to the change of status of illegal immigrants. He did, however, offer an evaluation of the review system after two years, either independently with a report to Parliament or by the parliamentary committee which has been established. The coalition supports this measure at this time, but will be carefully watching its operation to ensure that reviews and reports of the system become available to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major feature of the legislation is that it spells out mechanisms for ensuring that planned immigration program intakes are not exceeded. Other significant features of the legislation which have been explained in some detail by the shadow Minister for immigration, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and other speakers in the House tonight include provisions for shifting the cost of detention and deportation onto the offender and making commercial immigration advisers accountable for their clients. My colleagues have already spelt out the major details of these Bills and, therefore, I do not intend to go into any great debate on these issues. I repeat what I said at the beginning of my speech tonight, and that is that this legislation has been handled in a way that I wish so much other legislation which has passed through this Parliament in recent months could have been. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to this Parliament's shame that last Thursday, 25 May, a very shabby exercise was undertaken aimed not at healing the damaging and divisive debate on this nation's immigration policy but at exacerbating and maintaining division. It was an obvious political stunt and was seen to be such by the nation, by the media and I think even, in the end, by this Parliament. As a result, it failed. It failed basically because the coalition's record, despite the rhetoric, surpasses that of the Government. Its record has been clearly and comprehensively documented by Opposition leaders in the debate that took place at that time and by those on our side of politics in this debate this evening. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UE4">Mr BLANCHARD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Moore)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.56)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill and its associated Bill. These are important Bills which certainly deserve close scrutiny by members on both sides of the House. Like the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), I feel that this debate has erased some of the bitterness associated with similar debates on migration issues in this and the other chamber in recent times. Certainly those who have contributed to this debate have put the record right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is long overdue. The present Migration Act has proved to be ineffective in meeting the human demands placed on it. These demands are really the result of this country being one to which many people wish to migrate. It is seen as an el dorado to many in other countries. Certainly over the past few years an unprecedented number of people have applied to come to Australia. Obviously we cannot take them all. This means that the selection procedures and their application must be seen to be both fair and equitable. Decisions are often hard to make in individual cases. There are always borderline cases which demand some final ministerial discretion. This again makes it important that the review procedures themselves be seen to be fair and equitable. This legislation is aimed at producing both better selection and better review procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> In the postwar period Australia has been transformed from a monocultural society to a more polyethnic multicultural society. No-one, except racial bigots, can deny that we are the richer for the implanting of cultural diversity into this country. We cannot ignore the fact that since the end of World War II and particularly following the Vietnam war, Australia has become more acutely aware of her geographical membership of the Asia-Pacific region and of her direct involvement with several countries of the region. Increasingly, for a variety of reasons-some political and others economic and linked to trading relationships-we have as a nation in recent times been compelled to come to terms with the social, political and geographic reality: we are part of Asia. These changes of the postwar era have given the question of Australian identity a new sense of urgency. It was much easier in previous years to bandy the phrase, `We are British to our bootstraps'. Our cultural diversity today makes the task of forging an Australian identity more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> The FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies identified citizenship as the ultimate expression of a commitment to Australia. No-one can disagree that immigration policy should be developed in the national interest for all Australians, as the FitzGerald report stated. That does not mean that we should discriminate in favour of or against any one nation. It does mean that family reunion is, and must remain, a key feature in our immigration policies; that we have a right to choose those with the skills and experience which will benefit Australia; that we have a right to choose who should be admitted under the refugee or special humanitarian program. Over 21 per cent of our population, or 3.5 million persons, were born overseas. I am to be classified amongst that huge number. More than one-third of the overseas born were from Britain and the Republic of Ireland. The importance of our immigration program in the post-war era is evident from the fact that since 1946, 40 per cent of our growth in population has been due to overseas migration and 60 per cent to natural increase. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years the migration program has put a tremendous strain on the staff of the Department. I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Mr David Jolly and his staff at the Perth office for their help and assistance in the variety of migration problems that come to the attention of a Federal member. I am informed that the workload in the Perth office has increased at a greater rate than in any other office of the Department in Australia. Certainly, Western Australia proportionately has the largest migrant population. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to one of the new proposals, which is to replace the present points system with a floating pass mark system. Already in this debate there has been a great deal of discussion about this matter. I do not wish to delay the House by continuing it. I think most honourable members would agree that the old points system was far from satisfactory. It created a great deal of unrest, particularly amongst applicants and their families. Whether the new system will improve the situation will be judged after it has been in operation for at least two years. Nevertheless, it will allow more flexibility in assessing prospective migrants. There is still, however, a need-and the Government has seen that need-for the Government to keep a cap on the intake so that it can remain in control of the numbers coming into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to commend the Government on its two-tier system of review. Again, this has been discussed at some length by previous speakers. The first tier review by specialist officers within the Department will speed up the decision-making process. Theirs will be an unenviable task, as they will find themselves in the position of making more adverse decisions than positive decisions because of the excess of applicants over places available. The second tier review is the important review. This will be conducted by the Immigration Review Tribunal. I welcome the fact that an attempt has been made to avoid creating the excesses of court like adversarial procedures which have been adopted and are being used by other tribunals. The system, whilst it excludes lawyers and also the Department, will still allow for interpreters who may be in a position to assist the applicant. This is very important in terms of the families of those from non-English speaking countries. I agree with the Minister that a non-confrontational approach in a non-threatening atmosphere is a better approach to the review of administrative decisions. However, I welcome, as indeed other members in this debate have welcomed, the retention of the ministerial power to make the ultimate decision as to who should enter Australia and who should remain here. Members on both sides of the House will agree that this Bill is a great improvement on the existing Act. It will create a fairer selection procedure and a fairer review system. On those grounds I support the Bill before the House. </PARA>

<PARA> These Bills are the conclusion of a rather long process of review of Australia's immigration policies, notably the review undertaken and reported on by the FitzGerald Commission to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies. It was not with the setting up of that inquiry and its report that the issue came to light. For some years now there has been dissatisfaction with the working of the immigration process and there has been an acknowledgment of the problems in it. This Bill attempts to address those problems and to provide solutions. Along with, I am sure, many other members on both sides, I do not feel it is a perfect solution, but those of us who have spent many hours discussing the alternatives and the proposals have had to come to the conclusion that this is one of those areas where there is no easy solution and that whatever we propose is manifestly imperfect. However, this changed system attempts to address in a realistic way the very real problems that have been building up in the system of immigration review. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the contribution of the FitzGerald report, but I would also like to acknowledge that I think this Bill has its genesis, at least partly, in a number of legal decisions. I, along with a number of my parliamentary colleagues, have become increasingly concerned at what appears to be an interest of judges in involving themselves in how migrants ought to be selected for this country. Although I am a lay person, I have been mystified by the conclusions of the judges on occasions in ruling on cases before them. It seems to me that parliamentary and government intent on the process that was desired to be undertaken or thought desirable to be undertaken was clear. Some of those judicial decisions have unearthed complexities and possibilities that those of us who have been involved in the process for years would never have dreamt were possible. One can only hope that this legislation will rectify the problems that those decisions have raised for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), in his speech, made the statement that he believed that this Bill would lead to a lot of legal processes and lengthy court cases. I think that is probably right. It is probably inevitable, whatever we do in this area. However, there is quite an immigration review industry in this country, partly because of the build-up of pressures of people wanting to enter the country and the reduction in the last decade of the migration program. We have had some significant refugee programs in that time, and some pressures close to hand and overseas from people who feel that they need to come to this country, and from many others who feel that they want to. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether it is my imagination, but it seems to me that the problem of illegal immigration has grown in recent years. When I entered Parliament in 1974, 15 years ago, we were starting to see the process of people with imperfect English coming here on visitors' visas and, when they arrived, telling the immigration officials that they believed that the approval of that visitor's visa meant that they had been accepted as migrants. There was great concern that people were being told that in their country that was correct and were being preyed on by people who knew very well that the approval of a visitor's visa did anything but give approval for them to stay in Australia for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my conclusion that since then the whole process has not so much changed in kind-that industry continues-but it has become more sophisticated and streamlined. As we hope we are closing one loophole another is discovered, and plane loads of illegal immigrants arrive in this country, something that would have been unthinkable 15 years ago and certainly a little further back than that. That may be partly as a result of pressures in the area and an awareness that Australia is a place where people have the possibility of humanitarian consideration of their case. I suspect it is also because the process of appeal and review has become so much the province of the lawyers, the courts and the judges. That has encouraged that sort of traffic in migrants-in human beings. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years we have all witnessed many sad and worthy cases in which Ministers have sought to deport people who had no right to be here and whose story might well have been one that would appeal to one's softer nature. But those people had no right to be here and resided in Australia clearly in the knowledge that they had no right to reside here. We have all heard anecdotes in this debate, and I have a clear recollection of a case in which I was involved as the honourable member for Moncrieff. A married couple, illegal immigrants from Hong Kong, had come to Australia with two children on a visitor's visa. Their pattern of activity and residence since they had been in the country-which, by then, was six or seven years-made it clear that from day one they had intended to be nothing other than illegal immigrants. In the time they had been here they had had three more children who, under our previous citizenship laws, were Australian citizens. By the time they were detected and under an imminent deportation order-and that was when I first encountered them-the children who arrived with them had started school at Catholic schools and were as Australian as any child whose parents had a perfect entitlement to be here. I was approached by a school principal, who pleaded with me that these children were really Australian children and that it was not right to send them to Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA> My reaction to all that was essentially anger with the parents, that they would do that to their own children. Nevertheless, the parents had followed a fairly sophisticated pattern of activity and residence from the time they had come to Australia. They had owned and sold homes and businesses; some businesses had been successful and some had not. At that stage the father, whilst under a deportation order, had just purchased another business. Part of the basis of his plea was, `Give me a chance to make a go of this one and see what a good citizen I can be'. I may be a little on the conservative side, and maybe my school mistress background emerges on occasions like this, but my simple view is that people who come here with the intention of breaking our citizenship laws do not make a very good beginning as good Australian citizens. They are behind the eight-ball with me when they start. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, there are cases in relation to which I too have gone to the Minister. Various honourable members have tonight referred to the importance of ministerial discretion. Initially, this Bill would have eliminated ministerial discretion. In referring to the process that has culminated in this Bill before the House, I have so far referred to the FitzGerald inquiry, parliamentarians' contributions, through criticism, and the legal decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that I ought to put on a par with that the contribution of the Opposition to the final form of this Bill. We were disturbed at the removal of ministerial discretion, but not because we want to be able to go and ask for favours for those who may have caught our ear. I know that I speak for both Government and Opposition members when I say that anyone who spends any time in this place inevitably encounters the totally worthy case of someone applying to migrate who does not fit the categories or the rules, who, so far as the provisions are concerned, appears to be a square peg trying to be pushed into a round hole. One knows that one is dealing with a person who is entirely worthy, a person that the country would welcome, a person who has proceeded in a legal way-not in the way of the illegal immigrants to whom I have just referred-and a person from whom this country would benefit by having as a resident and ultimately as a citizen. Surely it is the ultimate objective of any immigration legislation to identify, among the people who want to come to this country, those who could make a good contribution to it and would be good citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> During my 15 years in Parliament I have taken four such cases to various immigration Ministers. It has to be an extraordinary case and the application must be entirely worthy before I take such a course to gain approval. I have not always been successful. Indeed, I am sorry to say that, in those few cases that I have taken forward, I was rather less successful under the Fraser Government than I have been under the Hawke Government. It is important, when dealing in this human area, to have a mechanism by which individual human aspects of a case can be taken into account. When one is dealing with human beings, there are as many different cases as there are people on the face of this earth. I am pleased that, after the Senate held up the Bill, the Government has decided to reconsider the matter and reintroduce minsterial discretion in specialised cases. Of course, it is up to the Minister to decide whether to use that discretion. If we had a Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs who believed that it was inappropriate that ministerial discretion should be exercised, it would be open to that Minister not to exercise it. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the legal processes that I referred to earlier, we have a very big backlog and some very real problems in processing immigration review cases. I think it is fair to say that that appears to be producing a situation that we do not want. I would defend the right of the government, rather than the courts, to determine the immigration program. Even while I am in opposition, even if I do not necessarily agree with the Government's programs, I will defend its right to determine the immigration program. I will certainly defend the right of Parliament to be involved at all stages. It is possible that this new approach of putting into regulations a lot of detail that was not there before will extend the legalistic nature of the handling of immigration decisions. On the other hand, it is a defence of government policy that clearly is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to the operations of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. Over the years there have been different suggestions about having a parliamentary committee on immigration, though not necessarily for the reason for which this Committee is being set up. It appears that in this case it is an entirely appropriate way of handling regulations under the legislation. I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted the Opposition's submission that there should be equal numbers of Government members and Opposition members on the Committee, although of course the Government has the right to supply the Chairman. I hope very much that the Committee will act in a way that achieves the objectives of its establishment. Actually, I am quite confident that it will. I hope that that will continue for years into the future, if the Committee endures that long. I hope that the Minister's act of goodwill towards the Opposition in accepting the changes that were requested will be vindicated by the actions of both Government and Opposition members. I look forward to serving on that Committee. I think that contributions to the debate by others who are clearly members of the Committee indicate that it has an excellent chance of operating in a spirit of goodwill.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, I do not want to protract the debate unduly by just repeating what others have said. I have sought to highlight those areas that I think are most important and I have much pleasure in joining with my Opposition colleagues to support the Bill, particularly for the reasons outlined by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4I4">Mr LEO McLEAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the House is absolutely correct. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill is such an all-encompassing Bill that there are very few things in it that one could criticise and therefore there are many things that one could support. I think for the first time the Bill adds a systematic approach to the immigration system in Australia. The approach is spelt out by legislation and ensures that the Government will be able to have some control over its immigration program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major features of the Bill are a mechanism to ensure that the planned intakes are not exceeded and that there will be a mechanism for providing people with an appeal system. There will also be a provision in the Bill to make commercial immigration advisers accountable to their clients. There has been a formal mechanism for review in the legislation since 1982 but it has been administrative rather than legislative and sometimes the powers have been rather difficult to appreciate. The new two-tiered system will be fair, economical, informal and, most importantly, quick. In my electorate, there are probably more people not born in Australia than in any other electorate in the country. What really gets on their goat is the fact that the review process takes so long. On behalf of my constituents I congratulate the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) on the new system. Its informality and absence of legalisms will be the key to the operations of the new Immigration Review Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal also will be designed to permit claimants to put the merits of their cases in a factual and straightforward way. They will not need formal representation though they will be allowed to have someone appear with them to assist them in their case. The Tribunal will examine the papers relating to the case-that is, the material put forward by the applicant and that prepared in the course of the primary decision of the review process. If the Tribunal can make a decision favourable to the applicant on that material, it will do so and that will be the end of the matter. If it cannot, it can make such a decision on the papers. If it cannot make a decision on the papers, it will invite the applicant to give oral evidence before it makes a final decision. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the applicant will be able to be accompanied by an adviser. One would hope that people will not end up being accompanied by legal advisers but by people who are versed in the system and who could act as friendly assistants in the process. Of course, the Minister may override the decision of the Tribunal in cases where a more favourable decision could be established. In those cases, quite properly, the Minister will have to make a statement to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the applications by people already in Australia, once a decision is taken and reviewed the applicants should have to leave Australia if the application is not favourable to their point of view. The decision on any further application will not be renewable. One of the difficulties people in my electorate have is that at present the process offers numerous avenues for review. Unscrupulous people in both their communities and the wider community try to encourage people to go to the ultimate type of review. That gets people's hopes up. In the end they have spent a lot of money and achieved nothing. Because it will be far quicker and easier to understand, I think the new system will be a far better one to have. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing I find most satisfying about this legislation is that the Minister has finally decided to take action against those people who provide advice for a fee-the so-called immigration agents. The current legislation, prior to this Bill being enacted, simply requires a notification by a person who intends to act as a migration agent. Those provisions will be repealed by this Bill, which will substitute sanctions aimed at ensuring a responsible commercial relationship. Advisers will be committing an offence when they claim that they can influence or have influenced the making of a certain decision either in their own right or through a third person. </PARA>
<PARA> I also hope that they will be committing an offence when they take people's money and fail even to lodge an application, as has been the case with many people who have been into my electorate office. For a long time I have been concerned to have some regulation introduced into the migration agent industry. There are many very reliable and honest people providing a service to people at a reasonable cost; but unfortunately, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) would well know, a number of people who have set themselves up as migration agents are, quite frankly, ripping these people off. Not only do they not know what they are talking about but they charge exorbitant prices. I have had complaints about solicitors charging $1,000 or $2,000 for writing a letter to the Minister on behalf of a client. In fact, the cheek of one solicitor is beyond belief. He sent one of his clients to me. He charged the person $1,000 for writing a letter to me asking whether I would see the person. The person then came and asked me to write a letter to the Minister. This solicitor ripped that poor unfortunate person off for $1,000. They are the sorts of disgraceful things that were happening in the migration agent area. </PARA>
<PARA> Gloria Bourke in Sydney was one of the more notorious agents. She operated in my electorate for a long time, cheating people. She seems to have left the country in a hurry. Fortunately, that is good for the people of my electorate. Unfortunately, she left too quickly for the law to catch up with her. Sol Baltinos of the New Settlers Federation-a person whom my friend the honourable member for Dundas has criticised frequently in the past-has failed to lodge papers for a number of my constituents despite assuring them that he would be taking money for membership of his so-called federation. He has been charging them thousands of dollars-stealing from them; stealing from people who are very afraid of the position they are in. He is a person to whom the old Australian term `bludger' would certainly apply. If there was ever a bludger in Australia, it is Sol Baltinos. </PARA>
<PARA> These leaches prey on people who are very vulnerable. They are victims who have usually exhausted all the regular avenues of review. More often than not they are illegal immigrants in Australia and they are desperate to hear that there may be a way around the system. The claims of influence with either a Minister or someone in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs at a price that are peddled by these agents are readily believed by these unfortunate people. Until now they have had no comeback. </PARA>
<PARA> In these regulations the Minister proposes that there should be some way to stop this. The Minister should be commended for that. In the legislation the Minister has also proposed that there be regulations that will be renewed every two years. That is a good idea because unfortunately in the past this piece of legislation has been set in concrete. It has been difficult to change. In the immigration area regulations are probably the best way to do it. The fact that the Minister is proposing to set up a committee of the Parliament to deal with it is a very good idea because it allows people who are involved in the area to have input and a say in it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Minister has made a small mistake in setting up a new joint committee to do it. The most appropriate way would have been to provide a reference to the various Senate and House of Representatives committees, which could have met from time to time on a joint basis and made decisions on these matters. To digress just a little, I think that we are now adopting a position in the Parliament where if someone comes up with a problem we set up a new committee. I think we should be using the standing committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate to deal with these matters, rather than setting up a new joint committee to look at the specific problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Minister for the two areas of the legislation that I have outlined. If it ensures that those who batten on to desperate people are brought under some sort of control, for that reason alone this will be a very important piece of legislation. If it ensures that the Gloria Bourkes and Sol Baltinoses can no longer bludge on unfortunate people, Minister Ray will have done a very important thing. I commend the Bill to the House on behalf of my Party and the people of my electorate, who probably have more need for and access to services in the immigration area than the people of any other electorate in the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 I pay tribute to the many migrants who have come to this country, particularly those who came after the Second World War. Everyone in this House tonight is the son, grandson, daughter or granddaughter of migrants. Our indigenous population is only about 1 1/2 per cent of the total population, so we are all sons and daughters, if you like, of migrants. What an important role they have played in developing this great nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the lateness of the hour, it is not my intention to speak for very long, but I wish to say how disappointed I was, as were other honourable members, with the Government's actions last week in trying to split the coalition or gain political advantage on the question of migration. Migration is one of the most important issues this country faces. It is important that we get our migration policy right, which is why I welcome this Bill and some of the improvements that will be made to the migration system through its application. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not often that we get a chance to speak in the Parliament about migration. Most of the honourable members who spoke before me have spoken eloquently about the Bill, and I do not intend to go over what they have said, but I want to raise a few issues on which the Minister Assisting the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Holding) might say a few words or the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) might take on notice. No doubt the Minister has already studied them. I know that he is fairly well versed in what is happening in the country in regard to migration. </PARA>
<PARA> There are five categories of migrants: independent and concessional, family, skilled and business, refugee and humanitarian, and special immigration. One matter that has been raised with me by people in my constituency relates to the business category. Rumours are circulating that people are involved in what the Minister calls scams in this area. In the business category, a person who has $500,000 to invest in a commercial enterprise which has the potential to increase exports or decrease imports, create jobs or introduce new technology has a good opportunity of migrating to Australia. A rumour is circulating in various electorates that some people who have wanted to migrate to Australia but have not had $500,000 have borrowed the amount, have paid interest on the money and paid some of it back before coming to Australia; and, after having migrated to Australia, have given the money back. I do not know whether this is possible, but it is certainly a strong rumour in my electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be investigated. I agree with the Minister that anyone who migrates under those pretences, or any pretences whatsoever, is jumping the queue ahead of people who have a right to be here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill touches on the matter of illegal immigrants. Although in Australia we do not have the problems with illegal immigrants that the United States, West Germany and other countries have, we still have a problem. I have noticed that some media people have a filing system with articles on shark attacks, the Bogle-Chandler case, the love life of Princess Margaret, something about Don Mackay and so on. Each month they pull something out-Don Mackay one month, Princess Margaret another month, and so on. If they find an illegal immigrant, they think that is wonderful because then they can go to town and play on the bleeding hearts of Australia, giving all the reasons why the person should stay here-never mind that the person has broken the law and is jumping the queue in front of people who should be here first. So I have very little sympathy for those people. I have a great deal of sympathy for Ministers who in the past have had to face this barrage. Of course, some Ministers have given in, for one reason or another, and perhaps that is why some members of the Opposition are saying that they do not agree with the total discretion of the Minister being taken away. No doubt there are some genuine cases, but I would say that in the majority of cases these people do not deserve to jump the queue in front of others and should be sent back to their country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I would like to touch on is the matter of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. I know that this is a health problem, but it is my belief that every migrant coming to Australia should be checked for the HIV infection before he comes here, with the intending migrant paying for it. Refugees should be checked in Australia, and we would have to pay for that. I do not think that it should stop there. Because of the nature of the HIV infection, whilst I am not a medical specialist I understand from what I read that sometimes it does not become evident for a number of months after infection. After these people arrive in Australia there should be another check, perhaps within the first 12 months, which should pick up about 90 per cent of cases. If these people do have the HIV infection, I do not believe they should be given permanent residency. This is not because I do not believe on a humanitarian level that we should not look after these people; of course we should. But the cost to Australia in looking after people who are already here who are infected by the HIV virus is going to be absolutely horrendous. It will take all our resources to look after them. If more infected people are coming in, not only will we have to look after them but it will cost an absolute fortune. In addition, there is the risk that they could pass on that infection to other people. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I would like to raise-and because the hour is getting late it will be the last one-is the question of visitors' visas. A number of people in my electorate have wanted their relatives to come to Australia from different countries throughout the world. In the countries of origin the embassy staff interview these people and decide whether they are coming as visitors or have another intention. In other words, they are a little afraid that they will become illegal immigrants. I have here a copy of a letter that has been sent to the relative of a constituent of mine. I will just take the time of the House to read this letter. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to your application for a visitor visa for Australia. Under current policy relating to applications received from persons seeking to visit Australia, visas are only granted to those persons who are assessed as being genuine visitors. In examining applications an assessment is made by the Australian Officer at this Embassy as to whether a person may wish to obtain visitor entry for other purposes, such as residence, employment or study. Careful consideration has been given to your application, but after taking all factors into account it has been assessed that the true purpose of your proposed entry into Australia may not be for tourism. In the circumstances, I am sorry to have to tell you that your application has not been approved. Yours sincerely . . .</PARA>
<PARA>A number of people have come to my office and said that what this letter is really saying is that `Your brother' or `cousin', or whoever, `is telling a lie; he or she does not want to come for the purpose of a visit'. I know it is a very touchy subject and one has to be very subtle about it, but I just wonder whether perhaps the wording of that letter could be changed slightly so as not to give that impression. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to again impress upon the minds of everyone the importance of immigration to this country, particularly as, with our present tax regime, it is becoming almost impossible for young couples to have families and, therefore, to populate Australia by natural means. I hope things improve in the near future so that we can increase our population in that way as well as by migration. For the future of Australia, I believe that both natural growth and migration are the means of making Australia a prosperous nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that the hour is late. However, being a migrant myself, I would like to add an authentic voice to this immigration debate. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill and the Migration Amendment Bill represent a major overhaul of our immigration policies and give a long overdue legislative base from which to introduce regulations to govern our immigration intake. These regulations will enable everyone to know what criteria apply, those criteria having been set before this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation contains a number of measures dealing with illegal immigrants and it sets a legislative base for review of decisions-a two-tier system of internal review and a review by the Immigration Review Tribunal. It also sets down a legislative base to achieve a total number of immigrants in a particular year, specified by the Government according to our ability to receive and absorb migrants and to provide them with the necessary services. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that this policy and the regulations will ensure is that whatever criteria are set down, they will not take any account of the race, colour, nationality or religion of the people that we are going to receive. In whatever way we select our migrants, it will not be based on colour or race. Of course, that is a big advance on the past. </PARA>
<PARA> My Party is not quite innocent as far as racism is concerned in immigration. Our national platform of 1904 stated that we had to choose migrants so as to maintain racial purity. Our platform went on later to establish the categories of people that we should receive-a mixture of British and non-British people-and we finished up later with the white Australia policy. We were accused of that recently in a debate to which I do not want to refer tonight. However, whilst I do not know the history of the Opposition's policies, I can say that I know its practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I came to Australia from Italy in 1954 on a ship called the Neptunia. Just before we landed at Fremantle, a number of immigration officers accompanied by a couple of doctors came onto the ship, and they looked at our fingernails. I wondered whether they were checking to see whether our personal hygiene was okay; but no, they were looking at us, and at our fingers, to establish whether we had a negro ancestry. That was the practice during the period of the great arch-reactionary Prime Minister Bob Menzies. So, if we look at history, I do not think that either major party has much to be proud of in regard to immigration policies or practices. However, we have moved a long way since then. By the time the Whitlam Labor Government was elected, we had a policy which did not discriminate, and we had a practice whereby we started to look on migrants not as factory fodder, not as people brought here just to work in factories and to turn the wheels of industry, but as people who had human needs. That practice was continued during the period of the Fraser Government. I pay a tribute to former Prime Minister Fraser, because his views on race and colour and on that aspect of our immigration policy, or race and colour in general, were very humane. I think it will take the rest of his Party a long time to catch up; but I will come back to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention how our immigration policy developed in a bipartisan way to look at immigration as a means to increase our population, to be humane about it, and not to be selective in regard to race or colour, until about 1984, when Blainey suddenly discovered that we had too many Asians here and that this was the breaking point that the Australian community just would not tolerate. He did not conduct a survey; he just guessed this. As an academic I would have expected more of him. I would have expected him to make a study of the population's tolerance. He never did so. The surveys were done later by the media. If we ask someone whether he wants a slit-eyed Asian, or someone like that-using derogatory terms-as his neighbour or to marry his daughter of course the answer will be no. Blainey will be vindicated by a mass of rednecks if we put the question that way. Unfortunately, following Blainey's racist outbursts we have seen the former Leader of the Opposition voicing his concern about immigration. Last year on 1 August he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do believe that if in the eyes of some in the community it-</PARA>
<PARA>meaning Asian immigration-</PARA>
<PARA>is too great, it would be in our immediate term interest and supportive of social cohesion if it were slowed down a little . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He was followed on 12 August by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who said that the figures showed that there were too many Asians coming into the country. On 9 August Senator Stone said:</PARA>
<PARA>Asian immigration has to be slowed. It is no use dancing around the bushes. </PARA>
<PARA>I accept that the former leadership of the Opposition is now on the back bench. I hope that we are returning to some consensus as far as our immigration policies are concerned, not only in relation to intake but also as far as dealing with people who are already here by giving them equal opportunity and equal rights and supporting multicultural development. We should give rights to people whether they have come from Asia, Africa, Europe, England or elsewhere to be just as Australian as they wish, as anybody else who is of any other tradition. It is not the privilege of only those who migrated here from the United Kingdom a few generations ago to be Australian. It is a privilege that we have to extend to everybody if he wishes to take part in the building of this nation because that is what immigration is about. I wish that the consensus that we are talking about in this Parliament were extended to Opposition parties.</PARA>
<PARA> I have had to face four elections. The first candidate that I stood against issued a letter mentioning my name, which I changed 30 years ago never thinking that I would be in politics. I had a long name which was very hard to spell. My brother who migrated to Canada changed it to Kent and my brother who came here before me changed his name to Kent. So I naturally took it on without any thought that I would want to sound English, British or whatever. It was easier to spell. There are only four letters in the name Kent. The first thing Opposition candidates do when they oppose me is dig up my old name, distort and misspell it, and they print in the literature in block letters that I am foreign born. They suggest that I am somewhat less than others and that I should not have the privilege to serve this nation because I did not come here generations ago. As a matter of fact, I am a second generation Australian. My father came here a year or two before me. I followed him; I followed my family. My father and mother are buried in my electorate and my grandchildren are growing up here. </PARA>
<PARA> If someone wants to tell me that I am not serving this nation as well as anyone else, I want to see him outside. But nothing helps; people never learn. They think they will appeal to the rednecks if they print my old name. I am not ashamed of it. I can spell it out; that is not a problem. They highlight the fact that I am foreign born and suggest that I am somewhat less than one who came here three, four or five generations ago. The same people would not put those who came here 40,000 years ago on a pedestal. They look down on them too. They cannot have it both ways. We are all equal. We are all human beings. We are all here working together to build a better future for our children. Or are we trying to judge each other by our ancestry?</PARA>
<PARA> It will be a sad day for this nation if we turn child against child in our schools and judge each other on the basis of our origins, whether Irish, British, European, Asian, Aboriginal, or anything else. I can tell the House one thing: I agree with the former leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), with respect to one Australia. I am for one Australia; we are all for one Australia. But it depends what we mean by one Australia and what we mean by multiculturalism. Multiculturalism certainly does not mean that we will build little Italys, Greeces, Yugoslavias, Vietnams, Irelands, or United Kingdoms in this country. We will build one nation, an Australian nation, but we will be of varied origins and will all have the right to contribute and to bring our heritage here-just as the Irish did, just as the Aboriginals did, and just as other migrants will continue to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a great friend of the British. I admire them and have done so since the war. They are a people with backbone. They stood up alone against Hitler, for which I greatly admire them. I admire Britain's institutions, its democracy and its Parliament. We brought from Britain our trade union movement, as well as our individual freedoms and a free press. However, let nobody think that I, who admire that system and will fight to maintain it, will be put down by people who say, `He is foreign born and has a foreign name. Let's distort it and use it as propaganda so that a few rednecks might vote against him because of his name'. Honourable members opposite can tell whatever party member might contemplate standing against me that these tactics do not help. We thrashed them; we trounced them very soundly four times in Hotham. If that does not prove the tolerance of the average Australian, nothing will. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians will not follow anyone down that path of discrimination and intolerance. Anyone who takes up that path will lose not only the migrant vote, but that of every decent Australian. My advice is that, while we might have different political views and different ideas about how we can help this nation and create a better future for it, we should never divide on racial grounds, because we came from 70 or 80 different nationalities and our children and grandchildren will go together to school and will work shoulder to shoulder in factories or offices. If we ever judge each other by our ancestors, it will be a sad day. I propose that we look at our individual merits, our individual achievements and our individual contributions to this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with a great deal of interest to the contribution of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). I am a bit disappointed that some of the things he said were said about the past. I have found in a number of different facets of life that hindsight is 20 : 20 vision and that, looking back, one would do it differently with regard to a number of aspects of Australia's approach to the migration program over the years. It was not as easy at the time to perceive those sorts of situations as it is now, but overall I do not think for a moment that Australia has anything to be ashamed of in terms of its immigration program over very many years. I always feel very aggrieved when people within or outside Australia accuse Australians of being racist. Australia has a magnificent record in terms of its acceptance of people from many different nations. The honourable member for Hotham mentioned 80 nations, but the people who make up the modern Australian state come from well over 100 different nations. The percentage of overseas born, as a proportion of the total population, is second only to the figure for Israel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have, I think, in so many ways provided an example of which we can all be proud and for which we should argue strongly. We should never allow any critics to suggest that we are in any way inferior to any other nation in the world in terms of racial tolerance. If one looks at countries in the region and outside the region we stand up as a nation very well indeed. Just before I leave this subject, I think that the presence of the honourable member for Hotham in this chamber demonstrates very clearly the acceptance by the Australian people of people from all different backgrounds and the capacity that such people have to make a success of their lives in Australia. If honourable members look at successful stories in Australia, they will find that they are the stories of migrants in so many cases. Many migrants from so many different countries have contributed--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the House has encouraged a long speaking list from his colleagues. I thought that his colleagues were being limited to 10 minutes, but some speak a little longer than others. I will return to the subject under discussion. Australia provides the opportunity for people from so many different countries to make a success of their lives in this nation. I think it is something that we can be inordinately proud of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill has been brought about simply because we have had the development, in a very real sense, of an immigration appeal industry. A ridiculous state of affairs has arrived whereby people within that immigration appeal industry are creating a situation which has virtually brought the administration of immigration policy in this country to a standstill. The general community is very aggrieved by the fact, for example, that some people who have no right to claim entry to Australia, nevertheless simply by being here have been able to have access to legal representation paid for by the Australian taxpayer. That is just one example of how the situation has developed which has caused very real concern throughout the general community. This Bill is an attempt to overcome the problem of the immigration appeal industry which we have seen developing over recent years. What has also happened is that the final delineation of immigration policy has, to a certain extent, been taken away from the Parliament and placed in the hand of the legal fraternity. That is a completely wrong situation to have developed. I commend the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) for doing something about overcoming that situation. Obviously immigration policy in this country should be made by the Parliament. It should not come about as a result of legal interpretation outside this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In the original form the Government put forward some suggestions which the Opposition took exception to-in particular what appeared to the Opposition to be a handing over of the role of responsibility from the Minister and the Parliament to the Secretary of the Department and to the bureaucrats generally. I am happy to pay tribute to the Minister and his officials for the way in which those differences and difficulties have been worked through in consultation over some time now and we have achieved in large measure agreement as to the final shape of the legislation. If we can continue to work together-part of the Bill brings about a situation where that cooperative effort can be maintained-we will be going a long way towards developing a much stronger, unified approach to the whole difficult question of the administration and development of immigration policy generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that this cooperative effort has occurred. I hope that we will see a continuation of that strong wish which comes from this side of the Parliament to develop a cooperative approach to what are essentially, as we have seen over the years, very sensitive policy issues. Finally, I am extremely pleased that the Minister and the Government have agreed to the fact that the formulation and development of immigration policy should be maintained within the Parliament and that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs will retain the pre-eminent role in policy administration, which was the case in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that the hour is late and pressure is being placed upon us not only by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) but by our colleagues on both sides of the chamber in their keenness to terminate this debate and leave this place at a reasonable hour. It is early in the morning. I am pleased to speak in this debate because the Northern Territory, as most honourable members will know, is an extremely multicultural society. This landmark legislation will be of immense benefit to my constituents and will give them a great deal of pleasure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that migration not only plays a very significant role in the long term growth of our community by providing an economic base, skills for the labour force and capital infrastructure but also, most significantly in my view, adds essentially to the social fabric of our society. It is that aspect of the legislation and particularly the family reunion program that I am keen to support. The Northern Territory in recent times has been the beneficiary of a large number of migrants who have come to Australia as refugees from South East Asia, particularly from East Timor or Vietnam. If they have not come as refugees, they have come under the family reunion program. They have added significantly to the Northern Territory with their culture and their skills. </PARA>
<PARA> It was stated earlier in the debate that one-fifth of Australia's residents in 1986 had been born overseas. Most of those migrants chose to live in our cities. Perth's population had the highest proportion of overseas born-33.5 per cent-and Darwin in my electorate had 27.7 per cent of its population born overseas. It is significant, as I said, that the Asian population has increased dramatically over the past decade. This trend is particularly noticeable in Darwin. Darwin is the Australian city that is closest to Asia. That is often referred to as Australia's front door. I certainly acknowledge that it is. It reflects our longstanding connections with our northern neighbours, particularly most recently the Philippines and Indonesia and, within Indonesia, East Timor. Of the recent South East Asian born migrants in Darwin, almost one-third or 29.7 per cent were born in the Philippines and 17.7 per cent in Timor. Vietnam has provided 16.2 per cent of our migrants and Malaysia 13.2 per cent. The general principles of this Government's migration policy, this landmark policy, not only served the national interest but are also non-discriminatory. The policy fulfils the most important of humanitarian obligations to refugees, and the family reunion component, as I said, is of essential and vital importance. </PARA>
<PARA> To me, the dramatic impact of this legislation is its rejection of racism. The debate which the community has seen over recent months has demonstrated that racism is endemic in the attitudes of those who would seek a discriminatory immigration policy. It is a policy which I am pleased to see this Parliament has rejected. This legislation not only reflects a maturity of approach to the immigration issue but also fulfils our obligation to our own citizens and to those who seek to live here. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is the most progressive in this nation's history, and it should be seen as such. It involves a non-discriminatory policy, with the family reunion program being its essential basis. This legislation recognises the separate criteria for family migration. An economic migration system has been put in place which reflects the economic priorities of the nation. A very important attribute of this legislation-indeed, it was commented on at length earlier in this debate-concerns the non-combative review system. </PARA>
<PARA> The detail of the legislation has been discussed at length. I want to complete my remarks by returning for a moment to the issue of multiculturalism. In my view, multiculturalism acknowledges the right of people to maintain their own heritage and culture whilst citizens of this country. It acknowledges the right of people to foster their culture within the constitutional, judicial and administrative framework of the Australian political and social system. It is within that context that we should be discussing multiculturalism in terms of this legislation, because it sets the framework for us to be able to bring migrants into this country who will add significantly to Australia in terms of a multicultural community. I think we should be at one in rejecting the views of people who, for their own reasons-base political motives or in many cases extreme racist motives-would seek to divide this community on the basis of migration and multiculturalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) visited the Northern Territory and the Timorese community hosted a function for him. A broad cross-section of the Timorese community was present. Unfortunately, a parliamentarian from this place, a senator who is a member of the Northern Territory Country-Liberal Party (CLP), attacked a section of that Timorese community because they happened to be supporters of the Fretilin. It is well known that many of the East Timorese community in Darwin arrived there as refugees as a result of the Indonesian occupation in 1975. They still harbour quite justifiable concern about their relations in East Timor and about the way in which Indonesia has occupied that country. When those people have come to this country they have not sought to undermine our democratic processes by remaining concerned about the fate of their relations or their nation-the nation from which they have come as refugees or under the family reunion program. Yet this CLP senator attacked them for having some relationship with and concern for their community. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of attitude is not one which is accepted by the Northern Territory community, and that is because of the multiracial and multicultural nature of that community. It is an attitude which should be rejected by this Parliament. I invite everyone in this Parliament and, indeed, all Australians, to visit Darwin in the dry season and to attend on Thursday evening the markets down on Mindil Beach, because there one can see a microcosm of multicultural Australia. One can see 3,000 or 4,000 people happily enjoying themselves with people from Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, East Timor, and all the nations of Europe-as well as white Anglo-Saxon or Celtic Australians. They are all there together, as a celebration of multiculturalism. They are there sharing their own cultures and the ethnic diversity of our community. They are doing it in a cohesive way as an expression of their democratic right and of the value of a multicultural society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is the culmination of the protracted process of the review of the Australian migration legislation. It is unfortunate that this process has coincided with a period of ugly and divisive debate on matters of race and ethnicity. Whilst one can understand, and almost excuse, the excesses of minority groups, the role of mainstream politicians in this debate has been disappointing. It is therefore appropriate to welcome the return of a bipartisan approach to the non-discriminatory nature of our migration program, as has been displayed by honourable members opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), in leading for the Opposition, gave an interpretation of what the Government had expected during that debate of bipartisan cooperation. I do not think that it was felt at any stage that we wished the other side of the political fence to agree to dotting the i's and crossing the t's in relation to everything that was going on. However, one of the base requirements on which we sought some leadership was a return to the non-discriminatory base. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the migration program necessarily has economic requirements, underlying those economic requirements are important humanitarian concerns. I know that most honourable members who have taken part in the debate and most members of this House, through their work in their electorate offices, know the requirements of being able to contend with that humanitarian base. One of the difficulties with the economic requirements of the program-this was alluded to by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) tonight-is the recognition of overseas qualifications. I was pleased to see that on Tuesday in an answer in this chamber the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) assured us yet again that in trying to speed up the recognition of qualifications of tradespeople coming to Australia we are in no way impinging upon the need for proper training. He said that tradespersons are designed to deal with peak shortages. They are not designed as a substitute for training but to supplement the supply of tradespersons trained in Australia. That is important because it is something that people who have been against the nature of our present program have latched onto in criticising the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us has three major features. It puts in place a decision making system in which policies governing entry to and stay in Australia will for the first time be spelt out in the migration legislative scheme. I am not as pessimistic about the dangers of this as the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), among others, have indicated they are. The due process of the legislation should not involve the great difficulties that are envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major feature is the two-tier review system: first an internal review and then a review by the Immigration Review Tribunal. That body will have a statutory independence and a separate administrative structure from the Department. The objectives outlined by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) in his second reading speech in the Senate were that this process would be fair, economical, informal and quick. Again, we know from the experience of an electorate office that all of those objectives are absolutely essential. Complex, lengthy, expensive and protracted decision making processes lead to great hardship and do not make for a better understanding of the system and the objectives of government policy. I welcome anything that makes the system simpler for those who have to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major feature is that the legislation spells out the mechanisms for ensuring that planned immigration program intakes are not exceeded. Those are, of course, the so-called capping provisions. I agree that the changes that have been made late in the piece to exclude the applicants of the immediate family-the spouse, dependent children and aged parents-represent a good move which is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> Other features of the package that are welcome include the appointment of a joint parliamentary committee with the purpose of oversighting immigration regulations. I would have to agree, from what we have heard in the debate in this chamber and in the other place, that there seems to be a degree of goodwill about how that committee will go about its work. It should be quite successful. The last point that is worthy of note and emphasis is the Minister's undertaking to review the operations of the Immigration Review Tribunal and report back to the Parliament in two years of its being put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is important to note the part that migrants have played in the development of Australia. While I do not wish to make a controversial issue out of it, the nature of a multicultural Australia is also important. I tend to think that the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) got it right in his contribution. When we are talking about a multicultural Australia, it is not a matter of people going off in all directions; it is very much a matter of sharing-sharing past cultures, past practices and past habits-to make Australia a better place. It is important that that is done under our present parliamentary and legal setup. With that in mind-that multiculturalism is something that is very much a strength of Australian society-we should look at events in this place. At the moment, in another part of the building, there are many of us who are trying to convince ourselves that we are more of Irish descent than not, in a special farewell to the Irish Ambassador. The Irish form a group which has played an important role in the development of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday I had a visit from 90 elderly Macedonians, not only from my electorate and the area of Thomastown-Lalor but from other parts of Melbourne such as Doncaster. One of the pleasing features of that visit was that these people insisted that I join them in traditional folk dancing in the foyer of this building. While my Macedonian dancing is perhaps in need of improvement, the invitation showed that these people recognise this building as being a symbol of Australian life and that they feel at ease in sharing in it as one of Australia's institutions. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Migrants have played, and will continue to play, an important role in Australia's development. This legislation will provide a just framework within which our important migration system can continue. In the spirit of the debate, which has been quite a good one, I conclude my remarks by commending the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) The RAAF Special Purpose Aircraft on which I travelled from Launceston to Sydney on 17 December 1988 landed at Kingsford-Smith Airport at 11.15 p.m. (15 minutes after curfew). No demand was made for the aircraft to break curfew. When it became obvious that the aircraft would not reach Sydney by its scheduled arrival time, the Captain requested from the Civil Aviation Authority a dispensation in order to arrive during curfew, which was granted. Under the current arrangements, there is provision for dispensations to be granted to aircraft, including the VIP fleet, in limited circumstances, to allow landings at Sydney in curfew hours.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No such ``demands'' are or have been made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Minister is aware of the reference contained in the (39th) Annual Report of the SMHEA presented by the Commissioner of the Authority Mr C. C. Halton.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The specific problems seen by the Authority as relating to water quality within the catchments of the Snowy Mountains Area, as proclaimed under the SMHEA Act of 1949, fall within the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA> The escalating volume of discharge of sewage effluents, mainly from tourist developments, into the streams of the region. Some of these streams remain biologically infected particularly during peak tourist periods when treatment facilities can be overloaded.</PARA>
<PARA> Soil disturbance and the impact of erosion products on streams and lakes resulting from the construction of recent and future developments.</PARA>
<PARA> The possible loss of the recreational resource of storages, especially of Lake Jindabyne, as a result of the continual loading of the lakes with excessive amounts of nutrients from the above sources.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) The health risk to downstream users include viral, protozoan and bacterial disease transmission both to casual visitors and residents of the area and the possible effects due to the decomposition of excessive numbers of aquatic flora, especially algae. The possible degradation of Lake Jindabyne would be long term and difficult to reverse.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a), (b) and (c) The Authority carried out a monitoring program of Lake Jindabyne waters at seven locations betwen 1980 and 1986 in order to provide a bench mark of lake behaviour as an aid to subsequent assessments.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the NSW State Pollution Control Commission requires the NSW Health Department or lessees, as appropriate depending on the location, to monitor water quality. During 1988, no samples were taken at locations (I) (II) or (III).</PARA>
<PARA> However, the NSW Health Department perform monthly bacteriological analysis at fifteen locations including at sewage treatment works to determine effluent quality prior to discharge. Water supplies at Guthega Power Station were found to have gross faecal contamination during a period of the 1980 winter.</PARA>
<PARA> Heavy concentrations of nutrients have been measured downstream of Jindabyne resulting from the discharge of sewage treatment effluents from the Jindabyne plant.</PARA>
<PARA> A water quality survey of the streams and rivers of the Snowy River upstream of Dalgety and including Lake Jindabyne commenced in March 1989. This survey is monitoring additional chemical and biological parameters of Lake Jindabyne waters not investigated previously and includes streams within Kosciusko National Park. There will be five sub-studies of which a study of Lake Jindabyne by the Authority and the NSW Department of Water Resources will involve the largest input. The study is of two years duration with a final report in December 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Commonwealth and States are adopting an integrated approach to Natural Resource Management, including the issue of improved water quality. As part of this approach, the NSW State Government is imposing higher standards that will improve the water quality of alpine streams and necessitate the export of sewage effluent from new developments to other areas. One proposal is to discharge treated sewage effluent into the Snowy River downstream of Jindabyne Dam. This would require future dilution releases that would affect yield from the Snowy Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> Another option of effluent disposal is irrigated eucalyptus plantations. The Authority has undertaken a preliminary engineering investigation of this option. This option would not require dilution releases of Snowy Scheme water. A feasibility study and appropriate species selection has been commissioned from a forestry consultant with the intention of co-ordinating the implementation of the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the issues which Mr MacKellar has raised and have asked the SMHEA to keep the situation under close review. I have asked for regular reports to me on developments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The agreement reached in Geneva on 6 March 1989 related to the agenda of the Second Part of the 35th Session of the Trade and Development Board of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The final agenda for the meeting represented a compromise between the interests of Group B (Industrialised Countries) and G77 (Developing Countries) in respect of some Agenda Items, notably Items 2 and 5.</PARA>
<PARA> Agenda Items 2 and 5, as agreed, read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Item 2: Selected issues requiring attention by the Board at the second part of its 3rd Session in follow-up and review of the implementation of the Final Act of UNCTAD VII in accordance with Board Decision 350 (XXXIV):</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Services within the mandate of UNCTAD as defined in the Final Act</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The respective roles of national policies and the external environment in promoting social and economic development in the context of paragraphs 25-32 of the Final Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Item 5: Other issues for consideration by the Board as mandated in General Assembly Resolution 1995 (XIX), and in the context of the relevant provisions of the Final Act on international trade, as well as other pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly and the Conference: the impact of technological change on patterns of international trade.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The long discussion over Item 2 resulted from differences of view between G77 and Group B on the inclusion in the Agenda of items on the effects of national policies and the external environment in promoting social and economic development and on commodities. The Secretariat had originally proposed only a discussion on services as Item 2 (a). The G77 while seeking to retain the discussion on services on the Agenda, also proposed an item on commodities as (Item 2 (c)).</PARA>
<PARA> Group B agreed to discuss services, although most members of Group B took the view that this should be conditional on G77 agreeing to the inclusion of the effects of national policies on social and economic development under a proposed Item 2 (b). G77 endeavoured to confine discussion under the proposed Item 2 (b) to the effects of the external environment on social and economic development. Finally, it was agreed that the effects on both national policies and the external environment on social and economic development would be included.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, Group B also took the firm view that the item on commodities proposed by G77 should not be included as commodities had been exhaustively discussed at the UNCTAD Committee on Commodities meeting in December 1988 and the report of that meeting was scheduled to be dealt with under Item 8 (b). G77 agreed to this.</PARA>
<PARA> On Item 5 the disagreement centred on the precise wording to be employed. G77 and the Secretary General sought wording that would facilitate an expansion of the scope of the work of the secretariat in the area of technological change and development, while Group B sought to contain it in line with the objective of its majors to restrain the expansion of work programmes of UN bodies. An understanding was reached between the Groups which made it possible to restrict the Board's discussion of Item 5 to technological change on patterns of international trade while acknowledging the Secretary General's existing mandate to identify additional themes on international trade for further work and future consideration by the Board.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia while supporting the board Group B approach on both Items, worked to facilitate a compromise on the agenda.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The site for the administrative centre on Thursday Island is on Victoria Parade. It is not an administrative centre for the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority (PZJA), per se. The Queensland Minister for Primary Industries agrees with me that the building should accommodate the functions common to our two portfolios undertaken by Queensland officers from Thursday Island. The new administrative centre will therefore accommodate officers of the Boating and Fisheries Patrol, undertaking fisheries duties in accordance with policies and programs developed by the PZJA, and officers of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, undertaking animal and plant quarantine duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Settlement of the purchase took place on 24 August 1987.</PARA>
