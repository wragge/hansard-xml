<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Perth)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.03)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The topic under discussion in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 is the Budget. Yesterday I sat here and listened with interest to members of the Opposition umming and ahing and generally suggesting, as is normally the case, that the great problem that Australia faces is that this Government is such a high taxing government and that, while it is a good thing that we have produced a significant Budget surplus, this has been raised as a result of massive increases in taxation. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred), with his normal para-noia, suggested that the figures had been cooked. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised a number of issues and used figures which were not significant. He used gross receipts in taxation rather than relating the figures to gross domestic product (GDP) and growth that has occurred since this Government has been in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the explosion of employment in this country there have been increases in gross tax revenue, but it is very important to put all these things in context. When one looks at revenue, the real figure that counts is revenue as a percentage of GDP. If we look at that figure we find that revenue this year and last year as a percentage of GDP was 26.2 per cent, exactly the same amount of revenue raised by the Government in 1981-82 and 1982-83, when the previous Admi-nistration had its hands on the levers of this country. At a time when we had a Budget deficit of more than $9 billion, the previous Administration was raising exactly the same percentage of revenue as a percentage of GDP that we are raising now. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason we have a significant surplus and the reason there has been such a signifi-cant turnaround is that we have been able to cut outlays significantly. We hear talk all the time about fiscal drag and how the Government has increased its revenue share, but if we look at the Budget Statements at page 4.42 we see this passage:</PARA>
<PARA> Following the cuts in personal income tax rates from 1 July 1989, taxpayers as a whole will pay less tax in 1989-90 than would have been the case if the tax rate scales in place in 1983-84 had been fully indexed for inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is clear that indeed there has been significant improvement for taxpayers on an individual basis. This surplus we are seeing, which demonstrates a significant turnaround in the financial management of this country, has been brought about by cuts in government spending by a smaller, more efficient government sector which is providing targeted assistance to those people who most need it. It is easy with hindsight, I suppose, to think about the economic climate which existed when we came to office, but in 1983 all of the economic gurus were saying, `If you can do something about this domestic deficit, if you can do something about the public sector borrowing requirement, then you will have turned around the economy and the structure within Australia'. It was the view taken by all the economic gurus at the time that that was the first priority. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other competing priorities, of course-it was necessary for us to decrease inflation-but the domestic Budget deficit was the principal problem. We find that in 61/2 years that has been turned round from a deficit of $9 billion to a surplus of $9 billion, but it still is not enough. The balance of payments problem is a significant problem and indeed the strategy of the Government has led to a dramatic shift in the way in which Budgets are framed in this country. But that shift has not been enough, so it is necessary for us to continue a rigorous fiscal policy, a rigorous monetary policy, and to control wages in this country because there is more hard work to do. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at outlays one finds that, over four years, outlays have fallen in an unpre-cedented way, by 8.1 per cent. So the amount of money that the Government is spending on its programs has shifted dramatically downwards and we are now spending at the level we were spending at during 1972-73. If we continue this trend, in two years spending will be at mid-1950s levels and that will exemplify the sort of change that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> No government wishes to have high interest rates-they are certainly not popular any-where in the electorate-but it is an appropriate setting for them at the moment. It is an appropriate policy position and indeed if we were doing anything other than applying the interest rate policy we have at the moment we would be seen as being delinquent in our duties. It is the case, I think, that in politics it is very hard to win. If a position is taken which is seen as being hard on individuals, which is seen as being difficult, then the Government is seen as being cold and hard-hearted; if a position is taken where the needs and aspirations of others are satisfied, then it is being cynically political. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is like being a parent. I accept the honourable member for Wide Bay's response. It is very difficult to win. In a sense what a parent has to provide for his child is unconditional love and in the same way we on this side of the House are providing that sort of care and attention. It is harsh medicine but we have to deliver it to the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks at the other aspect of management, wages policy, what we are seeing in action at the moment in the pilots strike is indeed the policy of the Opposition in a microcosm. We are seeing a small group out there who would like to have a wage increase of 30 per cent. All of us in this community would love to have a wage increase of 30 per cent. But I suggest there are very few who would have that wage increase at the expense of the vast majority of people in this country. Very few in this community would want that increase at the cost of bringing Australia to its knees. I make the suggestion that the pilots are taking the position that they want a small wage increase, but they have a very high base wage and enjoy a very significant position of privilege. Their claim is at the expense of many other Australians. Our domestic and international prestige is suffering as a result. The solution suggested by the Opposition is to introduce more draconian laws in the wage structuring system. The response of the previous Go-vernment in 1982, which caused it problems, was not a deregulatory response or a collective bargaining response; it was a centralised response of a wages pause. If one were to try to sell a wages pause now, I suggest that it would be like trying to sell fridges to the Eskimos. One could not get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those comments on the economy in general and on the stringency of our fiscal policy in particular, let me reinforce those points by referring to a comment made last night in Sydney by David Henderson, the head of the economics and statistics department of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. Mr Henderson, in a speech made in Sydney last night, had something to say about Australia's fiscal policy. This was not said by some Government hack; this was not said by somebody who has a particular ideological leaning towards this side of politics; this was said by somebody from an internationally respected organisation, commenting on how he sees the way in which Australia has been restructuring over the last six years. This was his comment on fiscal policy:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Australia is one of a relatively small group of countries that have taken major steps towards fiscal liberalisation across a wide front. </PARA>
<PARA>As we have said time and time again, one of the principal actions necessary for micro-economic reform in this country is the freeing up of the financial sector. What does Mr Henderson have to say about Australia in that regard? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think that in a comparative assessment of recent financial market liberalisation Australia has to be classed among the leading countries within the OECD, simply because of the extent to which reform has been taken. </PARA>
<PARA>Again we have a glowing endorsement of the policy structure which this Government has set up, the direction which it has taken, and, indeed, the course on which Australia has embarked. Within the setting of Budget priorities and within the setting of Budget parameters, it is necessary for the Government to determine priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are one or two particular aspects of policy which I want to pursue in the time remaining to me. The first is the very severe and growing problem that represents the most massive international epidemic which we face in this decade and perhaps in this century-that is, the problem of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Yesterday the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) made a substantial statement in this place on the release of the Government's White Paper policy on AIDS. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member opposite, who was previously the health spokesman for the Opposition, says it is two years too late. We must congratulate the Minister on the response that the Government has made on this issue. It is a very difficult, complex problem. The Minister has been acrimoniously attacked in a personal and a policy sense. I recently visited England and the Netherlands to discuss the issue of AIDS with a number of experts in those countries. I spoke about this issue with one of the most eminent people in the United Kingdom. After I had spent some days in the United Kingdom and some days in the Netherlands I said to him that I thought it was important that we in Australia learn what they are doing and it is important that we be able to integrate those things into our program. He said to me, `If you want to see a well thought-out, caring, imaginative, progressive strategy, then go to Sydney and see what they are doing there'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear from speaking to people all over the world that Australia's response to this problem is seen as being amongst the most progressive, caring and well developed in any country. We are fortunate to be in one sense isolated in Australia because it means we are able to respond to this problem in a very meaningful way and in some ways to control it. We have set significant priorities in education, prevention, treatment and care, research and our international response, and we see in this Budget a more than 40 per cent increase in the funding available to AIDS programs, a more than 40 per cent increase in areas which will provide for improvements in our education program, improvements in the way in which we spread the message of prevention and improvements in the care and treatment of people, and certainly it will provide for significant input into the area of research. </PARA>
<PARA> It is still the case that while there are improvements and advances in the treatment of AIDS we do not have a cure. It is important to understand that while we have made significant progress in the area of the homosexual community and, indeed, the infection rate and the incidence of the disease in that group of people is falling, we are particularly concerned about the new wave of AIDS, the so-called second wave, which is related to the intravenous drug-using community. It is important that our response in that area be dramatic and early. It is the case that all over the world intravenous drug users are increasingly making up the number of those people infected by AIDS. More than 60 per cent of those presenting in places like Edinburgh, and even in parts of New York, have received the infection by the intravenous drug-using route and it is very important for us to respond to that sort of problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been criticisms of the policy White Paper. There is a view that we should be taking a more liberal philosophy to intravenous drug users and indeed that the thrust of the Government is not as strong as it could be in that area. An intergovernmental committee has been set up and it will be looking into this issue. It has a number of references. One of them is to look into legal sanctions which might impede the changing of personal use patterns of drugs which are not administered by intravenous methods. This raises the question of the decriminalisation of substances like marijuana. In Sydney an ounce of marijuana is more expensive than the equivalent number of dosages of heroin, and if that situation means an implicit attraction for those who wish to be drug users to use the intravenous route rather than the other route, then it is something that we need to consider. The problem when one looks at the liberalisation of policies with regard to drug use is that health professionals are divided. There is a deep division amongst those who treat intravenous drug users as to which is the most appropriate response and so caution on the Government's part is understood. Clearly that is an area which needs considerable review and considerable interest has to be taken in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The last area I wish to raise is that of sports funding. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, of which I am a member, was recently involved in a rather rapid but very thorough review of the funding of sport in Australia. That is an ongoing review. Members of this Parliament must know that we understand that this is not the most important issue that one deals with in this Parliament. There are issues of income, there are issues of education and health care, dramatic issues in industrial relations and issues in a whole lot of other areas, but certainly sport is something that affects the lives of most Australians in some way every day. Whether we sit and watch sport on the television, whether our children are involved in it, or whether we are in fact weekend warriors ourselves and part time participants, it is something which touches our lives and has a dramatic effect on our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is clear evidence that the financial impact of sport is very significant when one looks at the discretionary income of individuals and the amount of money which is turned over in our economy in that area. There are two areas in particular that are of concern and it is hoped that the injection of funding that the Government has directed towards sport will be spent in an appropriate manner. Certainly it is important for us to raise in schools, and in particular in primary schools, the status of physical activity. It is important for children to be taught the basics of running, jumping, swimming, catching and throwing-those things which can improve their enjoyment of life and their health in the long term. That is not to suggest that we have to make them into champions. What we have to do is provide them with the basics, the techniques, the opportunities to pursue an interest in sport, perhaps throughout their lives. Certainly it is the case that in many States we do not provide physical education teachers in primary schools and it is clear that that is an area we should pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> There were many criticisms of the way in which we were directing our finances at the elite end in particular to the Australian Institute of Sport. While the building of the Australian Institute of Sport was a worthwhile project and the direction taken was necessary, we do not need $100m worth of facilities in Canberra and fewer facilities in the States. Because of Australia's geography it is necessary for much of the funding that it is available in sport to be spent around this country. We cannot follow the model of a small European country or even the model that exists in the United States of America. We have to have a unique approach; we have to encourage initiative and talent; and we have to encourage the foresight and ideas that exist in the States. The Western Australian Institute of Sport and other regional based institutes of sport all over this country need increasing assistance. When we talk about spending money in the area of elite sport and in the area of development it is important that that money should be directed throughout this country and not just towards a huge institute based in Canberra which is not appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA> A series of threshold questions must be asked in order for the Australian people to decide whether the Government's 1989 Budget attempts to deal with the nation's serious economic and social difficulties. Does the Budget deal with inflation? The answer is no. Does it deal with our accelerating overseas debt? No. Does it establish an economic framework that will allow early reduction of our record commercial and housing interest rates? No, it does not. Does it provide incentives for the traded goods sectors? As the Budget increases taxation in these areas, the answer is certainly not. Does the Budget encourage export incentives? No way. Does it make any attempt to relate labour costs to productivity? No. Does it address the urgent problems of our inefficient transport infrastructure and the waterfront? Most certainly not. Finally, does it make any attempt to straighten out our convoluted and regressive taxation system? No. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this wretched document do? The answer is that it increases taxation on all and provides politically calculated handouts to some. One of the chief moral problems of modern-day politics is how to stop politicians bribing the electorate from the public purse. This Budget is a classic demonstration of that moral problem. We have the little team of Hawke and Keating and Richardson, the old Labor wheeler-dealers, the Boulevard Hotel boys, ratting the public purse for electoral purposes. There are the handouts for the youth vote, the handouts for the ethnic vote, the handouts for the pensioner vote, the handouts for the environment vote, and so it goes on. Is it any wonder that Senator Walsh, the only economically literate member of the Cabinet, wanted to resign when he saw the shape of this Budget's handouts?</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget makes no attempt to deal with our basic economic, social or strategic problems. It gives no shape to any program of economic reform. There is no outline of the future and no vision for the path ahead for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is almost incomprehensible that the Government has made no attempt to deal with inflation. After forecasting a level of 4 1/2 per cent inflation by the end of last financial year, the Treasurer has now found the problem beyond his wits and estimates inflation at 7 1/2 per cent for the current year. Budget Paper No. 1 is 570 pages long. In that whole vast expanse of words and figures, inflation gets about 10 paragraphs-10 lousy, miserable, apologetic paragraphs. Inflation is wrecking our exports, creating turbulence in our labour markets, distorting our taxation system and crushing our national savings. What does the Treasurer do? He gives inflation 10 paragraphs, more or less in passing, in the major Budget document. The irony of all this is not lost on the Reserve Bank, which had this to say in its annual report, released around the time of the Budget:</PARA>
<PARA> The setting of incentives and disincentives at the microeconomic level has played a role in creating some of our present economic imbalances. Changes there are essential if we are to avoid a re-emergence in the next upswing of the problems of the past year-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, the Reserve Bank is saying that the Government's labour market, taxation, infrastructure and waterfront policies are all wrong-</PARA>
<PARA>but the vital key is inflation. Restructuring is much more difficult, even impossible, in a high inflation environment which destroys competitiveness and discourages saving. Altering this situation must have top priority. </PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank says that altering the situation must have not a little priority, not just some priority, but top priority. What priority do Hawke, Keating and Richardson, the Boulevard boys, give to inflation? No priority at all; it hardly rates a mention. In answer to a question asked of the Prime Minister in this House yesterday when he chose to compare what the Reserve Bank was saying with Government policies, did he mention inflation once? Not once. Yet the bank says, talking about inflation:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the vital key is inflation . . . Altering this situation must have top priority. </PARA>
<PARA>Within a couple of weeks of its release, the Reserve Bank report has simply blown the whole Budget strategy out of the creek and into the bush. The Treasurer was not able to get to Simon Crean, his looming rival, before the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions said that he was disappointed at the Budget because he thought it had not tackled the inflation problem. The Reserve Bank goes on with this profound warning to the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> On its own, monetary policy will not produce the longer-term structural benefits Australia is seeking. Beyond a point, it may even inhibit the structural change because of the effect of high interest rates on investment of all types. </PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, it concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> Inflation appears set to remain above the average for industrial countries, even if demand pressures are contained. </PARA>
<PARA>The Budget strategy and its priorities have been disowned by the Government's own bankers. The policy of selective vote buying and high interest rates will not work. We all know, and the Press Gallery knows, that the Government's priority is not inflation but the next election. We all know that dealing with inflation will conflict with the electoral imperative. </PARA>
<PARA> The country's second major problem after inflation is our mountain of overseas debt. This problem gets about the same space in the Budget documents as does inflation. The message seems to be that we should not worry about our external indebtedness, which increased again yesterday, and that `She'll be right'. Unless the Government is prepared to do something about our overseas debt, she will not be right. Does the Government really appreciate that our foreign debt is growing at the rate of more than $50m a day? Is that the legacy this Government wants to leave to our children? The Government's attitude to our overseas debt is irresponsible and immoral. It is our obligation to expose this fraud on our children. The Hawke Government is stealing from our children in order to try to buy its way back to power. The Government admits that our overseas obligations will grow at least a further $181/2 billion this year, and then does nothing about it. Furthermore, the Government's estimate is based on the hope that commodity prices and world trade will hold up well this year. If, however, there is a fall in commodity prices and a downturn in world trade, our current account will deteriorate even further and we will then be, as Senator Walsh has predicted, well and truly down the Argentine road. </PARA>
<PARA> In normal circumstances it would be almost inexplicable that the Government has casually accepted that our current account deficit will once more climb to record levels. But these are not normal circumstances, because dealing with our overseas debt realistically would also interfere with Labor's electoral strategy. If it had the political will and the interests of all Australians at heart, the Government could have done many things to reshape the economy in a way that would allow us to escape the debt trap. It could have freed up the labour market. It could have ended the union hierarchy's monopolies in transport, communications and the waterfront. It could have reformed the taxation system to encourage productive investment and savings. It could have privatised some government businesses. It could have contracted out some government services. It could have fostered a production and export culture rather than a handout culture. It could have rewarded achievement and skill in our education system. It could have ceased fostering and funding single issue and social engineering groups, and it could have reduced the scope and intrusion of government in people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA> But, Mr Deputy Speaker-and I also take the opportunity to congratulate you on your election-this Government lacks the stamina, the political skills and the will to tackle these challenges or, indeed, any of the challenges. Despite the beliefs of the social engineers who inhabit Australian Labor Party branches and carry out Labor's welfare programs, governments by themselves cannot provide good and satisfying lives for their citizens. Government programs do not normally lead to the greater contentment and fulfilment of individuals or groups, and often make matters worse, as in the case of the creation of an underclass of younger welfare recipients. Social engineering of the kind promoted by Ministers Dawkins, Howe and Blewett does not generally work. It leads to conflicts with traditional and valuable professions. It diminishes the family. It politicises communities and genuine welfare agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's youth policies, for example, are generally regarded as a joke. The operations of the bureaucracies seem comical to most young people. Youth homelessness is an acute problem in our society, yet the Government does not seem to be able to come to terms with it and fails to understand that much of the problem flows from the social disorientation fostered by the Government's other programs and by the views of its social engineering ideological allies. The New South Wales Teachers Federation, for example, is a highly influential organisation within the Labor Party, supplying funds, ideas, programs and even parliamentarians. However, the views of the Federation on school discipline, on minimal core content and socially oriented courses, on work, on the causes of violence and on the family-all those views by that Federation contribute to youth alienation, lack of self-respect and poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now characteristic of the welfare and social care industries in Australia that they have become seduced and preoccupied with government. There are, of course, noble exceptions, such as the Salvation Army and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, but many have gone where the big funds are-that is, to government. Accordingly, education, health and welfare have all become substantial clients of the bureaucracy with the resultant decline in the quality of service, in personal relations, in efficiency and in initiative. So the hunt is on for more government funds and programs and in this Budget, and in these documents attached to the Budget, we have them galore. The LATA scheme, the SAAP scheme, the CAP scheme, the LGACHP program, the adolescent mediation initiative, the JSA scheme, the YHA scheme, the Newstart scheme and dozens more-most of them with their funny acronyms-cost tens of millions of dollars extra. Those fabricated schemes and programs will not really work, of course, any more than they worked last time. We have even more schemes and programs trying to remedy the problems created by this Mad Hatter Government's present schemes and programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government still has not learnt the lesson that social engineering creates more problems than it solves. Genuine need should be met-and no-one disputes that genuine need should be met-with grants, vouchers, the contracting out of services and the encouragement of individual and community initiatives, not by the creation of extra layers of impersonal and expensive bureaucracy. In the training area there are now an incredible 30 or so Commonwealth training schemes. Some are unnecessary employer subsidies. Some are grants to social engineering activist groups. But all are costly and have their own mini-bureaucracies and many have been modified recently because their predecessor schemes simply did not work. Training and skills formation is expected to cost $516m this year. Job creation schemes and employment assistance schemes are expected to cost $123m. Administration costs under the heading of labour and employment-all these figures are from Budget Paper No. 1-are estimated to run to an incredible $436m, including the Commonwealth Employment Service, which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is yet again trying to revamp because it has not delivered jobs for our young people. As the Brotherhood of St Laurence and other genuine welfare groups have pointed out, the tragedy is that most of these schemes are useless. There is the Commonwealth rebate for apprentice full time training program, or CRAFT; the Australian traineeship system, or ATS; the industry training services program, or ITS; and the formal training allowance, or FTA; as well as the jobs, education and training program, or JET, and Jobstart and Skillshare, and the propaganda machine. No doubt there is a rash of new programs in the pipeline. The cost increases but productivity does not; neither does the effectiveness in getting our unemployed into jobs. It does not seem to have occurred to the Government that business, big and small, pays the taxes that fund these expensive and, in many cases, useless programs. It does not seem to have occurred to the Government that a reduction of up to $1 billion in taxes and charges on business might provide more incentive than some of these weird schemes dreamed up in the Gilbert and Sullivan world of Jobstart and Skillshare. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, this was never a government of rags to riches but it has now become the government of rags and patches. It is a government dying of a thousand schemes and short term programs. It is a government that has lost its way and lost its vision. It is a government that in this Budget has fled from facing its responsibilities by failing to deal with inflation and our foreign debt. It is a government that has instead retreated to electoral handouts combined with social engineering. Ministers Dawkins, Howe and Blewett, with their thousand and one little schemes, are taking over from Hawke and Keating. It is a fitting judgment on this Budget to declare that the social engineers are taking over from the Boulevard boys. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I congratulate you on your appointment to your high office, and I wish you well. I do not wish to comment on the address of the previous speaker, the honourable member of Deakin (Mr Beale), except to say I am sure quite a number of form 4 teachers around the country will use it as an exercise in unclear thinking. I will leave it at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Tuesday, 22 August, I had the pleasure and privilege of being a guest of the Wimmera Farm Tree Group and touring the upper reaches of the Wimmera River and its catchment lands to see at first hand the devastation caused by decades of unremitting tree clearance and inappropriate land management practices. The rate of land degradation in this and similar areas now constitutes the greatest problem facing Australia today. While farmers, environmental groups and the Government are determined to attack the multiple causes of land degradation, it cannot yet be said that the urban dwellers of this nation are adequately informed and concerned about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many schools, particularly primary schools, are devoting much time to the issue and I recently joined the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) in a very pleasant visit to the Delacombe Primary School in Ballarat where the principal, John McManus, and a very dedicated staff are trying to instil in the children an active awareness of the problems besetting the Australian environment. John and his teachers, the parents of the children and the children themselves deserve our congratulations and they deserve our support, as of course do teachers throughout our schools. I exhort them to continue their efforts. May the children develop an even deeper understanding of the problems facing our environment, and commit themselves to putting them right. I only hope that is not going to be labelled an exercise in social engineering, but if it is then I am all for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to believe that the restoration of our land cannot be accomplished by the farmers alone. The farmers will need government assistance, both financial and technical. Over time they will need more money than has been allocated. While it ought to be said that these are early days in the development of a planned attack on the immense problem of land degradation, the scale of the problem and the fragility of our soils cannot await a slow growth of commitment to save our soils. It has taken 200 years to reach this point. An area of 3 1/2 million square kilometres of grazing and arable land in this country is affected and the degradation is accelerating at a very rapid rate as the effects come through the soil systems. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have farmlands at all worth farming in 50 years or so the attack on the problem must be on a vast scale. This is where the urban dwellers need to come to understand this problem. It is not just a problem for farmers on the land or those in small rural service towns. The Australian population is the most urbanised on earth. Over 80 per cent of our people live in cities. The problems of land degradation are theirs no less than they are those of the farmers. The other day I spoke to farmers such as Jack and Vic Start, Jim Kilpatrick, Alan Holden and his son George. I saw the work which they are undertaking to provide leadership by spending considerable sums of money on and dedicating time to gully repairs, diversion banks, tree planting, pasture improvement, et cetera, but the problems are immense. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned to see that, even after a very intensive rabbit eradication program, if one looks across the farmland one sees a virtual carpet of rabbits, disappearing as one approaches. The threat of an explosion of the rabbit population is imminent. City dwellers do not recognise the horrific environmental damage done by rabbits. Adequate funding must be made available to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to ensure that the work on rabbit eradication by biogenetic means and other biological measures proceeds as rapidly as possible. I would like to think that honourable members on both sides of this House, who often are involved in many other issues, recognise that this is something on which we can take very much a bipartisan approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The farmers recognise that it is not simply a matter of government handouts to solve the problem because we are talking in terms of billions of dollars. We want an enormous amount of encouragement. We want urban people to marshal their forces-if necessary, to go out to country areas in volunteer teams to assist the farmers in the very large task of, for example, tree planting. I hope that something like that will arise and that people across the country will take up these schemes and get their communities involved, especially now that farmers are taking on the whole farm plan approach, which means that they are changing their whole farm and land management practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that while this country relies so much upon farm commodities for its export-earned income it had better realise that they will be a dwindling resource, with dwindling revenue, if something is not done very quickly. In Victoria alone it has to be recognised that to maintain the level of productivity from our soil will cost an extra $50m per annum. That is just to mark time. That is the rate at which the problem is now growing. Across Australia it is costing us over $600m. In the Murray-Darling region alone it is costing $250m just to maintain the level of farm produce. </PARA>
<PARA> When people throughout Australia begin to recognise how significant this problem is they will begin to take some kind of position on it. I hope it will be a very positive position and one in which we can bridge the gap between the farm and the city. It is really everybody's problem. I make no bones about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a couple of other points. First, I would like to comment on the first home owners scheme. That was introduced on 1 October 1983, with the express aim of assisting low to moderate income earners to purchase their first house. It also was devised to give a stimulus to the home building industry and to create jobs. Honourable members will recall that when we came to office we were left with a legacy of the most serious economic downturn since the Depression of the 1930s. Housing starts had slumped to a record low of 105,000 and the ranks of the unemployed included thousands from the building industry. Alongside the community employment program the Government introduced the first home owners scheme. I hope that is not classified as social engineering. As a kick starter to economic growth the injection of funds into the building industry was a dramatic success. Not only did the building sector itself take off but the feeder industries also showed rapid growth. </PARA>
<PARA> From an economic standpoint the first home owners scheme was brilliantly conceived; from a social perspective it was also a winner. The conditions of the first home owners scheme were deliberately aimed at helping eligible first home buyers to get into a home as soon as possible through the grant. In other words, they were not required to have a deposit, which many of them would have found difficult to raise. Previously, under the Liberal-National Party Government, that was the case. It meant that low income people had great difficulty in getting into a home. The poor were virtually excluded. That is not terribly new when it comes to Opposition attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the first home owners scheme, in my own electorate of Ballarat for instance, 2,693 applications had been approved as at the end of June. An amount of $11.4m has been approved and $10.1m has been paid out. As a result of this scheme many people have homes much sooner than they would have under the previous Government's programs. Even today the Opposition has no suitable housing policy. Its emphasis completely ignores the poor and concentrates on what it believes to be vote-catching opportunities. The main effect of its policies would be to push up the price of housing and leave very low income earners at the mercy of private landlords. </PARA>
<PARA> I know I am running out of time. I want to make a comment that the Government has a deliberate policy of assisting people in the low income area through rental housing, increased rental housing allowances, the family allowance supplement, Austudy and similar programs. I do not resile from supporting programs which are aimed at assisting the people who are out of work to develop relevant skills. I would have thought that honourable members on the other side of the House would have recognised that we are dealing with existing populations of people, many of whom left the school system early and do not have the adequate skills to be able to get themselves a job-to go out with something marketable. That is what these programs are on about. They are targeted at different age groups throughout the spectrum. The Government is concerned about these people. It has never resiled from assisting them. It will never do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Deakin, were somewhat irresponsible and very much those of a person who probably would tend to jump into his Rolls Royce and head back to Toorak, where he is not going to see a great number of the poor, and hope that the servants know their places. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset may I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your elevation to the Deputy Speaker's position. I would like to open my comments by speaking about various aspects of the Budget. Much of the fanfare of the Budget centred around a so-called domestic surplus of $9.1 billion. At first blush that sounds quite attractive but when we look at how that surplus came about we see that it is not so attractive after all. There are two ways of getting a surplus. One is by cutting expenditure and the other is by increasing income. In the case of the Government, this is done through increased taxation. Regrettably, it is the latter method by which the Government has come to record this Budget surplus for this year, because taxes have gone up by astronomical amounts, well over 100 per cent in the five years that the present Treasurer has been in place, and are forecast to increase by more than 10 per cent in the coming year. About $40 billion was collected in taxes when the present Treasurer took over not so long ago. This coming year about $91.3 billion is forecast to be collected. Expenditure overall is not being cut at all; in fact, it continues to climb to record levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The worst feature about the Budget was that the basic fundamentals remained untouched-the things that are today so crippling this wonderful country we live in. Inflation is predicted by the Treasurer to run at about 7 1/2 per cent in the coming year, and when that is compared with our overseas trading partners' rates, that bodes ill for us. One of the worst aspects is the high interest rates. We see a lot on television about interest rates at 17 and 18 per cent for home buyers, but let us not forget the small businessmen in this country and the farmers in particular, who are paying interest rates in excess of 22 per cent up to 26 per cent. These high interest rates are crippling the wealth producers of this country, and it is regrettable indeed that the Treasurer is following a one-dimensional policy. I know just what the severe effects of high interest rates are for the small businessmen and the farmers in my electorate of Parkes. The rates are hurting them and they cannot see why they should be penalised in this way to straighten out the economy, by having their enterprise penalised and wound back. </PARA>
<PARA> The current account deficit for the year past touched record levels in this country-$17.7 billion. I think it ran at a record monthly level for about eight or nine months out of the previous 12 months. All that the Treasurer can offer us is that it will set even higher levels in the coming year. He predicts $18.5 billion; so there is no joy there either. This all eventually translates back into the overseas debt, which, we were told yesterday, has just gone to a net of $108.2 billion dollars for the June quarter. It has risen by nearly $18 billion in the past year. This happened at a time when wool prices were high and buoyant, when beef prices were strong, when wheat prices were recovering, and when mineral prices had been running at high levels. Goodness knows what would happen if there was a serious downturn in these sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no sign that the overseas debt will even stabilise. In fact, it is predicted to worsen, and I read one comment this morning in the newspapers that the net overseas debt could be about $130 billion next year. I remind the House that when Captain Cook arrived and set foot on Botany Bay, the overseas debt was zero. One hundred and ninety-five years later it had risen to the rather high level of $20 billion, and then the present Treasurer, Paul Keating, took over--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1983. When the present Treasurer took over in March 1983, it started to skyrocket, and it has increased by in excess of five times, to $108 billion today. We are getting almost daily messages from independent commentators both within Australia and overseas condemning our economy and pointing out to us where we are going wrong, but the Treasurer washes his hands of this sort of information. We had Moody's report yesterday downgrading us from a AA1 credit rating to a AA2 rating. Only two or three years ago Moody's had taken away our AAA credit rating. We had the Reserve Bank recently writing a damning report on the way the Treasurer is managing the economy. Considering all these sorts of things, such as our AA2 rating, which is equivalent to what Spain has got, we are close to having the worst Treasurer in the world managing our finances. It will not surprise me if he comes into Question Time one day dressed like a matador.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The net overseas debt has gone from 13.8 per cent of gross domestic product to 32.2 per cent of GDP, and it is still rising. The interest payments that are going out of this country to service this overseas debt are running in excess of $1,000m a month, which is equivalent to more than 20 per cent of our export income today. If we take interest plus the contractual principal repayments that are due on this debt, the overseas debt servicing runs in excess of 60 per cent of our export income, and let us not forget that much of this debt is short term and needs to be rolled over regularly, so we are in a very vulnerable position. </PARA>
<PARA> The per capita debt in Australia today runs in excess of $7,000 a head, and while the Prime Minister tries to say that that is an irrelevant figure, it is nevertheless very significant. It is twice what it is in the United States, it is three times what it is in Argentina, it is four times what it is in Brazil, and it is 10 times what it is in the Philippines-and the Government somehow still cannot grasp the seriousness and the magnitude of this problem. The Government serves us up these inane and ignorant comments that it is paying off debt, that there is no net Commonwealth debt-as if it is likely that they are going to liquidate our international reserves-and they say that it is mainly private debt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is frightening that the Government does not seem to have a grasp of what the overseas debt is all about. It does not matter whose debt it is, at the end of the day it is Australia's debt. The private sector has been forced to borrow overseas because of Government policy-because the Government is running a low domestic savings policy in Australia, and because the Government maintains a tax advantage for debt accumulation, and because of the other policies that the Government is running. The Government has set an economic course which has forced increased borrowings by States and by the private sector, and this is the result of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The world's greatest Treasurer-when he took over-was downgraded in 1986 by the international Euromoney magazine to the world's second worst Treasurer, behind Egypt's financial Minister, Sultan Abu Ali, and I suspect that today he has even dropped behind him. Overseas independent observers are judging Australia very harshly indeed, and it is time that a more critical realisation of our economic state in Australia today was written about in the media. I will admit that the Treasurer has one marvellous quality. He can portray to the Australian people the impression that he is on top of it all and that things are panning out exactly as he would like, and because of his acid tongue and his ability to do this he seems to be bluffing the media in Australia, and many of the commentators, that he is doing a good job. I ask the House to look at his record. It is the worst record of any Treasurer that Australia has ever had. At the end of the day we have to judge a person by his record, and the record of our present Treasurer is the worst ever. I do not care how skilled he is or what he says; his track record, his runs on the board, are the worst that Australia has ever produced. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to make some specific comments on Budget spending, particularly in the area of foreign affairs. I see that in the coming year we are allocated to spend $1,564m in the area of foreign affairs. Just to put that in perspective, that is some $350m more than the Federal Government will be spending on roads in the coming year. I question whether we have our priorities right in that area. There is, of course, nothing wrong with giving foreign aid, so long as it is spent properly. Australia has a proper and responsible role to play in regard to foreign aid. Unfortunately, I feel that much of this $1,564m is wasted or is even spent in a harmful fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a couple of examples about which I have had some personal experience. Both of the examples relate to the African continent. The first relates to Ethiopia. Ethiopia, of course, is portrayed in the Australian media as a flat, desert country, ravaged by drought, in which people are dying from starvation. Last year I had the remarkable experience of visiting a number of refugee camps in Ethiopia. One was in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, which is the northern province of Ethiopia-the New South Wales of Ethiopia, if you like. That refugee camp contained 3,500 refugees-women and children. The men, of course, had been shot, conscripted into the army or had fled to fight with the freedom fighters against the brutal government. The refugees had come from the western towns of Tessenai and Barentu, mainly from the latter town. That had occurred when the Ethiopian military, which used to control those two towns, had had to withdraw because they had been hunted out of those two towns by the Eritrean Liberation Front. When the Ethiopian military withdrew they forced the remaining people, under threat of being slaughtered, to go to the refugee camp in Asmara. The people we saw there were mainly Kunamas from the town of Barentu. As the soldiers left that town they burnt 62 houses. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) has entered the chamber. He was there with me; so he can vouch for what I am saying. We visited the refugees who were located in a soccer stadium in Asmara. It became apparent to me, as it did to the honourable member for Franklin, that they had been located there as a sort of honey pot to attract international aid, to show politicians from other countries, such as ourselves, and members of the United Nations who visit the country that aid is being distributed to refugees. No mention was made of the fact that these refugees were government created, that they were perfectly happy living in their own towns before they were herded into this place. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw Australian wheat being distributed in Asmara to refugees. The honourable member for Franklin and I both found when we spoke to the people in the town and others around the country, rather than to government officials, that much of the wheat and aid from other countries is sent to the Soviet Union to pay for arms. Seven billion dollars of arms have been sent to Ethiopia from the USSR. A lot of the wheat is also sold for profit. Some of it has even ended up in feed lots in South Africa. The money that is obtained for that seems to be lining the pockets of government officials in Ethiopia. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the aid, particularly wheat from Australia, Canada and other places, seems to end up feeding the army. I remind honourable members that the Ethiopian Government maintains an army of 300,000 people. That is five times the total size of the Australian defence forces-Army, Navy and Air Force. Seventy-five per cent of that Government's budget is allocated to the army. The figure is almost 10 times higher than when Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in 1974. So at the end of the day only a small amount of the aid is used to feed refugees-government created refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> The regime in Ethiopia celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1984 by importing 450 tonnes of whisky from Great Britain for the celebrations. It is almost unbelievable. At the same time as its people were dying from starvation, and the regime was calling upon the world to provide aid, it spent over $100m on that one celebration. Colonel Mengistu, the leader of Ethiopia, has become the African incarnation of Stalin. Over a million people have died since he came to power. We are sending foreign aid to that country, much of which, I regret to say, is assisting to prop up this obscene regime. I have nothing against giving aid to those who are less fortunate than ourselves, but it should be given through private organisations such as the Red Cross, Catholic relief, et cetera, so that it can be properly distributed and accounted for. This sort of direct aid should be given only to genuine refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget Papers show that we will give another $110m to nine of the so-called frontline states in southern Africa. That is on top of the $100m that we have given over the last three years. We will have given these countries a total of $210m by way of government to government aid. All of the nine frontline states that are listed in the Budget Papers either are run by `military governments' or are one-party states. </PARA>
<PARA> Budget Paper No. 4 states that this aid is `aimed at offsetting the effects of apartheid'. All of the nine countries trade with South Africa. In fact, they conduct most of the trade with South Africa. Their trade with South Africa has increased in recent years. South Africa is the only country that is keeping these people viable. All of these countries have air links with South Africa. In fact, they get most of their handouts from South Africa. One has only to look at the record of South African aid to Mozambique. This aid is used to dredge its harbour, put goods through its ports and revitalise and protect the electricity generating dam at Cahora Bassa in the north. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the document entitled Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1988, a document presented to the foreign affairs committees of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, one will note the appalling examples it gives with regard to human rights atrocities in these nine frontline states. Zambia has had a state of emergency since 1964. People have been held in prison for years before being granted a trial. The persecution of Asians in this country is an indictment of that country's regime. I refer to the seizure of Asian goods, et cetera. It is a one-party state. Total censorship exists there. What is the position in Tanzania? The honourable member for Franklin and I visited that country last year. It is a one-party state where only one labour union is permitted. The Government owns all the media-radio, newspaper, et cetera. It has had in place a Ujamaa policy of forced settlement, equivalent to Ethiopia's villagisation program. It has plunged the country into desperation, poverty and misery. It runs a racist persecution of Asians policy which has halved the Asian population in that country over the last 10 years. Mozambique has public floggings, death camps, re-education camps, and no opposition is allowed. I will quote two or three passages from a book sent to me by two missionaries to Mozambique, Rodney and Ellie Hein. The book is entitled Mozambique: The Cross and the Crown. In that book they say:</PARA>
<PARA> We did see some sad incidents. We arrived at a certain village and found all the villagers in mourning. The Frelimo soldiers-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the government soldiers-</PARA>
<PARA>had raided the village the day before, killing the chief and gouging the eyes of his son. Then they captured his son and all their cattle. Marxism destroys the traditional chieftainship system in Africa, and most of the people deplore this method of breaking down their customs and laws. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In Frelimo controlled areas, villagers are moved away from their homes and placed in communal villages or camps where they have collective fields. The communist soldiers take most of the food, leaving little for the people; thus, the problem of mass starvation. The people in Renamo territory told us they had been liberated from communism and were free to live together in their own villages as families used to, before the communist takeover. </PARA>
<PARA>I could quote more passages from this book. These are the sorts of countries to which we are giving aid and comfort. Quite frankly, I question the foreign policy that we are running in this country, which is costing the taxpayers of this country hundreds of millions of dollars in order to prop up these racist, brutal regimes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to take part in this year's Budget debate. It gives me the opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on his seventh successive Budget, a Budget which sets in concrete Labor's achievements. Honourable members would know that I am not usually a flatterer. On the contrary, I have at times been critical of the Treasurer. On one occasion I gave vivid expression in this chamber to my criticism. However, I am amazed at the achievements of the Treasurer, who has turned an over $9 billion deficit that we inherited from the conservatives into an over $9 billion surplus in seven years, despite adverse economic conditions created by successive conservative governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that to most people Budget debates and debates about the economy are somewhat boring, especially in view of the fact that economists and politicians are using a jargon that makes the debate hard to follow for ordinary people. There would be few people listening outside or inside Parliament House to this debate who would know the precise difference between fiscal and monetary policy; macro-economic or micro-economic policies; the gross national product or gross domestic product; negative growth rate and such terms. So when I compare the policies of our Labor Government with those of the former conservative Government I will avoid the use of such terms that would escape the laic. </PARA>
<PARA> But one does not have to be a Rhodes scholar to understand the basic difference between the Hawke Labor Government and the Opposition when it was in government. The basic difference is that the conservatives by their criminal neglect of the Australian economy threw over a million people on to the scrapheap of unemployment while the Hawke Labor Government created 1 1/2 million jobs. We put Australia back to work. Every worker and employee, and indeed employer, in this country understands that. The conservatives do not like to be reminded of their negligence. When the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), was reminded of that the other day, he was quick to defend himself, saying that he was only an adviser to the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and as a public servant he cannot be blamed. So he puts the blame on Howard, Howard on Fraser, Fraser on the New Right, the New Right on providence, and so it goes. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, I ask then: who was guilty of causing the misery of unemployment and the untold suffering of millions of Australians? Of course, it was the ideology of the New Right that was to blame, an ideology which still forms the main plank of the Peacock-Hewson economic platform. The Opposition still advocates the same old New Right policies-to cut drastically government expenditure, which means cutting health expenditure, pensions, police, education, defence and so on, and thus starting an avalanche of unemployment. No thank you, the Australian people had enough of that experiment in 1982. I would be quite prepared to face my electors at the next election on this issue alone, and I do not have to worry about their verdict. But on every other issue also, be it pensions or the environment, the Hawke Labor Government is miles ahead of the policies of the Opposition, if it has any policies at all. However, I will return to this question later. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I would like to devote some of my time in this debate to an exciting new development in transportation-namely, the proposal to link Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney with a very fast train (VFT). Recently, by courtesy of the French Government railways, I was briefed and had the opportunity to travel on the TGV from Paris to Lyon. We travelled on the line, which is the forerunner of a French-European fast railway network, at 270 kilometres per hour. The 400-kilometre journey took exactly two hours from the centre of Paris to the centre of Lyon. The travel was more comfortable than first class air travel, safe, smooth and noiseless. The journey took less time than to fly, considering the travel to and from airports, it cost half of the air fare and was twice as fast as by motor car. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be accurate to say that in the near future Europe will be served by this new mode of travel and that the fast train will interlink the major population centres. I add also that the Paris-Lyon line-built and run by the French Government railways-is already profit-making after only six years of its existence and that it involved a major redevelopment of the centre of Lyon, with a new hotel, shopping centres and new railway terminal. In Australia a consortium, consisting of four companies-Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Elders IXL Ltd, Kumagai-Gumi Co. Ltd and TNT Ltd-is engaged in a feasibility study to construct a new high-speed passenger transport system, linking Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed VFT, which was regarded by many with sceptical disbelief only a couple of years ago, will be travelling at 350 kilometres per hour. It will reach Canberra from the centre of Sydney in one hour while it will travel from Canberra to the centre of Melbourne in two hours. This means that it will connect our two largest cities in just three hours. It will provide safe, comfortable high-speed travel with continuous telephone and facsimile facilities for business people. There will be audio and video entertainment aboard, catering, and large windows to enable passengers to enjoy the scenery. It will be more roomy and comfortable than travel by air, just as fast, yet much cheaper. It will be three times faster than the motor car and provide absolute safety. </PARA>
<PARA> The VFT will be widely used by tourists and it will become a tourist attraction in its own right. I am certain that it will revitalise fixed rail transport, which has been neglected for too long by successive governments. Indeed, it will become a new mode of travel. It will also create jobs in the construction phase and when it becomes operational and it will assist in the development of new technology. As there will be numerous trains running daily, the capacity of the line being 150 trains a day-some connecting only shorter distances from main centres-the VFT, unlike its European counterpart, will provide exciting possibilities of development of outlying urban areas, satellite cities and regional centres all within the easy reach of the central business district of the metropolis. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the VFT is not only a new mode of transport but a tool to promote and speed up existing population and industrial development patterns or to establish new patterns altogether. Therefore, while accepting the project in principle, the State and Federal governments should satisfy themselves on a number of issues before giving their imprimatur to the project. There are a number of questions I would like investigated before we get carried away with our enthusiasm for the project. The first question I would like to examine is the type of ownership of the project, private versus public. In my opinion the Commonwealth and the States should enter into partnership with the private consortium. After all, in France the whole system is totally government owned and operated. There is also the question of what effect such enormous investment, $6 billion, private or public, will have on the rest of our rail system and whether it will lead to further deterioration of the existing rail transport systems. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important areas of the investigation should be the VFT's environmental impact. Its potential effects on our native fauna and flora should be thoroughly studied and where it is possible the detrimental effects should be alleviated. While I am certain that there will be some positive effects of the very fast train, like energy saving, reduction of road travel and the number of road accidents, and reduction of release of avgas into the atmosphere, there are a number of possible detrimental effects which need to be addressed. The route to be chosen is of extreme importance. The proposed route through Dandenong and Gippsland would pass close to newly proclaimed national parks, including the Erinundra Plateau and the Roger River Wilderness. Noise, fencing and all other effects on our native fauna should be seriously considered. Of course, the effect of the VFT on humans, its sociological impact, is just as important. </PARA>
<PARA> The very fast train will make possible daily commuting from Gippsland. Overnight it will transform Gippsland's country towns into dormitory suburbs of the central business district of Melbourne; it will do the same on the Sydney side. It will be possible to reach the centre of Melbourne from Warragul or Traralgon quicker than from Frankston. What possible consequences will result from such extensions of suburbia as far as Bairnsdale? Will the quality of life of commuters be better or worse than if they had remained closer to Melbourne? What amount of money is earmarked by the private consortium towards physical aspects and infrastructure such as roads, sewerage, electricity, gas and so on for the new development? How much will the private consortium invest in the cultural infrastructure such as schools, theatres, community halls and sporting facilities for the new communities? What effects will the influx of large numbers of people have on those who already live in these country areas, including the effect on the value of farmland which is subsequently earmarked for rezoning? These questions must be examined in a comprehensive manner before any decision to proceed with the line is made. It is important that decisions on development of the line and the towns alongside it be made on the ground of overall benefit to Australia and not on the profit to be made by the private consortium and land developers. </PARA>
<PARA> Land speculation along proposed railway routes is nothing new. During the planning and construction of the Melbourne suburban railway network, including the Dandenong-Gippsland line, in the latter part of the nineteenth century land speculation was rife. Far be it from me to suggest that politicians line their pockets, but I reveal that, at the time, six of the eight members of the Victorian Cabinet were directors of building societies or mortgage companies and many parliamentarians headed suburban land syndicates. Suburbs sprang up along proposed routes. Greedy developers subdivided land into postage stamp-sized blocks in areas remote from entertainment and services that those close to the city took for granted. In the summer months these densely packed and partly drained suburbs became breeding grounds for typhoid and other killer diseases. Fortunately today, with more adequate government regulations and better town planning, the worst consequences of land speculation are removed; but there remain important quality of life questions that need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also important implications for existing rural communities as the price of land along the route may be forced up to such an extent that farmers traditionally settled in country areas may not be able to afford to purchase new houses or retain their old houses and farms. They may not like to see their rustic way of life urbanised and destroyed. There is no doubt that land speculation along the route will be rife. The VFT project developers will be in the box seat to capitalise on land values because they will be in the best position to know, before anyone else, the exact route and the location of stations. The consortium itself admitted that part of the $6 billion investment in the project will be financed by land speculation or, as it chose to call it, land value capture. However, notwithstanding my cautious approach to the VFT project, I am an enthusiastic supporter of fixed rail transport in general and the very fast train in particular. I see tremendous possibilities in the future development of Australia being facilitated by the very fast train. I hope that all the problems that surround such a large scale project can be and will be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the Victorian inquiry into the project as well as the recently announced reference by the Federal Cabinet to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I am only sorry that the New South Wales Liberal Government has not taken any interest in the project and is ready to give an open go to the developers. This once more illustrates that Labor governments are aware that we have to strike a balance between the need for development and the protection of the environment and that the community cannot afford to allow an absolutely free hand to speculators, who in the past had little regard for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me back to the performance of the Labor Government, which has an excellent record on environment matters. The only blemish on our record is the mining and exporting of uranium, especially to France. On every other environmental issue, such as the saving of the Franklin River, the handing over of Uluru to its Aboriginal owners, the saving of the Daintree and Kakadu from devastation by loggers and miners, the stopping of the pulp mill that would have polluted Bass Strait and so on, the record of the Hawke Labor Government is exemplary while the conservatives opposed us on every move, from the Franklin River to the Daintree forest. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at social legislation. This Budget brought pensions up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It also increased the allowable earnings of pensioners before pensions are reduced, as well as making such earnings by pensioners non-taxable. The only criticism I can make of the Budget is that it did not provide for some form of mortgage relief for first home owners on average income and with average mortgages. Many are now struggling to meet their high repayments because of increased interest rates. I think it is unfair to let a section of the community-the young home buyers-who bought their homes after April 1986 carry the burden. I will continue to fight for easing of that burden through tax relief or interest rate subsidies. However, I remind those who are now finding it difficult to meet their mortgage payments that the alternative would be losing their jobs, if the Opposition's policies were implemented. One has only to remember the position in 1982, when people were not talking only about not being able to pay their mortgages. There were scores of people who could not pay their butcher's bills because they had lost their jobs. They did not have enough to feed their families. The situation was much worse under the conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice before the Australian people today is either to march with Labor into the twenty-first century as a united people, with an independent and self-reliant defence and foreign policy, with a restructured and free economy which will lead to prosperity, or to choose the discredited stop and go economic policies of the Opposition, to go back to high unemployment and high inflation, to relinquish our independence and rely on a powerful ally for our defence, and again base our economy solely on the export of commodities. I am sure that the Australian people will choose the path to independence and economic strength with Labor and reject the New Right policies of a discredited Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout this Budget debate we on this side of the House have seen Government members rise to their feet and vainly attempt to talk up the Budget and the Government. We can understand their motivation in doing that. In fact, the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent), went so far as to say that this Budget set in concrete the achievements of the Labor Government. I would like to inform my honourable friend opposite that the only thing this Budget has set in concrete is Labor's demise at the next election. Many people on that side of the House will be making their last Budget speeches in this place, and I do not need to dwell on that matter too long. This Budget will herald the electoral demise of this Government, and the best thing we can say about it in overall terms is that it is Labor's last Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the shadow Minister for health I am going to spend the balance of my time in this debate talking about the performance of the Government in the health area, and I must say at the outset that on this benchmark alone the Government deserves to lose office. It has wrecked Australia's health system. When the havoc it has brought on our previously excellent and envied health system is coupled with its abysmal record of economic mismanagement, the Government can expect nothing more than a thumbs down, and a big thumbs down, from the electorate when it goes to the polls within the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only to look at some of the key economic indicators. Under Labor foreign debt has quadrupled and we are now in hock to the rest of the world to an extent never before achieved. Government spending in 1989 is 10 per cent higher in real terms than it was in 1983. The honourable member for Hotham, whom I regret has now left the chamber, found it difficult to understand the supposed great achievement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in coming out with a $9 billion surplus. It is easy to understand when one appreciates that total taxation of individuals under this Government has more than doubled, from $23 billion in 1982-83 to $51 billion in 1989-90. This Government is able to achieve a surplus, even though government spending is 10 per cent higher in real terms, by taxing the heck out of us. That is exactly what it has been doing. Interest rates have reached record heights. People are struggling to pay their mortgages and the housing sector has been knocked for six. Inflation, which the Treasurer predicted in last year's Budget would fall to 4.5 per cent-that Budget, remember, would bring home the bacon-is now stuck at between 7 and 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hotham cited what is supposedly one of the greatest achievements of this Government, the reduction in unemployment levels. Nothing is more certain than that under this Budget, in the economic circumstances we are now experiencing, we are about to go into a recession and unemployment will steadily and inexorably climb. Do not take my word for it. Just this week Moody's Investors Service Inc. in the United States turned in yet another bad report card on the state of our economy and our credit rating. We are now a higher risk for international lenders than ever before. I say with chilling confidence, when I make my comments about unemployment, that the economy has now been dealt a king hit by the pilots strike, a dispute which has been exacerbated by the intemperate intervention of one man, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The impact of this dispute on our economy-and the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories will know that what I am about to say is absolutely the case-is something which should not be underestimated. Already it is costing the airlines millions of dollars a day; but worse, as the Minister was reported in the weekend press as saying, it is causing tourism to lose at least $5m a day in foreign exchange earnings. The Minister knows that bookings around the country are being cancelled by the thousands. Yesterday tourist industry sources said that they were losing $56m a day and the Australian Tourism Commission said that the loss could reach $600m. Tourism, again in the words of the Minister, last week had reached the point where it was our greatest foreign exchange earner, our greatest export industry. It has been knocked for six by this pilots strike, a strike which has been exacerbated by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By any measure which one cares to apply, we are now in a disastrous situation. Our debt is at record levels. Our biggest problem is the month by month current account deficit, where what we earn by way of exports is less than we pay out for imports. Our debt is increasing on a month by month basis. We have been relying on the tourism industry, along with wool and wheat and our mining industries, to help us turn that situation around. We have been kicked in the guts now, and our tourism industry is not going to make the contribution that we were relying on it to make. Our debt situation is going to get worse and worse and worse. Quite frankly, we are in bad shape and it is going to get worse. All the economic indicators clearly point to the fact that on any net analysis Labor's performance in the past 6 1/2 years has been appalling. This Government has a record that no-one in his right mind would want to claim, and between now and the next election, before its ultimate demise, that is going to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to my own shadow ministerial responsibilities and look at health in the context of this Budget. The Budget provides for an appropriation of almost $11.8 billion for the delivery of health services, which is the second largest single Budget item after social security. In the current financial year outlays on health will represent 13.6 per cent of total Budget outlays-up by 0.5 per cent on last year's Budget outlays. Chart 4 on page 317 of Budget Paper No. 1 shows that in the period 1989-90 to 1992-93 estimated real expenditure growth in the field of health is expected to outstrip that for all other areas of Federal Government activity. We are spending billions of dollars on health. Let me try to put it in some context. It is interesting to note that in the 1982-83 Budget, the last Liberal-National Party Budget, Commonwealth health outlays were $3.4 billion, or 6.9 per cent of total outlays. Expenditure now has risen to 13.6 per cent of outlays and we are now spending $8.3 billion. That is how much the Government now needs to fund its Medicare health system. For such an enormous additional amount of money, up from $3.4 billion to $8.3 billion, it is not unreasonable for the community to expect a far superior level of service. But what is the case? Indisputably, the answer to whether we are getting a better service is a resounding no. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83 where were the pensioners who were desperately in need of surgery to remove cataracts or replace damaged hip and knee joints, all of which impact upon their ability to retain their mobility and to lead independent lives? I can tell the House one thing: they were not at the end of the hospital queues we have attendant on every major public hospital around the country. It is estimated that there are now 100,000 people in our community, commonly the aged, awaiting important elective surgery to improve their quality of life. When we were last in government they were receiving the care, treatment and attention they required at the time they needed it. Where were the industrial disputes which now plague the public hospital system on an almost daily basis? As I move around the country, spending most of my non-parliamentary time inquiring into the health care system, I am enormously impressed by public health officials, public health authorities, administrators and those doctors and nurses who work in the public health system who say to me, `You have to do something about Medicare. The current imbalance between the public and the private sectors is not working, we're getting less money than we need to fund the demands that are now being placed upon us, and we can't cope with those demands'. </PARA>
<PARA> Where were the general practitioners six to seven years ago? They were in their surgeries attending to their patients, as they should. They were not fighting against a government which has attempted to conscript them, against their wishes and without due consultation, onto some sort of vocational register. Where were the private hospitals six or seven years ago? They were out there in the community using their resources to the full in the interests of patient care. They were sharing the burden of delivering hospital care with the public sector. Where are they now? While the public sector cannot cope, private hospitals are struggling with rising costs and empty beds. The public hospital systems are under so much pressure that they cannot provide the beds for those who so desperately need them. </PARA>
<PARA> Where were the health insurance funds six or seven years ago? They were in the market place providing adequate security and protection for 61.5 per cent of the population. Sixty-one and a half per cent of the population were privately insured. Where are the funds now? Their contributor numbers have dwindled to 45.8 per cent of the population. Their proportion of high risk, high claiming contributors has gone through the roof. Their contribution rates have been pushed up, further squeezing out members of the community who simply cannot afford the rising contribution rates and deterring new members from even considering private health insurance. In short, the ability of the private health funds to hold their heads above water has been seriously undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> So what has Labor's massive increase in health spending brought about? It has brought about unprecedented industrial trouble in health care. It has brought about a chaotic and hopelessly overloaded public hospital system. I invite honourable members opposite to go to their nearest public hospital and talk to the administrator, the medical registrar and the nursing registrar. They will tell them that they simply cannot cope. There is a vast imbalance in the system and it is not working. It has brought about an unstable health insurance industry. Where once 60 per cent of the population was privately insured, we are now down to 45.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This week we have dramatically seen-and I am sure that they are knocking on your door in the northern suburbs of Perth, Mr Deputy Speaker-a pharmaceutical benefits scheme which is perilously close to collapsing while this Government ruthlessly attacks pharmacists. The bottom line for Medicare, the cruellest irony of it all, is that it brought about a lower level of service for the sick, the aged and the infirm. Medicare is nothing more or less than a public health insurance system. The very people a public health insurance system should be looking after are the aged, the infirm and the disadvantaged-those people who have no other choice and for whom private insurance is not an option. The very people it should be looking after are the people who are getting less service and who are being pushed further and further to the back of our public hospital waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA> All the rhetoric about budgets bringing home the bacon is simply not matched by reality. It is certainly not matched by reality in the health area. The reality is that the massive blow-out in health costs under this Government has not brought the community anything resembling a masterpiece. To use an analogy similar to `bringing home the bacon', it has saddled the country with a pig in a poke. I wish to take the pharmaceutical benefits scheme as an example. This Budget implements the moves foreshadowed in the April economic statement to achieve savings in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme of $31m this financial year, $96m in the next financial year and $156m in 1991-92. All of this means a cut in expenditure of $283m. The first point to make about this is that ripping $283m out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, most of it coming from the remuneration package of pharmacists, would not be necessary at all if the Government were willing to face up to the real cost pressures in the health portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not talk about bringing in money from any other portfolio; let us talk about just the health portfolio. There is an absolute cost explosion which has been caused by Medicare and total medical and hospital benefit outlays have risen from $4 billion to $11 billion. The Government is ideologically unwilling to admit that there is something wrong with Medicare, ideologically unwilling to admit that there is an imbalance between those privately insured and those insured by Medicare, and ideologically unwilling to admit that there is an imbalance in the utilisation of public and private hospitals. The public cost is simply exploding. Instead of trying to do something about that public cost, trying to bring about a better balance between publicly and privately insured patients and trying to bring about a better utilisation between public and private hospitals, it is containing costs at the margin. It is trying to squeeze doctors' fees. It is trying to squeeze pathology fees. Now it is trying to rip the guts out of the pharmaceutical industry and, importantly, slash the remuneration package for pharmacists. This is an absolute outrage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is a publicly subsidised health care scheme in this country, one which we support. But the Government cannot deliver that scheme by itself. It relies on community based pharmacists to deliver the scheme for it. The Government and the community based pharmacists should be in a partnership relationship to see that this scheme is delivered on behalf of the Australian public. Instead of that cooperative partnership there is an `us and them' mentality. The Government, unwilling to face up to the problems that Medicare has caused, is wheeling on the pharmacists, ripping off $283m and slashing their remuneration package, when what it should be saying to pharmacists is, `You are in partnership with us. We are asking you to discharge a very important responsibility on our behalf through your pharmacies and deliver a very high standard of drug availability and access and general health care to the Australian community. The very least we will do for you is remunerate you fairly and properly'. That is what the Government should be saying, but it is not saying that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are solutions to be found in the health care industry. They include retaining and improving Medicare as a public health insurance system. That is what we intend to do. At the end of the day we should focus our system on the aged, the poor and the disadvantaged. They have no choice. The Government should encourage the rest of us to go back into private health insurance by abolishing the separate Medicare levy and offering people a taxation rebate to assist them with their private health insurance contributions. This solution is not an ideological binge from the Right; it is about recognising that the public health insurance system's responsibility is to look after those who have no other option-the aged and the disadvantaged. That is what Medicare should be doing. At the same time the Government should encourage the rest of us to go back into private insurance, to get those insured numbers back up from 45 per cent to around the 60 per cent level that we enjoyed earlier in the 1980s. When we have 60 per cent of the population privately insured we have a better balance between the public and the private hospital sector. It stands to reason. For every person who drops out of private insurance now there is an increased demand on the Commonwealth budget and another person is potentially in the queue of a public hospital. The hospitals cannot cope, and the reason they cannot cope is that the Commonwealth Government is cutting back on funding to the States. We have a recipe for an absolute crisis and disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is terrific as long as one never gets sick but once one does get sick and needs a public hospital bed it is not available. That is why we have to go down the route of achieving a better balance. If we achieve that better balance and contain Medicare costs there is no justification-in answer to my friend, we do not support the Tribunal-for attacking pharmacists. All the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are not health motivated. They are simply in place to try desperately to rip money out of the system to pay for Medicare which, at the end of the day, is absolutely unsustainable and must be reformed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget we are discussing today is the seventh Hawke Government Budget. It is a Budget which returns a surplus of $9.1 billion. In this respect it stands in stark contrast to the prospective $9.6 billion deficit which we inherited in our first Budget year of 1983. Today I want to talk about this Budget and previous Budgets and their impact on the Federal electorate of Bendigo. Because of Hawke Government policies, in conjunction with a number of local initiatives which I have recently proposed in Bendigo, I am confident that within two years Bendigo will achieve near full employment. When I was elected to Parliament in 1983 Bendigo had an unemployment rate in excess of 10 per cent. Some estimates put the figure at 14 or 15 per cent or even higher. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for the northern region of Victoria suggests that Bendigo's unemployment rate is around 6 1/2 per cent, which is still too high but it is a vast and dramatic improvement on the double digit figures which existed when I was elected in 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recent demographic report of the 2020 study being undertaken in Bendigo by the Loddon Campaspe Regional Planning Authority confirms that Bendigo has well and truly turned the corner. What the report says is that in the late 1960s and 1970s Bendigo was a dying city. We had little population or work force growth and there was net migration away from Bendigo to other regional centres and capital cities. According to the 2020 report, the picture in the 1980s has changed quite dramatically. Bendigo as a city is alive and well and, far from losing population, the 1980s has been a period of solid population growth. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in nearly two decades, there has actually been net migration to Bendigo. What the statistics show is that significant net migration to Bendigo has been under way over recent years. A balanced mix of young people, working families and retirees are moving there because of the opportunities our city provides. We have had our problems on occasions, and the tragic loss of Mayfair comes immediately to mind. But, most importantly, we have turned the corner and must now plan ahead and develop new strategies to take Bendigo confidently and prosperously into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Appropriation debate, I want to broadly outline the strategic development plan which I believe can take Bendigo into the 1990s. It is a plan which maximises our economic potential and takes full advantage of development opportunities in industry, tourism, agriculture, education, defence, construction and the environment. It is a 10-point plan and I am confident that it can be achieved. With its achievement will come a stronger and more vibrant Bendigo economy than we have known for many decades. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me detail the key aspects of this plan. First, Bendigo urgently needs a revamped, more highly powered and better resourced local development committee. The new committee will require some element of planning powers and the full cooperation of local government organisations in the area. Work is already under way on a possible new structure for such a committee and I am fully optimistic that State government funding of at least six figures will be approved for such an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the plan relates to education. Over recent months I have been arguing strongly for the relocation of the Latrobe University School of Agriculture to the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. There are strong grounds for such a transfer and I believe it will take place. The location of the School of Agriculture in Bendigo offers direct benefits in the shorter term and will provide the potential for further developments in the areas of research, salinity programs, food processing, industry extension services, and so on, into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Point three of the plan involves the appropriate preservation and recognition of Bendigo's unique goldfields heritage. When I run into people who have visited Bendigo while on my parliamentary duties around Australia, they always comment on Bendigo's magnificent buildings. According to historians, we have the finest collection of goldfields buildings, streetscapes and mining technology anywhere in Australia. We need to better preserve this heritage and then, having put in place appropriate conservation strategies, aggressively market our heritage as the major plank of our tourism strategy. My proposals for the redevelopment of the View Street precinct, in conjunction with plans now under way for World Heritage recognition of the goldfields region, will not only make Bendigo a better place in which to live but also immensely strengthen our national and international tourism effort. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth key element of the plan concerns the tanning industry. For more than three years I have been working towards the establishment of a fully-fledged, high value added, export oriented tanning industry in Bendigo. With the final feasibility report, which has been funded through the local government development program, on this subject soon to be released, I am hopeful that in the near future we will see a firm commitment made to the establishment of such an industry in Bendigo on a substantial scale. It is, I think, a matter of major national concern that of the 10 million to 15 million sheep skins which are suitable for wool-on tanning each year in Australia, only two million to three million are tanned in Australia, with the balance being exported in a crudely preserved form. There is an opportunity there for Bendigo, and Australia, and I hope that we can take it. </PARA>
<PARA> Point five of the plan calls for the construction of a Commonwealth office centre in Bendigo. Again, this is a project on which I have been working for some years. In this Budget, funds were approved for the purchase of a site for such a centre. Work is proceeding rapidly and I have indicated to the Minister that I would like plans to be submitted to the Public Works Committee in May next year, with a Budget appropriation for construction to be announced in next year's August Budget. I am fully confident that this timetable can be achieved, which will bring with it at least $6m worth of construction activity to the local economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Good transport links to Bendigo from Melbourne are essential to our future industrial and tourist development, and so point six involves the continuing reconstruction of the Calder Highway. In this Budget, $1.3 billion has been allocated to roads and I am delighted that over the next two trienniums until 1995 some $70m has been allocated to continuing improvements to the Calder. I can say with absolute confidence that by 1995 the vast majority of the Calder will be either double-laned or duplicated highway. </PARA>
<PARA> Point seven involves the responsible development of the Bendigo goldfields. It is something of an irony-a tragic irony-that at a time when Australia is producing more gold than at any other time in our history, Western Mining Corporation Ltd has withdrawn from, and effectively locked up, the Bendigo goldfields. It is imperative that a limited number of other reputable goldmining companies be allowed access to the lucrative Bendigo fields so that we can maximise employment opportunities. With proper management, Bendigo can sustain gold mining and, at the same time, conserve the best examples of our goldfields heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence industry is vitally important to Bendigo's economy. With the Bendigo facility of Australian Defence Industries winning around $100m worth of work from the new Anzac frigate project and the Army survey unit at Fortuna in line for a new $2m printing press and printing room, the future is sound. Point eight of the plan requires an ongoing commitment by government to the location and development of these enterprises in Bendigo. I am pleased to say that such a commitment has already been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> Point nine concerns the environment. I have already explained how proposals for the redevelopment of View Street and World Heritage recognition of the goldfields will significantly strengthen our economic base. Both proposals will also enhance our living environment. Our efforts in salinity research, revegetation and waste recycling are already commendable. By building on these efforts, utilising government and private sector resources in conjunction with strong community involvement and support, we will be able to ensure that Bendigo is at the forefront of environmental change in Australia. With the right commitment and strategy, we can be in a position within just a few years where people from all around Australia will visit our region to see at first hand the right way and the best way to reverse land degradation and recycle industrial and household waste. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point in the 10-point plan looks well into the future. In 2001, Australia will celebrate the centenary of Federation. In many ways, this will be a bigger event than the bicentenary of European settlement. Bendigo played a key role in the development of Federation-through the evolving political processes of the goldrush era and through the work of one of the Constitution's most notable founding fathers, Sir John Quick, who lived in Bendigo. Within the next year, we need to establish a high level working party to develop a strategy to ensure that Bendigo plays a major role in the centenary of Federation. It may well be that Bendigo could become the site of Australia's first constitutional museum and, in so doing, guarantee us high visitor and tourist levels throughout the latter part of the next decade, leading up to 2001. </PARA>
<PARA> When the 10-point plan I have enunciated is considered alongside other major projects presently under way in Bendigo, such as the Chinese Museum, the Capitol Theatre, the Linear Park, the new kitchen for the Bendigo Base Hospital and the development of a master plan for Bendigo senior secondary school, there is no doubt that Bendigo has the opportunity and the potential to enjoy a vibrant and prosperous next decade. Let me also stress that the proposals I have outlined are not mutually exclusive. They should be viewed in conjunction with ongoing efforts to attract new industry to Bendigo and to improve continually our quality of life by providing new services for our families and our elderly population. It is clear that achievement of this plan will require local cooperation and a commitment to common objectives. The potential rewards are indeed significant and will mean not just a stronger, more broadly based economy offering better opportunities and more jobs but also an immensely richer environment in which to live and spend our leisure time. I certainly commend that plan to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more general basis in relation to the Appropriation Bill, I take up some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). In his contribution the honourable member criticised quite stridently the system of national health care delivery in Australia, the Medicare system. I want to take up a couple of points he mentioned. He said that waiting lists did not exist in the last year of the Fraser Government in 1981-82 and leading into 1983. That statement is not true. It is a false statement. In fact, as many speakers in this House would know from recent debates on this matter, waiting lists have been an inherent element in Australia's health system for the past three decades. If we go back to the Gorton Government in the 1960s, we find reports commissioned at the time on the problem of waiting lists in Australia's hospital system. They have existed from the 1960s, they have existed under Liberal governments, under Labor governments, under the Fraser Government, and they exist now. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent inquiries that have been undertaken by various State and Federal authorities into the question of waiting lists have not concluded that Medicare is the cause of those waiting lists. What they have concluded is that the ageing of our population and the rapid changes in technology-for instance, those allowing cataract and hip operations, which certainly were not available on the same scale or for the same cost in the 1960s and 1970s-have led to a big increase in demand for operations of that type. In relation to Medicare, the honourable member for Tangney is out of step with public opinion. When this Government introduced Medicare in 1984 surveys done by Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd (ANOP) showed that around 52 to 53 per cent of the Australian population supported the Medicare system. I am pleased to say that surveys done late last year and early this year have found that almost 70 per cent of the Australian population now supports the Medicare system. In other words, more than two-thirds of Australians-more than two out of every three Australians-believe that the Medicare system is a good system of health delivery in Australia. I guess most pleasing about that survey work undertaken by ANOP was the fact that 93 per cent of Australians surveyed in relation to Medicare expressed their approval of the efficient and courteous way in which Medicare processed health claims. In other words, there is not only a high degree of satisfaction with Medicare in the community, there is also a high degree of satisfaction in relation to Medicare's efficiency and the service it provides over the counter. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Tangney also failed to mention that during the period of the Fraser Government, if I remember correctly, in seven years we had seven different health schemes. The Fraser Government could not ever decide on a scheme which was suitable for Australia. They averaged a change once every year and, as I have said, waiting lists were just as much a phenomenon of the health scheme in the 1970s as they have been in the 1980s. Recently an eminent professor of medicine from Harvard University visited Australia and what he had to say about the Australian health system was totally positive and supportive. He described our health system in glowing terms and said that to see a vibrant, positive, cost-efficient health system people should visit Australia, because that is where one of the best health systems in the world is located. He said that our system was much better than the system in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to an interjection the shadow Minister said that the Opposition did not support the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. I would be interested to hear in this House the policy of the Opposition in relation to this Tribunal and all the other wage and policy setting tribunals that exist in Australia. We have seen in recent weeks the Opposition toing and froing over the pilots dispute. One minute it believes the pilots should be part of the centralised system, the next it believes they should be outside the system, consistent with the Opposition's already announced industrial relations policy. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is there as an umpire. It has made a tough decision. I am not happy with the decision-I think it is a tough decision-but the Tribunal has been set up to be an independent umpire and if a tribunal is set up to be an independent umpire I think it is incumbent on all the parties to accept the umpire's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I opened my remarks in this debate by referring to the substantial Budget surplus this Government has delivered. I mentioned that it was $9.1 billion. It is a surplus which is equivalent to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). It will not only be the third consecutive Budget surplus, but it will also be only the third surplus in the 37 years for which comparable records are available. As I indicated previously, it contrasts absolutely and dramatically with the situation left to us by the Liberals-a prospective deficit of $9.6 billion. The important feature of the surplus is that we have achieved it without increasing the level of taxation. That is the easy way to record a Budget surplus, and what is pleasing about this Budget surplus is that it has been achieved through producing smaller government, better government, by improved targeting of programs, and by restraining the growth in outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> I see the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) smile when I mention that this has been achieved without increasing tax levels. If the honourable member would like to look at the average level of taxation as a proportion of GDP in this Budget, which is 26.2 per cent of GDP, he will find that it is absolutely identical to the level of taxation which applied in 1981-82 and 1982-83 under the Fraser-Howard-Hewson government. It is exactly identical: 26.2 per cent of GDP. So we have turned around that $9.6 billion in the red to $9.1 billion in the black without increasing taxes. We have done it by cutting programs that are not necessary, by better targeting of programs, and by taking all the tough decisions in the national interest that the Opposition never had the courage to do for the seven years of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have got spending down now to its lowest level in 16 years, and if spending priorities do not change in the future we can say that in next year's Budget we will have outlays as a proportion of GDP down to their lowest level in more than 20 years-in fact since the 1950s. That will be an achievement. That surplus contributes to the national savings. It indicates that this is a responsible Budget which will improve the living standards of Australians. It will allow us to repay debt and over time it will reduce inflation, our trade deficit and interest rates, and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to follow the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) and I look forward to responding to the various specific allegations he made about the Budget. I want to open by making reference to an article last week in a South Australian newspaper, the Adelaide Advertiser. In just one small paragraph there was recorded the fact that the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) and the pretender to Kingston, Senator Haines, had shared a meeting at the Flinders University campus. Senator Haines, as she is wont to do, had successfully captured the imagination, if one is to believe the Advertiser, of the students present by referring to the honourable member for Kingston and to the Liberal Party's candidate as having Tweedledum and Tweedledee policies. That ran counter to the remarks made a moment or two ago by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) and to the remarks that I want to make as well. It has been too easy for Senator Haines to suggest that there is a great deal of familiarity and similarity between the Government and the Opposition, when we stand for very different perspectives on the economy. There are times, of course, when what we say is the same, because we are both called-whether as the Government or the Opposition, whether as the Australian Labor Party or the Liberal and National parties-to be accountable to the electorate. Senator Haines manages to avoid that sort of accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the measures of accountability that we face there are times when it may seem that we are whistling a similar tune-we here in opposition having a knowledge of the fact that we will one day be in government and therefore called to deliver what we promise, and the Government because it is in government. But Senator Haines makes mischief when she suggests that there is little difference between the Government and the Opposition. There is a real difference as shown in the debate we have had on the Budget Papers and in the attitudes portrayed by the Government and the Opposition. Speech after speech in the last 10 days of sitting-including the speech by the honourable member for Bendigo-has revealed that difference in attitude. Speech after speech on the other side of the House has had about it a measure of self-congratulation: `Look at what a good job we have done. Here we are handing down a Budget surplus of just over $9 billion. Look at what this lot opposite did-unable to produce anything other than an alleged Budget deficit'-conveniently, I note, of $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite show no semblance of contrition for the fact that in producing a Budget surplus of $9 billion they have trebled this nation's debt, placed us in hock overseas to at least three times the level when they came to office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The real difference in attitude is indicated by the fact that time and time again I have heard honourable members on my side of the House-Liberal and National Party members-concede that the Fraser Government was not pure in its economic management and that it made mistakes. But I have never heard anyone opposite do likewise in respect of the Labor Government. Last night I had to sit in my office and listen to the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) deliver a speech which was an exercise in self-congratulation that suggested that all economic wisdom had been vested in the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) inherited a Budget deficit. Let us not argue about the level of that deficit. He inherited that deficit from the Liberal and National parties when they had been in government through the worst drought that the nation had ever seen. It is also true that the Budget Papers handed down indicate a surplus budgeted for by Treasurer Keating-but in face of a growing overseas debt and world commodity prices better than we have ever experienced before for our export goods. It has been too easy-and the honourable member for Bendigo just did it 30 seconds ago-to try to blame private investment in Australia for much of our overseas debt. It is too convenient for the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to come in here and imply that much of the present run-up in overseas debt is as a result of excess expenditure by the private sector and so imply-state, in fact, in the case of the honourable member for Bendigo; but I will use the term `imply' in the interests of the Press Gallery-that John Elliott is more to blame for our overseas debt than is the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the combined borrowings of local, State and Federal governments in Australia during the period of the Hawke Government exceed $100 billion. Much of that money has been borrowed on-shore. Much of it has been acquired even in the form of Aussie Bonds, so drying up the resources available in Australia and forcing those who need to borrow for private sector development to go off-shore for their borrowing demands. Why? In Australia under this Administration there has been no encouragement to save or to be productive. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful to the honourable member for Bendigo for doing me the courtesy of remaining in the House for much of this part of the debate. I suspect that the electors in Bendigo and my electors in Wakefield find themselves awfully confused. Even people in the electorate of the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), in Canberra, are probably confused about just what is happening to the economy. Electors around Australia hear the Government talk about a surplus while the Opposition talks about a growing debt. They say, `How can we be $9 billion better off on one side and over $100 billion worse off on the other side? Who is telling the truth?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I use a very simple analogy to explain what the Budget is all about. I am not an economist; so I use what I call my farming analogy. I would not mind if the honourable member for Bendigo would give me 30 seconds to run through it. Running the Australian economy is just like running the farm. Currently in Australia too much is coming in the farm gate in the form of imports-in farming terms, bringing in too much superphosphate, seed, chemicals and lambs for fattening-and too little is going out in the form of finished product. Every month this nation stumbles backwards to the tune of $1 billion to $2 billion. That is the cost of a new Parliament House every month. We stumble backwards economically because we are exporting less than we are importing. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile the Treasurer says, `I have produced a Budget surplus of $9 billion'. How can that be? It is just the same as the farm housekeeper saying, `I am going to balance the farm household budget even though the farm is going broke'. The farm housekeeper, just like Treasurer Keating, says, `I will put up the rent for everybody who works on the farm and lives in the house'. He or she puts up the rent. As a result of that exercise the farm household budget-the Government Budget, housewife Keating's Budget-will be in surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what is happening. But the nation and the farm continue to go deeper into debt even though the Government Budget is in surplus. That is the sad reality. Housekeeper Keating has very successfully made the farm household Budget-the Commonwealth Budget-pay. How? By putting up the tax take. What has happened during this Government's period in office? From 1983 to 1989-90, total Commonwealth tax revenue has gone up by 105.7 per cent. Let us come to terms with that. In some areas-for example, company tax-we have had a rise of something like 162.8 per cent in tax. All of this is additional tax revenue generated that has made it possible for the Government to proclaim a $9 billion surplus. But while the Government has done that, the nation-the farm, if you like-continues to go deeper into debt because it keeps importing more than it exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The only solution to the dilemma is to encourage productivity-to produce more to export-or change our standard of living. The Opposition has consistently called for increased productivity. There is no other way out of this quite uncomfortable and seemingly invincible problem facing our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Three weeks ago I was fortunate enough to be on a panel that had to select a Nuffield farming scholar from South Australia. A member of the electorate of Barker, Mr Brenton Smart, was the successful farmer. I was there not as a politician but as a member of a panel. Mr Smart, a farmer from the south-east of South Australia, was asked-by another panel member, I must hasten to remind the House-`Mr Smart, what do you think is wrong with Australia and what would you do about addressing our economic difficulties?'. Mr Smart said, `When I first went on to my property and I was deepest in debt and the bank manager was breathing down my neck the only solution to the problem that I had was to get up earlier in the morning, come home later at night and come home tireder'. He said, `I think the problem that Australia faces in 1990 is that too few of us come home tired enough'. Now that is not a very palatable solution to the problem, but he is probably dead right. We are simply not productive enough. One will find on this side of the House not a cry for people to work for less-though that misrepresentation has frequently been made by those opposite-but a cry for people to be more productive and to produce eight hours work for eight hours pay. Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Senator Haines? I hardly think so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties have said there are some very simple solutions to the problem of encouraging Australians to be more productive. We have announced policies outlining those very solutions, but in fact those policies have received but scant regard from the press gallery. Let me take two of them. First, we have said that if we are going to have a more productive economy we ought to encourage Australians to get on with producing goods and with developing properties, farms and small businesses. We have said, quite rightly, that the capital gains tax that did not apply when we were in government and has now been introduced by Treasurer Keating is nothing but a burden on the productive sector of the economy. There is no encouragement for Australians when everything they do that makes their farm or their business more valuable will also put them into a more intense tax bracket. So we have said, `Let us bring in a tax which is nothing more than a speculative gains tax. If you buy a business or a farm and sell it in under five years you will incur some form of speculative gains tax. If you sell it in one year it will be at 100 per cent; two years, 80 per cent; three years, 60 per cent; and so on until after five years no longer does a person incur a speculative gains tax for having produced a more productive and more efficient business'. That is one area where we have said we will encourage Australians to get on with making a more productive Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In another area, we have said, `Let us not discriminate against the employee; let us make sure the employee is encouraged to be more productive by offering share ownership schemes'. So we have proposed in our policy that employees be encouraged to become shareholders in the enterprise in which they work. It is an incentive for them to be more productive; an incentive to see that more goods go out of farm Australia's gate than come in. It is just what we need if we are to turn around the present disastrous balance of payments deficit that we face this financial year and that the Treasurer's Budget Papers indicate we will go on facing. Yet he offers no solution. Solutions are being offered here, Senator Haines. Hardly a Tweedledum-Tweedledee scenario. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we see in the Budget Papers? We see a proposal guaranteed to be the very carrot that would attract urban Australia; a proposal with which you are very familiar, Mr Deputy Speaker, because of your interest and commitment to the area-a proposal to encourage Australians to be more environmentally sensitive. We saw the Prime Minister on the boundary of my electorate, if you please, announcing a proposal to spend $520m planting trees, tidying up salinity and sorting out soil erosion in Australia. That proposal is budgeted for in these Budget Papers. I am not opposed to that, but if we talk about what is happening to our nation in this Budget debate, let us keep that proposal in perspective too. We have $520m not only to plant one billion trees but in addition to sort out the River Murray salinity and tidy up some soil erosion as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the proposal but frankly it is nonsense in terms of what it can do. Do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that at Woolpunda, a place on the River Murray in my electorate, there is currently a Commonwealth funded salt interception scheme to sort out some of the problems caused by the natural inflow of salt into the River Murray? That one proposal, that one project, not even large enough to have captured the imagination of the Australian press, will cost $29.9m. That is the cost of one salt interception scheme on the River Murray. The $520m is not designed solely for the River Murray; it is designed to plant trees and sort out soil erosion as well. It is simply a drop in the ocean. I am indignant about the proposal not because I am anti-environment-quite the contrary; we need to turn the economy around so we have some money to spend on the environment, and that is essential-but as an irrigator. I am conscious that the members of this Government, if you please, claiming to be the people worrying about the environment, are also the people who had the bare-faced audacity to rub out a scheme which was designed to encourage irrigators to use water carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> There was once tax relief for water conveyancing. That tax relief for installing better forms of water conveyancing meant that River Murray irrigators particularly in South Australia went about doing away with their flood irrigation systems and installing instead low throw sprinkler and dripper systems so that every tree had apportioned to it the water it needed. So successful was that change by individual growers, encouraged by no more than tax incentives, that the Commonwealth-engineered drainage scheme at Noora proved to be 50 per cent over-engineered. And what did this lot do? They rubbed out that tax concession. Do they really care about the environment, or do they only care about dangling in front of the electorate the sorts of carrots that will capture the electorate's imagination if the electorate does not have the sort of information it needs?</PARA>
<PARA> If I wanted to sort out Australia's environment, I would go about encouraging every individual Australian, by tax incentives, to do something about the environment. We have seen it work. Once we captured the imagination of Australians they started to recycle paper to the point at which they tell me paper recyclers are embarrassed by the volume of it. We do not need enormous daubs of money; we need a new motivation in Australia to sort out the environment and a new motivation to sort out the economic difficulties we face. The solution to Australia's problem is principally that Australians simply want to be more productive-in Brenton Smart's terms, simply that Australians come home feeling a little more tired or, if I may, in Ian McLachlan's terms, simply that Australians get up in the morning wanting to go to work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Often in debates I follow the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and I was surprised at some of the things he had to say. I have not heard many people on the Opposition blatantly attack business as he did during his speech. He said we are in trouble with our burgeoning foreign debt. He knows as well as anybody in this chamber that two-thirds of the foreign debt is due to the private sector and he attacked it for that burgeoning debt. The point is that he has no confidence in the private sector's business judgment and business acumen. He knows that people borrow because of their expectations of profits in the future, for expansion of their business, for confidence in themselves that they will be able to take on more employees. But, no, he damned his Party's former bedfellows, its former traditional support base which has deserted the Liberal Party, because they have got more confidence in this Government as more legitimate and competent economic managers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member talked like a jilted lover. He lashed out nastily at big business because it has confidence in those on this side of the House and not in those on the other side. If Opposition members want to get back its love and affection, it is about time they spelt out their tax policies and economic management policies. During the great farcical cavalcade a few weeks ago we saw the recycled Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) travel around Australia, but he did not give one word of encouragement or explanation to the business sector or anyone else. It is no wonder that the Opposition will not be handed the reins again. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wakefield admitted that he was not an economist. I am not surprised, having heard what he said today, that that is so. The honourable member has something in common with his leader. He also is not an economist. The honourable member fell into the trap of trying to compare Federal Government economic management and the fortunes of Australia as a nation with a single business or household entity. He referred to his own farm. I do not know whether he was saying that he managed it badly or whether he was just displaying his ignorance. He forgot that there are millions of players who all have different ideas and different methods of running their businesses. Even farms must borrow to expand, just as Australia borrows to expand. The nation's books must be balanced over years. The honourable member would have averaged out his income over years rather than take one specific financial year on which to base his judgment of his own capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talked about the growth in tax collections. The honourable member's argument falls down because he spoke as though each individual was paying more tax. He blithely cited figures showing more tax going to the Government, as though the same number of people were paying it, but that is not true. Of course, collections have grown. More people are at work; in fact, 1.5 million more people are at work. We have reduced unemployment from 10.3 per cent when the Opposition was in government to 6 per cent. People are paying less tax, but more people are paying tax. We now have a fairer system. We have put an end to the rorts that the previous Government cultivated. We have a wider tax base. The biggest reason why we have a surplus of $9.1 billion is that 7,500 to 8,000 people per week are leaving the dole queues and going into jobs. The great performance, the great success, the great social justice achievement, of this Government has been in increasing employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I had to laugh when the honourable member entered the environment debate. I do not doubt his sincerity in his commitment to the environment, but he had better get his ideas right. The Government in this Budget has encouraged the recycling of paper by announcing the removal of the sales tax on recycled paper. The Opposition did not do this when it was in government. I doubt whether it even crossed its mind that one way of encouraging the use of recycled paper so that we chop down fewer trees and there is less deforestation is to have that tax incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> Two major themes have been developed during speeches by Opposition members in this Budget debate. They say that Government economic management is questionable. Questionable? Employment is growing at a rate which is far ahead of that of comparable countries. While inflation is still too high, and the Government recognises that point, it has stabilised and it is still 3 1/2 percentage points less than the rate that we inherited. Is our economic management questionable because of our growing foreign debt? I have covered that point. I never thought I would hear an Opposition member attack business and blame it for our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the matter of high interest rates. Contributions to the debate on this topic come from the Opposition, from our hostile critics outside the Parliament, from well meaning analysts and even from some journalists. There seems to be an ability on their part to forget that the economy is now deregulated. Some still think, write and argue in past terms and understanding about the money supply and how it is controlled. In other words, when comparisons are made about interest rates, people should be very careful to compare apples with apples. Interest rates in a certain economic climate should be compared with those in a like economic climate at another time, unless adjustments are made. People are still talking about tight economic policy in the old terms. We have market pricing of interest rates rather than a juggling of figures by a particular government. We once controlled credit in this country through statutory reserve deposits and liquid and government securities, and through the buying and selling of treasury notes. Of course, we still do the last, as part of the rationing process. Having regard to the very brief history of Australia's deregulated economy, it is obvious that, without a restriction on credit to curb demand, there will be much higher levels of interest rates than before for a similar response. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes in a deregulated economy. It argued for it, but it did not have the guts to introduce it. The consequences are apparent: now that we have adjusted to a deregulated economy, to curb demand, interest rates will have to remain high because we do not have the restriction on credit that we used to have. Only meaningless nonsense comes from the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. Credit is available if one can afford it. Business needs it and, if it can pass it on, it does so and is doing so. Perhaps that is better than the wicked, thoughtless recession that would come about if we relied on a hard restriction of credit, as occurred in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, government cannot rely on monetary policy alone. This Government does not do so. We have in place a successful accord, a wages policy which has kept inflation due to wages under control, which has kept disputations down and, therefore, has kept costs to business down. We also have a very tight fiscal policy. We have the lowest level of government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product for 16 years. For the fourth successive year we have reduced the level of government spending. In the absence of that, interest rates would have been much higher. We have not heard from the Opposition where the cuts will be made if it intends to have a tighter fiscal policy. It does not have a wages policy. We can only conclude, without those supporting arms of economic policy, that interest rates under a Liberal-National Party government would be far higher than they are under this Government, at a time when we must curb demand and, at the same time, increase production to satisfy that demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has also said that we have to tackle savings in this country. Part of the farce of the travelcade by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) was to put forward, off the top of his head, an ill thought through policy about taxing only the real component of interest earnings, and then turning around and allowing business to claim only the real costs of borrowing as a tax deduction. Of course, what is included in the non-deductable and deductable items of expenditure by business, after allowing for inflation, varies according to whom one speaks to in the Opposition. There seems to be no agreement whatsoever among Opposition members on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> About a week ago the pretender to the Treasurership, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), contradicted the Leader of the Opposition. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me put the record straight on two key Opposition tax proposals flagged by the Leader of the Opposition. We are not wedded to it, either, and I don't have a preconceived view. </PARA>
<PARA>Already we see a shifting away from this commitment-as we predicted would happen-to tax only real interest earnings and to allow business to claim only real interest costs as a tax deduction. The Opposition is already backing away from this policy. It will not hit the deck because big business and small business will scream until the Opposition drops this policy. In fact, there is a story going around my electorate about the Leader of the Opposition. How does he get a small business going under his proposal? Give him a large one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual the Leader of the Opposition finds it impossible to state a position accurately. Let me state the position accurately as follows: I said at the outset, as I have said all the way through, Mr Speaker, that I pleaded with the pilots to operate within the system. Before I said anything else I asked them to operate within the system. That is what everyone else in the community does-operates within the system. I pleaded with the pilots to do the same thing. I then said, `If, against the plea that I make on behalf of the Government, and I believe the people of Australia, you are going to claim for yourself a very special position, and if you are going to say it is all right for everyone else, for those who service your plane, those who make the plane safe to fly, all those men and women who do operate within the system and exercise restraint which has brought about this enormous growth in employment in this country, but not for you, from your privileged position, where you have got an average salary of $80,000 a year for eight hours at the stick, and you are asking for an increase which is equal to the average wage and salary of working men and women around Australia, then I am saying to you, not just on behalf of the Government but I believe on behalf of the people of Australia, that's not on and we will not cop that and we will fight that'. Now that was not declaring war on the pilots. The war had been declared by the pilots on the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. Is the Minister for Social Security aware of a recent call by the Brotherhood of St Laurence for bipartisan support on policies for the support of children? Can the Minister tell the House about progress in relation to social security policies directed towards children?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the call by the Brotherhood of St Laurence which said that the Government's real advances in building a more secure and adequate system of income support for low income Australians were too important to be caught in the crossfire of political conflict. The Brotherhood of St Laurence went on to acknowledge that for the first time in this country's history we have a system of guaranteed minimum income for children, and it added that the Opposition ought to openly acknowledge the merit of such reforms. That system of a guaranteed minimum income for children is built around standards of adequacy of 15 and 20 per cent of the combined married pension rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has committed itself to maintaining those standards of adequacy through indexation and adjustment. This means that the Government's Budget move to increase pension rates not only to meet but exceed 25 per cent of average weekly earnings will benefit not only pensioner families but all low income families. Rent assistance increases mean that by September next year all low income families will be able to receive up to $35 a week in rent assistance, more than double the maximum of $15 a week available in December last year. Families with three or more children will be eligible for up to $40 a week, more than 2 1/2 times the amount payable last December. The Government will index those levels of rent assistance from March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has so far refused to commit itself to index rent assistance and has refused to commit itself either to set the standards of family payments to maintain a guaranteed minimum income for children or indeed to index the real value of those payments. The only commitment that I am aware of that the Opposition has been prepared unreservedly to make is to slash a billion dollars off the social security budget. The Brotherhood of St Laurence questions whether the Opposition intends to pay for tax breaks for high income earners by scrapping the Government's welfare reforms. As the Brotherhood of St Laurence notes, it and other welfare agencies are waiting to hear just where the Opposition stands. Five hundred thousand families and more than a million children are now benefiting from the Government's assistance, and they, according to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, have a right to an answer too. In conclusion, the Government is as anxious as the Brotherhood of St Laurence that those very low income families in Australia ought to continue to have the security of a commitment on the part of the Opposition to support those increases and the indexation of the real value of payments for low income families.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Treasurer explain to the House how the Commonwealth plans to use the record Budget surplus to repay debt? Can he provide specific details of the debt repayment program for 1989-90?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="582" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Debt Commission met today to finalise debt repayments from the $9 billion surplus. As I indicated in the Budget Speech, the Government said that every cent of the surplus would be used to repay debt and that will be so. The program is to retire $1 3/4 billion of foreign currency debt through maturities and economically attractive early calls, redeem around $2 billion of Australian savings bonds, redeem at maturity treasury bonds of about $3.3 billion, run down the stock of treasury notes on issue, and redeem additional treasury bonds and foreign currency liabilities prior to maturity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This program, again, will dramatically change the Commonwealth debt outstanding, which honourable members will have seen from the Budget Papers is forecast to have fallen by half in the last three or four years. Of course, this implies a huge saving in public debt interest costs. Part of the continuing story of success in fiscal policy is the decline in public debt interest, which was one of the fastest growing components of the outlays and is now one of the fastest declining components. This contrasts, of course, with the performance of conservative governments in the past, the once so-called prudent managers who never repaid any debt, could never manage a Budget surplus and had outlays to their highest record in Australian history. This will be the third year in a row that the Labor Government has retired both domestic and overseas debt.</PARA>
<PARA> If we could procure the Commonwealth debt from foreign holders of debt-if we could procure it-we could in fact wipe out the Commonwealth's foreign currency debt with this single Budget surplus. That is, the Budget surplus of $9 billion would be enough to discharge that foreign currency obligation on the part of the Commonwealth. So again I make the point: this contrasts completely with the position of the former Government. Between 1975 and 1982-83 total net overseas raisings were $4.5 billion, but between 1983-84 and 1988-89 this Government has actually repaid in net terms a total of $1.5 billion of the Fraser-Howard debts. The general improved management of the Commonwealth's fiscal account and the surplus and the repayment of debt contrast starkly with the practice by conservative governments over the last 20 or 25 years, and again indicate how the whole nonsense about some increased risk of default can never be an issue, when the Commonwealth could actually wipe out its foreign currency debt obligations with one Budget surplus.</PARA>

Opposition members say that if someone operates outside the conciliation and arbitration system and gets a 20, 30 or 40 per cent increase, that is a matter to be acknowledged with pride by the Opposition because that is its policy in action. In regard to the pilots and the complete misrepresentation involved in the honourable gentleman's question, what we are concerned to say to the domestic pilots of this country is this: do not take the view that there is some mystique about you which entitles you to have a position different from that of the rest of the community. Of course, people who fly our domestic airline routes have a very considerable responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Oh!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If honourable members opposite would like a rational and impartial exposition of the point I was trying to make, I suggest that they read Mr Oakes in today's Bulletin. Mr Oakes says in today's Bulletin-he gives us a rap across the knuckles at times if he thinks we deserve it-that the point is right; there are other people in the community who have great responsibility. Let us take the case of an aeroplane. The man or woman who finally flies that plane has a very great responsibility for the lives, the safety and the welfare of those in it. But so does the man or woman who trains for five years, through an apprenticeship, to become a maintenance engineer. The person who services and maintains the aircraft and has a commitment to the quality of his or her work undergoes at least a five-year apprenticeship. If that man or woman servicing the aircraft does not do his or her job properly, the lives and the safety of the pilot and the passengers are at risk. But that man or woman who trains for many years to equip himself or herself to become a mechanic, in whose hands the very lives of the pilot and the passengers will be placed, has not said, `Because I have a responsibility which entails the lives of the pilot, the hostesses and the passengers, there is something about me that says I will take myself outside the whole of the organised work force and use my power to get a 30 per cent increase'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple point I am making is that responsibility is not the exclusive preserve of people who work eight hours a week for $80,000. Responsibility is also very much in the hands of the people who service those planes. If honourable members opposite continuously want to identify themselves with the pilots and say, `It is fair that these people should get, by way of a 30 per cent increase, what these other people are getting on average per year', that suits us fine. It is logical for honourable members opposite to say-and they should do because the pilots are their surrogates and they are pursuing Opposition policy-that they are protecting the pilots. That suits me fine. Let the Liberal and National parties be the protectors of the avarice of the pilots against the responsibility of the rest of the Australian workers. That suits us fine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Congratulations, Mr Speaker, in more ways than one. Can the Minister for Housing and Aged Care inform the House whether the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) is a disaster for community pharmacy, as the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has claimed? What measures, if any, is the Government proposing to ensure the supply of appropriate medication for the Australian community?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="583" SPEAKER="Staples The Hon P.R." NAMEID="KJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="JAGAJAGA" MINISTERIAL="HOUSING AND AGED CARE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the decision of the PBRT needs to be put into context. This is an independent process of the PBRT. I understand that over 600 submissions were put to the PBRT for its consideration of the remuneration for pharmacists dispensing items under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The Tribunal's determination is now fixed under the National Health Act, but there is scope for discussion of a number of recommendations in that report. As was evidenced last night, a number of honourable members do not seem to understand the difference between a determination and a recommendation. As the Prime Minister said, this was established under the legislation of the previous Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of issues and recommendations are available for the Government to discuss with national pharmacy bodies. The first issue relates to the structure of the retail pharmacy industry; the second issue relates to the essential pharmacy allowance; and the third and very important issue relates to developing a professional role for pharmacists over and above the role that they already fulfil in the dispensing of drugs under the PBS.</PARA>
<PARA> To put this matter into further context, it is important to realise the history of this matter. In April or May of this year, some honourable members will remember, the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia were involved in negotiations to put a joint submission to the Tribunal. At that time the Pharmacy Guild embarked upon a campaign of industrial action-a fear campaign in some parts of Australia-directed particularly at pensioners, saying that pensioners would be the next to have to pay. Not only do pensioners not have to pay-that decision has been quite clearly confirmed in this Budget-but also on that occasion the Pharmacy Guild of Australia rejected an offer by the Government that was probably half to a third as bad in its effect as the decision the Tribunal has now delivered to it.</PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition and those in pharmacy have to look at the decision that was taken then in the context of what they face now. They must realise what action they perpetrated in the community and the situation they are in. They must realise that for a long time the Government had a very high level of goodwill towards this industry-a level of goodwill that is quite clearly shown by the fact that we are now prepared to go back and enter into discussions with the Guild and other national industry bodies to resolve some of the problems that affect them. It has to be realised that many people in the industry, particularly the hotheads, who rejected that decision have something to answer for.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this time many of the moderates in the industry and many of the pharmacists who contacted us when they were looking towards an amalgamation incentive, when they saw that the Government was offering them indexation, a 10 per cent mark up and a much higher dispensing fee than has been set by the Tribunal, will recognise the reality. Tomorrow I will be meeting with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and I will also be having discussions with the friendly societies, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, and unions of workers associated with that industry. I hope that cool heads, reason and reality will prevail.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the other element of the question, the supply of medication, I can say quite categorically that Australians wherever they live need not fear any loss of access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by any action of the Government on this matter. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as we all know, is very much underrated and very important. We all need to protect it. There are problems associated with the overuse of drugs and the inappropriate use of drugs. We need to protect the scheme so that it can go on playing its role in providing for the aged, the chronically ill, those on low incomes, and in fact all Australians, the world's best and latest pharmaceuticals at the least cost to the Australian public. The Government will not allow any problems associated with this current situation to interfere in that security for all Australians.</PARA>

In the light of comments by Captain Wayne Cairns on AM this morning that on that basis we should be able to get a pilot into the right hand seat of a 737 overnight, can the Prime Minister tell the House how many commercial airline pilots have been trained in Australia since he made that stupid statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here is the fourth question today from the Opposition which is yet again a demonstration of the total chaos that rules within its ranks on this issue. As the Treasurer says, `What a knockout question'. There have been four pathetic questions. I do not know how many commercial pilots have been trained in Australia in this period, so I will not attempt to guess an answer. If the honourable member really wants to know I suggest that he address the question to the relevant Minister, who will take steps to find out the answer to this profoundly important question. It really is something which is earth shatteringly important!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is this: the Opposition simply now is caught on the horns of its own dilemma. The simple fact that we have here, which every commentator is coming to realise, is that the Opposition is nailed. It is nailed with the situation that the pilots are operating according to the industrial relations policy of the Opposition. That is what is happening. Opposition members cannot make up their minds. At the end of last week the Leader of the Opposition came out and said he supported what the Government had done to deal with this dispute.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were no qualifications; the Leader of the Opposition supported it. They cannot make up their minds. They say that the pilots should have the right to opt out of the system. What have the pilots done? They have opted out of the system. What does the Opposition then say? `We will introduce a Bill in the House'. To do what? To deal with people who are within the system and to impose more penalties on them. Has anybody ever heard of anything more stupid? They say first of all to the pilots and to anyone else who will listen, `Opt out of the system. That's what our policy encourages you to do'. The pilots opt out. What does the Opposition then say? `We will introduce legislation to impose more penalties within the system'. That is very logical! It tells the pilots to get out, they get out, and then the Opposition will do something more within the system. The fact is that not only are the pilots not in the system, they are also no longer in a situation of an employment relationship. They have resigned. In a situation like that, the policy of the Opposition is absolutely irrelevant, as is the whole of its industrial relations policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of seven hours training, one was making the point-and it relates back to the previous answer I gave-that to actually learn to fly an aeroplane takes that order of time. Of course, no-one, including myself, said that after one has learnt to fly an aeroplane one can then hop into the cockpit of a 727. No-one is saying that, but in terms of training I am saying that those who service these planes go through a very long period of training to acquire their qualifications as mechanics and engineers. The people who maintain and service these aeroplanes are ignored in this situation. If those people have not got the training, the commitment, the integrity that is necessary, then the planes the pilots fly and in which passengers fly will simply not be safe.</PARA>
<PARA> The time has come when the pilots have to understand that they are not going to hold the country to ransom, they are not going to wreck the wages system, they are not going to ruin the Australian economy on the basis of some mystique that they want to attach to themselves. They are important people. They have a fundamentally important job to do, but so do many other people, including the people who put those planes into the air. The time has come, and the pilots must understand that the time has come, when neither this Government nor the airline industry nor the Australian economy is going to be held to ransom by people who want an increase which is equal to what those who put their planes into the air get paid for the whole year.</PARA>
<PARA> We do not want the pilots to keep on like this. I repeat now what I said at the very beginning of this dispute. I plead with the pilots to say, `Okay, we've made a mistake. What's good enough for the rest of the Australian community is good enough for us'. If they will make the simple statement that they recognise that they are not uniquely different from other Australians, then we can come back to a situation where their legitimate claims can be dealt with within the system. There is full opportunity for significant increases in wages-the 6 per cent plus that is available under the system, including negotiations for increased productivity. Is there anyone in Australia who suggests that there is not significant room for productivity increase? Is anyone really saying that Australian pilots uniquely in the world need to work only eight hours a week at the stick? Of course there is room for these people to work longer hours, and if they work longer hours then there is room for significant pay increases. But there is not room for significant pay increases when these people simply say, `We won't work within the system. We'll hold a gun at your head and demand a 30 per cent increase on top of the $80,000 a year we get for working eight hours a week'.</PARA>
<PARA> If they think they can go on like that, they are wrong. I do not want them to go on like that. I want a situation where they will go back into the system and negotiate with their employers. If they do that, there is the opportunity both for significant increases in remuneration and for significant increases in productivity-significant increases in productivity which not only will redound to their benefit in terms of increased remuneration, but also will redound to the benefit of the airline traffic-using public of Australia. If they get those significant increases in productivity, that can operate as a bulwark against further increases in air fares in the near future. In other words, the productivity increases that can come from the pilots working a reasonable number of hours can be shared both by the pilots and by the public of Australia who fly in their aeroplanes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the question asked by the honourable member for Hotham. I think he and all honourable members would be aware that the Government has indicated its support for the concept of a very fast train development. In the last few weeks we have made a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure so that members of the Parliament will have the opportunity to examine a number of issues relating to that proposed development which are of concern not only to the Parliament but also to the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everyone is aware of the fact that in December of last year the joint venturers had completed their concept report, which indicated the prospects that could be associated for them and for south-eastern Australia generally with the development of that particular proposal. They are now in the process of completing a three-year feasibility study at a cost of almost $20m to examine the commercial viability of that particular proposal. Not only the Commonwealth Government but also the State governments have indicated in-principle support for the concept. We have indicated that we would be prepared to assist and cooperate, because we support the concept of that development, to the extent that may be necessary. In the process of doing that, we will take any necessary steps that could be designed to protect the community interest.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and other members of the Government have indicated that this is a particularly exciting concept. Those people who are of the opinion that it simply represents some type of new transport development or link between Sydney and Melbourne seriously understate the significance of it. The Prime Minister has indicated that it is probably the most important private sector venture or investment project which has been undertaken in Australia since the Second World War. It could well be the most important venture of that kind which has ever been undertaken in Australia. It is not just a proposed transport development; it is a total transport land development package. That has been made perfectly clear by the joint venturers. Those people understand that companies such as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Elders IXL, TNT and Kumagai Gumi are all companies of substance. They are significant developers and investors in Australia. The project has the capacity to remake the pattern of urban and industrial development and transport and communications in south-eastern Australia. But we have also indicated that we will not underwrite, at the Commonwealth level-nor do I think the States would underwrite-any financial commitment towards that.</PARA>

We have also indicated that we will expect appropriate guarantees from the joint venturers that we will not be expected in any way to financially underwrite that project or to commit any public funds to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is it a fact that the examiners of airmen in the Civil Aviation Authority are members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP)? Have these officers pledged not to train, upgrade or approve to fly foreign or domestic pilots recruited by the airlines to break the present strike? In this case how does the Minister propose to achieve certification for new pilots?</PARA></TALK.START>

What we are seeing from the Opposition is a series of questions which simply shows no interest in resolving the dispute but an interest in making political capital out of it. As far as I am aware, the airworthiness examiners are members of the AFAP. In that respect, they may or may not be adhering to instructions from the AFAP. As far as I am aware at this stage they have not been put to the test.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories. I refer to the growing concern throughout the Australian tourism industry regarding the damage caused by the pilots dispute, particularly in relation to loss of earnings, the effects on jobs and the reputation of Australia as an international tourist destination. What action is the Government taking in relation to this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="587" SPEAKER="Holding The Hon A.C." NAMEID="CH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MELBOURNE PORTS" MINISTERIAL="ARTS AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present position is that the Australian Tourist Commission is working closely in conjunction with overseas operators to assist them as they try to disengage, with a minimum of damage, those tourists who plan to come to Australia. They have also been cooperating with overseas operators to ensure that they are fully informed about the present situation in Australia. There is a Tourism Advisory Council meeting planned for early September, at which leaders of the industry will be discussing what options are available to minimise the damage which is being caused on a daily basis to Australia's tourism industry. There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that tourism is the most significant victim of this airline stoppage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the statistical material that is available, some 25,000 to 35,000 overseas visitors travel in Australia on domestic airlines each week. The estimate made by the Bureau of Tourism Research is that if the number of visitors dropped by one-third over August, Australia would lose over $100m in foreign exchange for the month. If the dispute had the same impact on arrivals through to December the figure would almost double, to about $180m for the month. It is more difficult to get an accurate figure in respect of domestic travel. It makes up about 80 per cent of tourism travel in Australia. Some authorities within the industry have put the loss as high as $70m per week in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> I need to indicate to the House that in discussions which involve the Australian Tourism Industry Association, the Australian Hotels Association, the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, and the Inbound Tourist Operators Association, there is a common resolve that the damage that is being done on a daily basis to the tourism industry will be met with all the capacity that the industry can mount. Already major hotels have stood down casual staff and, by the end of the week, they will be standing down permanent staff. All those associations have asked me to indicate to this House and the people of Australia that we are examining as closely as we can, on the best legal advice obtainable, what action can be taken on behalf of the industry to bring the pilots and the Pilots Federation to their senses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received no advice on the likely impact of a continuation of the pilots dispute on the Budget figuring, but I would say this to the shadow Treasurer: if he has any influence on the Opposition-he may have-I wish that he would bring home to his colleagues the appropriateness of the strength of the Government's stand on this issue. I wish that those opposite, including the shadow Treasurer, would make up their minds where they stand. They have done nothing in this Parliament this week other than be apologists for the pilots. It is understandable, in a sense, that they should do that because the pilots are acting strictly in accordance with their policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, as my colleague the Minister who has just resumed his seat has said, the realities of this start to emerge very clearly when we see the unity ticket that is developing-a very strange unity ticket-with the pilots, the Opposition and the socialist workers alliance of Australia. It is not very strange when one thinks about it because, in terms of philosophy and position, when those opposite were in office they wrecked the Australian economy. The pilots are trying to do it now and the socialist workers of Australia have a philosophical commitment to the wrecking of the Australian economy. In one way or another all Opposition members are wreckers, potentially or philosophically, of the Australian economy. So it is not strange that the socialist workers, the Liberal and National parties and the pilots are all in one grizzly bed together.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that considerable concern has been expressed by various groups about the application of Medicare benefits to laser therapy for vascular skin lesions, otherwise known as port wine stains. To date the laser therapy treatment for port wine stains has been restricted to the head and neck for Medicare benefits purposes. This was done on the grounds of overseas evidence which indicated that the results of this form of therapy on other parts of the body were less than satisfactory. However, the latest laser technology does permit effective treatment of port wine stains on other parts of the body. Having accepted this new evidence, I have approved a recommendation of the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee (MBAC) that Medicare benefits be extended for the removal of port wine stains from any part of the body. This change has been made retrospective to 1 February 1989. That was the date on which the restrictions were introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As regards other severely disfiguring skin lesions treated by laser therapy, for the moment these will be restricted to the head and neck. That continuation of the restriction is in line with the best medical evidence provided by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee after detailed consideration of these other disfiguring lesions. Where treatment of other severely disfiguring skin lesions on areas of the body other than the head and neck is performed for clinical and not simply cosmetic reasons, applications can be made to the MBAC in individual cases.</PARA>
<PARA> Technology is changing rapidly and there are likely to be advances in the coming months-for instance, original machines are being replaced by new machines-and some of the benefits are yet to be determined. For all those reasons I have requested the MBAC to review the whole question of laser therapy for vascular skin lesions in 12 months time so we can keep it under review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present the Government's response to the report Fairness, Courtesy and Efficiency? A Report on the Quality of Service provided by the Department of Social Security. The report was prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs and tabled in this House on 25 May 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Terms of Reference</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I referred an inquiry to the Committee in February 1988. The terms of reference were to examine the effectiveness of methods used to provide information on entitlements to social security clients-and the effectiveness of the Department of Social Security in providing face to face contact with its clients. The Committee was also asked to examine any proposals to enhance awareness and take-up of entitlements by persons who qualify for assistance under the Department's programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The background to this inquiry is one of enormous change in the social security system since 1983. In that time, the levels of assistance provided through the Department's programs have been significantly increased. At the same time, social security outlays have declined as a proportion of the Budget and as a share of gross domestic product. These achievements have required enormous policy and legislative reforms and administrative and systems changes within the Department of Social Security. At the same time, the functions of the Department were being significantly broadened beyond its traditional income security role by programs such as family allowance supplement, the child support scheme, Newstart and the jobs, education and training program. </PARA>
<PARA> Change in an organisation the size of my Department is difficult. The Department has 16,500 staff in 300 locations serving the needs of a diverse client population of around 4.2 million throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Total payments to clients of $20 billion in 1989-90 represent 23 per cent of all Commonwealth outlays. The size of the administrative task is immense-in 1987-88 100 million payments were made. It was in this context that I referred the inquiry to the Standing Committee. It is essential that information provision and client access to services be effectively integrated with the rapid changes occurring in the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the task faced by the Department, the Government has given the highest possible priority to administrative reform within the Department. In recent years there have been very significant advances in the way the Department of Social Security has provided clients with access to its programs and services. The Department has vigorously adopted new technologies and innovative administrative practices. It can be proud of its achievements. In fact, many of the matters raised in the Committee's report and its recommendations are already in place or are being addressed. In some cases alternative strategies to those suggested have been developed. These are assessed as producing better results or being more cost effective. To implement all of the Committee's recommendations would require a total additional amount of $40m. This represents some 7 per cent of current running costs. I will table a detailed response to each of the Committee's recommendations at the end of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Use of Technology</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> At the outset this Government recognised the need for the social security system to be supported by modern, efficient computer operations and endorsed the stratplan program. With the implementation of stratplan completed last year, on time and within budget, the Department now operates one of the largest computer networks in the country. It is probably the most advanced social security automatic data processing system operating anywhere in the world. This advanced technology has resulted in the significantly more effective and helpful administration of social security programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of this technology has allowed for the integration of the Department's major payments systems through the introduction of on-line benefits processing. On-line benefits processing has a strong client focus and is resulting in improved service to clients through the decentralised network of the Department's regional offices. </PARA>
<PARA> On-line benefits processing will improve service to clients by allowing speedier processing of claims, more accurate and faster answering of queries and simultaneous updating of all related benefits when there is a change of client circumstances. The system can also monitor progress of outstanding action. It ensures a close client focus-common processing actions for all benefits mean more efficient and effective resolution of client queries. </PARA>
<PARA> The flexibility afforded by the new technology makes possible innovative policy development and program delivery as well as much more effective and pervasive control of payments, ensuring that only those who are eligible under the Social Security Act receive them. The Department has looked to new technology to enable vast improvements to be made to its written communications with clients. This area received special attention by the Standing Committee. The Government recognises the magnitude of the task-each year the Department of Social Security sends out over five million letters and eight million review advices. These notify clients of changes which may affect them and request information if their circumstances have changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department now uses laser printing technology to produce simpler, more straightforward advices personalised to each client's circumstances. The advices incorporate the principles of good forms design and plain English. The Department will be using this technology for all its computer printed correspondence and forms. An on-line letters and advices project is at an advanced stage of development. It will convert all of the Department's standard letters to laser production by mid-1990 and the phased conversion of computer produced advices by mid-1991. The size of the task is demonstrated by the fact that there are over a million variations of computer produced advices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department's computer network has also provided new opportunities for distributing information to staff. An on-line information system allows staff throughout the Department to have easy access to up to date information affecting the eligibility of clients. This system has become an essential element in the delivery of internal information. Importantly it facilitates more consistent and accurate decision making across the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Restructuring of Management and Decision Making</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Major areas of reform of direct relevance to the report include an expansion of the role of area offices and the devolution of functions to allow more effective day to day management-including community consultation and information provision-at the area office level. The result will be improved decision making based on the needs of local clients and staff and better management. An important outcome of the strengthening of area offices is the area based review system. This provides for independent decision makers in area offices to review and, where appropriate, quickly change decisions affecting clients made in regional offices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government established in November last year the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) as an independent determinative body. The SSAT has as members welfare workers, doctors and lawyers drawn from their various communities. The national convener of the SSAT advises me on difficulties and anomalies identified by the Tribunal through its work in hearing appeals. </PARA>
<PARA>Reforming Policy and Legislation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> No review of this Government's reforms can overlook the wide ranging implications of the work of the Social Security Review in assisting us with the reform of policy and legislation. Its most recent work has dealt with the crucial area of retirement income policy-work which culminated in my recent statement and Budget announcements. Issues relating to families and children, sole parents and the unemployed have also been dealt with and we are now turning our attention to the remaining matter dealt with by the review-disability payments. The new directions which are flowing from the review are having major impacts on legislation, policy, programs and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> An important barometer for the Government of the effectiveness of the Department's administration is the Social Security Advisory Council. This body of experts in the social security field provides me with advice on issues relating to the administration of my portfolio as well as important input to social security policy. </PARA>
<PARA> A major task being undertaken at present is the complete review of the Social Security Act. The revised legislation will provide a vastly more coherent legislative base for the administration of social security programs. It will ensure that the law is as easy to understand as is possible with large, complex Acts, is internally consistent and is accessible to both staff and clients. These developments together with the other advances made by the Department of Social Security in recent years provide a sound basis on which to build even greater efficiency, effectiveness and integrity in the administration of my portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>Lifting the Standard of Service</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90, the Department is working to achieve better client access to services, information and entitlements; to improve communication with staff; and to take full advantage of the opportunities the changes I have mentioned give to increase productivity and enhance the work environment. The delivery of programs by the Department of Social Security is central to the achievement of the Government's social justice objectives. Those programs are central to fair income distribution. We are committed to ensuring that all people have full access to payments they are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department is now implementing a package of measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget to lift the standard of service to clients-including training for public contact staff; development of the decentralised office network, particularly in rural areas; the establishment of an area office based information service for pensioners; and special measures to improve access for Aboriginal and Islander parents. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Chairman of the Standing Committee, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), presented its report to the House, members of the Committee spoke of the dedication and commitment of staff in Social Security offices. I want again to put on record my own appreciation to the staff of the Department. Let me say that without their dedication and professionalism we would not have moved so far down the path of achieving social justice for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has performed for the Parliament a very valuable service in doing the work and producing this report. The area of service has been a major area of priority for the Government in the current financial year. Any examination of this year's Budget will indicate the range of initiatives that the Government has undertaken in the area of improving client services in this Budget. Those initiatives have coincided with and had the benefit of the information provided by the Committee and the Committee can rest assured that in this response-including the attachment but in particular in the Budget Papers-the Government has taken account of the work carried out. I table the Government's response to each of the recommendations in the Committee's report and seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security actively encourage Regional Office Managers to produce supplementary information regarding their local office and related services. (para 2.27)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department's Regional Managers are actively encouraged to involve themselves in community outreach and in the production of material which is helpful in the local situation. These activities are being assisted and supported by the newly appointed Area Outreach Officers whose role includes:</PARA>
<PARA>* direct assistance to Regional Managers with their particular regional outreach endeavours; and</PARA>
<PARA>* assessing and evaluating the Department's information strategies and products. </PARA>
<PARA>In late 1988 the Department carried out an audit of Regional Public Relations. A number of recommendations were put forward as a result of the audit. Among them was the recommendation that the Department develop a national Public Relations Plan and that the Plan include standards of involvement for Area Outreach Officers as well as a system for monitoring and evaluating public relations activity. Implementation of the Plan will further enhance and develop the Department's strategy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 2, 3 and 4</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Community consultative committees be established to meet at regular intervals in order to facilitate the exchange of information and concerns between the Department of Social Security and the Community. (para 3.23)</PARA>
<PARA>Such committees be established at Area and Regional Office levels. (para 3.23)</PARA>
<PARA>One function of Area Managers and Regional Managers is to establish consultative arrangements with welfare organisations and client groups. The newly appointed Area Outreach Officers now assist in this process by:</PARA>
<PARA>* initiating and generating interaction with various agencies and bodies on an area or locality basis;</PARA>
<PARA>* establishing links with key people who work in community agencies and organisations relevant to the Department's sphere of interest (including trade union, employer and training interests); and</PARA>
<PARA>* arranging forums and other activities with consumer groups to enable clients to contribute to policy, administration and service issues. </PARA>
<PARA>A position of Community Liaison Officer be established in each Regional Office to facilitate communication between community agencies, the Department and its clients. (para 3.25)</PARA>
<PARA>Trials of community consultative arrangements have been operating in Victoria over the last three years or more. In addition, the Department has been discussing with the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) a proposal for a pilot involving the establishment of a number of Area-based consultative committees. A report on the proposal will be prepared for the consideration of the Social Security Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA>As noted in the report, Regional Managers and Social Workers already seek to facilitate communication between community agencies, the Department and its clients at the regional level. </PARA>
<PARA>With reference to the recommendation to establish a Community Liaison Officer in each Regional Office, Area and Regional Managers and Social Workers already provide effective consultation at the local level. In addition, it is considered that the objectives underlying this recommendation can be achieved more effectively and at much less cost through Area Outreach Officers. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>A senior staff member at the Administrative Service Officer Class 3 level or above is available at the counter at all times. (para 4.14)</PARA>
<PARA>Developments have overtaken this recommendation. Under the Regional Office Job Redesign Agreement made with the unions, ASO4's will handle the more complex cases at the counter (e.g. full interview for new claims) and in the field (e.g. complex misrepresentations). Other public contact work at the counter and in the field will be undertaken by staff at the ASO3 level. </PARA>
<PARA>These features of the Regional Office Job Redesign Agreement have already been introduced in many offices and should be operational by the end of the year in all of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The staff selection process include application of secondary selection criteria, one of which is the requirement for a high level of interpersonal skills. (para 4.14)</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation is already under active consideration. The Department has proposed to the Public Service Commission that it trial secondary selection criteria for the recruitment of staff to the Department. A high level of interpersonal skills is one of the criteria proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department is keen to use these criteria because they provide obvious advantages in obtaining staff who have an interest in, and capacity for, assisting clients. These interests and skills are not tested adequately in the current selection procedures for the APS. Discussions are continuing with the PSC and the unions with a view to adopting secondary selection criteria. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security support its staff adequately by giving them appropriate interpersonal skills training at all levels in the organisation and as soon as possible after entering the Department. (para 4.14)</PARA>
<PARA>Within its resource capacity the Department conducts courses for staff in all aspects of public contact including interpersonal skills training. The initiatives recently announced in the 1989/90 Budget address this recommendation by providing additional resources for training, especially in the areas as of interpersonal skills and conflict resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter is being pursued in the Structural Efficiency Principle discussions with the unions to ensure that staff receive adequate training before being requested to perform public contact functions. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Staff do not assume public contact duties until they have been employed in a Regional Office for an extended period, preferably six months. (para 4.14)</PARA>
<PARA>In the re-structured offices following Second Tier Wage Agreement Job Redesign this is most unlikely to occur. However, it is not possible for all staff to be excluded from public contact duties in the first six months of their employment in a Regional Office particularly if public contact is seen to include contact by phone. </PARA>
<PARA>For those who have been employed elsewhere in the Department, the six-month rule may not be appropriate. For those who have been recruited recently, the Department would aim not to have them assume full public contact duties until it was sure they had the necessary skills to deal with clients effectively and the necessary technical expertise. Generally, it could be expected that this would take six months. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Second Tier Wage Agreement the Department has upgraded the level of staff who will have public contact. Counter and field enquiries will be handled now by ASO3s. </PARA>
<PARA>This was done because the Department recognised that it is important that public contact staff in Regional Offices have the training and experience to make decisions and process client enquiries from initial contact through to the assessment of the eligibility of claims. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Structural Efficiency Principle, the Department is looking to revise the duties of staff at the base level so that such positions would be regarded as in-training positions. Its proposals in this regard appear to be consistent with the aim of the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 9</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security include, as part of its staff training, information on the background to Departmental policies and the political and social context in which the Department operates, including information on the labour market. (para 4.14)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department has sought to include information on the background to Departmental policies increasingly in its technical training when new policies are announced by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department runs an intensive one-week program for managers designed to give them an appreciation of the broader context in which the Department operates. </PARA>
<PARA>The induction and other training courses of the Department include information on the Department and where it fits in the wider context. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 10 and 11</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security expand its use of toll free services to provide either a national or State based permanent facility. (para 4.22)</PARA>
<PARA>The permanent 008 facility to comprise two elements, one a `help desk' for staff and the second an information hotline for clients. (para 4.22)</PARA>
<PARA>For many years the Department has had a policy of accepting calls on a reverse charge basis or calling clients back where a client is calling from outside the `local' call area. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Department has 008 services in most offices where they are needed. Currently 86 Regional Offices have 008 services installed. In line with recent legislation, the Department is developing these services and a further 13 are on order. It is expected that 008 services will be available in all Regional Offices where they are needed by the end of September 1989. ``Reverse charges'' and ``call back'' arrangements will continue to be available for circumstances not met by the 008 service. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department has maintained special purpose telephone enquiry services since late 1984 when an Assets Test ``Hotline'' was established in all States. Since that time 008 information services have been used in connection with major policy statements by Government-including Budget/Economic Statements and specific initiatives, such as Family Allowance Supplement (FAS). Over the last two years hotlines spread over six locations have run almost continuously. The Department has found the use of 008 lines to be generally cost effective, easily accessible and a direct method of client contact. In addition, statistical monitoring of calls received has provided the Department with useful feedback on client attitudes, information provided and potential problems as well as for planning and co-ordinating future enquiry services. </PARA>
<PARA>To date the telephone enquiry services have been State-based because of technical and resource considerations. While there is some variety in the operation of each service there is general consistency in hours of operation and the extent to which the availability of each service is advertised. The Department has established a single national hotline based in Sydney to coincide with a major family payments advertising campaign during July/August 1989. The results of this campaign will be carefully monitored with a view to examining the full implications of establishing a permanent national 008 facility serviced from one or a number of locations and accessible from all areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department recognises the utility of ``help desk'' facilities for staff. With 16,600 staff, it is difficult to establish an effective service. </PARA>
<PARA>The concept is being developed with the devolution of functions to Area Offices. Expert Benefits Administration Units in devolved Area Offices provide ring-in policy advice services for Regional Office staff. As well as providing phone advice, expert policy staff visit Regional Offices in their Areas on a regular basis. Staff are given the opportunity to select in advance areas for discussion and review. Seminars for OICs are held which provide additional information to key staff-particularly in connection with Budget and other initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Regional Office staff can obtain advice also from specialist policy areas in State Offices. These arrangements are particularly active in Areas where devolution is yet to be completed. </PARA>
<PARA>Officers from the Area and State Office Benefits Administration and specialist policy units in turn have access to advice from nominated specialist staff in the Department's Central Administration. </PARA>
<PARA>Comprehensive assistance including phone advice to staff on procedural and other matters is also available from the training units in State Offices and all Area Offices. </PARA>
<PARA>Regular conferences of Area, State and Central offices benefits experts are held to ensure that at the local level those on whom Regional Office staff rely for expert advice and guidance are fully informed and up to date on new policy developments. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security investigate the conduct of its Field Officers in order to assess the extent to which the guidelines are infringed. (para 4.35)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department's Field Officers are expected to maintain high standards in their work and are assisted by guidelines and training. Input from welfare organisations can play a useful role in the training of the Department's field staff. Some initiatives have already been taken along these lines and managers at State and Area levels are being encouraged to extend them. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department also investigates every complaint about field staff behaviour and, where necessary, takes disciplinary action. Unsubstantiated allegations made by welfare groups such as the Welfare Rights Unit in Melbourne, coupled with a refusal to provide relevant client details to the Department so it can establish what actually occurred, hinder the Department's efforts to minimise problems in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Letters of advice left by Field Officers incorporate:</PARA>
<PARA>* the reason the Field Officer called;</PARA>
<PARA>* the option of having the interview at home or in the Regional Office; and</PARA>
<PARA>* advice to the effect that the client has the right to have a friend, advisor, interpreter or advocate present during the interview, wherever it may be held. (para 4.35)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department's national `Advice of Visit' card advises the client that an officer of the Department had called but did not find him/her at home. All visits to clients by Field Assessors are of a routine nature i.e. they are being made as part of normal Departmental review arrangements which seek to establish the correctness of current payments. As the Committee knows, the Department's risk analysis approach means that cases can come to notice for review in a number of ways. To identify the background to the selection in correspondence prior to commencement of the interview would cause unnecessary distress to a client and create an impression that the Department expected the outcome to be a reduction in fortnightly rate (even cancellation) and an overpayment. The view is taken that any procedure which could give rise to such impressions should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>The `Advice of Visit' card advises the client that:</PARA>
<PARA> * the Field Assessor will call again at a particular time and date; or</PARA>
<PARA> * he/she should ring the nominated contact officer to arrange a mutually convenient interview time. </PARA>
<PARA>When the client rings the contact officer, he/she can request that the interview take place in the Regional Office. </PARA>
<PARA>Clients often prefer to be interviewed in their homes since the atmosphere is more comfortable and they are more likely to have any material that they need close at hand. </PARA>
<PARA>Interpreters and advisers are already used as part of the interview process when required. The Department is currently developing a Field Assessor pamphlet which will advise clients of the role of Field Assessors. It is intended that the pamphlet will be given to all new clients as part of the pre-grant information package and be left with the `Advice of Visit' card. </PARA>
<PARA>The availability of an interpreter and the right to have an adviser present will be dealt with in that material. The presence of advocates at interviews is not supported. The Department strives to ensure that interviews do not develop into adversary situations. Having other people present in an advocacy (as opposed to advisory) capacity would negate these efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 14 and 15</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>All new clients be given, as a matter of course, a pre-grant interview, during which their rights and obligations are clearly outlined. (para 4.44)</PARA>
<PARA>These recommendations could be based on a misconception of the Department's practices. Existing procedures provide for all people who visit an office of the Department to apply for a benefit or pension to be interviewed and given information about their rights and obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>All clients re-applying for benefits after a period of 12 months without social security support also be given a pre-grant interview. (para 4.44). </PARA>
<PARA>However, where, for instance, a person has claimed benefit previously and is well aware of requirements, the contact with such a person need not be of long duration. A streamlined interview process is used in such situations to reduce the amount of time a client needs to spend with the Department's interviewing officer. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 16 and 17</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security ensure that regional Offices are equipped with the following:</PARA>
<PARA>* play areas and toys for children;</PARA>
<PARA>* toilet facilities for clients; and</PARA>
<PARA>* a television set and/or video cassette recorder placed strategically in the waiting area. (para 4.51)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security offer clients the option of private interviewing facilities prior to asking any personal questions. (para 4.51)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department has gone some way towards meeting these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Play areas, toys and television are already provided in a number of Regional Offices. It is intended to provide more television sets as resources allow. The provision in Regional Offices of activity packs for children is being trialled by a number of Area Outreach Officers. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the Department's policy to ensure toilet facilities are available on all premises. These facilities are being provided progressively as office accommodation is upgraded or offices are relocated. However, there are constraints. The Department leases its office space and there are difficulties in terms of both cost and suitability of available accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>Private interviewing facilities are available in all offices. Staff will be reminded that clients are to be given the opportunity to be interviewed in private. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 18, 19 and 20</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security implement a revised set of standards for the content of letters to clients. As a minimum, these standards should include that letters:</PARA>
<PARA>* are always dated and include the name of a contact officer;</PARA>
<PARA>* are forwarded to the client prior to termination of payment;</PARA>
<PARA>* set out the calculations on which the level of payment/termination of payment has been based;</PARA>
<PARA>* include a simple, personalised explanation if payment has been altered or terminated;</PARA>
<PARA>* advise alternative avenues of income support, where possible and/or avenues of appeal; and</PARA>
<PARA>* are accompanied by a translation in a preferred language where applicable. (para 5.15)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department has looked to new technology to enable vast improvements to be made in its written communications with clients. Necessary work is now well advanced towards the production of advices using laser printing technology, including the conversion of the Department's standard letters to laser production under a project called Online Letters and Advices. </PARA>
<PARA>The standard that letters should be dated is already being met and some also include contact telephone numbers, advice of avenues of appeal and of alternative types of income support available. The Department will move as quickly as possible to give effect to these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Advices of termination are produced and issued to clients as soon as the Department is aware of the event which precludes further payments. In many cases, this occurs before the next payment is due. In other situations the date of the event is known in advance and this knowledge is used to give clients early warning. Supporting parents are advised, for example, one year and again at 3 months before his/her last qualifying child attains the age of 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA>With reference to the calculations used in arriving at rates of payments, existing advices cater for this where a payment is granted or varied. The progressive implementation of Online Advices will further enhance capacity to incorporate more detailed information, and to allow more flexibility to tailor letters to suit individual cases. This will also satisfy the Committee's recommendation that a personalised explanation be included if payments are altered or terminated. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not proposed to implement the suggested standard that letters be accompanied, where applicable, by a translation in a preferred language. The use of qualified translators to provide this service for even the most frequently used foreign languages in all of the Department's Regional Offices could not be justified. However, the Department does include on the reverse of its computer produced advices a message in several different languages. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security develop a single application form for all clients. (para 5.24)</PARA>
<PARA>The application form comprise a number of streaming questions which indicate the most appropriate form of payment for which the client might be eligible. (para 5.24)</PARA>
<PARA>The concept of the use of a generic claim form for the major pensions, benefits and allowances is under active development but is by no means simple to implement or operate. The introduction of the Person Data Update System will provide an opportunity to develop the concept. Plans are in hand to pilot a generic claim form. The pilot will allow for a qualitative assessment of the effectiveness of various options. Legal aspects of a generic claim form will also have to be taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Standardised processing of new claims, regardless of the payment claimed, will be necessary in future because of the online environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 21</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Initial application forms be evaluated at Determining Officer Level. </PARA>
<PARA>It is Departmental policy that Determining Officers should always be available to assist with new claims. In many Regional Offices Determining Officers also perform the Streaming Officer function. In this situation new claims are evaluated by the Determining Officer. In other offices, the skill levels and experience of staff allow this function to be performed at a lower classification. </PARA>
<PARA>Straightforward new claims normally receive a counter contact interview. The length of the interview is determined by the amount and nature of the information required. The Department considers it is more efficient and cost effective for those simple new claim interviews to be performed by lower classified officers. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 22 and 23</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security ensure that the wall chart is updated on a regular basis, and immediately major changes are announced. (para 5.32)</PARA>
<PARA>The wall chart is revised twice a year in line with CPI and rates of payment changes. The format and production are now being integrated with other Departmental information products providing details of rates of payments including leaflets, the pocket rates card and the desktop rates card. This is the result of an overall review of the Department's promotional material. </PARA>
<PARA>The wall chart be distributed as soon as possible after amendment, and in any case no later than two weeks after major announcements. (para 5.32)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department, in conjunction with a graphic design/consultancy group, is developing an integrated approach to its entire range of information products. This will ensure consistency of style, graphics, level of language and technical information in the information material produced for national distribution. At the same time, the distribution procedures for information products are being improved to ensure that all changes to policy and programs are communicated to clients and agencies as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 24, 25, 26 and 27</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security establish a consultative process with specific expert welfare bodies (for example the Sydney Welfare Rights Centre) as an essential element of the process of examining its manuals. (para. 5.38)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security continues to produce manuals and amended pages in hard copy, any updates to be forwarded to welfare agencies immediately changes are made on-line. (para 5.38)</PARA>
<PARA>In any case, the Department of Social Security provides copies of its manuals and the Social Security Act and amendments free-of-charge to recognised welfare agencies. (para 5.38)</PARA>
<PARA>Some changes to the manuals have been made taking into account comments from welfare bodies such as the Welfare Rights Centre (Sydney). However, given the large number of amendments made to the manuals each year, it would be impractical to seek input on most proposed amendments. It must also be borne in mind that the manuals are intended to provide guidance to Departmental officers-they are not prepared specifically to assist welfare groups. </PARA>
<PARA>While it is the intention to move towards the concept of a fully automated office environment with a major reliance on online reference material, there are no plans at present to dispense with paper copies of the Department's policy manuals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department will continue to issue hard copy amendments as quickly as possible after the changes are made to the policy manuals on the online database. </PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation to provide, free of charge, copies of the manuals, the Social Security Act and amendments to these documents cannot be accommodated as this action is contrary to Government charging policy. </PARA>
<PARA>As indicated above, at this stage policy manuals are to be retained in hard copy to complement online versions. If at some future date the Department decides to move to a totally online environment for its policy manuals and other internal reference documentation, the question of providing major welfare agencies with `appropriate support and software' will be examined. </PARA>
<PARA>If, in future, the Department of Social Security does decide to move completely to on-line manuals, the Department must also look to providing major welfare agencies with appropriate support and software. (para 5.38)</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 28 and 29</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security's Corporate television Unit be expanded to enable concentrated production of general client information, in addition to current training material. (para 5.42)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security, in conjunction with the Braille and Talking Book Library, proceed with a trial program for the production of audio cassette tapes. (para 5.44)</PARA>
<PARA>The majority of programs produced by the Corporate Television Unit aim to enhance the internal communications of the Department. While most internal programs are distributed to all staff, they are particularly targeted at Regional Offices so that public contact staff are kept up to date on changes that affect social Security recipients. </PARA>
<PARA>The Unit also produces programs for internal training purposes covering a wide range of topics: for example, Telephone Skills, Induction Training and Aboriginal Liaison Officer Training. </PARA>
<PARA>The Unit already produces programs aimed at particular community groups. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> * ``Aboriginal Community Video'' in an Aboriginal language and in English for remote Aboriginal communities in North-West Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> * ``Perhaps Social Security can Help You'' made for community groups and public contact staff;</PARA>
<PARA> * ``Social Security Information Video'' made in three local languages and English for Torres Strait Island communities;</PARA>
<PARA> * ``The New JET Program'' made for community groups; and</PARA>
<PARA> * ``a program on the reciprocal Social Security Agreement with Italy, made in Italian and English for Italian community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1988-9 financial year the Corporate Television Unit produced 24 programs in total. Within resource constraints the Department proposes to increase the number of programs produced by the Unit for community groups. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, an extensive study is well advanced into identifying and meeting the needs of clients with literacy problems. 1990 is International Literacy Year and the Department is taking a proactive approach to meeting the needs of people who experience difficulties owing to their literacy problems. Associated with this, an information package incorporating the use of audio tapes is being trialled at offices in NSW and the NT using audio playback equipment installed in the Regional Office. The audio information includes details relating to basic eligibility, the procedures for obtaining benefit and the rights and obligations of clients. Printed information is being reviewed with greater use of graphics and symbols in place of text wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The production of audio cassette tapes is already under way with pilot projects in both New South Wales and Victoria. The target audience for these is people who are visually impaired or blind. It is expected that this will develop into a national program in 1989/90. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 30</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security investigate the potential of the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association's Radio Station 8 KIN FM and Imparja Television for the production of appropriate social security material for broadcast through these outlets. (para 6.10)</PARA>
<PARA>This is already being done. The Department is currently working with Imparja to produce a video on FAS, targeted to Aboriginals, particularly those living in remote areas. The video is part of a campaign to promote FAS which will also include picture stories, posters and stickers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department has prepared advertisements for use on CAAMA radio alerting Aboriginal communities to the FAS products and the Department will continue to develop ways of using both CAAMA and Imparja and other media of this kind to assist in reaching this target group. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is committed to providing adequate access to DSS services for Aboriginal people and people in remote areas. A number of innovative services to Aboriginal communities were announced in the 1989/90 Budget. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> * a doubling, from 6 to 12, of the number of Remote Visiting Teams. These teams consist of two officers, a benefits expert and an Aboriginal Liaison Officer, who provide intensive assistance to remote area people in claiming and maintaining their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> * The establishment of an interpreter service to help the Department communicate with Aboriginal people whose first or only language is not English. </PARA>
<PARA> * The establishment of the Support Network for Aboriginal Parents (SNAP). Departmental officers will work primarily with Aboriginal women's groups, first to ensure that DSS entitlements are claimed and maintained and, second, to assist parents in their efforts to acquire greater home-making and economic skills. This scheme is designed primarily to achieve the Government's pledge with respect to child poverty in respect of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>All of these initiatives are biased heavily in favour of Aboriginal clients' preferred method of communication-face-to-face personal contact. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 31</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security's Regional Office Managers and Aboriginal workers promote a higher profile and easier access to their services throughout their areas of operation by seeking to appear regularly on Aboriginal radio and television programs. (para 6.10)</PARA>
<PARA>This is accepted in principle. The Department will ensure that all officers concerned are equipped with media skills and provide training for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 32 and 33</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security consult with the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Public Service Commission regarding the proposed cross-cultural communication training course. (para 7.9)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security make a commitment to include cross-cultural awareness courses in its training programs for public contact staff and commence such courses at the earliest opportunity. (para 7.9)</PARA>
<PARA>As part of the 1988/89 Budget initiatives in the migrant services area, provision was made for the Department to engage a consultant to develop staff training packages in cross-cultural awareness and communication. This training will be provided systematically to all Regional Office public contact staff and to all Section, Regional and Area Managers. </PARA>
<PARA>The consultant began work on the project in May 1989 and will complete the development of the packages by November 1989, with implementation continuing throughout 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department consulted the Office of Multicultural Affairs and its training consultants during the initial planning phase of the project in September 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1989/90 Budget builds on these initiatives by providing additional resources for training in cross-cultural awareness. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 34</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security encourage greater use of the telephone interpreter service through training programs and by installing conference telephones in at least one interviewing room in each Regional Office. (para 7.12)</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee may not have been aware that the Department does not need to use TIS to the same extent as in the past, primarily because of the introduction in January 1989 of the Telephone Information Program (TIP). TIP was a 1988-89 Budget initiative which has been proving very successful. (Further details on TIP are provided in comments on Recommendation 36.)</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, the Department has produced a training video entitled ``Communicating Through Interpreters'' which provides, among other things, comprehensive instruction for Regional Office staff in the proper use of interpreters and of the Telephone Interpreter Service (TIS). </PARA>
<PARA>Most Regional Offices have been provided with dual handsets to enable proper access to TIS. It is Departmental practice, however, to use TIS only in situations where a Departmental interpreter or bilingual staff member is not immediately available and generally to assist with simple enquiries. TIS is not suitable for use in more complex interview situations. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 35 and 36</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>A stock of application forms be available in both English and major community languages. (para 7.16)</PARA>
<PARA>Where a client has nominated a language, communication with that client be in both English and the preferred language. (para 7.16)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department has given a lot of attention to the usefulness of providing claim forms in a range of community languages. However, market research recently commissioned by the Department has shown that such an approach would not necessarily meet the needs of non-English speaking background clients (who have varying degrees of literacy in their own languages); nor is it desired by many such clients or their intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition to legal considerations, there are obvious practical difficulties and resource implications involved in producing, distributing, storing and regularly updating forms in a range of languages. </PARA>
<PARA>A more effective approach to assisting non-English speaking background clients in this area is currently being trialled and evaluated by the Department. This involves the use of form completion aids which provide instructions in the client's preferred language on how to complete Departmental claim forms. </PARA>
<PARA>To assist in the planning and provision of interpreter services, the client's preferred language is now asked for on all pension and benefit claim forms. </PARA>
<PARA>Written advices to clients now regularly include ``language blocks'' advising clients in a range of languages to contact the Department's Telephone Information Program (TIP) if they require information and advice in their own language about the contents of the correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA>TIP is particularly useful for people who cannot easily get to a Regional Office because, for example, they are working during the day, they live a considerable distance away or they have family commitments which keep them at home. </PARA>
<PARA>TIP operates five days a week during office hours with different languages rostered throughout the week. Callers from anywhere in Australia can contact the service for the cost of a local call. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 37 and 38</PARA>
<PARA>Reponse</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security investigate the possibility of running advertisements, similar to those which have appeared on SBS, on the ABC and other selected television stations. (para 7.23)</PARA>
<PARA>Regional Office Managers be encouraged to develop the use of local specialist media. (para 7.23)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department is a major user of ethnic press and electronic media outlets to publicise and provide information on its programs and services. </PARA>
<PARA>All major ethnic community newspapers are regularly provided with translated Ministerial media releases. Advertisements and articles providing information on, and explanations of, DSS payments and programs are prepared by the Department's media liaison personnel and regularly feature in the ethnic press. </PARA>
<PARA>Ethnic and community radio stations are used in all States to provide Social Security information to migrant communities, with the Department providing such stations with advertisements and information programs in a range of languages which, in some cases, are presented by bilingual Departmental staff.</PARA>
<PARA>Market research conducted last year indicated that ethnic radio is a very important source of social security information for people with a non-English speaking background. This finding has also been supported by evidence provided by Telephone Information Program (TIP) statistics. In general terms, ethnic radio has been reported by callers to TIP as a major source of referral. </PARA>
<PARA>More specifically, numbers of calls from particular migrant communities have consistently shown significant increases in periods immediately following the broadcast on ethnic radio of social security information in those communities' languages. The Department is keen to use this medium more to provide information to migrant communities and is examining ways of developing a more systematic approach to its use. </PARA>
<PARA>The ABC has advised that where the Department has community service notices (as opposed to advertising) it will place them in its schedule, provided the content and quality of production are given clearance by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. </PARA>
<PARA>At present community service notices are run during the day and sometimes late at night. They are not shown during peak times. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department will negotiate further with the ABC on this matter and attempt to introduce community advertisements where feasible. </PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the use of specialist media by Regional Managers, they are encouraged to, and do, use (particularly in country districts) local print and electronic media to respond to community concerns and queries and to provide information regarding DSS programs and facilities. The Area Outreach Officers assist Regional Managers in their media contacts and supplement these activities with direct contacts with local media. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 39</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security develop an information outreach program for use in schools and such community organisations as youth refuges and welfare agencies. (para 8.17)</PARA>
<PARA>As indicated in response to recommendations 1 to 4, the Department is expanding its local community outreach activities. Regional Office Managers and their staff are using opportunities to establish better contacts with agencies and organisations in their local areas to disseminate information about Departmental programs and services and to encourage feedback from the community on policies and procedures which affect clients. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, consultations with agencies working with young people are encouraged. A national strategy for an information outreach program for use in schools is being developed. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 40</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security develop an in-house training module for its client contact staff comprising:</PARA>
<PARA>* the technical aspects of Departmental programs available to young people; and</PARA>
<PARA>* the economic and social climate facing young people, particularly homeless and unemployed young people. (para 8.17)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department already provides training in the technical aspects of programs available to young people-such as the Young Homeless Allowance. The Department is reviewing the content of its current public contact training to ensure that it gives proper appreciation of the economic and social climate affecting young people. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 41</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security provide a report to the Minister for Social Security on the Youth Access Project, including details of progress made to address the recommendations made in the Report. (para 8.23)</PARA>
<PARA>The Youth Access project ran for a year in Area South (Metro) NSW in 1986/87 on a trial basis and the final report on its achievements was presented to the Minister in November 1987. Many of its findings have been incorporated into policies aimed at young people, notably the Young Homeless Allowance and Unemployment Benefit for under 18 year olds. </PARA>
<PARA>The Youth Access project highlighted a range of access problems and misconceptions experienced by young people in relation to the Department. The project addressed the specific needs of young people in one area of metropolitan Sydney. Further work in relation to young people in other settings is being undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department's ongoing information planning and strategies are aimed at remedying the problems identified by the project report and addressing these on a national basis wherever necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 42, 43 and 44</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security move quickly to provide staff in Regional Offices with a simple ``user friendly'' computer aid along the lines of the Social Security Enquiry System. (para 9.19)</PARA>
<PARA>This project commence with a trial of the modified Social Security Enquiry System in its Regional Offices. (para 9.19)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Social Security consult with the Department of Veterans' Affairs to ensure that there is minimum duplication of effort in the adaption of similar systems in both Departments. (para 9.19)</PARA>
<PARA>The Department is continuing its discussions with the developers of this system. However, the Department saw some limitations in using a standalone system of this kind. The system would need to be modified to integrate it with the Department's existing mainstream systems and client database. The Department is looking at how best this can be done and whether the Social Security Enquiry System is best suited and cost effective for this function. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department is well aware of the benefits arising from the use of `expert systems' and has already developed a prototype system for use in the administration of overseas pension payments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department is continuing to study and develop other Decision Support Facilities and is confident that a number of such facilities will be developed to help Regional Office staff with complex aspects of their work. </PARA>
<PARA>Discussions are continuing with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs titled Fairness, Courtesy and Efficiency? is an important report which was tabled in this House some months ago. I should just place on record that the need for an inquiry was brought to the attention of the Committee by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) on 3 February 1988. The specific terms of reference, which he was involved in drafting for the Committee, were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (i) the effectiveness of current methods of providing information to clients and potential clients of Social Security entitlements;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the effectiveness of methods currently used by the Department of Social Security to provide face to face contact with clients and potential clients; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) any proposals to enhance awareness and `take-up' of entitlements by persons who qualify for assistance under Social Security programs. </PARA>
<PARA>In the analysis conducted by the Committee three key words were used: fairness, courtesy and efficiency. I was somewhat surprised that at no stage in the departmental response or in the statement made by the Minister were any of those words referred to. I think one could be excused for saying that the Minister really has only given himself the opportunity to make yet another statement to the House about his stewardship of the overall direction of Government policy. He has not responded to the essential elements of this report. As the Deputy Chairman of the Committee I find the Government's response and the response of the Department of Social Security to the report somewhat disappointing. I say that in the sense that when one reads the analysis of the recommendations the report contains and then studies in detail the paper which has now been incorporated in Hansard, the Department tends to have taken the view that there is an adversary relationship between itself and the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In fairness, if virtually all the initiatives contained in the report were already in the process of being introduced, as the analysis suggests, why was the Committee not told? In all fairness, we have a substantial workload on that Committee and if the Department wishes to work with us both sides would be the first to say that we want close cooperation. The language in the response from the Department gives me, as a member of the Committee--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a tendency in the analytical stage of these things on occasions-and this appears to be one-for there not to be as close a rapport between the Committee and the Department as we would want to see. On initial assessment the Government's response to the recommendations of the inquiry therefore seems somewhat cursory and even suggests that the inquiry might have got it wrong. I acknowledge the Minister's comments that the size and administrative complexities of the Department make change difficult, especially for an organisation as large as this one. It is probably the largest organisation in the Public Service, with the exception of the Department of Defence, and therefore changes of the number, complexity and nature we have seen in the last seven years create major administrative problems. I think it is a compliment to the Department and to its staff that in fact it has been able to absorb most of those changes as well as it has in fact done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The findings of the Committee report outline a number of problems which we believe the Department has in its interface with the client groups. As well as the diverse mix of personal and social demands which the Department must meet in its role of service delivery to clients, these problems are mainly due to the speed and complexity of change with which the Department and its officers have to deal, often on a day-to-day basis. The Minister has often been heard to boast about the revolution that he has effected in the area of social security and welfare. The Government has introduced a vast number of changes during its term. That is not a deniable fact by any means. But many of these have been welcomed by the Opposition, particularly in the areas of family payments and child support. </PARA>
<PARA> This revolution, as the Minister refers to it, has not come without its adverse consequences. It has simply not been possible for many departmental officers to keep abreast of the many changes while trying at the same time to cope adequately with the day-to-day workload, which certainly varies from office to office depending on the suburbs and the areas where people may have various difficulties in relation to unemployment and other benefits. In addition, the recent fast rate of change with regard to social security entitlements has greatly increased the necessity for social security clients to seek information and often advocacy support from outside the Department. This is not necessarily of their choice. It is simply an acknowledgment of a reality that they feel, regrettably on some occasions, some degree of alienation between the person who is there seeking support and the departmental officers who are meant to be helping them. The advice and the information given to the Committee on these matters from organisations such as the Wright centres in both Sydney and Melbourne did emphasise that there was a problem; it was related not just to migrant groups, which often have a language difficulty, but to a range of other groups who on occasions feel some alienation from the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Departmental personnel are further constrained by the policy processes which embargo promoting changes until they are announced by the Government itself. This means that regional office staff are often unable to respond promptly to queries with consistent and accurate information. As I said, some of the changes introduced by the Government have been welcomed by the Opposition, but the Government does have a woeful track record in the areas of complex administrative change, the capacity to involve the Department and its officers closely in that change process, and above all, to give them the capacity to be able to explain that change as soon as possible after the event. There have been so many cases-for example, changes to the assets test, and things like that-where there has been considerable confusion among the recipient community as a result of the problems of being able to get advised by the Department. The introduction of the child support scheme, which has had bipartisan support, is an example of the sweeping administrative change that has left departmental workers often inadequately prepared for the onslaught of inquiries and administrative complexities which the system has brought about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is obviously less than generous in its allocation of extra staff and information services for its office personnel. The vast number of inquiries to my office, and no doubt to many other members, and the tragic story, for example, of a woman who was advised by a departmental officer that she had to pursue the father of her child for maintenance payments before a sole parent pension could be paid and who was in fact bashed as a result, are but sad testimony of the inadequate resources and the inaccurate information which regrettably is on occasions given by officers to clients. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, in its support for stage 2 of the child support legislative package, has requested a firm commitment from the Government that more adequate resources for information and staff training be made available. That is completely consistent with this report. The complexities of the system are not aided by the dissemination of inaccurate information by the Minister himself, and unfortunately this is the case. The Government's pensioner newspaper, the Age Pensioner News, for example, contained glaring errors and misled the 1.7 million Australian pensioners to whom this piece of blatant propaganda was sent. Getting wrong the non-taxable income threshold for pensioners is simply inexcusable. Similarly, the excuse of the Department, and presumably the Minister, that the Australian Taxation Office gave them the wrong figures is itself not an adequate response. Pensioners and the groups to which this type of documentation has been targeted have a right to expect accurate information from the Government no matter which department of government is ultimately responsible. Similarly, on the ABC AM program on 31 July of this year the Minister was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Today I understand is the last day when pension recipients can declare their tax file number. Is that the situation?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, and it is very important that people that haven't done that as yet make contact with their local social security office or the Department of Taxation as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The outcome of that particular bit of misinformation is that scores of distressed age pensioners phoned their local DSS offices and the Tax Office as a result of that comment. One DSS officer in Burnie in Tasmania alone received over 80 calls. One has to ask the question: How can officers of the Department be expected to cope with their own workload in addition to having to unscramble premature eggs laid by Ministers or by others in the minds of their constituent client groups, especially when they are based on wrong information?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement refers to the extensive advertising campaign being undertaken at present in various areas of Government policy-undoubtedly related to the next election. But he has stated in his own response here today the amount of resources which are going to be allocated in social security towards that particular result. What one has to ask, however, is whether the information being provided is adequate and whether it is accurate. The examples I have given so far give one reason to suspect that that is not the case. We are very happy that action has now been taken to establish a permanent 008 telephone facility, which will be a tremendous help to clients of the Department. This advertising campaign will no doubt have put the Department under even more pressure with increased amounts of inquiries which it will no doubt generate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to put on record my admiration for the DSS office personnel, who do work under enormous pressure at the coalface in the delivery of quality service to its clients. The pace of change over recent years occurring within the Department as a result of government policy has brought great pressure on those officers and, all else being equal, I think they have handled the situation as well as can be expected. But as has been brought out on numerous occasions in recent weeks, there is always the difficulty of being able to strike an adequate balance between the capacity of the Department to give the highest level of service possible while at the same time ensuring that the vast majority of taxpayers who are carrying the cost of these services are also getting value for money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I preface my remarks today by saying that the Opposition is not aligned with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots; neither do we support its action; neither are we supportive of the attitude taken by any other political party in Australia has neither; the cause of this particular dispute that is disrupting Australia today been brought about by any industrial relations policy of the Federal Opposition. The strike and the causes of the strike and the ongoing nature of the strike must be laid firmly at the feet of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This particular situation that we have in Australia today is a culmination of what can only be described as nine months of absolute disaster in terms of the administration of transport in Australia. We have seen this year nothing but disaster, and we have seen nothing this year other than the suffering and the hardship and, indeed, the sheer stupidity in trying to cripple Australia's foremost overseas foreign exchange earner-tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of some of those areas where we have seen the Government entering into such disastrous paths. Going back to late November-December last year, we had the first inklings that something was wrong in the air traffic control systems of Australia. It is more than eight months since the Sydney Airport disaster started-eight months, and we still do not know what the final deal is with the air traffic controllers. We still do not know whether we will see any improvement in the air traffic control facilities not only in Sydney but in other major airports around Australia. It is now four months since we determined in this House that one of the reasons that the growth in international tourism to Australia had slowed was simply that overseas operators could not get a guarantee of the movement of their passengers through Sydney Airport because of the delays caused by air traffic controllers. </PARA>
<PARA> I take honourable members back to some of the debates that we have had over the past eight months about the ongoing problems at Sydney Airport. There is no doubt that if the Government had followed the Opposition's strategy and had gone ahead with the third runway at Sydney Airport, we would not have had the delays that we are experiencing today. Yet the procrastination continues and there is still no evidence that the Government will definitely go ahead with that third runway. I am sure that it will do so after the next election, but in the meantime the suffering continues. </PARA>
<PARA> Some months ago many honourable members received a copy of a directive from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots entitled `Deadline 89 Issue No. 3', which set out the situation regarding the oncoming dispute. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) was asked a question in this House on 19 May about what he was going to do in terms of planning for this strike. He said nothing. If the Government was really serious about trying to get its act together it would have been conscious of an article that appeared in the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday, 31 May this year, which stated that the domestic airlines were gearing up for industrial trouble. If it missed the article in the Australian Financial Review, I am sure it would have seen a headline in the Australian of Wednesday, 7 June this year, which read, `Pilots play down talk of strike', but the strike was on, and nothing was done. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the real question we should ask the Government is: Why was nothing done? Is there not some sort of hidden agenda behind this whole terrible exercise that Australia is being subjected to at the moment? Is not the real story behind this strike a number of issues? Is not the real story about this strike, firstly, that the Prime Minister had every intention of making this strike a major election issue? Is it not true that the Prime Minister hoped that he could break the back of the pilots early in the piece, then go to the electorate and say, `Here I am, the world's greatest environmentalist; here I am, the world's greatest supporter of the ethnic community; here I am, the world's greatest industrial relations expert'? Perhaps the second part of that agenda was that if the country is in absolute chaos, the Prime Minister would still have the opportunity of calling an election based on the theme, `Who is running the country?'. That must be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the agenda is undoubtedly that there are certain personnel within the airlines who want this strike. Next year Australia will enter an era of airline deregulation. There is no doubt that Australian airlines at the moment are not properly equipped to handle any sort of competition. We have been stifled by a two-airline system for years. The airlines have structured themselves into a very comfortable situation which means that if there is competition in the market, under the present regime they will find it very hard to compete. Is not the third part of the agenda the fact that the pilots realise what will happen when deregulation occurs and they, too, want to be in a position of strength so that they can negotiate when that reorganisation takes place?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and this Government took the blunderbuss approach when one classic word should have been at the forefront of trying to deal with the pilots. That word was `negotiation'; the simple fact of being able to talk to each other. We have cut off that option or, rather, the Prime Minister and the Government have cut off that option. It seems absolutely amazing to me that in Question Time today the Prime Minister put on his Rambo gear again, and went hell for leather, blasting everybody he could lay his hand on. A question was asked of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding), who gave a very considered reply. It seems rather strange that the Minister responsible for tourism could give us figures outlining the absolute disaster that is being wreaked on that part of the economy, yet the Prime Minister's answer did not concern what was happening to the tourist industry or to the economy in general. He just wanted to blast away. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad part of the whole situation is that Australia could be shut up for months. We do not want that. The Government, because of its very narrow industrial relations system, is bringing Australia to the verge of economic disaster. As one cynic I was speaking to this morning said, `Well, it's really a Government plot to boost tourism to Australia, because when the economy finally collapses and the Australian dollar drops below 50c, we are going to be a very good bargain'. What will that do to Australia if that is allowed to happen?</PARA>
<PARA> In discussing a matter of public importance yesterday I gave a litany of the costs of the strike to the tourist industry. We should update those figures today because, as the Minister said, everybody is suffering. That is the point about the tourist industry: everybody does suffer, and that is sad. I do not know how many honourable members watched the rugby league match last night between the Brisbane Broncos and Cronulla. It was interesting that there were only 16,000 people at the game. Usually, in excess of 10,000 people travel from Brisbane for those interstate games. They were not there last night. The sporting industry is suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested to know that the Perth basketball team, which was playing the Newcastle basketball team, yesterday travelled from Perth to Auckland, back to Sydney and then from Sydney to Newcastle to play the game. I think you will be interested to know as well, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the hockey championships to be played in Tasmania last weekend were cancelled. There is not one section of the Australian community that is not being affected by this action of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to the recent statement from the Australian Travel Industry Association. It said it was very concerned that at the moment $19 billion worth of new tourism plant is currently under construction or about to be commenced, and that that new development is in jeopardy. I will cite some figures from the Boeing report on the development of tourism in Australia. Let us say that, of that $19 billion that is being committed for new development, only about $11 billion has actually been committed, and that that is the money that is in real jeopardy. Do honourable members know what that does? That takes out of the economy $5.5 billion worth of building works, $3.9 billion worth of furniture, fittings and equipment, $600m in consultancy fees, and $1 billion in land and associated costs. It also brings earthworks to a halt. If that development does not go ahead, we would expect to lose 2.77 million cubic metres, or 277,413 tip-truck loads, of dirt. What will that do for the trucking industry? What about the fact that 2.31 million cubic metres of concrete presently is not being able to be poured? What about the 242, 377 tonnes of reinforcement, the 3.26 million square metres of carpet, the 243,670 showers, the 1,562 lifts, and the 915,600 square metres of curtain materials?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government can boast quite proudly to some of its union colleagues that because of the attitude it is taking, 183,750 beds are in jeopardy, as are 367,000 bedside tables, 105,000 desks, 105,000 television sets, 9,262,052 glasses, 115,000 telephones, 1,010 bars, 2,530 beer taps, 79,000,000 bars of soap, 115,000,000 towels washed per annum, and 80,000,000 sheets washed per annum. This is the biggest industry that we have in Australia. It is the biggest growth industry in Australia. This industry is going to the wall in a hurry, yet the Government is not prepared to allow the pilots to talk to the airlines. The Government is prepared to put this country's future development at risk. It is prepared to put the jobs of the young people of Australia at risk, purely because it wants to back a failed industrial relations system. The sad part is simply this: the stand-downs have already started in the hotel and hospitality industry and we may never ever get those jobs back. This weekend the airlines are going to decide the future of 22,000 employees in that particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If you go home tonight, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you get a hire car driver who will tell you about what is happening in this particular city. The one I had the night before last, which was Monday, had one non-parliamentary job all day. He has just invested $200,000 in that particular company. He is going out of business fast. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the money that is being put into the promotion of Australia by this Government, and rightly so, for tourism. That is being wasted. We are going to have to spend more, the Minister tells us today, to try to retrieve the situation overseas. What about the money that has been invested by State governments in providing the tourism training infrastructure? What is going to happen there? Why are we training these people when this Government, because of its action, is doing its ultimate to wreck this industry? There is no doubt that it is attempting to wreck this industry if it continues to take this stupid line that is being taken now. What we are saying is that people must talk. The last thing that we want is another repetition of what the Prime Minister did yesterday in relation to our question about the negotiated settlements between Qantas Airways Ltd and its captains of the new 747 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> It was quite obvious from the Qantas press release that was issued last night that that deal had been agreed upon. It was an interim arrangement, but the deal had still been agreed upon. Yet the Prime Minister went to town once again and really took the big stick to the international airline pilots. If I were a member of the international airline pilots organisation whose members so far have acted very responsibly indeed, I would have been upset with his attitude too. The last thing that this country can afford to happen at the moment is for the Qantas pilots to go out on strike. But if we are going to continue to have that attitude of the Prime Minister we could well have a strike on our hands and that is the last thing that we want. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's simple appeal is this: this Government is sending our economy to the brink; this Government at the moment must be fully responsible for what it is doing to the tourist industry. All the Opposition says is this, `For goodness sake, let's take the high ground, let's get the pilots talking to the airlines, let's cool everybody down, let's try to get some sense back into the situation and save Australia'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I flatly and absolutely refute the terms of this matter of public importance, which are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The havoc wreaked upon the Australian economy by the Prime Minister's confrontationist mismanagement of the Australian transport system. </PARA>
<PARA>What a ludicrous and ridiculous matter of public importance. What a ludicrous and ridiculous topic. Every honourable member sitting on the Opposition side knows that that is absolutely untrue. They do not believe a word of it. If they do then they are even more naive than I would believe them to be. The fact is, of course, that the last thing that this Government wants is to have a dispute with the pilots. What is even more important is that we preserve this economy and that we do not allow concessions to wage claims which would destroy the economy. Of course, that is totally forgotten or ignored by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just come to some of the things that were ridiculously suggested by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in opening this matter of public importance. He suggested that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wanted to have a dispute with the pilots for political reasons, so that we could call an election on the basis of resolving the dispute. What a ridiculous suggestion, an absurd suggestion which is hardly worthy of reply. As though the Government would delight in causing strife to travellers, to the tourist industry and to others. Of course, the reality is that the last thing the Government wants is that. But what the Government is concerned to do is to ensure that we have a proper wages policy in this country; that we have an economy which can have some chance of recovery and will recover with a proper wages policy, not of course with a wages policy which would apply if this Opposition were in government. </PARA>
<PARA> What, in fact, this matter of public importance is about is a further demonstration of the fact that this Opposition has no political principles whatever. It will simply seize every opportunity to try to maximise political advantage, even if its means diminishing or trying to diminish the attempts of the Government to resolve a dispute. It has no compunction at all, no qualms at all, about jumping into bed with the pilots. Members of the Opposition are shameless, political harlots in bed with the pilots, and they know it. They have no principles whatever. They are quite prepared to say, `Just resolve this. We'll go off and get discussions going', as though that is some sort of industrial relations policy. What an industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Just get the parties talking, that is what they say. That is what the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was saying yesterday; what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has been saying; what the spokesman in the Senate, Senator Chaney, has been saying. They have been saying, `Just get the parties together and try to get them to resolve it'. Well, of course, that is what they did for years and years. Under the now Opposition, that is what they did. That is how they resolved their industrial disputes. Of course, what happened was that they built up a tremendous level of wages and conditions which are, as they say in their own journal, `the envy of the rest of the world'. The pilots have the best conditions of pilots anywhere in the world. That happened because of what the Opposition allowed to happen under the industrial relations policy which applied under the Opposition policies for the decade that it was in government in the post-war period with the two-airline policy applying. That is what has brought about the conditions the pilots now enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> There was just this simple, `Go off and resolve the damn thing and forget the cost'. There was no wages policy to apply, no framework to apply. That is still the policy of the Opposition. It still has not learned anything. It is still sitting there advocating a policy which says, `Just go off and negotiate and everyone should do this-not just the pilots; everyone should do it. Opt out of the system. Go off and get a voluntary agreement. Go off and decide what your wages and conditions should be. Let all those with strong bargaining strength get out there and screw the economy for all they are worth for their own personal aggrandisement at the expense of everybody else'. That is what the Opposition policy is. It is right here-all about the voluntary agreements and the opting out. There is no suggestion that there should be a wages policy framework; no suggestion that people would have to get the approval of the Commission. They simply go out and do what the pilots are doing, and the Opposition is still saying that right now. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, the pilots are not just saying, `We want to negotiate'. They are saying that, but they are also saying-and the Opposition totally forgets that they are saying this-`We want to negotiate outside the wage fixing principles'. There is a big gun at the head of the airlines outside the wage fixing principles. That is the basis upon which they want to negotiate. That is the only basis upon which they will negotiate. The Opposition is saying that that is okay. Its members are absolute wreckers. They are people who are quite prepared to destroy the Australian economy in the hope that they might then get back on the government benches. They are an absolute disgrace. They have no political principles whatever; they were a shameless lot of political harlots who have no right to be in government in this country. I would have thought surely, after all this time in opposition, that they might have learned something. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the Opposition has shown, quite clearly, that it is in support of the pilots in this matter. It has not in any way condemned the pilots. Despite the opening remarks made by the honourable member for Fadden, there has been no condemnation of the pilots. Yesterday the honourable member for Flinders really condemned them. He really got stuck into them and flayed them. He really belted the pilots with a big handful of fairy floss. He said, `The Opposition does not have much time for the pilots'. That was the extent of his condemnation. The pilots reeled in anguish from this tremendous verbal attack by the honourable member for Flinders-a hopeless effort. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>They have a double-barrelled shotgun pointed at the head of this economy and they have already pulled one of the triggers. </PARA>
<PARA>That was it. The pilots are still recovering from the shock of that attack. Of course, no-one else from the Opposition has condemned the pilots either. Senator Chaney, the spokesman for the Opposition on industrial relations, was asked on the Face to Face program:</PARA>
<PARA>Do you have any sympathy for the pilots?</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have sympathy with the whole of the Australian workforce which is-I mean, the pilots are at the very high paid end, and so you don't spend a lot of time wasting sympathy on them. </PARA>
<PARA>So he really belted the pilots too. He showed that he was terribly annoyed with them. This is the extent of the criticism from the Opposition. Of course, it is understandable on two grounds: firstly, honourable members opposite want an enormous industrial conflagration-they want to see conflict and mayhem because they think that will advantage them-and, secondly, philosophically they support the pilots because it is their policy. The pilots are doing what members of the Opposition say they should do. They have spelt it out time and again in their industrial relations policy which, as I was saying, is a policy for voluntary agreements and opting out. Of course, that is what the pilots are trying to do. The Government is saying, `We will not let you opt out because we know that that is a totally destructive industrial relations policy. If we allowed you to opt out we would get a whole host of other people with strong bargaining power who would do exactly the same'. We would get opting out by a vast array of groups in the country which would mean that our wages policy would be in shreds and this economy would be in ruin. That is what happened when honourable members opposite were last in government and, in large measure, that is why they went into opposition. They still have not learnt anything about that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is understandable that the Opposition supports the pilots, because the pilots are doing what the Opposition wants them to do. It is as though the pilots picked up the Opposition's policy and said, `The Opposition says we should be opting out and making a big wage claim. Don't worry about the wage fixing principles; just reach an agreement with the employers. They are in a nice position. They can afford to pass on the costs, as they have done time after time in the past, and we will just go ahead and do as we did before'. From the way the pilots are performing at present it is as though they have a script from the Opposition. There has been no condemnation from the Opposition. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) reached scurrilously low grounds. He raised safety scares to try to frighten people about the alternative arrangements that are being set up. Yesterday the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) accused me of being a strikebreaker because we used the Royal Australian Air Force. Of course, that is exactly the pilots' line; that is what they are saying. As I have said, everything members of the Opposition do and say indicates that they are simply in bed with the pilots. Their remarks fit in with that absolutely. There has been no condemnation of the pilots or support for the kind of action that they are taking. Members of the Opposition are trying to disrupt the alternative arrangements that have been made. Of course, a few days ago they started off saying, `We generally support the Government', but then they thought, `Hell, why don't we try to make some political mileage out of this', and off they went. As I have said, it is understandable because of their philosophical basis. They are highly supportive of what the pilots have done. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken a highly principled stand in this dispute. The Government is taking a stand against the pilots because that is the only thing the Government can do. The Government, in doing that, is supporting the airlines. Ansett Airlines of Australia, not being owned by the Government, is capable of working out its own industrial relations policy. I assure honourable members that it is finding this as hard as Australian Airlines. I noticed yesterday that the honourable member for Flinders condemned us for supporting the cancellation of the award. Of course, that was what the airlines, the employers in the airline industry, wanted to do. They believed that that was the best thing to do. Ansett, East-West Airlines Ltd and Australian Airlines wanted to do that. Members of the Opposition are saying that we should not support the airlines by cancelling the award. Again this is a demonstration of how they are in bed with the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that nothing could be more important for the Government now than resisting this claim by the pilots. Union after union and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have said, `We could not live with a situation in which this highly paid group gets a large wage increase'. If they get it others will get it. Of course they will seek to claim it. We will have industrial disputes and large wage claims all over the place. Wages will skyrocket and the country will be pushed into stagflation. We will not allow that to happen. Of course, honourable members opposite know that that is what will happen under their policies. They have learnt nothing about wages policy. Everything they are saying and doing now demonstrates that. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the actions taken by this Government to ensure that there is a service for the travelling public in this country ought to receive the strong support of a decent, principled opposition which is capable of taking some sort of statesmanlike view and helping the nation in a time of need. But no; all it has done is seek to undermine us by raising scurrilous safety allegations which have no basis in fact. Members of the Opposition simply have no standing in this place and the people of Australia should see them for what they are. They have learnt nothing about economics or industrial relations and, worst of all, they have learnt nothing about political principle. They can rest assured that in no way will the people of Australia put them back in charge of this country for a long time. </PARA>

I remind the Minister that he is in government and he is in charge of these things. His Leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), has inflamed those pilots into the action that they are taking today. He knows that and he knows that we are not responsible for it; we have no association with the pilots. He also knows that the reason he is taking these actions is not for any great political principle or ideology; it is simply because he wants to try to protect that sweetheart arrangement that he has with those harlots in the Australian Council of Trade Unions to ensure that members of this Government get re-elected next time around.

The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who led this debate on behalf of the Opposition, discussed the particular arrangements surroundings the aviation industry at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable members on this side of the House would know, it is not only the aviation industry which is in chaos; it is not only that industry which has been put in a state of disaster and disruption as a consequence of the mismanagement of this Government. If we look at any area of the Australian transport system we will discover that it is in a state of chaos. Look at roads: there have been more than 30 per cent reductions in road funding since this Government came into power. Look at our coastal shipping industry: the Government is refusing to allow increased efficiencies by refusing to lift cabotage. Look at our waterfront: the reforms that are being proposed there are being denied the Australian public by this Government. Look at the inefficiencies, the costs, the rorts and the expenses that are going on there, all because of this Government's very close arrangement, its very close deal, with the ACTU and the trade unions in those industries. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the pilots dispute we have seen a great hypocrisy, a double standard. We have seen over these last couple of weeks the way the Government has reacted. In Victoria over the last few days a huge industrial disputation has been going on. The waterfront employees have been on strike for about a week. We have had massive losses to the Victorian economy as a consequence. That strike has spread beyond the waterfront, of course, and is affecting all levels of industry in Victoria, costing the economy of Victoria and consequently the economy of Australia a great deal. Where is the Prime Minister on this subject? Why is he not speaking out? For goodness sake, there is a tremendous amount of waste, a tremendous amount of cost and inefficiency on the waterfront and through other industrial disputes in Victoria at the moment. But we do not hear the Prime Minister speak out at all, not a whisper.</PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to somebody who is not affiliated with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the ACTU we hear him speak out. We see him vigorous. We see him making decisions and taking action and being bold and strong, a hero. That is the double standard. In the course of one week the Australian Federation of Air Pilots had its industrial award scrapped. In the course of one week the Government has allowed the application of civil law so that airlines and tourist operators who are affected by the pilots dispute could sue those individual pilots who are causing the dispute. In the course of one week we have seen the Government bring in the military to be strikebreakers. Yet while all of this decisiveness and action from the Government is going on we hear not one word, not one whisper, from our heroic Prime Minister, who is trying to get into bed, as the Minister has put it, with his colleagues in the ACTU. We see a double standard of mammoth proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen over the last little while another example of that double standard. The Government has been talking about reform on our waterfront, and it is on that point that I want to make a few remarks now. Let me go back over the history of reform on the waterfront. We will see just how slowly this Government can work when it is dealing with its mates in the trade unions. In September 1984 the Government implemented the Webber inquiry, which looked into improved efficiencies in the waterfront area. It took two years to make its report. At the end of two years recommendations were brought down. The Government decided, `We cannot move too fast; we are talking about our mates here. Let us have another inquiry'. So we had an Inter-State Commission inquiry, which took 2 1/2 years. At the end of that inquiry the Government entered into a process of negotiation. It will be six months from the announcement of those recommendations of the ISC before the Government will make any decisions as to what it will do-another six months. When those negotiations are complete there will be a further period of three years for the implementation of those recommendations, if any are to be picked up at all. So after eight years we may finally see some reform on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to actions in the aviation industry, when we are dealing with someone not affiliated with the ALP, it all happens in a week. That is the double standard that is so eagerly portrayed by this Government. In addition, the chaos on our waterfront is being perpetuated by the fact that the Government is having these negotiations carried out by a body called the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. That body is not made up of people who use the waterfront, the importers and the exporters, the people one would think would have a vested interest in what might be going on there in terms of reforms and efficiencies. No, we do not include those sorts of people. My goodness, they are not one of us! This Reform Authority is made up of people from the Government, the Waterside Workers Federation, that well known reforming body, and the stevedores. Out of all that, what sort of reforms do we expect to get? We will get no great reforms from that Authority because those people have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. When it comes to the ALP and its ACTU mates I am afraid that reform just does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> If we compare the way this Government has dealt with reform on the waterfront with the way reform on the waterfront has taken place in Britain, we see surprising differences. Reform on the waterfront in Britain took a total of three months earlier this year. There was an Act of Parliament, some industrial disputation that petered out after a couple of weeks, and reform was implemented virtually over a period of three months. Yet under this Government reform here is going to take eight years. That is the sort of action we see. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also notes with some alarm the Moody's Investors Service Inc. report which only yesterday downgraded Australia's creditworthiness by one notch. Moody's highlighted the lack of reform within our tranports system as being one of the reasons why it had downgraded our creditworthiness. Moody's report refers to the continued slow pace of structural adjustment which makes Australia ill positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign debt. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The rating agency also pointed out that the downgrade reflects several other considerations. The first is the persistence of structural weaknesses imbedded in Australia's domestic and international position, such as intransigent rigidities in the local labour and transport markets. These constrain international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Moody's knows it, the people in the industries know it, the people around Australia know it because they are all feeling the pinch. They are feeling the pinch from a government which is doing nothing to attack the real causes of concern within our transport industry. Whether it is the pilots in the aviation industry, whether it is the air traffic controllers, whether it is the people on the waterfront, whether it is people in our coastal shipping services, this Government is not doing it. As a consequence, we are being downgraded from a country with a good credit rating, which we had some years ago before Labor took charge of the whole show. The Business Council of Australia has estimated that the Government's intransigence in terms of reform on our waterfront is costing the gross domestic product of Australia $4 billion per year. That is a greater cost to this economy than what is going on with the pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the economy is in this Government's mismanagement of the transport system. The cost to this economy is in this Government's determination to stick to age old Labor principles. It is costing tourist operators and the average Australian a tremendous amount. We have chaos in our transport system. It is wreaking damage on every single Australian. The Minister should not kid himself that Australians are not being hurt by this because I can assure him that they are. They will get no relief until we have a government which is determined to implement real reform in our transport system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance put forward by the Opposition is a piece of hypocrisy and a nonsense. None of the debate put forward by the Opposition this afternoon has outlined the history of this dispute or, indeed, dealt with it in any substance. It has been a sham, a debate where those opposite have heaped abuse on the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) and also on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Nothing of substance has been put forward by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth outlining the history of this dispute. From September last year the Australian Federation of Air Pilots made it quite clear that it intended to obtain a substantial increase in wages. It also gave notice that it would review its position when the no extra claims commitment expired in June of this year. In that period the pilots held a 24-hour stoppage for mass meetings; they commenced planning for extended industrial action. Indeed, they gave a name to it, the Deadline 89 campaign. The Federation served a log of claims on Australian Airlines and commenced negotiations with Australian Airlines. As part of these negotiations, Australian Airlines indicated that it could negotiate only on an industry approach, not in isolation from other operators. Australian Airlines indicated that it wanted to address productivity issues and other concepts and conditions of employment. The Federation of Air Pilots subsequently withdrew its log of claims. In July this year it served on all domestic operators a pay claim of 29.47 per cent. On 1 August the Federation said that its claim was not negotiable and it was not interested in working within the wages system. On 7 August the Federation's approach was rejected by the airline companies, who made it clear that they would maintain an industry approach to achieve a common outcome on wages and conditions of employment. Negotiations by the parties continued without change. </PARA>
<PARA> The dispute was notified to the Industrial Relations Commission on 4 August, and stop-work meetings were held on 9 August. Hearings were held in the Industrial Relations Commission on 10, 11 and 15 August when the Commission directed the parties to confer within the framework of wage fixing principles. It called on the Federation to cease industrial action. The parties met again on 17 August and the Federation reiterated its intent to negotiate directly with companies outside the wage fixing system. The following day the Federation introduced its 9 to 5 work rule. The Industrial Relations Commission heard applications to cancel the awards, and on 19 August the Commission cancelled the awards for a period of 12 months. That is a brief outline of the history of this current dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It is crystal clear that the Federation was absolutely resolved that it wanted to be outside the wage fixing system. This is despite the companies' plea for it to remain in the wage fixing system. This is despite the companies' commitment to the national wage case principles. This is despite the commitment of all other unions and wage earners to the accord, and despite the wishes of the Hawke Labor Government. The Federation has spurned all calls for responsible negotiations. Now it must live with those consequences. The Federation has forsaken the rights of its pilots. It has forsaken the protection offered by the wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background it is also very alarming to read that the Opposition's policy, as outlined by Senator Chaney in yesterday's Australian Financial Review, is on all fours with the Federation of Air Pilots' current campaign. In yesterday's Financial Review Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is central to our own policy that the best way to conduct industrial relations in this country is for direct employer-employee negotiations at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the same policy as those of the McLachlans, the Costelloes, the Stones, the Copemans and the Kemps. This is the policy that is advocated by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) on behalf of the legal profession and others. This is the same policy that the Liberal and National parties had in 1981-82, when we lost 249,000 working days every month. Senator Chaney, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, prefers to sit on the fence. He wants to have two bob each way. He advocates an increase in the penalty provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. As the Prime Minister said during Question Time, Senator Chaney's initial policy was to support the Pilots Federation outside the wage fixing system. Now he wants to amend the Industrial Relations Act to introduce these penal provisions to have them operate within the system. He is having two bob each way. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take a closer look at the Liberal and National parties' policy. The current pilots dispute is an example of the Opposition's industrial relations policy in action. Among other things, the Opposition's policy calls for secret ballots before strikes. The Opposition's policy calls for employers and workers to opt out of the wages system of this country. The Opposition's policy says that employers and their workers should negotiate directly on wages and conditions to create voluntary agreements, and its policy says that all such agreements should be a base for more flexible and efficient working practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us measure the Opposition's policy against the current pilots dispute. Firstly, I refer to the call for secret ballots before strikes. Before the current dispute went ahead the Pilots Federation held a secret ballot. The Opposition says that employers and workers should opt out of the wage fixing system. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots made it quite clear that it wanted to pull out of the wage fixing system. The employers and airlines successfully obtained an order to cancel its award. The Opposition demands that the courts should be used to enforce such voluntary agreements. Not only did the airlines resort to court action but also there is now the threat that tourism operators and other Australian businesses will be forced to take action against the pilots for compensation worth millions of dollars for the enormous damage that those businesses have suffered as a result of the pilots strike. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says that all employment agreements should be based on more flexible and efficient working practices. Everyone now knows that the airlines are doing their best to negotiate fresh contracts of employment that will include provisions for vastly improved productivity by the pilots. Why, therefore, is the Opposition refusing to back the airlines in this dispute? This dispute has not been caused by the airlines; it has not been caused by the courts. This dispute has not been caused by the Government. This dispute is an example of the Opposition's collective bargaining policy in action. In other words, it is a policy for industrial chaos. Honourable members should ask Sir Peter Abeles, Rupert Murdoch or any airline traveller in this nation what they think of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. They will tell of their disgust, anger and contempt concerning the Opposition's industrial relations policy. They will say that they want this dispute fixed as soon as possible. They want the pilots back at work. They want air travel in Australia back to normal. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the role of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) in this whole debacle by the Opposition. On 25 August in an interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program AM he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a classic case where you've got to go beyond the employer and employee fight and look after the national interest and the Government is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to say in this chamber and other places that he is not trying to score political points on this issue. But living in the fairyland that he does he now says that the airline pilots and the other unions would not make claims under the Opposition's industrial relations policy. What a fairy floss, feather-headed idea of an industrial relations policy. In his speech last Wednesday week in this chamber he, like the Federation, rejected the central wage fixing system. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we will establish the mechanism for voluntary agreements which employers and employees can discuss and settle by themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has no concern for wage fixing. It has no concern for control of industrial relations. It totally supports the Federation's policy in respect of this dispute. If this country were to concede or give in to any claim outside the wage fixing system, then all of Australia would suffer. It is a price that the Australian people cannot afford to pay. It is a price that this Government cannot afford to allow to be paid. The pilots must come to the negotiation table. As the Prime Minister indicated in Question Time today, there are procedures and practices now available for the pilots to pursue their claim within the ambit of the accord and to take account of productivity and other issues that they feel they should be rewarded for. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce new legislation to enable a levy to be collected on the sale of goat fibre. Funds from this levy are to be directed specifically into research for the betterment of the goat fibre industry. Associated with this Bill is the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Bill 1989 which allows the levy moneys to be collected and provides for their forwarding to the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. The funds will form a sub-account within the Australian Special Rural Research Fund which is dedicated to goat fibre research. The participation within the Australian Special Rural Research Fund ensures a Commonwealth contribution to goat fibre research while avoiding the expense of a separate statutory authority which would not be justified for an industry of this size. </PARA>
<PARA> The goat fibre industry comprises mohair, cashmere and, more recently, cashgore sectors. Those industries have made an increasing contribution to Australian export earnings, and export earnings are expected to approach $10m this year. In addition, there are the associated products of meat and hides from goat slaughter and the export of live goats. </PARA>
<PARA> These goat industries have been expanding and frequently complement the traditional pastoral industries of sheep and cattle production as they use resources which would not otherwise be fully utilised. This is particularly the case with some weeds such as thistles and blackberries which could require chemical control if goats were not used. A small expanding industry such as goat fibre production offers many promising opportunities for research in the area of animal production, fibre harvesting, marketing, economics and processing. However, the industry has limited capacity to organise and fund the required research. Despite this, the goat industry has made considerable effort to support research projects. This has been undertaken by a number of independent voluntary funds and some Commonwealth funds from the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. While the industry has identified research priorities, programs have rested on a precarious funding base with limited capacity to expand to meet the needs of an emerging industry. A more substantive, ongoing and coordinated research program is required if the needs of this industry are to be met. This is particularly the case as this industry is export oriented and so must meet the vagaries of international markets and compete with producers in a range of countries, some with a long history of fibre production and others with newly emerging industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1988, with the support of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), I convened the national goat fibre workshop. This workshop comprised representatives of the various goat fibre industry groups who were supported by brokers, buyers, the fibre testing sector and research groups. At this workshop, the grower organisations recognised the benefits of a coordinated research program encompassing all goat fibre organisations. The degree of support for such a unified research effort was reflected in the subsequent request that I received from the four goat industry grower organisations. They requested that the Commonwealth enact legislation to collect a statutory levy of 1.5 per cent on the gross value of sales of goat fibre. This rate of expenditure on research will be amongst the highest of any Australian agricultural industry. In addition, the industry contribution will be substantially greater than the Commonwealth's maximum contribution of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production in the industry. The willingness of the various sectors of this industry to work together and make a significant contribution to sponsoring change and improvement is reflected in the fact that they have suggested that an appropriate maximum rate for this research levy should be 5 per cent of the value of fibre sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides for the initial levy rate of 1.5 per cent and the maximum rate of 5 per cent as requested by the industry. Provision is also made for any recommendations from the goat industry organisations to be taken into account prior to altering the operative rate of the levy. Initiating the levy on 1 January 1990 will allow the accumulation of some funds before the beginning of the 1990-91 financial year. This should allow research objectives to be assessed and individual research projects to be funded from the commencement of the 1990-91 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The goat fibre industry will benefit from an industry-wide research program which is administered by a professional research administration organisation, namely, the Australian Special Rural Research Council which was established by the Rural Industries Research Act 1985. In addition, the industry will have the benefit of a guaranteed Commonwealth contribution to the research effort. Initially the industry levy is expected to raise around $150,000 with an additional Commonwealth contribution of around $50,000. The Special Research Council will, therefore, be able to implement a goat fibre research program of around $200,000 annually. I believe this industry desires to make a substantial commitment to research and that the potential benefits for both the industry and Australia will justify the research effort. Because of this I believe the Commonwealth should provide the supportive mechanism as well as a financial commitment to this research. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before the House amends the National Health Act to increase the maximum general patient contribution for prescribed drugs supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) from the present $11 to $12. The increase in the general patient contribution from $11 to $12 is estimated to achieve savings of $10m in 1989-90 and $17m in a full financial year. The Bill provides that the increase take effect from 1 October 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will note that the Government has continued to support those in need by maintaining both free pharmaceutical benefits for all pensioners and the concessional beneficiary rate of $2.50. In addition, the Government has retained the provision of free scrips for the chronically ill under the safety net provisions. Individuals or families who record 25 scrips in any calendar year receive all additional scrips free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill further provides for the annual indexation of the general patient contribution in line with the March quarter `All Groups Consumer Price Index'. The annual adjustments will occur on 1 August to coincide with the issue of the PBS schedules. This amendment will thus link the general patient contribution rate to the rate of inflation to address the rapid growth in the costs of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme through increased prescribing of high cost drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the maximum general patient contribution is one of a number of measures that the Government has taken to restrain the growth in expenditure of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the past 12 months. In 1988-89 this expenditure under the scheme increased by only 8.5 per cent over the previous year. The changes to patient payments announced in the Budget are consistent with the Government's desire to maintain the viability and effectiveness of the scheme with assistance targeted to the most needy. As other changes to the scheme announced in the Budget do not involve amendments to the National Health Act I shall not discuss them in this debate. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Hawke Government came to power in 1983 the unemployment rate was higher than 10 per cent and the government deficit was more than $9 billion. Now the unemployment rate is lower than 6 per cent and the Government is in surplus by more than $9 billion. Those facts speak for themselves. The Hawke Government has provided not only stable economic leadership but also a strong foundation for the future. Building that foundation has taken courage and it has not been easy. The Budget surplus, with a tight wages policy, will help contain interest rates and increase employment, making life easier for our families. When people come up with quick fixes and easy solutions, which is what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) tried to convey during his $1m extravaganza cavalcade around the capital cities of the nation a month or so ago, I wonder about the economic management of our country and fear what would have become of our future if the Hawke Government had taken that easy way out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, with sustained economic growth, high levels of employment and stable economic management, more people are sharing in the gains. I made the point that tax collections have increased, but this is because there are more people paying tax in a fairer way; the individual is paying less tax. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), who is an author of many books, treatises indeed, on economics, agrees with that point. When one sees the shift away from sole parent benefits, away from the unemployment queues and the dole and into jobs, 7,500 to 8,000 people a week, one thinks of the savings in expenditure and the increase in tax that come about to give the turnaround in the Budget that we have. All of these things add up to responsible, responsive government. The alternative easy way out peddled by the Opposition would have provided no long term benefits; in the end it would tear apart all that we have worked for. </PARA>
<PARA> The outstanding feature of this Budget is its impact on social justice. While the Opposition concentrates on whipping up antagonism against the needy, this Government gets on with dispensing social justice. While the Opposition loosely talks and carps about the small number of cheats that may or may not exist-it certainly cannot prove it-on our welfare programs and turning the public against the needy in a most cynical vote-catching exercise for the middle ground, the middle class, middle income vote, this Government has been getting people off supporting parent pensions and off unemployment benefits, and into the work force through training and employment programs. While the Opposition talks of cutting back $1 billion to $5 billion, if it is to take the advice of the Business Council of Australia, in essential programs of health, education and welfare, this Government has been about restructuring government spending. As government spending as a percentage of GDP in this country has dropped to the lowest for 16 years, the percentage of the Budget devoted to social justice programs has increased. We spell out our programs. We are still waiting for the Opposition to have the guts to get up and spell out where it is going to make the cuts. Is it to be the pensioners who will feel the knife? Is it the students? Is it those who have not been able to get a job through no fault of their own? I wish that Opposition members would stand up and be clear and honest with the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere are the Government and the Opposition more contrasted than in our concern for, and their rejection of, the aged, the sick, the young people and young families. We reject totally what the Opposition represents, what was represented by the Leader of the Opposition's tour-a poll-driven exercise. The strategy of this Budget is not geared to votes; it is geared to social justice. It is to restore equity, access, rights, fairness, to ordinary men and women of Australia. That is no idle boast. The strategy was put in place way back in May 1988, when with the Budget came a catalogue of the Government's achievements and then further social justice programs in the Budget of 1988, the April statement of this year, and now the centrepiece of this Budget. We have a detailed strategy, consistent with desirable end points. As I said, it contrasts with the Opposition's gaffes, contradictions, apologies, and what was noted for what it did not say rather than what it said in explanation of its policies. Labor, indeed, over its time in office, has been true to its traditional base, and that is an increasingly widening base. It is true to its objectives-and all this in what can only be described as tough economic times. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more to retirement than money; but income security is an important found- ation stone of retirement. The Government has given detailed consideration to pension, taxation and superannuation measures affecting senior citizens. I was proud to be a member of the task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on retirement incomes that went around the country and was part of the detailed government process of consulting extensively with older people and interested organisations. The result is Australia's first comprehensive national retirement incomes policy. The Government has already announced that the date of indexation for pensions will be brought forward by 12 weeks in three stages. It has also announced that the pension income test free area would become 100 per cent tax free by July 1990. Our commitment to pensioners includes more than $1 billion extra each financial year. The Hawke Government will meet and exceed for the first time that I can recall a pension entitlement in excess of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also introduced the first social justice strategy for young people, a comprehensive $100m package of initiatives for disadvantaged young people. That will be over four years covering accommodation for the homeless, income support, labour market assistance, education, health and access to services. I say a thankyou there to a former university acquaintance of mine, Brian Burdekin, for bringing down the report which formed a substantial basis for the development of that social justice platform. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) was scathing about the number of training programs for the unemployed, especially youth. That shows that he misunderstands the scene completely. He wants one program to suit all people. He does not understand the many reasons for being unemployed. They vary from person to person. The needs of the short, the medium and the long term unemployed are different. The needs of unemployed women and youth and men can be different. Not once in his verbose flowery speech did he indicate any understanding or put forward an alternative. Of course, it is hard for Opposition members to put forward an alternative when they had such a disparaging and disgraceful record on unemployment when they were in government. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up: If people want fairness and equity in Australia, they will support the Government's social justice programs. If they want to hurt people, they can support the Opposition in its denigration of needy people. Or as one person put it: `If you support the Liberal-National Party coalition, does that mean that you are an accomplice to their political crimes against the needy, the deserving and the vulnerable?'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the Appropriation Bill before the House today, I wish to concentrate my remarks on the science portfolio, for which I have responsibility as spokesman for the coalition. At the risk of stating the obvious, to the science community, the treatment of Australia's science and technology effort in the 1989 Budget held no surprises. All the news, so far as there had been any news in the first instance, was broken last May. The science and technology statement of 9 May, though initially well received, came to be viewed with increasing cynicism. Even the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) considered the statement to be `intellectually shallow', and he conceded that at best the statement represented just the first step in clawing our way back to something approaching a respectable scientific base in this country. Despite being touted as the $1 billion scientific statement, it soon became evident as the hype and rhetoric of the occasion gave way to close analysis instead, that the Government had managed to find only an extra $78m of new money a year for our science and technology community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of contrast, I note with interest that Australia's sporting community won an extra $100m over four years in this year's Budget. This is $40m more than the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) called for in its Cabinet submission of last November as the base figure necessary to maintain, and only maintain, its level of research activity. Perhaps the increase in funding to sport was deserved, but I remain to be convinced. In any event, the increase in funding to sport is a telling comment on the balance of influence within the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> At the broadest level, despite the small increases in science funding over the last year, Australia's research effort continues to compare very poorly with that of other nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). No matter how the Government promotes its modest initiatives, no matter how much it seeks to deflect criticism of its approach to science and technology, the truth of the matter is that research in this country, on a comparative basis, is at an extremely low ebb, if not the lowest ebb in our history. Of the 19 OECD nations cited in the science and technology budget paper, Australia ranks sixteenth in regard to its research and development expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Our other major trading partners spend twice as much as we do on research and development. Only Ireland, New Zealand and Spain spend less than the 1.2 per cent of GDP which is the percentage we allocated to research and development in 1987-88</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, what ought to compound our concern is that this proportion is a decrease in the upward trends of previous years. In 1986-87, for example, we spent 1.25 per cent of GDP on research and development. In a corresponding period in the 1960s we spent 1.33 per cent of GDP. In short, we are sliding backwards. To make matters worse still-despite the well-publicised reluctance of our business sector to engage itself in research and development-the Government has provided nothing by way of compensatory support. That is to say, while in 1981-82 the Government provided funds equivalent to 0.75 per cent of GDP for research and development, it now provides only 0.72 per cent support. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this is against the backdrop of the collapse of all of our assumptions about the basis of our national prosperity. If there is a certain inconsistency evident in all of this, look at the treatment of CSIRO in this year's Budget. The CSIRO's appropriations for this financial year have been inflation adjusted; that is, its funding will keep pace with anticipated inflationary growth of around 6 to 7 per cent. Assuming the organisation achieves its predicted external earnings target, the CSIRO still has to deal with other factors which have cut deeply into its operational budget. Amongst these are past reductions in appropriations, budgeting shortfalls, salary increases and efficiency dividends, none of which CSIRO was compensated for in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this the Government's expectations for the CSIRO have increased in recent times. In its attempts to reconcile development policy with environmental considerations the Government is increasingly calling upon the resources of the CSIRO. Such was the case of the Wesley Vale pulp mill dispute. So it is too with concerns about climatic change, and so it will be increasingly in the future. More and more is expected-indeed, demanded-of CSIRO while fewer and fewer appropriations are made available to CSIRO in a climate of falling private sector investment in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted with interest in the recent CSIRO report entitled Pulp Mills: Modern Technology and Environmental Protection, that the research team concluded that if the Government wanted a rational assessment of the impact of pulp mill effluents-and one presumes that it does-then it would have to create the research base in Australia necessary to carry out the essential baseline studies. I cannot stress strongly enough that whilst CSIRO is being bled to death our core knowledge is being depleted at an alarming rate. We do not have the baseline knowledge necessary to make objective, informed, rational decisions in regard to the environment as we try to balance development against protection of the environment. The reality is that, by political necessity alone, the Government eventually will be drawn to reassess the role of CSIRO in Australia's environmental and developmental future. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now seize on an example which, better than anything else, encapsulates the dilemma the Government has on its hands and which will affect very markedly industry on the one hand and the environment on the other. I refer to the disastrous reductions in the insect taxonomy section of the Division of Entomology within CSIRO. Honourable members will be interested to know that the Australian national insect collection was established in 1928 and since 1969 has been declared part of the National Estate under an Act of Parliament. It is curated by scientists in the taxonomy section of the Division of Entomology. The collection contains over eight million specimens. It is the largest collection of Australian insects in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Insects are the most dominant form of terrestrial life in Australia. There are about 200,000 species. By contrast, there are only 2,000 species of higher land animals and birds in Australia and 20,000 species of native plants. That gives honourable members some idea of the predominance of insects. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of a broader contrast still, insects outnumber humans by a ratio of two million to one. There are 10 million different insect species. Many of these are still unknown in terms of their classification to taxonomists. Part of the task of the Division of Entomology is to develop an understanding of the interactions of these insects with animals and plants, a task critical to the management of Australia's environment. If we do not understand the ecosystem and the effect man's ecosystem has on it, then we cannot make rational decisions about protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The insect collection provides the resource, the data base, for environmental research. It has been at the basis of work done on biological pest and weed control programs. The results of this research have been significant in reducing our dependence on pesticides and other chemicals. The insect collection has also contributed to genetic research, animal behaviour, ecological studies and other areas of national interest. Specifically we need to know how to use and control insects, particularly in agriculture. Many agricultural pests and weeds are controlled by insects acting as biological control agents. In this application too, the expertise needed to identify species and sub-species-for example, the screw-worm fly in cattle and sheep-is vital for the survival of a $300m livestock industry. Even more importantly, the insect taxonomists at CSIRO play a critical role in identifying insects and worms brought into this country on foreign transports which might prove a threat to our agricultural industry. Recently on a Middle East ship they identified a particular type of fly worm which could have devastated our sheep and cattle export industry. In this sense the insect collection really possesses an economic value to our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that, in the very substantial reduction of funding for CSIRO, programs that cannot be justified on a short term economic return basis are being jettisoned. In regard to environmental research it is not easy-in some cases it is impossible-to quantify the economic return for baseline research. But the insect collection can be justified, leaving aside the environmental considerations, because of its economic value to the nation. Without this knowledge our livestock industry would be rendered extremely vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> The study of insect life-insect biodiversity, as it is referred to-in a particular habitat can provide indicators of the environ-mental health of a particular area. Changesor decreases in biodiversity-in numbers and types of beetles, moths and insects-signal environmental problems. Given this, a knowledge of biodiversity can provide ready signals of the state of a particular habitat. It does it so much better and far quicker than the study of large animals. Insects have short life cycles of up to 10 days and hence can provide very accurate indicators of sudden environmental changes. A study of changes in ant numbers can provide very accessible and reliable data as to the effect of mining waste disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the areas in which a study of insect biodiversity has been important in establishing baseline research has been in Kakadu National Park. That is, insect taxonomy expertise is essential if we are to develop a database for baseline environmental conditions which will then enable us to make rational decisions about courses of action. No longer should we need to make these sorts of decisions on political or emotive grounds. For example, insect taxonomy, or biodiversity studies, can tell us about the health of rainforests, whether they ought to be preserved, and what areas can be safely harvested. It can tell us about the state or condition of our crops. </PARA>
<PARA> I have recently had the pleasure of a long discussion with Professor Ed Wilson, Professor of Biology at Harvard, Pulitzer Prize winner and special adviser to the Bush Administration on the environment, on the issue of insect biodiversity. He tells me that the issue ranks fourth after toxic waste, climate change and ozone depletion as the public's main environmental concern. The Congress is soon to legislate on this very issue, providing for an institute to focus research on biodiversity. In the United States, private research and charitable funds such as the McArthur Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trust have invested millions of dollars in developing America's biodiversity research effort. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country the business of serious-minded environmental and agricultural research is lost on the Government. We are going in the opposite direction to the United States. Unfortunately, the capacity of CSIRO to maintain its existing research effort-forget about adding to it or expanding it; we are talking about maintaining the present research effort-has been totally jeopardised by the failure of the insect group to give evidence of immediate financial returns. Because the taxonomy group draws heavily upon appropriation funding from the public purse-funding directly from the Government-it is vulnerable to closure. External funding for the group might well cater for field trips for the officers, but it cannot, by the nature of the group's activities, directly support its continued operations. Accordingly, the standing of the taxonomy section within the Institute of Biological Resources is jeopardised. Because it cannot pay its way in an immediate sense or attract external funding to the extent demanded by the Government, the staff who administer and curate the Australian National Insect Collection are being squeezed out. </PARA>
<PARA> The expertise in two critical areas of environmental and agricultural research is being lost forever. The development of biological control programs is reliant upon the expertise of taxonomists. So, too, is the future of rationally based environmental research. It is with much regret that I advise the House that three of the taxonomists in the Division of Entomology are to go-that is, three out of a group of 12 research and experimental scientists. One is a research scientist, a specialist in ants, given to building baseline studies essential to environmental research and providing important quarantine advice. Another, again a research scientist, is a specialist in an area concerned with identifying parasites capable of controlling aphids, particularly those such as the Russian wheat aphids. The third is an experimental scientist who has expertise in the control of plague locusts and grasshoppers. They are all critical to the body of research expertise which underpins our environmental research core capacity as well as the health of our agricultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> How many times do I have to impress upon this House the twin disasters that will affect the future of this country: on the one hand, the environment, and on the other the agricultural industries. There is no equivalent expertise in this country, if not the world, to the insect taxonomy group within CSIRO. If those people go, and they have been so informed, their experience is irreplaceable. This will be only the beginning. Owing to reductions in Government support for CSIRO, the institute funding the taxonomy group has been forced to cut its funding still further. More research projects are to be terminated. As a result, another two to three positions will be lost. In short, the Government intends to cut savagely by 50 per cent our taxonomy expertise within the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> The driving force behind this is not a rational assessment of the worth of a particular research project. The driving force is the Government's reluctance to commit appropriate funds to research. I am sick to my back teeth of mealy-mouthed members of the Government coming into this chamber, wearing their concern about the environment on their sleeves, but when baseline research is disintegrating in front of them they remain silent; they remain mute. There is no excuse for any member of the Government-those who beat a well worn path up to Kakadu and pronounce their concern about the environment and pontificate back in their electorates-to allow CSIRO to fall apart in this way. If we lose the invaluable insect collection in this country we will pay dearly for it in terms of the environment. As for agricultural research, that too is at risk. We will lose the only experts in Australia able to identify the very difficult pests coming into this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1989 Budget provides grants to Queensland of nearly $4.5 billion. As specified in Budget Paper No. 4, Queensland will receive in the 1989-90 financial year some $2.4 billion in general revenue assistance, $1.5 billion in specific purpose grants, and well over half a billion dollars in both general and specific capital grants. This is a huge amount of money to be paid to the State and one would think that normally it would be well spent and applied to essential services such as education and health for the benefit of the people of Queensland. However, I am afraid it is money which the Queensland Government is incapable of administering in accordance with any basic standards of accountability and honesty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The actions of the Ahern Government, its Ministers and its instrumentalities can lead only to the conclusion that the Commonwealth should play a larger role in imposing conditions on the grants it makes to Queensland. The Commonwealth, of course, does have power to make specific purpose grants. The grants are tied to those purposes and conditions can be placed upon the nature of those grants. Normally untied grants are just that. That is, they are made to the State and the State can decide within its own budgetary priorities where the money should be spent. Unfortunately, Queensland, through maladministration, corruption and the bad practices identified in the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, has placed itself in a situation where it is not worthy of the implicit trust which should follow the making of such a large financial contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Commonwealth Department of Finance should investigate whether Commonwealth grants to Queensland have been misused and applied for political patronage of the National Party, its donors, its supporters and its members. Evidence of maladministration and misuse of funds, including Commonwealth funds, is overwhelming, as is evidence of Premier Ahern's shallow commitment to tackling the issues of accountability and cleaning up the entrenched rorts which are characteristic of the Queensland National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The clearest recent examples of the misuse of Government funds relate to the actions of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, the QIDC. This body was established as a development financier, with lending emphasis placed on those projects which offered increased growth and employment. Indeed, there has been employment and growth-employment of National Party cronies, who have been given jobs with the QIDC, and there has been growth in the asset bases of other National Party cronies by way of loans through the QIDC. In terms of general employment growth or strengthening of the Queensland economy through the activities of this financier, I am afraid the evidence is far less clear. Of course, it has proven simply to be a vehicle to give the National Party support in its electoral areas and also to launder funds, if you like, through government means, into the pockets of its friends. </PARA>
<PARA> One may think that these were practices of the Bjelke-Petersen Government and that the new Ahern Government would be going down a different path. Unfortunately, quite the contrary is true. Under the Ahern National Party Government the practices of political patronage have become more entrenched rather than removed. For instance, one has only to look at the governing board of the QIDC. The Chairman of the board is Mr James Brennan. Mr Brennan came to the board with no great reputation as a financier or banker, unlike the person he replaced on the board. Mr Brennan's apparent qualification is that he is the Darling Downs Zone Vice-President of the National Party. The gentleman he replaced was Graham Tucker. Mr Tucker was forced to leave the position as Chairman of the QIDC because of pressure applied by the Queensland Finance Minister and the Queensland Government. When pressed on the reasons for his removal, it was explained that he was unsuitable for the job. However, it is interesting that now it has been revealed that only a few days prior to his forced resignation, the board at the time passed a resolution of confidence in Mr Tucker as Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> Other members of the board include Mr Donald McDonald, a senior vice-president of the State National Party, and Mr Bill Roberts, a Barambah electorate councillor of the National Party, and also a director of Keldeal Pty Ltd, the company which provided the corporate veil for the funding of the abortive `Joh for PM' push. These are the gentlemen who are the senior members of the board of the QIDC. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suppose it is any wonder, with these gentlemen running the show, that the funds of the QIDC have been grievously misused. Some examples of this that have been placed before the Queensland Public Accounts Committee, before that body's inquiry into the QIDC was muzzled by the Queensland Government, include the well-documented and well-known examples of misuse of disaster relief funding which have been raised in this House on many occasions by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice); in particular, the very poor practice, in fact malpractice, of the State Primary Industries Minister, Neville Harper. </PARA>
<PARA> Many examples are available of the misuse of these drought funds. For example, one property which received drought funds, ironically enough, exhibited the champion fatted cow at the Townsville show. That is how badly dealt with that property was by drought! Other examples concerned the extension of a sugar cane quota on a farm through disaster relief funding, the purchase of extra dairy quotas and the extension of a farm-again, using funds which supposedly go to primary producers who have been hit, and hit hard, by natural disaster. Some examples are already the subject of a Commonwealth Department of Finance investigation. There are plenty more examples which the Commonwealth could investigate before extending funds to Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example concerns a $340,000 loan to a friend and supporter of Premier aspirant Russell Cooper. This money did not relate to any growth or employment creating scheme, which was the charter of the QIDC; this money was to help out the person with his divorce settlement. There was the curious example of extra pay and conditions being granted to one John Muntz, an employee of QIDC, after intervention by Geoff Muntz. Of course, Geoff Muntz is the Queensland Minister for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from these clear examples of patronage and cronyism, the QIDC is in a poor state financially. It is heavily engaged in the practice of borrowing short and lending long. This is the same sort of practice which led to the downfall of the ill-fated Rothwells Bank in Western Australia. Last year the Queensland Government was obliged to inject $18m of extra capital into the QIDC from general Treasury funds. These funds were largely supplied by general Commonwealth assistance to Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Faced with this overwhelming evidence of malpractice within the QIDC-malpractice which was very clearly brought to people's attention through some limited inquiries by the new Queensland Public Accounts Committee-what was the response of Premier Ahern? Was it to go down the path of accountability and to be the new broom? Far from it. The Public Accounts Committee in Queensland was prevented from conducting further investigations into the QIDC. A majority vote of its members-all the National Party members-led to the inquiry being quashed. This was opposed by the Liberal and Labor Party members of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other grounds why the Commonwealth should seriously consider imposing more conditions on the payment of grants to Queensland. One of those is the gradual, but nonetheless seemingly inevitable, watering down of the new accountability checks and balances recommended by corruption commissioner, Tony Fitzgerald. As a principal reform of the way in which government should be run in Queensland, Mr Fitzgerald recommended the formation of the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, known as EARC. The legislation creating this Commission was drafted under the direct supervision of Mr Fitzgerald and he also agreed to play a limited consultative role in the implementation of this new Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government's response to this recommendation was not to embrace it or adopt it; through a campaign of misinformation about the Commission's true powers, and then through a simple rejection of the accountability process, the Queensland Government, under Premier Ahern, has walked away from this administrative watchdog. Mr Fitzgerald gave his opinion of the Queensland National Party's commitment to accountability when he resigned from his position when the Queensland Premier announced on 9 August that the powers of the EARC would not be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Ironically, yesterday's leadership spill in the National Party was not brought about because people were concerned at the watering down of the Fitzgerald process or the accountability process; it was brought about by a dispute over daylight saving. What did the two aspirants to the premiership have to say about this process? They were not interested in accountability. Indeed, probably even more worrying was the fact that Premier Ahern sniped at his two opponents by saying that they were opposing his administrative reform package. So the people who were opposing Mr Ahern's weakened and watered down reform package were those who were challenging him. They were not challenging him because they wanted a strong package; they wanted a weaker package. It is absolutely amazing that this Government is still desperately trying to cling to power. I do not suppose that is particularly surprising when one realises that the aspirant for Premier, Mr Russell Cooper, was quite extraordinarily involved in the QIDC to obtain a divorce settlement loan for his friend and supporter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), concentrated all of the 15 minutes he took to make his speech on discussing issues of State politics relating to his home State of Queensland. It is a pity that people are elected to represent, as he is, marginal seats in the Federal Parliament and then devote the whole of their time to a discussion of State politics. All I can say is that eventually, after the next election, a career option for him may be to enter State politics where he can carry out his desired profession to the full because that is clearly his sole interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no comments to make on what is happening in State politics in Queensland. It is not my business or of any particular concern to me because I am from South Australia in the first place and, in the second place, as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament I am a little more interested in national affairs and Commonwealth affairs than the provincial affairs of the State of Queensland, even if members of the Australian Labor Party may not be. After all, at this time in our history in Australia, compared to comparable nations we face something of a national economic crisis. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) conceded that two or three years ago when he went on a Channel 9 program and said that we faced the economic equivalent of war. </PARA>
<PARA> So we were facing a war two or three years ago, but we are not doing anything to win that war. Gradually we are being pushed further and further back in the battle, and the Budget that was brought before the House a couple of weeks ago was just another concession in what the Prime Minister described as that war-another loss of ground. That document did none of the things that a government should be doing at a time of economic crisis. The Government should be taking steps to improve the competitiveness of Australian industries. As members who travel overseas will know only too well, at a time when other countries are addressing issues of competitiveness we are not. Even in so far as we take any steps in Australia to address the issue of competitiveness, we do so in a much slower, less imaginative and less productive way than is taking place, for example, in the United States, Canada, the European Community and other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. We are falling behind and the test of the Budget had to be whether it addressed these things. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been discussed already in this debate at some length, the Reserve Bank of Australia and Moody's Investors Service have simply underlined how the Budget and the Government's general economic strategy is failing to address the real issues that we face; indeed, the Government has an economic strategy which people ought to understand is little more than illogical nonsense. After all, we all know that Australia has a massive balance of payments deficit and a burgeoning foreign debt. The Government argues that that is caused by excessive demand. It says that we purchase or demand, if you like, 6 per cent more than the economy can actually supply. The Government argues that it will deal with this by crushing the life out of demand and then we will not demand so much. The only way to crush the life out of demand, which is the Government's strategy, is to reduce living standards. The Government is doing everything it can to reduce living standards through the device of forcing up interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality-Moody's is the latest organisation to point this out-is that that sort of economic strategy is voodoo economics. The quick fixes that were tried in Britain by the Wilson Government and in other parts of western Europe, such as by the Mitterrand Government when it first came to power, included devaluation and pushing up interest rates. Those tools have always failed because they have avoided addressing the fundamental issues of the economy. It is voodoo economics because if interest rates are forced up in order to reduce demand and to solve the balance of payments problems, one of the consequences is that the exchange rate is forced up, keeping the Australian dollar, in our case, at a higher rate than it would otherwise be if interest rates were not so high. If the Australian dollar is kept at a higher rate than it would otherwise be, one of the obvious consequences is an increase in the price of exports beyond what they might be and a reduction in the price of imports. If the price of exports is increased and the price of imports is reduced, then that encourages a blowing out of the balance of payments deficit. That is exactly why the high interest rate strategy that the Government had pursued since the New South Wales State election-it temporarily went through a low interest rate strategy in order to bolster the Labor Party's chances in that election-has failed. It has failed and the Budget Papers confess that it will continue to fail because they estimate that we will have a balance of payments deficit in this financial year of over $18 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a policy which, in a human sense, is fundamentally discriminatory because obviously the people who bear the heaviest burden of this policy are those who depend the most in their daily lives on borrowing money and who are therefore affected the most by high interest rates. Naturally small businesses which depend on borrowings rather than equity capital for their investment are severely handicapped by having to pay business rates of anything up to 24 per cent. But I guess the people we should all feel the most sorry for, and the people who ought to be brought back into this Parliament as a central point of debate, are home owners, in particular young home owners, who have seen home affordability decline as a result of rising interest rates for seven consecutive quarters. The last figures produced by the Housing Industry Association and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the June quarter of this year showed that home affordability in Australia had fallen to its lowest level since records were kept. </PARA>
<PARA> If home affordability is destroyed, we are creating two Australias: the Australia of those people who were able to purchase homes in previous generations-let me say in a party political sense under the Menzies and Fraser Governments-and those young Australians who have to purchase homes now and simply cannot afford to do so. Honourable members should remember that they are confronted with the worst home affordability figures since records have been kept. So we are creating two Australias-the one Australia of home owners and older people, and the other Australia of young families who are forced into the rental market or onto queues for public housing. The Government is pursuing on the one hand a policy of voodoo economics for younger people which will not work and, on the other hand, a policy which destroys one of the basic aspects of Australian society-the capacity of ordinary Australians to own their own home. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's come-back in this Budget is to do something for home owners. I can see that it tosses a bone to home owners by providing some additional rent assistance-not a great deal, but some-and $15m of extra funds for the mortgage and rent relief scheme. But it does not provide anything for young people who go out to buy their first homes. In this Budget funding for the first home owners scheme is reduced by more than twice the amount of money that is provided for the mortgage and rent relief scheme-it is reduced by $32m-and funding for the first home owners scheme in nominal terms, let alone real terms, has declined every year since 1984, when the first home owners scheme was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that, in the main, the first home owners scheme is a good, fairly well targeted scheme, although it could be better targeted. In so far as the Government wants to help low income people to purchase their own homes, I think that is a rational way of doing it. If the Government has chosen a good policy it is a shame that it has not carried on the promise the original policy gave for younger people buying their own homes but instead has taken more and more funding away from that scheme. As house prices have increased-of course, they have increased massively since the policy was first introduced-so interest rates have increased. Yet as interest rates and prices have increased, funding for the first home owners scheme has actually declined. Instead, the Government has transferred resources away from assisting young first home buyers at this very difficult time and into the public housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is very proud of its commitment to public housing; it always has been. It has always been an article of faith in the Labor Party that it should get more and more Australians into public housing. One of the great boasts of the Labor Party is that this year X people are in public housing, whereas under the Liberals Y people were in public housing, and Y is less than X. That is the sort of game this Government likes to play because it thinks it might be popular with the electorate. Actually, it reflects one of the strands of socialism, if you like, that still run through the Labor Party: its commitment to get more and more of the Australian community into dependence on the Government and away from the ultimate independence of having their own property and their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that public housing is a necessary thing for certain categories of people. No government would abolish public housing and I am not arguing that it should be abolished. What I am saying is that this Government's emphasis in its housing policies and through all its Budgets since it came to power in 1983 has been on providing more resources for public housing and fewer resources to help young Australians get into their own homes. I think that is a terrible indictment of this Government. As I have said, in general, public housing makes people dependent on the state. Home ownership gives them independence. Public housing also means that people become immobile. For example, people in public housing in the town of Murray Bridge in my electorate cannot afford to move to Adelaide to take work. If they move to Adelaide they will be out of public housing and back onto the public housing waiting list. That just does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's housing policy, in placing emphasis on public housing, is also very discriminatory. It discriminates in favour of those who are lucky enough to get into public housing-if we could call it lucky enough-and against those people on low incomes who are on public housing waiting lists and who are forced to go into the private rental market. At the moment there are about 180,000 people on public housing waiting lists, and they are there partly because increasingly they cannot afford to buy their own homes, as they could in better economic times, and partly because, effectively, they get more financial assistance in public housing than they do in the private rental market. So the Government's policies actually provide an incentive for people to get out of the private rental market and into public housing. I think that sort of housing policy is wrong and needs to change fundamentally. After all, the highest incidence of housing related poverty is found not in public housing but amongst low income people in the private rental market-the people for whom this Government has done the least. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing policies need to change fundamentally, and I think we need to look at some radical changes to those housing policies to ensure that low income people are guaranteed a roof over their heads in a way that is not discriminatory. Let me mention one of the ways in which we could do that. Instead of providing funding directly for public housing, as is currently done, we should use that money to introduce a housing benefit which is paid directly to qualifying low income households. Those people who qualify to receive the housing benefit would then be able to use that money for one of three things. Firstly, they would be able to use it in the form of rent assistance to help them pay the cost of rent in the private rental market. Secondly, they would be able to use it to help purchase a home, to help meet mortgage repayments, although I am quick to confess that very few people would be able to afford to purchase their own home, and in particular to accumulate a deposit to purchase their own home, if they fell into a category where they were able to qualify for a housing benefit. But that could be done and, where it could be done, I think it would be a very practical use for the housing benefit. Thirdly, the individual would be able to use that funding to pay the public housing authority in his or her State to help meet the cost of the provision of public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The net effect of this would not necessarily be a reduction in funding for public housing, if that were the choice that individuals who received the benefit actually made. On the other hand, if individuals overwhelmingly decided that they did not want to go into public housing but instead wanted to go into the private rental market-and I would submit that individuals would overwhelmingly make that choice-there would be a reduction in demand for public housing, a reduction therefore in the need for public housing, and obviously a reduction in funding for public housing. Ideally, I would like these people to choose whatever they wanted. I do not want to discriminate in favour of one form of tenure and against another form of tenure. I want individuals to be able to make those choices for themselves. By contrast, the Government's policies discriminate in favour of those lucky enough to be balloted into public housing and against people in the private rental market, who get an infinitesimal proportion of the assistance that those in public housing get. Because of the emphasis on high interest rates, the Government's policies discriminate, in a macro-economic sense, against young people who go out to purchase their own homes, to get into the home ownership market. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Labor Party's rhetoric is always the rhetoric of equality, equity, fairness and that sort of thing. Members of the Labor Party talk a lot about it, but I have just explained how their policies are basically unfair. If they are serious about equity they should provide equity in tenure between those who rent, those who purchase their own homes and those who go into public housing. That would also provide for much greater mobility of labour than is the case under current policies because people would still get the benefit if they were to move from, say, Adelaide to Newcastle or Wollongong, or where ever it may be. They would still get the benefit; they would still get assistance. That is not so easily done with public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, there is one other thing we could do to help young people get into home ownership, and that is to introduce a scheme which I spoke about in the earlier part of this year and which the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) christened the homesure scheme where we propose that those young people who go into superannuation funds would be able to cash in 75 per cent of the accrued superannuation benefits at the age of 25 and use that money as a deposit on their first home. Of course, there would have to be provision to ensure that they remained in the superannuation fund; they could not just take the money and sprint out of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this would have two very beneficial effects. Firstly, it would provide a deposit averaging in the vicinity of $16,000 for young people to help them purchase their own homes. That would be an enormous step forward. Secondly, it would provide an incentive for people under the age of 25 to enter superannuation schemes. Honourable members may not be aware that only 17 per cent of people under the age of 25 are currently in superannuation schemes. So with the homesure scheme, as we call it, there would be a very real incentive for what we might call the rational young person to go into superannuation, to remain in superannuation until he retired and, therefore, to make provision for his own retirement-something that both sides of the House support-and also to have the opportunity of purchasing his own home which might otherwise be denied him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating)-indeed all members of the Parliament-may wonder how much a scheme like this would cost. I submit that such a scheme would cost nothing at all on top of the cost that already exists for superannuation concessions. So I think it is an imaginative scheme and a way that we can encourage home ownership in our society, which has always been one of the fundamental objectives of the Liberal and National parties-though certainly not of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that the present Government, as has been the case with the Opposition, has resisted the political temptation of going down the path of providing quick fixes in the housing area; of doing things such as providing tax deductability for mortgages which would do nothing but massively inflate property prices around Australia at an enormous cost to the Commonwealth's Budget, and I think the net result would be just a substantial reduction in the Commonwealth's Budget deficit. It would certainly do nothing, ultimately, to make housing more affordable because prices would go up as a result of the increased demand provided through the tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, we need more imagination in the housing area, including more rational and less discriminatory policies. But so we do throughout the Budget. This is a Budget which is full of lost opportunities and which has turned its back on Australia's great problems. It will do nothing to help us become the economically powerful nation we really ought to be, given the resources that we have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, at the outset I would ask you to pass on my congratulations to the Speaker and to the Deputy Speaker on their elevation to high office. It is always a great pleasure for me to follow the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in this House. I always find it interesting when he starts speaking about the less privileged and so on. I always find it a little strange that someone in this chamber who comes from the most privileged of backgrounds has this close identification with those who talk about the less privileged. It is also interesting that he harked back to home ownership in the Menzies era. Rest assured that there are more young people today owning their own homes under the Hawke Government than there were in the Menzies era. He might be too young to remember the Menzies era but I remember it and I remember the people then who could not get into homes and the tragic situation of homelessness in that era.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, and having been slightly critical of the honourable member, I must say that his idea about being able to draw on superannuation in the early part of one's life is one that does attract me. It is an argument that I have used. I would go even further, though, and say that under a national superannuation scheme everyone would be able to be part of a superannuation scheme that people could draw on. I always believe it is in those early years when people get married, maybe have a couple of children, maybe buy a car on hire purchase, are often on low wages, and are trying to get into a home, that it is much more difficult for them. Later on in life, when the family is off their hands, when their home is paid for and their salary is usually greater, they do not need it. I have great sympathy for the scheme that the honourable member put up. I think it is a good scheme and, as he said, it is an imaginative scheme and one that deserves some attention. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of his speech the honourable member criticised the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), saying that he was just talking about State politics. I listened very carefully to the speech of the honourable member for Fisher and all he was doing was pointing out in his opinion the misappropriation of Federal funds that have gone to Queensland. That is something that I thought members of the Opposition would be very interested in. I am not saying whether they were misappropriated or not; I am just repeating what the honourable member for Fisher said. But perhaps it is something that, if the honourable member for Mayo feels so strongly about, he might be able to refer to the Opposition Waste Watch Committee. It seems to be looking into every other thing, so why not have it look at Commonwealth funds that have gone to Queensland over the last couple of years to see whether there has been any misappropriation there. It is certainly very quick to look at funds going to research in universities and other places like that; let it have a look at the funds going to Queensland and maybe we can have the benefit of the committee's collective wisdom on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Having listened to the many speeches in this House on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) it seems to me that members of the Opposition have exercised the luxury of opposition by criticising, but as usual they fail to tell us what they would do. They fail to tell us what they would cut. They tell us about how this Government has not funded appropriately various pet schemes that the Opposition has; but they never tell us what they would fund. The only thing we can do is guess. They have given us a few hints over the last couple of years of what they would cut. We have a hint that welfare would be cut; we have a hint that there might be a bit of a slash to pensions which, in their view, are too high. There has even been one hint that the telephone concessions for pensioners could well be cut. As I say, these are only hints that we have had from Opposition members. We on this side are waiting for their policies. We will watch with interest the relaunch of the famous 13 that did not gain enough publicity and we will have a look at those. </PARA>
<PARA> One of their policies of which we are aware, of course, is their industrial relations policy, and in the present pilots dispute we have a good example of how this would work. But it is not really these policies that we want to see. We have had a look at their industrial relations policy; we are seeing it working. It is their economic policies that we are really interested in, as indeed are the people of Australia. Until these economic policies are released I am afraid that our Opposition members must lack credibility, not only with us on this side but also with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since I have been a member of this place my electorate office has kept a record of all the telephone calls that we receive in the days immediately following the release of each Budget regarding the measures announced. It gives me, as the local member, an idea of what people are concerned about, what issues need more explaining and, dare I suggest it, what issues we have wrong. In the days following this latest Budget, I did not receive one call concerning the Budget. That has led me to the conclusion that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) got it right. It was a Budget for all Australians and it was well received. I think he got it so right and it was basically so well received because it is a document that is fundamentally based on social justice. Representing, as I do, an electorate in New South Wales, I am well aware of how important social justice is. Since the election of the Liberal-National Party Government in New South Wales my area has seen an unprecedented attack on services-an unprecedented attack by the Liberal-National Party Government in New South Wales. Make no mistake about it, this Opposition wants to introduce Greinerism, which is the Australian version of Thatcherism, throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989-90 Budget provides the most significant package of reforms for the aged introduced by any Federal government since the age pension system commenced some 80 years ago. A number of measures introduced in the Budget were in response to the issues pensioners raised with the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes. This Government not only listened to but also acted on their concerns. The youth package also could only have been, and indeed would only have been, introduced by a Labor government. I turn now to an area that is of particular interest to me and--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a way it is travel, as my colleague says. It is Antarctica. I was particularly pleased with the announcements contained in the Budget concerning Antarctica. At a time when more Australians are showing a concern for the future of Antarctica this Hawke Labor Government is supporting a range of innovative programs on that continent. In 1989-90 the Government is supporting Australia's largest ever Antarctic science program-a total of 135 projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) was critical about what the Government had not done in the science field. He may have a point when he is talking about insects. Nevertheless, he failed to mention the significant increase in the very exciting work in the science field that this Government is doing in Antarctica. Many of the projects involve international collaboration, including important studies on atmospheric, ecological and environmental issues. At a time when many people are concerned about the greenhouse effect, about one-quarter of the program focuses on research relating to the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion, the history of climatic change and future climatic trends. The continent is also a critical baseline laboratory for research into global environmental change. If we are going to understand changes to our weather patterns, much of the research will have to be carried out in Antarctica. Antarctica is the last clean place of any size that is left on earth. We each have a duty to ensure that it stays that way-a place for scientific research. We have managed to spoil so many areas. Surely there is one place left that we can leave in its pristine state.</PARA>
<PARA> During a trip to Antarctica earlier this year, I was made aware of the deplorable state of the meteorological stations at Davis and Mawson. I raised this matter in a speech in this House on 12 April this year and also discussed it with the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson. I was therefore delighted to read that new meteorological laboratories will be built at both Davis and Mawson. Scientific facilities at Davis Station will be the biggest beneficiary of $13m provided for the construction and fitout of four buildings in Antarctica. This will include construction of a general science laboratory and an upper atmospheric physics laboratory at Davis, as well as the meteorological balloon building and the fitout of new living quarters at Mawson. The Davis Station general science laboratory will be used for wildlife and fossil studies in the Vestfold Hills region and for atmospheric chemistry studies of greenhouse and other gases. The physics laboratory will have facilities for long term monitoring of the earth's lower and upper atmosphere, including studies and aerosol concentrations, ozone depletion, magnetic field variations and the ionosphere. The Mawson Station meteorological balloon building is to be built for the safe inflation and release of the balloons used to obtain weather data for forecasts and for research into climatic change and the impact of the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I must congratulate the Minister for agreeing to this proposal. In my own modest way I hope that the visits I had to the Minister's office and the discussions I had with him about the conditions under which the meteorological balloons have to be released at this station played a small part in obtaining the funding to rebuild these two very important meteorological laboratories. I also pay tribute to the workers who, over many years, have carried out their important duties in totally unsafe and dangerous conditions. It was only their dedication that enabled much important information and research to be carried out. I was also pleased with the announcement that there would be trials for an intercontinental Australia-Antarctica air link which will involve two Royal Australian Air Force Hercules flights from Hobart to an ice runway at Casey Station. In addition, an air transport system within Antarctica will also be tested using long range helicopters. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some debate about the building of an airfield in the Australian claimed territory in Antarctica. I inspected one proposed site near Mawson which would have been prohibitively expensive to develop and also damaging to the environment. The proposal for an ice runway at Casey and an expanded air transport system is a possible solution to a difficult problem. Air transport will enable more scientists to work in Antarctica over the summer months. It would also provide for quicker deployment to field sites and allow the introduction of new science programs which need air support. </PARA>
<PARA> The maiden voyage of Australia's new research and supply ship, Aurora Australis, will take place in 1990. This voyage will be a dedicated marine science cruise with a diverse range of oceanographic and marine biology projects to be conducted aboard. I am delighted that Australia will finally have its own Antarctic ship. The Aurora Australis will be equipped for research. The continent of Antarctica itself is largely a frozen wasteland. But the waters surrounding it are the richest reservoir of life on the planet and support the familiar large animals of the far southern seas-the penguins, gulls, seals, dolphins and whales. If we damage this region badly we will tear an enormous hole in the fabric of the planetary ecology and cause damage elsewhere. I was delighted that earlier this year the Government refused to sign the Antarctic Mining Convention. As would be obvious from my comments, I support the Government's efforts to have Antarctica declared a world wilderness park-an area reserved for scientific research. I hope that other countries will support Australia's efforts in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> The Antarctic region is valuable because of its ecological role and as a mine of information useful to science. In addition, we have a responsibility to try to protect and preserve in as pristine a state as possible the few areas on earth not spoiled by man. In this regard it is excellent news that this environmentally conscious Government will continue the clean-up process around the Australian bases. Not only is the present waste being returned but waste left from previous years, when perhaps Australians were not so environmentally conscious, is also being returned. Australia's record in regard to the environment in Antarctica, especially around our bases, is excellent. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect that does worry me is the prospect of tourism in Antarctica. I am of the firm view that any tourism would need to be ship based. Opening up the continent for tourists will make protection of the environment that much more difficult. A continual infusion of sightseers will only make accidents such as the Argentinean oil spill earlier this year much more likely. The Argentinean ship that went aground and spilled diesel fuel was a supply ship for the Argentinean scientific station on the continent. But it also carried about 100 tourists. Such ships should, I believe, limit themselves to their essential functions. It is not only in Antarctica that this Government has a proud record. The 64 per cent increase for funding for the environment is an indication of the high priority the Hawke Government is putting into the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to say that I strongly support the comments about sport made by my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) in this chamber last night. He made his usual excellent contribution and spoke from the knowledge that he has gained after many years of association with the sporting industry, in which he has a very distinguished background. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the 1988-89 Budget. I have to start off by saying how saddened I am by this Budget because, unfortunately, it does nothing to address our overriding problems-our lack of international competitiveness and our poor productivity rates. These problems have contributed to an overseas debt of $108 billion, as we heard in the last 48 hours. This rise of some 400 per cent in six years puts us on a par with countries such as Brazil and Mexico.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As other members have pointed out, this is clearly an election Budget. But it is not an election Budget in the old fashioned sense of the word. It is not about blatant handouts to all and sundry. It is about targeting benefits to particular problem groups-the aged, sports clubs, et cetera. Most importantly, it is about not upsetting any major constituencies. As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) got it right because he did not upset anybody. He did not do anything positive and, as the honourable member said, he did not target any groups for any major accounts. That is why the honourable member did not get any phone calls, apart from the fact that he is probably never in his office to get them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have attempted to sell this Budget as an economically responsible Budget when the truth is quite clearly exactly the opposite. They claim a tight fiscal policy, responsible wages control and encouragement to save, but of course the realities are quite different. Fiscal policy has been eased, not tightened. For example, personal taxes have been cut by $5 billion. There is an odd accounting process in the Budget. For instance, a couple of items of revenue from last year have been delayed and some items of revenue from next year have been brought forward. When one adds those up and does the balance figures one finds that this year's much-vaunted surplus is actually lower than last year's. The Forward Estimates also show expected real growth in outlays over the next two years. There is no increase in planned public savings. If one excludes asset sales and the cuts in State grants, one finds that Commonwealth outlays increased by almost one per cent. So much for Labor Government restraints on spending. The only restraints are on the grants to the States, not on its own spending. Quite clearly, the public sector is expanding rather than contracting. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, wages policy has been eased. Wages policy should allow for flexibility but prevent abuse by the Government, employers, employees and their employee organisations with, if necessary-as the Opposition has often pointed out-appropriate sanctions introduced at the right time. Our current earnings growth is already moving ahead of the agreed rate under the Government-Australian Council of Trade Unions deal which called for 6.5 per cent earnings growth in 1989-90, which would cause no problems if only it were tied to productivity increases, but of course it is not. The truth is that wages and fiscal policy have both expanded at a time of disastrous economic news. In the last day or two our overseas debt has skyrocketed and our inflation rate of 7 to 8 per cent is higher than that of almost all of our competitors. Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded our credit rating and we are now on the bottom of the rung of industrial nations. Why is that? The brief answer is that the decisions made in the Budget are not economic decisions but political ones. As a result monetary policy will continue to be the only lever which the Government can pull to control the economy. Therefore, high interest rates will continue for the foreseeable future and, in turn, our cost of living will be higher, inflation will increase and there will be corporate failures-in both large and small companies-bankruptcies and the possibility of a recession at the end of the financial year-all at a time of a world boom. The Reserve Bank of Australia, in its reserved way, summed up the situation with the kindest possible view of Australia's economic future under the Hawke Government. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Retention of the present stance of policy should produce a more significant restraint for spending as 1989-90 progresses. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether this will also be sufficient to lay the groundwork for winding down the current account deficit is uncertain: There are risks that it may not. </PARA>
<PARA> These risks will be much greater if there is a substantial slowing of world growth and a decline in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, even at a boom time for most world economies and with record commodity prices in most areas, the Labor Government still made a mess of it. What should be done? There is no short term solution. In summary, the solution would be to increase productivity and competitiveness and increase our export markets so that we can trade our way out of the mess. How can we do that? A whole range of measures need to be introduced which the Budget does not address. We need a tax system which is not penal, which does not deter people from working harder or doing overtime. We must bear in mind that the Hawke Government is the heaviest taxing government ever in peacetime. We need a flatter tax system. We need to get rid of excess bracket creep. We must remove disincentives to save and invest and we must remove the bias against the establishment of industries in Australia. We must equate more closely top corporate and personal tax levels and we need to abolish the capital gains tax. We need to remove the bias against savings and we need to reform and rationalise the indirect taxation system which has increased so much in the last few years under the Hawke Government. We need to be able to deregulate businesses. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), suggested that in business regulations there should be sunset clauses. Basically, that would work by all business regulations becoming non-functional at a certain time unless it could be shown clearly that there was a need for them as opposed to what happens at present, which is, unless specific action is taken the regulations apply forever. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to remove the dead hand of government. We need to prevent government spending from increasing. We need to remove regulation and encourage enterprise and freedom. That means, at least in part, privatisation to give incentive and reward for hard work, enterprise and efficiency. Part of that would involve decentralising the wages determination system so that we can achieve flexibility and offer reward for ability and productivity. We need to give incentive by introducing profit sharing schemes and so on whereby an employee benefits if his company does well partly as a result of his own labours. Schemes such as the employee's share ownership scheme, where a company belongs in part to its employees, have worked well in both Australian and overseas companies where they have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to reform our infrastructure. Goodness knows why it costs twice as much to transport a chest from Melbourne to Burnie in Tasmania as it does to transport one from the United Kingdom to Melbourne, as somebody trying to do that only a month or two ago pointed out to me. Surely there can be no logical explanation for that sort of cost. However competitive our products are when they start, when they are made, when they are dug out of the ground or grown, once transport costs are added they cannot compete. I do not need to list the problems; there are a number of them-for example, shipping, bulk storage, the waterfront and other transport methods. All those problems must be resolved. Outdated and restrictive work practices, which in most cases are the cause of problems, must be reformed. The Government has not had the guts to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to be able to introduce competition, incentive and reward for effort in those industries and transport areas as well as in ordinary enterprises and business. Again, we have to reduce the red tape and regulations for those industries. We have to reintroduce a sense of competitiveness into our country. We have a sense of competitiveness in so many areas. We can thrash the hide off the poms at cricket, we can win golf tournaments all over the world and occasionally we can even win an Olympic medal, although not as often as we might like. That sense of competitiveness is there in those spheres. Our reputation in times of war is unsurpassed. However, when it comes to business there is no competitive spirit which is not being drowned or smothered by the dead hand of government. We must relieve our workers and management from this dead hand of government to allow them to show the initiative which we all know they are capable of. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to focus on a couple of specific issues which, unfortunately, have not been addressed in the Budget but I believe they are an important part of the decision-making process. A number of Italian taxpayers and pensioners face a number of problems. I raised this issue in the House in May this year but the Treasurer has not even had the courtesy to reply, let alone to resolve the problems facing a number of people who are in great difficulties. The first concerns the invalid pension received by former residents of Italy which is taxed by the Hawke Labor Government. The invalid pension received by Australians from the Australian Government is not taxed, quite appropriately. Surely an invalid pensioner is an invalid pensioner no matter what his or her background is, unless the Government is saying that Italian invalid pensioners are not really invalids, that only dinky-di Aussies can be trusted to be genuine invalid pensioners, or that the Italians cannot be trusted to be genuine invalids. If that is the case it is a disgraceful slur on the Italian community. Yet it seems to be the only explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The criteria for invalidity in the two countries are basically the same. If there is any doubt in the Government's mind about the genuineness of those Italian pensioners, I am sure that they would be very happy to undergo an appropriate assessment of their medical problems. To make matters worse, the Italian invalid pensioners-unlike their equivalents in Australia-have contributed to a special fund to finance their pensions over a minimum period of five years and often much longer than that. Clearly, there is no significant difference between Australian and former Italian residents in terms of the invalid pension, except of course for their country of origin. I am disappointed that this matter has not been resolved in the Budget. Therefore, I call upon the Government to resolve it now. </PARA>
<PARA> There is yet another problem facing the Italian community which has not been resolved in the Budget and which clearly should have been. It concerns the double taxation of Italian pensioners. They are taxed by both the Australian and Italian governments. Under the bilateral agreement between Italy and Australia, as from 1 July 1987, which is over two years ago, tax should have been paid to the Australian Government only. However, largely because of differences in the timing of the financial year endings some problems have arisen. They could have been resolved easily, but they have not. The Australian Government has stated that each Italian pensioner must obtain from the Instituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociole (INPS), which controls Italian pensions, the amount identified as being derived from the pensioner's own contribution to his or her pension. Such information is available, but apparently the Australian Taxation Commissioner, at the behest of the Treasurer, has not accepted the data as being genuine. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that part of the problem has been obtaining detailed information from the INPS, but clearly, red tape and bureaucracy are taking over here and the people who are suffering are the poor pensioners of Italian origin. It is clear to me that the available information from INPS regarding the contributory part of the Italian pension should be accepted as the best available data on the contributory part of the pension, and allowances in terms of the taxation system should be made on this basis. The amounts involved are, broadly speaking, accurate, as described in these letters from INPS, and such a ruling would resolve a major problem, without resulting in any major loss of revenue for the Government. It would remove a problem which, I have to say, is hanging over the heads of a large number of Italian pensioners like a sword of Damocles. </PARA>
<PARA> In a similar situation, the Department of Social Security faced a problem in obtaining data about the level of Australian age pensions which they were entitled to, which in turn was also dependent upon the contributory part of the Italian pension. The Department of Social Security accepted the letters which I have referred to and said that these were reasonable data and accordingly adjusted the age pensions, and this problem, I am pleased to say, seems now to have been resolved. If, on the one hand, the Department of Social Security can accept the data, why cannot the Taxation Office accept the data? I think that the Treasurer should address this matter as a matter of urgency. The numbers of people involved are small, but the problem, as far as they are concerned, is very, very large. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other specific issue I wish to address which was not, unfortunately, covered in the funding which was made available in this Budget. I refer to the funding for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the fact that there is no funding in the Budget for haemophiliacs who have caught AIDS. Let me just outline the background of this problem. The haemophiliacs, people with so-called bleeding disease, have in many cases, through no fault of their own, caught AIDS. The bleeders, as they are often called, suffer from the deficiency of what is called factor 8 or factor 9 in their blood. The treatment for the disease is that they should receive intermittent transfusions of factor 8 or 9, which is in turn taken from hundreds, if not thousands, of donors. It is extracted from each blood donation which is given to the blood banks. The frequency with which they receive these transfusions varies from every other day to very, very occasionally. As a result of those transfusions, at the time when the precautions in terms of AIDS donors giving blood were not as good as they are now, approximately 350 out of the 1,200 haemophiliacs in Australia have now contracted HIV infection. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very difficult problem, of course. Haemophiliacs have a different case from many other patients with AIDS who contracted their AIDS from blood transfusion in as much as they had a pre-existing disease which meant, being haemophiliacs, that they really were in most cases unable to get a disability insurance or a life insurance. They had in many cases, because of their reduced earning capacity, no ability to provide for their own retirement or ill health from their own financial resources. On top of that, of course, there is the emotional and extra emotional and extra physical burden of having two major diseases, on top of the physical, social and psychological problems which all patients with AIDS or HIV infections suffer from. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, therefore, that in view of the fact that there is an even greater burden on these patients of having two major diseases and that they are in fact worse off initially, because of their haemophilia before they caught AIDS, there is a special case for caring for these patients and making sure their lifestyles are as normal as it is possible for them to be. There are indeed a number of options, and many of these have been canvassed with the Department of Health. One was for compensation for each individual patient, but after some discussion it was realised that there may be some difficulties with this and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) encouraged the Haemophilia Society of Australia to seek an alternative method, which was to arrange for a one-off payment from the Government as a seeding grant to a trust fund administered by independent trustees, which would then undertake to look after patients with haemophilia and AIDS for the rest of their lives. The seeding grant would have generated enough income to cover the needs of these patients. The advantages of this way of offering compensation was, of course, that there was no precedent set and that it was self-limiting, because indeed the problem itself is self-limiting. No new haemophiliacs are now catching AIDS because of the precautions now being undertaken in the blood banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Haemophilia Society went to a lot of trouble and, indeed, a lot of expense in preparing submissions for the Department of Community Services and Health, only in the end to be told that there was no way it was going to receive a grant. In both the Budget and the AIDS paper there is no mention of the question of a grant being given, although in the United Kingdom a similar situation has arisen and indeed the UK Government has given a grant there which is a very adequate grant. I understand that what happened in fact was that, in spite of the support of the Minister for Health for the project, the haemophiliacs' position was rolled by the financial brains of this Government. I understand that Senator Peter Walsh actually won the day as opposed to the more caring members of our society, and the more caring members, in particular in this case, of the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett, answered a question on this matter a week or so ago and he referred to the fact that haemophiliacs could address themselves to and use the `normal welfare arrangements'. But, of course, this is not a normal welfare problem. These people have their lives destroyed, both metaphorically and in reality. There is no other comparable scheme, according to the Minister, which would be used for people who have contracted diseases from their medical treatment. But of course, there is no other comparable situation; it is a unique situation. It would not set a precedent. He also suggested they might claim for negligence in the courts. There are problems with that. Firstly, there is the difficulty of proving negligence. Secondly, there is the fact, of course, that they are then about to sue the very people who keep them alive. The psychological and emotional problems in doing that, of course, are enormous. And, of course, the most important point is that the last thing the haemophiliacs want to be involved in, when they have AIDS in particular, is expensive, time-consuming and very distressing litigation procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said that the basic criterion for any government assistance is the need of the claimant, rather than the cause of the illness. If that is the case, then he should follow the example of the United Kingdom and give a seeding grant to this group, since the needs of this group, with two major physical problems, are indeed unique and their need is great. I believe that if he does not revise his decision, it will in fact be a very heartless consideration for a very, very special group in our society. The numbers involved are not small; the amount of money involved is not large. I believe that for once we should find some compassion from this Government and it should make a special grant to the Haemophilia Society which would enable it to care for its members. The problem then would resolve itself in terms of the ongoing care. The Government commitments would have ended with a one-off payment. There would be no long term problem, and indeed, these poor patients, who suffer so much in so many different ways, would have their problem, not resolved, but certainly minimised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like, first, to direct my remarks towards some of the ill-informed comments that come from the Opposition from time to time and certainly from the National Farmers Federation and many other vested interest groups, particularly in the area of the lack of reform with the waterfront unions and the seagoing unions. No other unions within Australia have played a more positive or constructive role in trying to co-operate with the Government in changes that need to take place not only to assist the economy but also to make their unions more economically viable. The seafaring unions in particular have been at the forefront of multi-skilling. This has taken place only because of the constructive, objective and positive role that Pat Garrety, the Secretary of the Seamen's Union of Australia (SUA), has been able to play in cooperating with this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Budget Papers a key element of the Government's shipping reform strategy is the program to reduce the size of crews on existing ships. To complement this program, the Government has agreed to partly fund retraining and voluntary early retirement schemes for the industry. Funding for these schemes of up to $15m has been allocated this year to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. I pay tribute to Pat Garrety for his cooperation with the Government in bringing this change about. It has certainly been no easy task for him to convince his members that fewer people are needed to man ships. Therefore, I really take exception to the fact that vested interest groups continually bag the Seamen's Union quite wrongly. It has certainly been at the forefront of making change within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The other union that always seems to get carpeted is the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. If we have a look at the history of the Waterside Workers Federation we see that 20 years ago containerisaton was introduced into Australian ports. The cargo handling wharfies at that time numbered 21,000. Today there are only 5,000 in this industry. In the past each person handled something like 1,000 tons. Today each waterside worker handles something like 5,000 tonnes. Waterside workers have lifted their game and I think it is a tribute to Tas Bull, the Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, that they have cooperated with the Government. It is quite disappointing to see the ignorant way in which the National Farmers Federation and some members of the Opposition continually have a go at these people when they have served a constructive role in bringing their industry to the forefront of mechanisation and have tried to expand their output. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised this and has set aside $38m as part of its contribution towards the waterfront reform package on the basis that an acceptable in-principle agreement will be achieved throughout the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. The bulk of this amount is to fund a retirement and redundancy program for stevedoring labour and to continue training, research and workplace reviews. A number of waterside workers have approached me and they are quite happy and contented with the way the discussions have taken place with the Government and the unions. That has been very good indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about a number of things that were in the Budget. At the forefront is road funding. Although I am disappointed that there was not more money allocated to road funding, this year's Budget has provided a total of $1.341 billion for road funding, an increase of $120m or almost 10 per cent. This compares with the consumer price index (CPI) increase of 7.6 per cent in 1988-89. Local roads in South Australia have received a 9 per cent increase in Federal Government funding. Local roads in South Australia have been allocated $22.7m in this year's Budget. In total South Australia will receive $91.3m from the Federal Government for road funding in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The national highway system in my State of South Australia will receive more than $34m for maintenance and new construction work. Some major works on the national highway system include the upgrading of the Stuart Highway between Pimba and Wirrappa and reconstruction of sections of the Eyre Highway between Adelaide and Port Augusta. Major work totalling more than $24m will also be undertaken on national arterial roads in South Australia. I am pleased to say that on top of this the Federal Government is also providing more than $10m to assist the South Australian Government to meet its road responsibilities. I know that a number of roads, particularly within my electorate, are quite appalling but I am sure that slowly we will get there to surface these roads and to get them in a condition we all expect. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to talk about Labor's commitment to health and community services. The Budget announcement in the community services and health portfolio showed a solid commitment by the Labor Government to the welfare of our nation. The combined package that was announced addresses essential areas of need in the community by providing for the following matters: There will be a new $15m safety net for home buyers facing extreme difficulty with mortgage repayments and $1,290m-up by 35 per cent-for public housing, home purchase assistance and new rental trust housing programs. An extra $27m has been allocated for accommodation projects as well as $7m over four years for health services for homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $40m has been allocated over four years to improve women's health, with $8.9m extra for child care increases and indexed fee relief. An amount of $59.6m-up 40 per cent-has been allocated for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and research. Over four years a $13.13m user rights program will protect aged people and people with disabilities. A sum of $6.3m will be spent over four years for multi-purpose facilities to provide health, residential and community care services for aged people in country areas. There will be extended entitlements to pensioner health benefit and health care cards for older and long term unemployed people. Over three years $1.65m will be spent to improve access by people from non-English speaking backgrounds to health and community services. This is extremely beneficial for the area where I live in Whyalla, where 65 different nationalities live in unique harmony. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be extra funds of $2.4m for health and medical research over three years. Half a million dollars has been allocated for computing facilities for the Australian Institute of Health and $277,000 to improve income support and increased work force participation for people with disabilities. Maximum patient contribution under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will rise from $11 to $12 from 1 October. Pensioners will still get pharmaceutical benefits scheme items free and concessional users will still pay only $2.50 a prescription. I have been particularly concerned about cervical and breast cancer in women and see the additional funding to provide extended screening programs-along with alternative birthing services-as a significant step forward in addressing identified needs under the national women's health policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important issue is that of homeless youth. I welcome the news that $27m has been provided for accommodation linked to innovative support services which will assist young homeless people to become more independent and guide them to longer term stable accommodation to be complemented by $7m over four years to provide health services for homeless young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I also welcome the initiatives announced in the Federal Budget to assist pensioners to achieve a better standard of living. The detailed measures outlined by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in the Government's historic document Better Incomes: Retirement Policy into the Next Century will assist people approaching retirement with the opportunity to provide better incomes for themselves under sweeping reforms announced in the Budget. Labor's longstanding commitment to an age pension of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings will be not only met but exceeded in April 1990 when there will be a special $2 a week increase for single pensioners and a $3.30 increase per week for pensioner couples. I am extremely pleased that this increase will be in addition to the planned indexation increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, rent assistance will be increased by $5 a week in December 1989 and by a further $5 a week in September 1990. Again these increases are in addition to those announced in last year's Budget. From March 1991, for the first time, rent assistance will be indexed every six months. One of the most important areas in which I have campaigned concerns the indexation of the pensioner income test-free area-$40 a week for single pensioners and $70 a week for combined pensioner couples. This has now become a reality and, from July 1991, will be indexed on an annual basis. This builds on measures announced in the April 1989 economic statement which made an income test-free area totally tax free by July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main problems brought to me by pensioners in my electorate of Grey concerns the confusion created by the differences in the Social Security Act and the taxation system. The new measure simplifies the age pension and the taxation system. Furthermore, from 1995 no age pensioner will pay income tax, whether he receives a full or part rate pension. </PARA>
<PARA> There are further measures to assist pensioners. Concessional treatment under the pension income test of income received from home equity conversion schemes and annuities, as well as a simplified pension earnings credit scheme, will be provided to allow pensioners to receive higher incomes while retaining their full pensions. A new bereavement package will provide financial assistance to pensioners through a very difficult time. A range of new and upgraded independent financial, advisory and information services will be established for pensioners. These services recognise the increasing complexity of financial products available to provide retirement income. Pensioners need reliable information on the treatment of investments under income and assets tests as well as taxation. The better incomes package announced by the Government, as well as providing for those who have already retired, outlines and recognises the needs of our ageing population, and changes to superannuation arrangements will increase opportunities for those approaching retirement, especially women, to save for their own retirement. I will be detailing all of these measures announced in the Budget for pensioners in September in my twice-yearly pensioners information kit for pensioners in my electorate. I must say that they look forward to receiving that package. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the announcements in the Federal Budget which I feel has been overlooked by the media and which is extremely important to my electorate, covering 86.2 per cent of the State of South Australia, is the additional funding for multipurpose centres. The funding for these multipurpose centres comes under the portfolio of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), and an additional $6.3m has been allocated for this initiative over the next four years in recognition by the Government of the needs of small communities. At the present time, people living in small communities in rural and remote areas do not have access locally to a range of services because the size of these communities will not sustain the viable operation of separate services. In line with the Government's commitment to provide accessible health services to all Australians, 40 multipurpose centres will be developed, to be located in underserviced rural areas in 1989-90, and more will be approved in future years, depending on demand. I think this is a very positive step. Project officers from the Department of Community Services and Health will work with local community groups and State governments to develop proposals and bring together small ventures of two or more types of service to reduce overhead costs for each service. In addition to this, a small multipurpose centre standard grant will be available for some centres to help meet the higher cost of a small-scale operation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to talk about the southern bluefin tuna program. It is quite appropriate that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who has had such an outstanding rapport with the fishermen in my area, is at the table tonight. I commend him for the grants that he has made available under the southern bluefin tuna program. I welcome the funding announcement in the Federal Budget for the southern bluefin tuna program. Maintaining the program is of prime concern to me and my constituency on the west coast, and is extremely important to the tuna industry, and I am delighted that the fishermen at Port Lincoln see this as an extremely constructive move by the Minister. The amounts allocated, $700,000 for 1989-90 and $750,000 for 1990-91, will maintain and expand aspects of the research and monitoring program, which is used to assess the status of stocks of southern bluefin tuna. I understand that the investigations will continue into the parameters used to identify recruitment to the fishery, changes in abundance and the control measures necessary to monitor the adherence to stock limits. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Commonwealth will continue to press for a global management arrangement on the southern bluefin tuna stocks to ensure that, should a recovery occur, the benefits of such a recovery will not be dissipated. I say to the Minister that I am sure that the red carpet will be out when he next goes to Port Lincoln as the fishermen there certainly see him as doing an excellent job in his role as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I thank him on behalf of the fishermen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to make a contribution to this debate on the Appropriation Bills because there are so many areas in Australia where there is a need for improvement, where there is a need, even in some small ways, for government to do things better. I make the point first of all that my personal disappointment in this most recent Budget was that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) could not find it in his heart to provide some form of tax exemption for donations to mobile life education units. I am fully aware that donations to life education centres are tax deductable but that applies to centres in the capital cities. Right around Australia there are at least 27 mobile life education centres doing, I believe, a marvellous job in teaching our children about their bodies and what to avoid in the way of drugs and all sorts of substances that are harmful to them. I am very disappointed that the Treasurer could not provide tax deductability for donations to mobile life education centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also interested to report a letter that I had from the Canteen Manager at St Joseph's Hastings Regional School in Port Macquarie about the sales tax on milk. This Government last year managed to take $400m off the excise on beer, yet it still taxes flavoured milk for kids at 10 per cent. I think the interests of Australia's children justify the reversal of that tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also interested to note a letter I have received from VOTE-Voice of the Elderly, the Coffs Harbour and Districts Branch-expressing its great desire for some form of additional hostel and nursing home accommodation for the aged in that area. Of course, that does not apply solely to Coffs Harbour. The need is throughout my electorate, but I am interested that the people of VOTE in Coffs Harbour make the point to me in their letter that there is a genuine need for a special care hostel-hospital with highly trained staff to cater for sufferers of Alzheimers disease and related disorders. This is something that is sweeping through Australia, yet all the Government wants to do, I believe, is to sweep it under the carpet. We should realise that, of those Australians who live to be 80 years or more, one in five will suffer from some form of dementia, whether it is Alzheimers or some other form. </PARA>
<PARA> I am most grateful to the people of VOTE for taking the stance that they have done, because it supports me in the moves that I have been making ever since I have been elected to try to gain more attention for aged and elderly Australians. These are the people who have made their contribution to our society, and I think it is less than satisfactory that we are not providing absolutely everything that should be required. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to detail some figures relating to the growth in the number of persons aged 70 years and over in my area. In health area 4, the Coffs-Bellingen-Nambucca area, the 1986 census revealed that the number of people aged 70 years and over totalled 5,931. By 1989 that had jumped by another 1,720 to a total of 7,651 people. That is a massive jump. According to the 1986 census, in area 5, the Kempsey-Macleay Valley area, the number of residents 70 years old and over totalled 1,766. That figure is now up to 2,314. In the Hastings area, 4,656 people of 70 years were covered by the 1986 census. That figure has now grown to 6,049. This is a massive jump. We are not providing for this increase because we have the home and community care (HACC) formula. We all know the HACC formula. It is not adequate because it is not keeping up. </PARA>
<PARA> The population growth estimates for the north coast of New South Wales are perennially proved wrong. They are always too low. We have a rapidly increasing population of ageing people and we are not putting in the infrastructure to cope with their needs. In the 1981-86 inter-census period, Coffs Harbour grew by 22.29 per cent; Nambucca, 24.96 per cent; Hastings, 17.69 per cent; and Kempsey, 17.06 per cent. These are massive growth figures. They are certainly the highest in total in New South Wales, if not the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of nursing home and hostel beds, I make the point that in area 4, the Macksville-Bellingen-Coffs Harbour area, there are not just people who are at risk of future institutionalisation, but people who are in desperate, urgent need of a bed right now, tonight. In the hospitals in that area 21 people and, in the community, 48 people-a total of 69-desperately need nursing home beds right now. As for hostel accommodation, there are 31 people who tonight, now, need a bed. There is a total bed deficit of 106 in that one little area of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> A little further to the south, in the Macleay Valley, a total of 36 people are in desperate need of nursing home beds now-not a risk in the future but a need right at this minute. Eleven of them are in hospital and there are 25 out in the community. Another 30 desperately need hostel beds. There is a total bed deficit of 66 in the Macleay Valley area. In the Hastings area, the situation is not quite as bad, I am pleased to say. There are five people in hospitals awaiting nursing home beds and 14 in the community, giving a total of 19 people who desperately need nursing home beds now. In the Hastings and Macleay Valley areas there are private nursing homes that are prepared to spend the money, at no expense to government, to put in extra beds but this Government will not let them go ahead and undertake that work. I believe that is shameful. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Hastings area there are 30 people awaiting hostel beds. There is a total bed deficit of 49 in that area. We cannot shut our eyes and hope it will go away. It just so happens that the north coast of New South Wales, because of its superb climate, attracts people. We have the fastest growth rate in Australia. People would rather live there than in many other places. We are not going to stop them. This is a free country. If they want to live in that marvellous mid north coast area, they should be allowed to do so. The fact that demographic studies continually underestimate growth must be addressed by government very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to address a current dramatic problem affecting pharmacies around Australia. I know that this is of particular significance to my electorate. I prefer to refer, not to pharmacists, but to one's friendly family chemist. Australians think of them in that way. It is proposed that dispensing fees will be cut by up to 25 per cent. The average cut per prescription will be $1.05. The projection from the Pharmacy Guild is that up to 30 per cent of pharmacies may close. I find this absolutely appalling. I hope it does not happen. I hope the estimates are wrong, but the indications I received from the pharmacists, the friendly family chemists, in my electorate are that the figures are pretty right. Of course, most of those that will close will be in country and regional centres. The majority of these pharmacies employ only one pharmacist. They are not huge businesses; they are small family businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the growth rate on the north coast of New South Wales. The growth rate of elderly residents in that area has been 16 per cent. They have a greater need for pharmaceutical care than many other sections of the community. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal in its report admits that this recommendation will cause `an unacceptable diminution of the services available to the community', as well as `unplanned' restructuring of the industry. That is just a bureaucratic way of saying that people will lose jobs and pharmacies will close. That is not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be recalled that when one talks about a pharmacy, one is not talking about handing pills over the counter; one is talking about service, caring advice, free home deliveries to the elderly who cannot go out to get their prescriptions filled, and free home deliveries to women with small children and to the disabled. We should pay tribute to the pharmacists of this country for the marvellous job they do in advising and helping people and treating minor injuries such as cuts and sprains or helping people to remove ticks and other problems of that nature. The Government must rethink what it will do to the pharmacists of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I am always concerned that the present Government increasingly tends to use the environment as a smokescreen to obscure the real problems of our economy. Our net foreign debt is now $108 billion. When Labor came to power in 1983, after almost 200 years of this nation's existence, we had amassed a total overseas debt, public and private, of $23 billion. It took six years of Labor government to boost it to $108 billion. That is absolutely appalling. It is no wonder that Moody's Investors Service Inc. has downgraded our credit rating to AA2. We have had the world's greatest environmental statement which promised that a billion trees would be planted. Of course, it turned out that about 600 million of them were to be tossed out of the back of aeroplanes as seeds. That is a great tree planting program! If the Government is so concerned, why is it not fair dinkum about doing more in the area of soil conservation? In 1987-88, $6m was spent nationally on soil conservation, while $5m was spent on landscaping Parliament House. It is not in balance. As I said before, the Government is not fair dinkum. Had the coalition Government still been in office, our policy was to provide $50m for soil conservation between 1983 and 1989. Under Labor, the total figure since 1983 is only $21.8m. In spite of the fact that some people cannot see the wood for the trees, soil conservation is our number one environmental problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The other side of the coin is flood mitigation. We have what is known as the 2:2:1 system whereby the Commonwealth puts in $2, the States put in $2 and local government puts in $1. I do not know what occurs in other States, but in New South Wales the Commonwealth never puts in enough. It is never prepared to match what the State and local governments are prepared to put in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not true. This Government is big on words, but it is short on funding and it is short on action. Most flood mitigation money appears to be spent on urban drainage. There is no money for river improvement works to stop Australia being washed out to sea. I believe that river improvement works are just as important in terms of soil conservation because every year-and look at the wet year we are having so far-Australia is being washed out to sea and we cannot get a penny for river improvement works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Kempsey there is one floodway project. Under the 2:2:1 system each year, the Commonwealth gives $15,000, the State gives $15,000 and local government provides $7,500. That totals enough to buy one old house a year in order to clear the floodway. The trouble is that 70 houses need to be cleared, so it will be 70 years before we can clear that floodway. Similarly, in Coffs Harbour there is a flood mitigation project in the urban area. Under the 2:2:1 system, we are getting approximately $100,000 per year. At that rate of funding it will take between 15 and 20 years to fix the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes remaining to me I would like to talk about the urgent need for airport upgrading at Port Macquarie. As honourable members know, Port Macquarie is one of the jewels of the Australian coast. It has a superb climate. In fact, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation says it has optimum climate for the human animal. Anybody who has been there would appreciate the great beauty of the place. The airport is desperately in need of and overdue for upgrading to jet standard. The cost is $6.122m. I flag the need for $2m of Commonwealth money to get that airport upgraded to jet standard. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Kempsey airport, while it has landing lights, there are no night landing facilities. This severely restricts the possibility of flights into and out of Kempsey. It really needs a T-VASIS system, but successive Ministers have flatly said no. Kempsey is so keen about the matter that it is spending its own money to put in a non-directional beacon. It has been waiting for two years for the Department to approve the tender. It is taking far too long. The Department now says, `We are pulling one out of Orange. You can borrow that until you get the recommendation and the tender for the other one'. That would mean double installation costs and, of course, double testing costs. The amount involved is only $80,000. I believe the Government should make a contribution because aviation-not that we have much of it at the moment!-is vitally important. If we ever doubted that, the present situation shows how important aviation is to this country. Government members are doing nothing except exacerbating the situation. They are being led by that flight lieutenant, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I believe that this Government must do better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, Mr Speaker, I would like to add my congratulations to those of other members of the House on your elevation to your present position. I am sure that you will continue to serve your own electorate and this House with distinction. I hope you will forgive me if on a few occasions in future months I refer to you as Madam Speaker. I hope you do not take it personally. I will try to adjust as quickly as I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 1) deals with matters brought down in the Budget by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The most important part of the Budget Papers that affects my electorate is the announcement regarding retired and elderly people. Mr Speaker, having visited my electorate in December last year on the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes, you will be aware that there are more age pensioners in the electorate of Dobell on the central coast of New South Wales than in any other electorate in Australia. Through the efforts of yourself, Mr Speaker, and people such as your co-chairperson of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes we were able to achieve some quite significant improvements for retired Australian citizens. I wish to spend a little time tonight going through those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that members of the Opposition will give the Government the credit that it deserves for these historic reforms. They add up to a package of more than $700m this financial year. The Government's decision to increase the base rate of the pension by $2 a week next April has earned the greatest response from the community. That increase is on top of the normal indexation increases which will occur in November and April. The reason why increases are coming through in November and April is that the Government announced in the April statement this year that it would be bringing forward the dates on which cost of living increases will be paid to pensioners and people receiving benefits. This means that people receiving pensions will be getting their cost of living increases 12 weeks earlier than they now do. Many of those pensioners have reminded me that that is simply restoring a delay which was inserted a few years ago, but I think the Government should be commended for taking the action that it has in bringing forward those cost of living increases by 12 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> One area which has created a great deal of confusion amongst retired people is that of tax. The difficulty has been the concept of a tax rebate for some pensioners and not for others. Each year pensioners have had to sit down, make calculations and determine how much they could earn on top of their pension before starting to pay tax. On occasions one almost needed a masters degree in economics to work out how much could be earned as the calculations were so complex. This confusion is being eliminated by the Government in two steps: first of all, in this financial year from 1 July the tax threshold for married pensioners was brought up to the same level as the social security threshold for married pensioners; that is, they can each earn $35 a week before their pension starts to be reduced and from 1 July this year they can each earn $35 per week before they start to pay tax. That has simplified the system and one does not have to sit down halfway through the year and do calculations to work out how much one can earn before tax is paid. The tax threshold is equal to the social security threshold; that is, $70 a week combined for married pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> For single pensioners there has been an even bigger increase. A couple of years ago single pensioners could earn only $4 a week before they started to pay tax. Last financial year that rose to $10 a week; this financial year the Government is pushing it up to $25 a week; and from 1 July 1990 single pensioners will also have the tax-free threshold equal to the social security threshold; that is, $40 per week. By simplifying the system we are removing a lot of the confusion amongst elderly people. I am hopeful that at the end of this financial year I will have fewer pensioners calling my office and raising questions because we have simplified the system. I think that that will be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most radical measures announced in the Budget Statements by the Treasurer was the Government's retirement incomes policy, which we have been working on for some time. I hope the Opposition is considering this matter. I am sure the Australian people would welcome bipartisan support for a retirement incomes policy. The reason why it would be good to have a bipartisan policy on this matter is that I think elderly people believe that once a new system is introduced for retired people and they make decisions about where they should place their investments, it is a little unfair to change the rules halfway through the game. The Government has announced that in 1995 no part pensioner-either service pensioner or age pensioner-will pay any income tax. I am disappointed that to date the Opposition has not come out in support of that policy so that we could say that there is bipartisan support for this revolutionary measure. I hope that in the weeks to come the Opposition will look at this closely because at the moment part pensioners are paying too much in tax. They lose 50c in the dollar by a reduction in their pension by the Department of Social Security and if they are paying tax they lose at least another 21c on the remainder in income tax. We are saying that no part age pensioner or service pensioner will pay any tax. Instead of paying 71c or more in the dollar, pensioners will simply be paying the 50c in the dollar. That is quite radical and will encourage more people to provide for their own retirement. It will make those fortnightly superannuation pensions and fortnightly annuities more attractive than they were in the past. I think that should be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> During the recent parliamentary sitting break we had some interesting comments from senior spokesmen on the Opposition benches on the question of retirement and welfare. Senator Stone, the Opposition finance spokesman, made some quite amazing comments. I will quote from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald. It is headed, `Welfare blamed for lack of saving'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The growth of the welfare state has eroded Australia's level of savings, the Opposition finance spokesman, Senator John Stone, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> . . . 20 years ago Australia had a very high level of savings. What has changed since then, he said, was that Australia had become a welfare state. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> He refused to say how far he would wind back the welfare system, saying he wanted to first get to the point where enough people acknowledged a problem exists. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. The Opposition says that it wants to go back 20 years to the welfare system that applied in the 1950s where the majority of retired people did not get an age pension and had to live with their children. They did not get the sort of support they can today. The Opposition says that that is the way it will promote more savings-by ripping the welfare system to shreds. I mention in passing that Senator Stone, the Opposition spokesman on finance, has called for cutbacks in welfare but he has not done too badly himself. He retired from the Public Service on the very generous superannuation system that applied to senior bureaucrats. Of course, now he is accumulating a parliamentary pension. So I am sure that Senator Stone's calls for the 1950s welfare system will not interfere with his measures for providing for his own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also had comments made by the Federal President of the Liberal Party, Mr Elliott. I wish to quote from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald headed `Elliott attacks Australian belief in ``handouts'' '. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal president of the Liberal Party, Mr John Elliott, called yesterday for the removal of `welfare shackles' to improve Australia's economy, even though this would cause pain for some people. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There will therefore be pain for some of us as one takes away some of the welfare shackles, as we support causes that are going to improve the productivity and living standards of our citizens overall. </PARA>
<PARA>I just wonder how Mr Elliott will be hurt by slashing back the welfare system. I would be surprised if Mr Elliott was receiving any support at all from the social security system. In fact, I find it obscene that someone as wealthy as Mr Elliott is leading the charge to cut back the sort of assistance that we provide to our elderly people receiving service and age pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just look at the Opposition's overall position on tax. It has come up with this gimmick scheme to provide for an inflation adjustment of interest from banks and building societies. It looks like the Opposition will have to dump that gimmick because it has realised that a few fishhooks are hidden in it. We know that the Opposition has promised those senior businessmen that it will not be retrospective, so Mr Bond and Mr Elliott will not have their massive borrowings affected. We know that the Opposition has promised the Real Estate Institute of Australia that it will not apply to negative gearing, so its friends in the real estate industry will not be upset; yet it has told us that, for some reason, credit unions will not be included in the scheme. Simply saying that the scheme will not be retrospective creates all sorts of problems. Imagine if the Liberal Party-shock, horror!-were elected at the next election and it announced that it was going to introduce its scheme to cut back the tax deduction which businesses get for their borrowings. Before the legislation passed both Houses of Parliament we would have a massive borrowing spree by the businesses of Australia to try to make sure that they could borrow as much as they could so that they could claim the tax breaks on those borrowings before the new proposal came into effect. That is absolute madness.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the short time that is available to me I simply make the point again that the Opposition has not really sorted out its views on retirement incomes and on tax. It has said that it wants to abolish the capital gains tax-the one measure that has cut down all those massive tax avoidance schemes that tried to convert income into capital gain. I think it is really time that the Opposition went back through its policies again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who preceded me in this debate, referred in particular to pensioners. If this Government is in office any longer, there will not be any pensions for pensioners. That is the reality of the economic crisis that is facing this country today. The major crisis that we are faced with is a huge overseas debt created largely by this Government. The honourable member for Dobell referred to the miserly $2 that pensioners will get; yet only a few days ago this Government announced that it was going to increase the stamp allowance for members of parliament by $21,000. Those are the sorts of standards of this Government. I say to the honourable member for Dobell: there will be no comfort for his pensioners from any government which brings those sorts of issues to the fore-a $2 increase for pensioners and a $21,000 increase in the stamp allowance. It is absolutely ludicrous and shows the sorts of priorities that this Government has. It wants to be re-elected at all costs and it is going all out to do that at the expense of the weak and needy people in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's debt crisis can only be illustrated by the following figures: for the first 82 years of Federation our debt rose to about $33 billion. In the last six years it has risen to $130 billion; in other words, it has risen by $100 billion in six years. That is the crisis which faces Australia today. This Budget and this Government are not addressing that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes members of the Government come in here and say that they have a great record. But housing interest rates are 37 per cent higher under the Hawke Government than they were under the Fraser Government. Let us look at what this means for the average modest family. Many people in my electorate of Braddon have very modest incomes-about $22,000-which is less than the average in Australia. A family on that income with a $30,000 home loan, which everybody in Australia knows is very low these days, has been paying $70 per month extra on interest rates over the last six years, the last 72 months, compared to what they would have been paying in the years of the Fraser Government. That is the difference in regard to interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks a lot about the employment opportunities that it has created. Of course, it has created very few. It is the small businesses and the business people out in the community, working themselves to the bone, that have created those jobs. But let us look at the Government's unemployment record. If its record in creating employment has been so good, why are our unemployment figures not down to one or 2 per cent? Under the Fraser Government unemployment averaged 5.9 per cent. Under the Hawke Government it is 7.9 per cent, which is up 34 per cent each year on average for the last six years. Our external debt figures are up, not by 30 per cent, 100 per cent or 200 per cent but by 600 per cent. That is the crisis that this nation is facing. In the Australian of 16 August this year, after the Budget, Mr McGuinness commented:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no more reason to rely on the forecasts in the Treasury documents than there was last year. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened last year? It was forecast that we would have a current account deficit of $9.5 billion. That figure blew out enormously. So why should we believe that this year the figure will be $18.5 billion? What an incredible indictment of any government! As each month goes by, under the framework and policies that this Government has put in place in this great nation of ours, we are going down the tube to the tune of $1.5 billion. Here we are, one of the richest resource countries in the world, with a high standard of education and, up until a few days ago, a good transport and communications system-yet we are failing to produce the goods. We are lacking in competition. And it is due to this Government's activities. </PARA>
<PARA> We also find that we are now one of the highest taxed countries in the world. This is the highest taxing government Australia has faced since the Second World War and in fact in the last six years taxation levels per man, woman and child in this country have risen from $2,900 to $5,800. In other words, the increase has been 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of that is when we compare it with the increase in average weekly earnings. Over the same period we would have expected a reasonable increase to match the extra taxation burden that this Government has placed on the Australian people. But the reality is that the average wage earner's packet has risen only 50 per cent in that period while taxation has risen 100 per cent. That is why the ordinary person, the average Australian is feeling the pressure under this Government. Taxation levels have doubled under its administration but the pay packet of the average wage earner has gone up by only 50 per cent. That causes a crisis in many families in this nation-the less well off families; the people earning under $25,000 with two or three children and trying to maintain a job. Those people are operating on a very tight budget. When we have interest rates at 17 per cent in this nation caused specifically by government policy it is the children and the young families that are severely hurting. This Government is largely to blame for it through specific monetary policy to squeeze those people and to make them share the burden of this Government's reckless administration of this country. It is a great tragedy that those people are being forced to carry the burden of maladministration of the huge overseas debt which grew under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I know some Government members would like to argue that it is not their fault, but it is the Government of Australia that sets the framework in which everybody in this nation operates and it has failed dismally to set a framework in which Australia has been able to rein in the debt or maintain a low level of debt. That debt crisis will be a noose around the neck of young Australians for generations to come because of Hawke and Keating and their so-called strategy. We ought to be reminded that one of their promises was that no child would be living in poverty in 1990. The reality is that this Government drives people into poverty. The poorer families in this country now realise that it is the policies of this Government that have really nobbled them as a family in trying to get on. Families want to try to improve their lot in life, to get on and save money so that they can provide a better standard for their young people. The reality is that under this Government's administration more and more of the poor families in this country have become dependent on government welfare. They cannot maintain independence of government welfare on their own resources because of the high taxation levels and the high interest rates in this country. The sooner this Government is removed from the administration of Australia the sooner will be the circumstances in which this great nation is able to get itself back on the track of improving its overseas debt crisis and lifting the burden of taxation from the ordinary Australian. </PARA>

<PARA> I would like to respond to some of the Opposition's remarks but in particular in this debate on the Appropriation Bills I believe there has been a very hypocritical and disgraceful approach by the Opposition to the increase in postage allowance that members of the House of Representatives will now enjoy. I just want to set the record straight from my perspective on this issue. Commentators and other people should look at this as a continuum and an addition to a process that has been going on for some time. What has been that process? I can recall some 15 years ago when I was campaign director for the State member for Mount Druitt, Tony Johnson, when he first ran for the seat, that if one wanted to see a State member or a Federal member in New South Wales one went either to Chifley Square or to Macquarie Street. In other words, to provide a service to their constituents, members of parliament did it out of Parliament House on a State basis or the Commonwealth offices on a Federal basis. We have moved so far over those years with that historic decision to give members an electorate office in their own electorate. What was the implication of that? It brought members of parliament closer to the people and made them more accessible. It provided staff for members of parliament so that they did not have to do it on their own or alternatively rely on a pool typist for correspondence. What was the impact of that? Members gave better service to their constituents and were more accessible. If a constituent could not get the member at least there was a very competent person in that member's office who would compassionately and sensitively take on board the complaint and try to resolve it. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own circumstances, coming to this Parliament in 1984, I was really shocked, coming out of the Public Service, that we did not have computers, that in the 1980s members of parliament could be dealing with a huge Public Service, dealing in millions of dollars, making all sorts of decisions and using electronic typewriters. </PARA>

It used to take me about 2 1/2 days to send out 300 letters. My electorate office computer and laser printer arrived in the middle of the last election. Now, instead of taking 2 1/2 days to do 300 letters we can do it very quickly. Some members of parliament at that stage were very concerned that computers may take away some of the need for staff and that we could be having some redundancies. But they have created more work. I am pleased they have created more work because we are more accessible to the people and that is what our role ought to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The postage allowance is a logical extension. It has been argued passionately by the Opposition that this is a proposal designed to help marginal members. I have never considered that my seat was marginal-some say it is very safe-but I have a very fundamental view about my electorate. I think exceptionally highly of its people. I believe that they deserve the best and that I have a role and a responsibility to ensure that I can pass off as much information to individual groups and constituents as I can. We live in an age, Mr Deputy Speaker, when people talk about information rich and information poor. I assure this House that I make no apologies for saying that I believe my constituents in Chifley deserve to be information rich. I do everything within my power to ensure that that is the case. I welcome the postage entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 12 months ago I asked the research section of the Parliamentary Library to look at the entitlements for members of parliament elsewhere. It staggered me that a member of parliament in the United States of America-a congressman or senator-can write to every constituent six times a year. In Canada it is twice every year. For the first time, we decided that in our parliamentary submission to the Remuneration Tribunal we would get away from a situation of learned judges gazing at their navel and trying to determine what the incremental increase in stamps should be. Should it be $1,000 a month? Should it be $1,050? These were the sorts of onerous decisions we were putting on them. With no disrespect to learned judges, I must say that I have not much faith in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> We have put it on a logical formula basis: a member of parliament is entitled to write to every constituent once a year. We are not going to argue about this formula. The figure used is 70,000. It is a formula basis, which is much better than demanding judges to gaze at their navels and try to make some determination. I predict that in the fullness of time others in Australia will follow what we have done. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), has played a very important role in trying to improve facilities for members so that they can improve facilities for their constituents. I would like to congratulate him. I would like to see more services being provided to members than we currently enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> In that list of facilities I failed to mention that we were provided with a facsimile machine in our electorate offices. When people asked me whether I had a facsimile machine I used to use the old joke and say, `No, but we do have a design group working on turbo-charged pigeons'. That is how outrageous I thought it was in this day and age not to have a facsimile machine. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition are playing a hypocritical role in this matter by saying that they are concerned about the formula. They say they are worried about whether the entitlement can be transferred. It cannot. It is to be used for parliamentary and electorate purposes, and it will be. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Senate. Senators are creating such a fuss about the fact that they do not have the same entitlement. Senators say that they do not have an electorate as members do, but are representatives of the State and that, indeed, if there is a vacancy, if someone resigns, the State Parliament fills that vacancy. Let us put aside that sort of argument that they consistently and persistently advance and let us accept that they have electorates. Are the senators arguing that if we go to formulas they should have the same formula? If they are, then they are saying that there should be an extra $40m spent solely on the senators. I think that is ridiculous. The Senate has a different role to play in this place. It has established a reputation for its committee work and reviewing of legislation and it ought to concentrate on what it does best. </PARA>
<PARA> It will come as no surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, when I say that I strongly endorse this increased postage allowance. As a member in a so-called safe seat, I see this increase as vital for me and my constituents. They are not going to have second-best treatment. It will allow me to fulfil one of the roles that I think important-that is, providing as much useful information to them and keeping them informed of a whole variety of things as best I can. It is something that I have done previously. I will continue to do it and this increase will allow me to do it even better. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes remaining I would like to respond to some of the other things that have been said. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) tried to express some concern about the national debt. He did not give the source of that debt. More than 60 per cent of the national debt comes from private enterprise. That has been the really significant increase. The other area of debt is State governments and statutory authorities. The smallest component is the Commonwealth Government. Our proportion of debt is quite small and is rapidly diminishing. It is diminishing because we are doing something that the so-called conservative, born-to-rule economic experts were never able to do-that is, to have surpluses that are being put towards paying off our part of that debt that the honourable member for Cowper talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) talked about the living standards of ordinary people and the burden of taxation. One needs to repeat that, in terms of personal income tax scales applying today in Australia, we should look at what the Opposition left us with. It left us with personal rates, particularly the 60c rates, which were not being paid by those who were incurring them. If we take those rates that Mr Howard had when he was the Treasurer in the last outgoing conservative Government and index them to today, we would be paying more than what the Labor Government and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have set in terms of personal income tax. The Opposition does not mention the way that we have cleaned up the tax system and made it much fairer. No longer are we subsidising anyone's free lunches, as we so frequently did. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talked about children and families. It is quite true to say that the working men and women of Australia, by accepting restraint-restraint not exhibited by the pilots-have made an enormous contribution to Australia and have created so many jobs. We have a low unemployment rate of 6 per cent, a great source of pride in this part of the House. We want to get that rate down. We want to create more jobs. That is the way we believe we need to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that we have done, which no other government has done, is to index family allowances and supplements. No longer will such important assistance to the poorer people in our community erode over time, because this Labor Government has shown its commitment to giving money not to the millionaires, not to those who can afford it, but to those who are really most in need. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Appropriation Bill. I repeat that I applaud the Budget that has been brought down successfully by the Treasurer-it is his seventh Budget-in difficult circumstances. He is making a tremendous contribution to the economic recovery of Australia and is certainly providing a sound future for all young Australians. </PARA>

In the limited time available-I am sorry that I have only 10 minutes in which to speak because I would have liked to say many things about the Budget-I will speak about the contents of the Budget and then about the statement of Moody's Investors Service Inc., which I regard as significant. The Trade Practices Commission is within my area of responsibility as shadow Minister for business, privatisation and consumer affairs. In the Budget the Trade Practices Commission received a princely $700,000 increase in its total expenditure for the coming year. The Trade Practices Commission is probably the most important commission in commerce in Australia. We have stated quite clearly in our policy that the Trade Practices Commission will play a significant role in ensuring competition in the marketplace. It is very important in the privatisation program. The Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission has said that the extra $700,000 just will not allow the Commission to do its job. In a nation such as ours nothing is more important than ensuring competition. I deplore what the Government has managed to come up with in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Securities Commission (ASC) proposal is also within my area of responsibility. In the ASC earlier this year there was a new grab for power by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), without a referendum being held. A series of Bills seeking to transfer corporate power in Australia from the cooperative scheme to the Federal Parliament were introduced. For years the Labor Party has been trying to get its hands on corporate powers but it has had no justification for doing so, except that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), in its plan for the future of Australia, has said, `We want to get control of the corporate powers so we can place trade unionists on boards of companies in this nation and expose all sorts of things'. We would like to expose a few things in the ACTU and look at the management of some of those trade unions. That would be more to the point. That is the place to go to see some of the rorts that go on in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Securities Commission Bill came before the House and now a sleazy deal is going on to try to make Victoria the principal place for the Commission's operations. Mr Cain said, `If you put the Commission in Victoria, we'll give you our whole corporate division. But you have to take the lot-all the employees and their superannuation'. The Attorney-General is not too sure about that because he knows in his own heart that the Commission's operations should go to Sydney. And so the argy-bargy goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recording the fact that currently the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) is battling on with the $3.5m which it received from the Commonwealth Government last year. That amount was matched by the States, so it received a total of $7m. In this Budget-the new body has not even been set up; it will not start till 1 July next year-$15.7m has been allocated for this year alone, which is double what the NCSC operates on. What will happen the following year with this great efficient operation? It will be allocated $65m. That is not bad, is it?-going from $7m to $65m in 18 months. Really and truly, what sort of a caper does the Government think it is on about? It is a complete rort. It is just grabbing the power, pumping the money in and making all Australian companies complete new forms. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know as well as I do that the affairs of State governments, including the Western Australian Government, will not be served by this measure. Even you attested to that. As my time is limited I will not go into that matter. I will turn to an issue which I am sure is at the heart of the concern of the Minister for Administrative Services, who is at the table, and that is asset sales. The Minister is a great privatiser! He knows all about selling things: he loves to sell things!</PARA>

The Opposition's policy on privatisation is quite clear. It is well known and articulated and it is in print. We will deliver. The people of Australia want to see efficiency, competition and employees having the right to own shares in the equity process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say that we would. It is not in our first three-year program. However, we will sell Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) also wants to sell them. However, the Minister and the Labor Party do not want him to do so. Most of all, the ACTU says that the Government must not sell them. It does not matter what goes on about Telecom Australia. What goes on in the Labor Party is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) want to sell Telecom but they do not have the guts to do so because their Party will not be in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will deliver to Australia the competitiveness which is necessary for our economy. We will not call upon taxpayers to put up the billions of dollars that ought to be put into Australian Airlines, Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, Australia Post and so on. We are determined that those bodies should stand on their own feet and be competitive. But the Government is not; it is running for cover. So much for what is in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I will turn quickly to another matter which fascinated me enormously, and that is Moody's press release. I have not seen a more condemning statement on Australian economic policy in years. It was quite fantastic. Before quoting from the statement I will repeat the Treasurer's comments. That great collector of watches and clocks, who still copped a living away from home allowance, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Moody's judgment is ill-founded and vindicates the Government's decision to put Australia's reputation and independence above that of a New York company. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to downgrade Moody's a trifle by saying that it had made an `incompetent judgment'. He then went on to say that it was a `lightweight and illogical judgment'. That is not bad. After all, in 1986 Moody's was joined in this by the other world known rating agency, Standard and Poor's. Moody's and Standard and Poor's are the two greatest and best known rating agencies in the world. Everyone in the commercial world is judged by them at some stage or other. The effects of their most recent efforts will not be felt just by government. It seems to be taken by the Treasurer that he is the only one offended. We cannot possibly offend the Treasurer because he is above offending, or so he thinks. Other people were offended by Moody's downgrading, helped by the Treasurer's ill-judgment. If he goes around abusing these people and refusing to allow them access to the Department of the Treasury and such nonsense, what does he expect to get, a blue ribbon? That would be quite ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> The organisations which will be affected are the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Government's merchant banks part of which it intends to try to sell on the market in the near future-it is well underwritten-the Australian Resources Development Bank, the Australian Wheat Board, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the National Australia Bank, National Mutual, the Westpac Banking Corporation, the Queensland Treasury Corporation and the State Bank of New South Wales. Those are just a few of the organisations involved in the downgrading. As a result of Australia's credit rating being downgraded the overseas investments of those corporations will be affected. It is worth quoting the reason Moody's took this action because it will enlighten a few people as to what is going on. Moody's press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The factors that Moody's considers crucial to its rating action include the following: (1) the government's inability to control excessive domestic demand growth-(2) insufficient progress in generating additional export-earning capacity and in restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains--and (3) the continued slow pace of structural adjustment, which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign-currency debt. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all very straightforward. It is no wonder that Moody's is concerned. What Moody's is saying is that if there is a downturn in commodity prices-Australia's balance of payments is very dependent on commodity prices-quite clearly, the exchange rate will be at risk. If the exchange rate is at risk those who hold Australian dollar investments will suffer a substantial loss. </PARA>
<PARA> The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the current Labor government has been unable to rein in domestic demand in an overheated economy, despite the opportunities provided by the recent upswing in the business cycle-</PARA>
<PARA>it was a very significant upswing indeed-</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth government has achieved a growing fiscal surplus on its own account . . . but political and social factors have prevented the application of a total policy mix that is sufficiently rigorous to balance the external accounts. The government has relied primarily on a tight monetary policy, which has bolstered the Australian dollar, thereby stimulating imports and discouraging exports. </PARA>
<PARA>In a nutshell, those are precisely the problems. We were going to have, in the third Labor term, great structural reforms, but that became too hard. The Minister knows full well that, where he comes from, they are not going to have structural reforms on the waterfront. There are too many perks and lurks. The ACTU says `No, thank you', so suddenly that great third term reform goes out the window. That is recorded in Moody's judgment of Australia, according to its press release, and until that matter is addressed it will continue to be recorded in our balance of payments problems. It is a great pity that the Government has drawn away from it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, may I quote from a well known adviser to the Government, Professor Hughes:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response to the current situation of high demand and inflation coupled with labour shortages and a growth of imports that has far outstripped that of exports has been to continually tighten monetary policy. Interest rates have been driven up in an attempt to slow domestic demand and import growth. This has created serious problems for exporters, both through increased costs and reduced prices as the exchange rate rose and eroded competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Do we need to go any further into any analysis of the balance of payments problems in Australia and the total lack of government response to a critical position than those few comments?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I take the opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment. I know that you are going to be very impartial and fair in your judgments on the conduct of members in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once again the Commonwealth Government has achieved a Budget surplus. On this occasion it is a record $9,122m compared with $5,899m in 1988-89. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has pointed out, the surplus will be more than enough to offset the borrowings by all State and local governments in Australia. The Government must be congratulated on the decision to use the entire surplus to continue repaying our overseas debt. Another aspect of the Budget which has my strong support is the announcement of the retirement incomes policy. Before I go on to talk about that I would like to say a little more about Moody's Investors Service Inc. in view of the fact that the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has found it necessary to give it such strong support. </PARA>
<PARA> In circumstances of strong economic stability and responsibility, it is incomprehensible to me that the international credit rating agency Moody's should once again have downgraded Australia's long term credit rating. I think it is now down to AA2. I find it very surprising that the honourable member for Ryan had to quote examples to explain away why this discredited international agency has chosen to downgrade Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only the Treasurer but many other people too. Australia's credit rating had already been reduced to the second rating of AA1 in 1986 and the new third rating means that it will be more difficult for Australia to borrow overseas at reasonable rates of interest. I do not know why the honourable member for Ryan is so pleased about this. It is typical of the Opposition. It is always pleased at anything that downgrades Australia's economic opportunities. It is particularly difficult to understand why the downgrading has occurred at a time when Australia is repaying government overseas debt and distinguished economists overseas have been congratulatory of the Australian Government's fiscal and monetary policies. The problem is, of course, that the big increase in our foreign debt has been through the activities of the corporate sector, which has not necessarily borrowed on the basis of productive capacity but rather on speculative ventures of one sort of another. I notice that the honourable member for Ryan is not prepared to talk about those things. However, that is not what I want to talk about; the honourable member for Ryan prompted me to make some comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said before, the announcement of the retirement incomes policy is an important aspect of the Budget. Some 11 per cent of the Australian population is now over the age of 65 years and by the year 2021 it is estimated that that figure will have increased to around 18 per cent. At that time about 3.9 million Australians will be aged 65-including, I might add, myself and perhaps most of my fellow parliamentarians, although I will probably get there a bit earlier than most. When I first entered the Federal Parliament in 1980 I was most impressed by the retirement income policies which the Whitlam Labor Government intended to introduce in 1975. Unfortunately, as we all know, there was a coup by the then Governor-General and as a result the Whitlam Government lost office. The Fraser Liberal-National Party Government which followed completely rejected any idea of adopting the Whitlam scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is to be commended for its efforts to maintain and improve the age pension. We have at last kept our promise that the age pension will be increased to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The next goal is to reach 30 per cent of average weekly earnings, but in the meantime the Government is providing better opportunities and incentives for people to add to their pensions with a self-generated retirement income. We must not forget that before the Hawke Labor Government gained office in 1983, the majority of the work force were not members of superannuation schemes. In addition, there was a strong tax incentive for retired workers to take superannuation benefits in the form of lump sums, and in that way they defeated the whole purpose of superannuation in providing a retirement income. Another problem was the lack of portability. The retirement income policy initiative of the Federal Labor Government since 1983 has progressively overcome these problems. Most importantly, the Federal Government has encouraged the growth of superannuation as an established part of the wages policy of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to have quoted from an excellent booklet entitled `Better Incomes-Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century', copies of which are available from my electorate office in Boronia for my constituents who might be either reading this speech or listening to it. I have been cut back to a very short time and so will not be able to read that quote, but it appears on page 6. It is very important and I hope that people will have an opportunity to read it. As the booklet indicates, the overall result of the Federal Government's commitment to improving superannuation has been the extension of the benefits of superannuation to a much larger proportion of the work force than ever before. It is particularly gratifying to me to note in the Budget that as part of the wages system for 1991 the Government is giving consideration to the gradual introduction of a further 3 per cent award for occupational superannuation. This is in addition to the 3 per cent award which was introduced following the 1986 wages case and involves employer contributions and superannuation for the self-employed and those who may not get the 3 per cent award. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I should like to raise concerns the funding provided in the Budget for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I consider that it is most unfortunate that as a Government once again we find ourselves embroiled with the ABC in yet another funding row. It is also unfortunate that some Ministers have given and are continuing to give the impression that they find the ABC a pain in the neck and an organisation which is not worth supporting. I would like to believe that that is not really the truth, but that certainly is how it is perceived by some people in the community. My own view is that the ABC is an efficient, entertaining, enlivening institution which helps to make Australia one of the foremost democracies in the world. As a democracy there is no doubt that Australia has some shortcomings, as the disadvantaged and the powerless in our community would testify. One thing is certain: the ABC does its best to improve the cultural, intellectual and political life of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the honourable member for Fraser agrees with that view because he has said so in the House before. In a recent article in the Sunday Herald the well-known science broadcaster, Robyn Williams, voiced his concerns about the attacks on the ABC. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian both attacked the ABC with headlines such as `Time for the ABC to start earning a living'. That appeared in the Australian. It took the Age to defend the ABC by pointing out that it needed financial independence, with the comment that it should not be necessary to remind Australians of the symbolic significance, institutional importance and cultural value of a national and independent broadcasting system. As reported in the Sunday Herald, Robyn Williams said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Well, if they don't want an ABC, let them say so. If they want us to dismantle sections of our services, let them be named. If they want us to accept advertising let them legislate for us. What won't work is continually having the floor fall away every few months as supposedly secure budgets collapse. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> As ABC director John Cleary pointed out in a letter to The Australian on Thursday, our service has never been cheaper and, I would add, never better. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australians really would prefer their current affairs programs presented exclusively by posturing millionaires (sober or otherwise) let them say so. If they really do believe that the same criteria for performance that apply to making hamburgers should apply to national broadcasting-let us know now. The time really has come. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not have said that as well as Robyn Williams. He is a distinguished broadcaster and I think we have to be concerned when he has that sort of thing to say. Only about a week before that he said in an interview on the radio that hundreds of professional broadcasters in the ABC are wondering whether it is worthwhile putting in their effort. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are lean, fast and very efficient and now is the time to build our confidence. The trouble is that the conservatives see us as Pinkos and part of some left wing plot and the ALP see us as just sitting here discussing ballet and pot plants. </PARA>
<PARA>Such remarks would be comic if they were not so horribly true. The general feeling amongst ABC staff is one of cynicism tinged with despair and a strong suspicion, as Robyn Williams's previous comments indicated, that the Government is attempting by means of financial stringencies to force the ABC into commercial sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA> I must admit that I share their concerns. Whilst the ABC board continues to reject advertising and commercial sponsorship, the Managing Director for the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) has not been, I have to say, so reticent. In a recent speech published in Ethnic Spotlight Mr Brian Johns supported such views. I had hoped to quote him but time is getting away from me. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to note that in the same June issue of Ethnic Spotlight, which is the newsletter of the Federation of Ethnics Communities Councils of Australia, an article completely refuted the idea that Mr Brian Johns had floated that the SBS should get into commercial sponsorship. Of course it should not get into commercial sponsorship. At least the ABC board has made it very clear that it will not do so and that it will not get into advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my speech I congratulate Radio Australia, which will shortly reach its fiftieth anniversary. On Tuesday, 20 September 1939, the service in English began with the name `Australia Calling'. This was transmitted to all Australian military personnel in Asia during the war. As the war progressed programs were broadcast in Japanese, Thai, Indonesian and Mandarin. I have a guest listening up in the Gallery. He is an American ex-serviceman and I hope that he too was able to hear this broadcast. Having conveyed my congratulations to Radio Australia I hope that the Government will be able to ensure that it has sufficiently powerful transmitters to broadcast to mainland China. Some of my constituents have complained to me that their Chinese friends are finding it difficult to pick up the programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the Budget I hope the Government will take into account the concerns I have expressed with regard to the funding of the ABC and SBS. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite what was stated by the speaker who preceded me, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), I want to say at the outset that a nation with a foreign debt of $108 billion is desperately ill. When further investigation reveals that in about seven years that debt has doubled, doubled again and increased about $20 billion above that again we will see that this disease is rampantly moving to destroy the economy totally. A government which presides over a record like that can only be judged to be thoroughly incompetent and totally unable to manage the national economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is even more reprehensible when the Government denies that we have problems and says that its policies are correct and are beginning to bite, and yet the reality is that the debt is still accelerating. Not all the photographs of the smiling Treasurer (Mr Keating) handing over cheques overseas, allegedly paying off our debt, can cloud the reality of that scenario. It would be bad enough if the Government were willing to accept some small culpability but even when Moody's Investors Service Inc., for the second time in a very short period, has further downgraded our credit rating the Government ignores the disease and attacks the doctor. It seems that we can anticipate a further downgrading of our credit rating almost annually, and this Government blusters and claims that all is well. After all, Moody's is an accredited agency recognised and respected worldwide, and its decision reflects the current judgment of all world authorities on the state of our economy. Others followed them last time and others will follow them this time.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, if that does not reveal a sick nation under an incompetent government, let us consider further these facts. The Government has staked all, its entire reputation, on its boast that it has allegedly created a multiplicity of jobs and reduced unemployment. We have heard Government speakers desperately and monotonously repeating this catechism continually throughout this debate. But the Budget Papers themselves contain a plain admission that the monetary and fiscal policies projected will cause unemployment to rise. Further, the Government's totally inept handling of the pilots issue will lead to many thousands more jobs collapsing in the tourist industry and the collapse of many businesses and that is without the accelerator effect in the wider business community where more jobs will be lost. So Labor's mournful song will not be sustainable for much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not all. By deliberate policy the Government has caused interest rates to reach fearsome dimensions. Housing interest rates have shattered completely the great Australian dream. No longer can young or old Australians look forward to owning their own homes. But, even worse, many are losing or being forced to sell their homes because they cannot service their loans any longer. Businesses are contracting-and the collapses will further accelerate because many cannot possibly continue under such awesome service charges. The Government cannot deny that. The Government talks about producing more, and yet by deliberate policy it is destroying all capacity to produce. </PARA>
<PARA> If that were not enough, Australia's inflation rate, which the Government has repeatedly boasted is on the way down, is rising and will continue to rise so that our competitiveness is being destroyed. Australia, a great trading nation, is being sabotaged savagely. </PARA>
<PARA> We could go on further with that depressing but very real scenario. No matter what economic barometer we employ, our nation is desperately ill-and it is getting worse no matter what yardstick we use. This Government has utterly failed and has proved completely incompetent. So we come to this Budget. This Budget indicates whether the Government has the capacity, the will or the gumption to address our ills. And what does it reveal? Having said last year that our foreign debt would fall, only to see it rapidly rise, the Government throws up its hands and admits that it will rise further. Having told us so positively that inflation would fall, and seeing it rise to almost double the projected figure, it now admits that it will be at least as high-in reality it will be higher-in the 12 months ahead. Having promised that interest rates would fall-remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) solemnly predicted that in Perth; he promised it-the Government now says they will have to remain very high well into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> What other judgment can one make? What can the world say other than that this Government has given in, that it is lost, that it is incompetent? The arrogance of the Government, the bombast of the Treasurer, the farrago of nonsense we get from Ministers in Question Time are simply further manifestations of the fact that the Government has nothing to say and has no idea at all what to do. The pitiful attempt to buy votes from the pensioners will also fail. The pensioners know that unless our economic illness is cured, they will be the first to suffer and they will suffer the greatest. What an awful mess this Government has created. </PARA>
<PARA> Now have a look at the wider spectrum. Our roads are falling to pieces. In a vast country like Australia, so dependent on road transport, the Government has reaped more and more in fuel excise and put less and less back into roads. This Government is doomed to defeat whenever the election comes around. Every home buyer, every small business and every motorist has had enough of them. The pharmacists are in despair and because of the parsimonious treatment and the false economy practised by this Government, many pharmacies will close. The community will suffer; that cannot be denied. What a paradox we have-the heaviest taxing government since the war, the most avaricious money grabbing government in our history and yet our roads are falling to pieces; pharmacies are being forced to close; veterans are being stripped of benefits so that the whole veteran community is up in arms; there is a desperate shortage of aged care, hostel and nursing home accommodation; and young people are being turned away because there are not enough places for them in our tertiary institutions. Surely there can be no plainer evidence that this Government's priorities are all wrong and it must go. We can be certain of one thing-it will be a very long time before the Australian Labor Party is ever again given access to the Treasury bench because memories are long and its economic mismanagement and vandalism will not soon be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Government still treats the people as being stupid. Whilst the tax take, direct and indirect, increases, whilst clawback destroys every reduction almost immediately, whilst inflation causes costs of living to soar and tax receipts to increase, it has the effrontery to try to dupe the Australian people by telling them that it has cut taxes. It has not even begun to give back some of the massive taxes that it has purloined over the years. Nor, surely, do they think the Australian people are so stupid that they do not realise how indexation of indirect taxes and excises is reaping in huge revenues. The Australian people will forgive much. They will forgive the discomfort and sacrifice they perceive to be necessary to get things right. They will cooperate with a government they judge to be honest, equitable and competent. However, the Australian people will not tolerate being treated as fools, misled by spurious promises and repeatedly fed totally unrealistic and specious forecasts. A government-and this Government is one such government-cannot ignore that; if it does it is riding for a fall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government dismisses every unfavourable assessment. It abuses every critic. It denigrates every economic authority which does not suit it and it shows an effrontery and an arrogance the like of which this nation has never seen before. I regret to say that that arrogance is also being exhibited through many of the departments and much of the bureaucracy. Unfortunately, I have to use this debate to illustrate yet another arrogant and inexplicable instance of Australian Taxation Office bureaucracy, of which I have first hand knowledge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member had better listen to this and he can tell me if he thinks it is justice. In the early 1980s the Tax Office raised an assessment on a partnership which wrongfully levied tax on what was clearly a capital and not an income transaction. Objections were raised. Years elapsed. The Tax Office just would not answer questions or respond to objections. The assessments, of course, in the meantime had to be paid. That is the usual arrogant and uncooperative behaviour that they mete out-no explanation, no answer, just demands. Finally, after about two years, there was an answer refusing the appeal. One of the partners immediately appealed to the Federal Court of Australia. The Federal Court quickly found clearly against the Tax Office. It upheld that appeal entirely and completely vindicated every representation that the taxpayers and I had been making for years. Furthermore, the Commissioner of Taxation, in writing, has agreed that the circumstances surrounding both the partners are identical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But let me tell the House what the Tax Office is doing. It has to accept that judgment in the case of the partner who appealed. For unavoidable reasons, and sad reasons, the other partners, whose appeals had been cursorily dismissed by the Tax Office, were not immediately able to appeal to the Federal Court and later they were told they were too late. They were prevented from appealing. So despite the fact that the court has found the assessment incorrect, has struck it out, despite the fact that the court has said that both partners are in identical situations, the Tax Office says they cannot do anything about it. No matter how wrong the assessment is, despite its having been struck out by the court, the other partners' assessments will not be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever there was an immoral decision, an unfair action, a sheltering behind the wording of the Income Tax Act, that is it. A taxpayer had to pay many, many thousands of dollars more than should have been the case. The court has agreed. One partner who appealed is relieved, the others are not. Yet the Tax Office expects respect, honesty and cooperation from taxpayers. All protests have been arrogantly and summarily dismissed. The Commissioner maintains that no matter how unfortunate the matter is, and despite the court's observation, he cannot do anything but grin and bear it and retain the taxes proven to be incorrectly levied. I cannot swallow that. I have respect for the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), and I hope that he will make sure that my remarks tonight are seen by the Tax Office. I believe that the Minister is concerned about injustices and I respect him for that. I cannot swallow the Tax Office's answer. I cannot believe that an obvious wrong cannot be rectified. I cannot accept that money which the Tax Office has wrongly levied can be retained. With all the discretion the Commissioner has and has demanded, I find that action unfair, unforgivable and unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not usually raise such matters in the House, but as every avenue of appeal has been closed and denied, this is now the only forum in which the matter can be exposed. Unfortunately, in all probability, this appeal too will be cursorily dismissed and the answer will be that our hands are tied. But I must make another endeavour to obtain justice and fairness for the family concerned. They are a particularly fine and compassionate family. They are very helpful to others; they would do anything for other people. Their only fault is that they have proved the Tax Office wrong. I suppose, however, it does assist the Government to obtain its so-called Budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look, in my final minute or two, at that so-called surplus. The Government is boasting about that surplus and claiming kudos. If it had been achieved by good economic management and curbing its spending, it would have earned that kudos. But it has not been. The surplus is an absolute fiddle. Company tax and provisional tax receipts have been brought forward into this financial year. They are being collected early. Other revenues were held over and brought back into this year from last year. Expenditure has been delayed, some for years-as long as, would you believe it, 1995? So although it figures in the Budget Speech, the IOUs are not yet redeemable. Additionally, increased taxation-and do not forget those hidden but savage indirect tax increases-brings in increased revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> If out of a fiddle like that a surplus cannot be produced, it would indeed be remarkable. I am encouraged by the determination of the coalition to restructure the taxation system and bring real sustainable cuts in our heavy taxation burden. That will restore some of the hope which has faded under this Government. It will restore some incentive and encouragement which this Government has largely destroyed, and finally it will encourage the saving and self-help which this Government has stifled. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to speak about employment and unemployment because I think there is no more important contribution that a government can make than to ensure the maximum number of employment opportunities for people in the community. Obviously, it is important that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to work. In that way the productivity of the community will be maximised. It is also essential that we recognise that there are few experiences more debilitating than the experience of unemployment. Unemployment involves, in a sense, people being told by the rest of the community that they do not want them to work. That is enormously psychologically as well as economically damaging to individuals. It causes a severe loss of confidence, it causes them to lose the capacity to work effectively, and it often leads to a breakdown of families, various forms of addiction, and other kinds of self-destructive activity. It is obviously essential for a responsible government to give top priority to employment creation. </PARA>
<PARA> When Labor came to government in 1983 the level of unemployment in the community was 10.2 per cent. That was one of the principal issues that the Australian Labor Party had in mind when the policies for the 1983 election were being prepared. Before that election the Party prepared what was called a national recovery and reconstruction plan. I had the pleasure of doing the first draft of that proposal. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This program for the recovery and reconstruction of the Australian economy has the dual aims of restoring economic growth and the simultaneous reduction of inflation and unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The plan made this very bold claim:</PARA>
<PARA>By the third year in government Labor would aim to restore economic growth to five per cent and to create at least 500,000 additional jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>At the time, people said that that was foolish, that it was extremely over-optimistic, that there was no way that a Labor government could achieve that goal. In fact, not only did we achieve it; we over-achieved it. After 6 1/2 years in government Labor has created 1.5 million jobs-three times the amount promised for the first three years. In fact, Labor has done more than 50 per cent better than the promise it made 6 1/2 years ago. Employment between April 1983 and July 1989-the most recent figures that are available-has increased by 24 per cent, which represents 1.5 million jobs. That growth has occurred in both full time and part time work and among males and females. Full time jobs make up two-thirds of the increase and employment among females makes up 56 per cent of the increase. That is a very important development and a very desirable pattern of employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> During the previous year, 1988-89, employment rose by 5 per cent or 370,000 jobs-quite a remarkable increase. Again, that increase was spread among males and females and full time and part time work. The result, in terms of the reduction in unemployment, is that between April 1983 and July 1989 the number of unemployed people fell by 200,000. There are now 200,000 fewer people unemployed than there were when Labor won government. That is a decrease of 28 per cent. Again, both male and female full time and part time workers have benefited and the unemployment rate has come down by 4 per cent exactly, from 10.1 per cent in April 1983 to 6.1 per cent now. That is an enormous achievement. It is a really quite remarkable achievement, particularly at a time when the participation rate, that is, the proportion of the adult population of working age who are in the work force, has gone up from 67.6 per cent to 63.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an enormous increase in the proportion of the adult population of working age who are in the work force. But despite that increase, unemployment is still falling. So that is really quite remarkable. Of course that has been associated with a reduction in the duration of unemployment and also with an improvement in the teenage level of unemployment. Between April 1983 and July 1989 teenage full time employment increased by 33,000. Now that does not sound an enormous number and it is not an enormous number but it reverses a decline which had been under way in the previous 10 years when the number of teenagers who were in full time employment had been steadily falling. So it is really quite a remarkable change in trend. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the improvement in employment amongst teenagers is also because an increased proportion of teenagers has been staying on at school and that has contributed to an even greater reduction in unemployment amongst teenagers. The retention rate for people beginning school and completing year 12 has gone up nationally from 36 per cent to 58 per cent. That is an enormously important development not only in terms of the benefit to people who would otherwise be unemployed, but also because of the benefit to the level of education of the whole work force. </PARA>
<PARA> These improvements in the labour market have been spread through all States. I note that, for example, in Victoria the level of unemployment is now down to 4.6 per cent which is a great affirmation not only of national policies but also of State policies in Victoria. In my own Territory, the Australian Capital Territory, the unemployment rate is 5.6 per cent-significantly below the national average still-and, in the last year, employment here continued to grow; it grew last year by 5.8 per cent. So those are remarkable achievements.</PARA>
<PARA> Now the question is: why did that occur? Of course in large part it occurred because of the accord. It is true that it also was assisted by the benefits to the whole economy from the whole phase of economic growth that has been occurring in the Western world and in East Asia, but without the accord this improvement in employment could not possibly have been as substantial. The accord, which was promised by Labor when it was contesting the March 1983 election campaign, was implemented as soon as Labor won government, and it is a comprehensive, voluntary and equitable prices and incomes policy. It has worked remarkably well, not only because it has assisted in reducing unemployment and increasing employment, but it has done that partly because there has been a substantial decline in real unit labour costs. These really have not been remarked on but they are shown in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1982-83-the year in which Labor won government-and 1988-89, which was last year, there was a 12.7 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs. That is partly a reflection of improvements in productivity. It is also partly a reflection of slower growth in wages than some people would like to see-than I would like to see myself, I must say. Nevertheless, it has been one of the key factors in ensuring that there has been an encouragement to employers to continue to employ new workers. That reduction in real unit labour costs has also been associated with a remarkable increase in investment. For the 15 years before 1984, investment in the private sector grew by an average rate of 2.2 per cent a year. For the last five years it has been five times higher; it has grown by 10.8 per cent in each of those years. That is an extraordinary reversal in trend and it is absolutely fundamental to a long term improvement in Australia's growth rates. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, I would like to note that there is still some way to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is certainly true and exactly what I want to come to. We still have 6.1 per cent unemployment. As everyone in the Government recognises, that is still unsatisfactory. We are proud of the achievement, but we have further to go. It is important to note that that improvement is expected to continue in the next financial year. Despite the remarks by the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Adermann), who spoke previously, the Budget Papers show a forecast improvement in employment of 2 1/4 per cent in 1989-90. So, there will be a continuation of the improvement in employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Essential to maintaining the growth in employment and the decline in unemployment is the fact that the accord must be maintained and that is why it is so essential that the Government is firm about the pilots strike. It is important to keep the exchange rate low to contribute to correcting the current account as quickly as possible. We need to minimise interest rates-everyone wants to get them down-and it is important that they come down as quickly as possible so as to encourage new investment. We must maximise our growth of exports and our import replacement-the whole area of industry policy is contributing to that. It is also important that we maximise our expenditure on research in the manufacturing sector and other sectors which will contribute to improvement in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important also that we restore growth in public investment as soon as possible. Private investment has gone up rapidly, but we must move as quickly as we possibly can to increase public investment again because national infrastructure is essential to the growth of national productivity. If it is allowed to decline, it will be very costly to maintain or very costly to renew. We must restore public investment as quickly as possible and we must build up as fast as we can desperately needed public programs. There need to be improvements in hospitals, public housing, education and so on. Finally, we must spend more as soon as we can on employment training programs because they are essential to improving the productivity of the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, I will mention some new figures that have come out in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Employment Outlook which was published just under a month ago. This publication shows figures for expenditure on training programs in all OECD member countries as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), as a percentage of national income. I think there is scope for increasing Australian expenditure on training programs. In 1988 we were spending 0.05 per cent of our GDP on labour market training programs for adults. That is really quite a small amount of money. Germany, which is commonly regarded as doing particularly well in this area, spent 0.23 per cent of GDP; that is six times as high a proportion of its GDP. The same sorts of trends can be found in most European countries. For example, Sweden spends 0.51 per cent of GDP on adult training programs. I think there is great scope for us to develop the quality and the breadth of our training programs so that the skills of our labour force are improved and that, too, will contribute to continued employment growth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is regrettable that in a debate on the Budget we are asked to contain our remarks to some 10 minutes when we are really discussing our nation's future and ought to be able to contribute in a significant way. The second point I want to make is that it is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). He is a thoughtful contributor. I do not agree with a lot of what he had to say, but at least he puts his argument cogently and well. Regrettably, not all government members see things in the same way, and I will offer comments on that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply draw attention to the comments of the honourable member for Fraser. I do not think members on this side of the House, particularly in the area of employment, argue that there has not been some marginal improvement in that particular indicator during this Government's tenure. Nor do I argue that there has not been a fall in real unit labour costs as part of the accord. But that is not the question. The question is: is the pace of change that is taking place in Australia fast enough to produce the sorts of gains that are necessary to ensure that this nation retains its place in a competitive world? The real problem that we face is that on the fundamental questions the pace of adjustment is not taking place quickly enough under the policies pursued by this Government, or the Budget which has been presented to the Parliament and which we are discussing now. Anybody who mounts a reasonable argument in a critical way in relation to the Budget finds that he suffers from what I call the `shoot the messenger' syndrome. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is not here at the moment, but that is the technique which he personifies. We have seen it in relation to one major critic, the international ratings agency, Moody's Investors Service Inc., I suspect mainly for Australian consumption. I do not believe that what the Treasurer has had to say will have any significant impact upon that agency's international reputation or the extent to which those who are guided by its advice will view Australia. There used to be a time when we heard comments which suggested that some other people in the world believed the propaganda that we hear in Australia that we presently have, in this Parliament, the world's greatest Treasurer, but I am afraid that is not the view abroad. From all that I hear, we are fast reaching the stage where we are seen to be a laughing stock internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that I characterise this Budget in another way. It is one of a large number of Budgets which constitute a lost opportunity for Australia. That is really what it is all about. The Budget was meant to impress the international community by having a large surplus on the Government's own account. The Treasurer's statement about the level of that surplus was intended to forestall a good deal of the criticism that was mounting about the size of the country's overall deficit on its account. The Treasurer frequently tries to blur the distinction. He would have us believe that because the Government has a surplus on its account, we are in some way able to address the fundamental question which this nation faces at this time, and that is the size of the country's debt-the debt that is owed by every one of us. It is debt not yet borrowed necessarily by the Commonwealth Government but debt that has been forced onto State governments and local governments, and accumulated by large companies and others in Australia in the belief that debt is a more appropriate way to raise funds for corporate expansion in Australia than the raising of capital or equity participation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget does not seek to address the underlying problems that that situation poses for Australia. In statements that have been made by the Opposition shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the Opposition clearly seeks to address that problem. But the urgency of the problem also fails to be understood. I often explain to people when I try to put economics in simple terms that looking at a nation that is living beyond its means is no different from looking at a family living beyond its means. If a family is to get out of its difficulties when it is living beyond its means it either cuts its cloth, that is, it consumes less and spends less or it increases its income. In the time that it takes to put its affairs in order it may want to borrow some money or it might sell some of its assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The short term remedies that this country has been adopting until now have been to sell some of its assets-we talk about that in terms of foreign investment and to borrow money extensively from abroad, and there is a good deal of concern about that. We are hoping to see a turnaround of our nation's own income; in other words, that we will be able to get our income up. But the real problem we face is that while this country has been spending in the order of $1 billion or more each month more than it is able to obtain from exports of its own products, our situation has become progressively worse. In announcements yesterday we found that our net indebtedness as a nation has reached a figure of $108 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The real concern we face is that that situation is not changing. I looked at a small publication produced by the Civic Advance Bank Ltd. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has left us, but he could well have read this publication. The most worrying concern is the statement that I would like to quote because I am aware of so many others which offer this advice. The statement is this:</PARA>
<PARA> The upturn in commodity prices since 1987 has underwritten the strength of the $A (recognised as a `commodity currency'). But the rise in commodity prices appears to have run its course-wool prices have recently tumbled following, among other things, the withdrawal of China as a buyer over the past few months. More generally, commodity prices can be expected to fall simply because they have not been higher for several years now, and suppliers have stepped up production to take advantage of those prices. (For example, this year's wool clip is expected to be a bumper, because of the number of farmers who have switched to wool from grain crops.)</PARA>
<PARA> The net result of that combination of factors-the high level of current account deficit, rises in interest rates through 1988-89 (impacting with a lag), plus prospective falls in commodity prices (impacting immediately on the $A value of the debt)-is that the net income deficit will continue to grow strongly both this financial year and next. </PARA>
<PARA>That must send a shiver down the back of every thinking Australian. The problem is that the steps taken by this Government in this Budget do not address the fundamental problem that this country has as a country that is spending beyond its means. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen creative accounting on the Government's part. My colleague the honourable member for Wentworth pointed this out very clearly in his press statements after the Budget. We saw the Government put up a high surplus on its own account, organised largely because it brought forward certain tax collections into this year; we have seen the proceeds of certain sales brought to account this year rather than last year when they were to be taken; and we have seen profits of the Reserve Bank of Australia held over rather than being brought to account last year and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> These are important questions that need to be addressed. In terms of the syndrome that I described earlier-the shoot the messenger syndrome-why is the Treasurer so anxious to shoot the international ratings agency, Moody's? It is because that agency made some very simple points about the Australian debt situation which I have addressed tonight. It has made those statements in the context of the decisions that ought to be taken by the Government in this Budget and to deal with this situation that we face. Moody's press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> The factors that Moody's considers crucial to its rating include the following: (1) The government's inability to control excessive domestic demand growth-- (2) insufficient progress in generating additional export-earning capacity and in restructuring industry to achieve productive gains-- and (3) the continued slow pace of structural adjustment, which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign-currency debt. </PARA>

While the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs may want to try to pass the buck in the same way as the Treasurer does, the fact of the matter is that these questions need to be addressed now. Here is another lost opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to conclude by referring to other points in the press release. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The agency also pointed out that the downgrade reflects several other considerations. The first is the persistence of structural weaknesses embedded in Australia's domestic and international position, such as intransigent rigidities in the local labor market and transport markets. These constrain international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, the current Labour government has been unable to rein in current domestic demand in an overheated economy, despite the opportunities provided by the recent upswing in the business cycle. The Commonwealth government has achieved a growing fiscal surplus on its own account, Moody's noted, but political and social factors have prevented the application of a total policy mix that is sufficiently rigorous to balance the external account. The government has relied primarily on a tight monetary policy, which has bolstered the Australian dollar thereby, stimulating imports and discouraging exports. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that the Government in attempting to deal with the situation has relied on one weapon in its armory: that is called monetary policy. That is a pseudonym to describe high interest rates. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bilney" NAMEID="RE4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the Government does not have a fiscal policy that is tight enough. Let me continue in relation to that monetary policy. Even the Government's adviser, the Reserve Bank of Australia, had some comments to make about it. While the Treasurer may be content to try to shoot Moody's, I have not heard from him a detailed commentary on what the Reserve Bank had to say. Implicit in the Reserve Bank's annual report are some of the most damaging comments that could ever be offered about a government's Budget. On page 15 of its report, the Reserve Bank makes it clear in quite unambiguous terms that the Government, which has been setting the pace in terms of interest rate policy for political reasons, sought to slacken off in the early months of 1987. The bank uses these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . As mentioned above, monetary policy is sometimes called `the balancing factor', suggesting some degree of possible trade-offs with other elements of the policy mix. In the early months of 1987, it was judged that fiscal tightening and wage moderation presented the opportunity to lift some of the burden from monetary policy. In the event, the exuberance of markets led to an easing in monetary conditions before the other policies had taken up the slack. In normal circumstances, the effects of this market anticipation might not have been troublesome. However, it coincided with an unforeseen resurgence in demand world-wide and in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA>The bank concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>The experience illustrates a need for great caution in adjusting monetary policy in response to decisions on, rather than the results of, other policies. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Reserve Bank is really saying is that the Government, for political reasons, slackened off in relation to monetary policy at a time when it thought its policies were going to achieve the objective, rather than looking at results. What the bank is saying is that if one views the Government's decisions in political terms the Government makes judgments which are not based upon the interests of the Australian people but upon the way in which the Government perceives may assist it. Let me say to honourable members opposite that I do not believe that their management of these issues on this occasion will bring any rewards for the Government whatsoever. This Budget is another lost opportunity; it is falling apart already before our very eyes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), characterised the Budget in a certain way. I would prefer to characterise it in a rather different way. It is a no gimmicks, no frills, very honest, straightforward Budget. It is a `what you see is what you get' Budget. It is a Budget which consolidates and carries forward the gains that we have made over the past six years in a variety of fields, for example, in the field of structural economic reform and in the field of employment, which the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who has just left the chamber, referred to at some length and in terms with which I fully agree. In particular, it is a compassionate Budget. The gains that we have made in social justice and in bringing about equity in this society are carried forward in this Budget in ways with which I fully agree and which, I believe, will benefit the least advantaged in our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition flounders when it tries to attack this Budget, because it is such an honest, straightforward, compassionate document and one which I know will be well received, in particular, in the electorate which I have the honour to represent. The kinds of things that it seeks to ensure-job security, more affordable child care, greater protection for our environment, better security for people who are retired or who are planning their retirement, better community facilities and better sporting facilities-are the kinds of things which electors want to see the Federal Government providing and which this Government, through this Budget, is providing. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I address my remarks to those aspects, I want to concentrate on the macro-economic background against which the Budget is framed because, after all, the great responsibility of the Federal Government is to manage the macro-economy. We have to recognise that our policies for promoting growth in the economy have been too successful. Over the last year or so the economy has shown signs of considerable overheating. It is necessary to adopt a macro-economic strategy to bring the level of growth back to one which is more sustainable. If one looks at the forecasts which are contained in the Budget Papers, one will see that, last year, gross national expenditure rose by 7.7 per cent, whereas gross domestic product-output-rose by only 3.3 per cent. The disparity between what we spent and what we produced meant that our imports rose at an unsustainable level, by something like 25 per cent. That led to difficulties with our current account. So the Budget does need to address that situation. It does so explicitly, which will, I believe, lead to the kind of soft landing for the economy which is an important objective to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> Some other indicators were running at unsustainable levels as well. Business investment last year was 15.5 per cent and is forecast in the year to come to be 6 per cent. Spending, as I said, went from 7.7 per cent down to 2 per cent. This is the only responsible policy to follow. When I hear some of the gimmicks and quick fixes which are advocated by some of our opponents-and not just in the coalition parties-I know that that is the primrose path which will lead to disaster for this country and this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to say that this Budget puts in place a strategy which will lead to lower interest rates. The three key elements of the Budget which establish that framework are; first of all, the increase in the surplus to a record $9.1 billion, which of course helps build public savings; secondly, the slow-down in spending, to which I referred earlier; and, thirdly, a gradual improvement through the year in our balance of payments. It is perfectly true that the balance of payments figure will not be turned around rapidly, but as the year goes on, I believe, we will see quite a rapid improvement in it. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the beginning that I wanted to concentrate on certain things which were important to those people whom I represent. First of all, I want to turn to some items within the community services and health portfolio. Foremost amongst those is the further progress made in this Budget towards bringing about more affordable and more widely available child-care. We have already announced our strategy for doubling the number of child-care places provided in Australia by the Government, and this year the initiatives in the Budget focus on affordability and equity. In particular, I was very pleased to see the liberalisation of the fee relief provisions for low income families. Part of that involves the maximum fee up to which the Government is prepared to pay fee relief in child-care centres, which goes up from $90 a week to $92.50 a week. For family day-care schemes, which, I might add, are extremely popular, the figure goes from $65 a week to $68 a week. The income limits for which one is eligible for maximum government benefit for centre-based care go up by $25 so that a family with one child and with a gross weekly income of up to $280 a week will now receive maximum benefit. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely true. I might add that in my electorate, I believe, there are more government-provided child-care centres than in any other electorate in Australia. There are seven. I have to say in reply to the Minister's remark that I am the envy of a number of my colleagues because of the number of child-care centres which a wise and far-seeing government has built in my electorate. One other thing I should mention is that operational subsidies for child-care centres and family day-care and occasional care schemes are also going to be increased as a result of the initiatives taken in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am on the portfolio of community services and health, another aspect which I was particularly pleased to see was the $40m package announced in the Budget to improve women's health. That comprises $33.7m for a new four-year national women's health program in which the States are to share the costs, a $6.5m program to help the State governments establish alternative birthing services, and a program of which I particularly approve, an additional $1.2m over two years to extend breast cancer and cervical screening services-an extremely important reform. These changes arose out of a massive consultation program in which over one million Australian women took part and it is they whose inputs have seen this program developed. The women's health strategy program is something which I particularly commend in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect to which I should like to pay particular attention is housing. My electorate will benefit greatly from the record $1,290m in the Budget for direct housing assistance this year. Of that, there is an additional $15m for mortgage and rent relief schemes. I know that they have not been fully utilised in the past, but we all know that there have been some difficulties there and this will help to address those. As to the first home owners scheme, again my electorate has been a massive beneficiary of that. This year we are expecting to assist an additional 40,000 home buyers to obtain their first home at a cost of $146m. In my own electorate already $12.2m has been approved for families there, of which nearly $11m has in fact been paid out and spent. I am particularly pleased to see that that aspect of housing has been tackled in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> But as well as that, the needs of the homeless have also received priority treatment. The new supported accommodation assistance program (SAAP) gets $75m for transitional supported accommodation and support services through refuges for youth and for women, and for general services for other homeless people. The funding under the crisis accommodation program for the purchase and renovation of accommodation for SAAP clients is to be doubled to $39m and $10m specifically to meet the needs of homeless youth. In Adelaide there is an extremely sad problem of homeless kids, and I can think of nothing which demands more compassion than a program directed to their needs. Do I have 15 minutes or 10?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that time is running short and I will therefore conclude, but I mention just very briefly the massive reforms to retirement incomes which have taken place in this Budget, both for age pensioners and for people on superannuation or planning their retirement. I do not have time to go into the details of those. The environment will receive a 64 per cent increase in funding for the one billion trees program, the save the bush for endangered species program, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I mention sport. My own electorate did extremely well out of funding under the community sporting facilities program. Indeed, the Seacliff Tennis Club received $50,000 and the Happy Valley Hockey Club $180,000. There was more funding for those two clubs in my electorate, I point out to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), than for the entire Northern Territory and Tasmania combined, and possibly one could even add in the Australian Capital Territory. In conclusion, I believe that this is an excellent Budget and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech of the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney). I felt quite flabbergasted at the amount of money that he said he has been able to achieve for his electorate when it seems to me to be quite a safe seat for him. I just wanted to make that point. The other point I want to make, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that as you rightly pointed out we have 20 minutes in which to make our comments on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 and on the Budget. We have agreed to cut that short by half. Unfortunately, I have had to cut my speech in half. Half of it was going to say good things about the Budget and the different Ministers, particularly the Minister at the table, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly). That came in the second half of my speech so I will have to leave it all out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to focus on four themes in my comments tonight on the Appropriation Bill and on the Budget. They are: firstly, our national foundation; secondly, our national viability; thirdly, our national security; and finally, our national generosity. When I refer to our national foundation I refer to the family-an institution which is fundamental to the well-being of any society. It is an institution which is under unprecedented social and economic pressures in Australia as we approach the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989 Budget was quite simply a council of despair for the average family. The bottom line of the Budget was that record mortgage payments and continuing price rises of basics such as food, clothing and transport, are going to continue for the indefinite future. The coalition has been claiming for some time now that the Government is out of touch with the problems of average families. If ever there was clear confirmation of that claim it was the 1989-90 Budget, devoid as it was of any short, medium or long term solution to the pressures on the family. Let me make it quite clear that average families have borne the brunt of this Government's mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> Two days ago the Australian carried a headline on page 2 which said `Families fall into mortgage arrears'. The article reported a 10 per cent increase in home loan arrears in July this year. It warned of a crunch period during September and October this year when `people who have been battling on in the hope of lower interest rates will start to fall over'. It notes a forecast that mortgage repayments will rise to a record 71 per cent of average weekly earnings by the end of this year. That report reflects the reality that Australian couples are being left with no choice but to be a double income family. It reflects the reality that more and more families are collapsing under the pressure of the Government's policies, determined as it is to ensure that individual families slip into debt and bankruptcy at the same rate as does the country. What happens when a government subverts the foundational institute of a society? We get rising family separation, rising educational difficulties, rising drug and mental health problems, rising homelessness, a blow-out in welfare and welfare dependency and a decaying individual and social morality. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of this Appropriation Bill should have been the restoration and nurturing of the family, chiefly by attacking the key economic problems besetting the family, that is, interest rates and inflation that we all know about so well. It is also important to note the continuing imbalance against the prevention of family break-up in favour of post break-up welfare support. In spite of minor increases, funding for marriage education and counselling compared to welfare allocated after divorce is farcical. Of the $100m allocated to tackle youth homelessness only $5.5m will go towards family mediation to prevent homelessness occurring amongst young people. It is putting the cart before the horse. We should consider the freely available abortion procedures and subsidisation compared to the totally inadequate pregnancy counselling and support systems that we have at the moment. The Government stands condemned for the neglect of this family policy focus in the 1989-90 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to my second point of focus-the national viability. On the same page as the article in the Australian I referred to earlier was the headline `Inflation, interest rates hit exports'. The article reported on a warning-yet another one-to the Government that high interest rates and inflation were destroying our economy, in this instance by creating serious problems for exporters by increasing costs and reducing prices. The warning came in a report from a committee which reviewed Australia's export assistance programs. The report stressed, as the coalition has been saying for so long now, that a predominantly monetary policy approach, such as interest rates, is too blunt an instrument to fix this economy. It called for a better balance of fiscal and wages policies to encourage higher levels of productivity and living standards-the very themes stressed by the leader of the coalition in his Budget response. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a dominant criticism of the Budget by all commentators that it failed to take positive action to tackle this country's growing foreign debt, our continuing current account deficits, our workplace productivity problems and our failed industry policies. It is increasingly obvious, here and overseas, as our new AA2 credit rating has revealed, that the viability of Australia in a competitive global economy is seriously in doubt. The reality is that we are in a worse situation than when the Treasurer (Mr Keating) rang out his banana republic warning, yet the Budget pretends that all is well. As a result, Australia is sliding gradually into the company of Third World nations. Our economic viability is in doubt. Our children are set to inherit a country sent bankrupt over a single period of government from 1983 to 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As is the case so often, the Government has limited the debate on the Budget, so, as I said at the outset, I must be brief. I turn to my third theme-national security. Commentators and analysts of international relations have increasingly agreed that Australia's regional security position will be less certain and more precarious by the turn of this century than at any time in our history apart from World War II. What is the position of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) in this year's Budget in this particular context? Our defence budget has been allocated its lowest level of expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product in nearly 40 years. That means that the morale crisis in the Services will continue to put our operational capabilities in question and new equipment purchases and integration will be deferred and stretched over even longer periods. Again it will be our children who will suffer from the short-sightedness which constrains defence expenditure and which characterises the 1989-90 Budget as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to my last area of concern-foreign aid, or our national generosity. As serious as our social, economic and security situation has become under the trio of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer, and Mr Crean-the unseen but ever-present third power in this Government-Australia is still a relatively fortunate country. As such, and given the suffering of people in what we call the Third World, I believe we have an obligation to share our resources overseas. Under this Government, and with this Budget, overseas aid has declined from 0.56 per cent of gross national product in the last year of the Fraser Government to a shameful 0.33 per cent of GNP for the coming year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me indicate the nature of the choices this Government made concerning overseas aid and competing Budget demands by looking at funding for the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), one of the few United Nations areas that I feel confident of supporting. On 30 May this year I asked the Prime Minister in the House whether his Government would increase UNICEF funding from a mere $3.3m to a mere $7m within an overall increase for our overseas aid budget. The Prime Minister indicated that he, like all of us, would place a tick beside that proposal if fiscal circumstances allowed. The Government brought down a Budget with a $9 billion surplus. Fiscal circumstances allowed for a $44m boost for sport in Australia. How did UNICEF fair? Its grant was lifted from $3.3m to $3.4m, notwithstanding a direct request on UNICEF's behalf for a doubling of the grant by Ken Done, UNICEF Australia's goodwill ambassador, and notwithstanding the Prime Minister's answer on 30 May. If the grant had been doubled it would have amounted to the equivalent of one cent per Australian per week. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the failure to increase the UNICEF grant substantially typifies the way overseas aid has been dealt with under this Government. The Prime Minister cut overseas aid in real terms in the 1985-86 Budget by 4.8 per cent. He cut it by 11.9 per cent in the 1986-87 Budget and he cut it by 2.8 per cent in the 1987-88 Budget. He gave some funding back with a 7.4 per cent increase in the 1988-89 Budget. This year he took that back with a further cut of 8.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget, as I have said, failed Australian families. This Budget ignored growing doubts here and overseas about Australia's future living standards and economic viability. This Budget deferred action to lift our defence capabilities to adequate levels. The most shameful aspect of the Budget with a $9 billion surplus was its savage cut to overseas aid. I say to this House: under the Government our priorities are all wrong and this Budget betrays the Government's lack of wisdom and direction. If ever we needed proof that Australia needs a change of government, the 1989 Budget is that proof. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When discussing an Appropriation Bill with the breadth of this one and the range of issues that one could turn to, a contribution could go on for hours. I intend to limit myself to three particular areas which I think are extremely significant. The first one is the measures that are included in this Budget relating to mortgage relief and rent relief for people who may need assistance during these periods of relatively high interest rates. I say `relatively high interest rates' because I remember that before I was elected to this Parliament in 1984 interest rates in the market place were in fact higher than they are now-mortgage rates not, certainly; but the cocktail mix being offered by the banks to people was certainly at these levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that for some years now our economy has been having to learn to adjust to a high interest rate regime while we redress our balance of payments problems. During that period we have seen a record number of young Australian families enter new homes, to the extent that at this point there are something like 170,000 new home starts on the agenda for this financial year and that is a rate which is far ahead of the capacity of the building industry to sustain. It has led to inflationary trends being fuelled within that industry and it is, I think everyone will accept, the accelerator industry of our domestic economy. Therefore, the maintenance of high interest rates is needed, particularly in this sector. But it has to be done with sensitivity and it has to be done with a sense of priority. I think that this Budget contains both those measures and in very large doses.</PARA>
<PARA> It contains sensitivity, in that the Government has put in place via the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and via the mortgage and rent relief packages which are being negotiated with the state governments, a very generous safety net. I saw a newspaper article yesterday referring to a massive $15m which has been allocated to ensure that no family will need to look at giving up the home because of the interest rate burden. There is scope there for an approach to the State authorities administering the rent relief and mortgage relief schemes to ensure that that safety net is in place. As one of the Government back bench members who focused attention on this question of sensitivity, I appreciate the consideration that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other members of the Expenditure Review Committee gave to showing that sensitivity and providing a safety net in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Another key feature in the housing industry is the recognition of the role that the industry plays in our economy and the measures that are there to ensure the industry is sustained during the inevitable slowing down of private sector construction and demand which will follow both the interest rate measures and a winding back from excessive levels of construction. Built into the package is a massive amount-$1,290m, almost $1.3 billion-for direct housing assistance via the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. That represents an increase of 35 per cent over the last financial year. It is intended to increase and improve the quality of public rental housing and to expand home purchase assistance schemes which are available via the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Victorian State Government announced a new package called the equity share concept. Under that package home buyers who are not able to meet the full cost of a mortgage from their current wage are able to enter into a partnership arrangement with the State Government and buy a house on an equity share basis. Such funding makes that kind of innovation available. It is to be commended because families which otherwise might be restricted to renting will receive assistance so that later on, when the opportunity arises to buy out the other share-in other words, the Government's share-and their family and financial circumstances allow them to do so, they will be able to get into homes. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the government share does not appreciate. The government share is locked in at the time of the contract and the ratio varies from 20 per cent to 80 per cent. The Victorian Government has introduced a very innovative and commendable program and I am glad to see it. It is vital to recognise the role that the industry plays in our domestic economy. We must all understand that housing-a roof over our head-is a basic right of all Australians. Recently reports have highlighted shortcomings in Australia's approach to housing. The widely known Burdekin report entitled Our Homeless Children pointed to a particular area of concern at the moment-that is, youth accommodation. I am pleased to see that there have been substantial allocations in the Federal Budget and in State Budgets to ensure that real priority is given to crisis accommodation and other forms of youth accommodation. That is to be commended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now move on to the question of superannuation and retirement incomes. If the Budget is to be marked for anything it is for its restoration of the concept of national superannuation. I regard it as light on the hill stuff. The last time that Australia seriously committed itself to a form of national superannuation was in the late 1940s when the Chifley Government proposed that everybody ought to contribute to a pension package. This was widely accepted and well regarded. Of course, since then successive governments have retreated from that notion. The concept of national superannuation as envisaged by Chifley fell apart. We reached a point by the late 1980s when only a third of the Australian work force was contributing to superannuation-it was predominantly an area for the privileged. Although there was scope for people to take out private life insurance and other sorts of insurance packages, obviously the system was not working and there was a dearth of people making provision for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The ruling off of the line in 1983 in respect of the assets test was the start of a reform program which will, in the future, be looked upon and seen as a very dramatic shift not only in the attitude to providing for one's retirement but also in the approach to savings investment in this economy. We have now reached the situation where, via the wage-tax trade-off, the productivity agreements and the changing of the wages system, all employees have access to employer-funded superannuation. This Budget makes further provision in respect of this trend which will continue to develop. </PARA>
<PARA> Radical steps have been taken in this Budget and in measures announced during April to bring the pension system in line with the tax system and to remove the confusion faced by so many pensioners. All of those steps are not only administrative tidying-up measures but also very real advances in social justice in this country. I am very pleased to support them and I feel that I have taken part in the development process. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the superannuation equation is national savings. Over a number of years, and particularly in recent times, a lot has been said about national savings. It has often been overlooked that Australians are prolific savers. It is often said that there is no incentive to save in this country. That is absolute rubbish. Australians generally choose to save in the form of bricks and mortar. They set off very early in their working lives with the goal of acquiring a house and land and they pour enormous amounts of their weekly wages into achieving that goal. They see this significant savings approach as a form of long term security. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now the incentive to get into and to stay in superannuation. It is predicted that within five years $60 billion per annum-I repeat, $60 billion per annum-will be saved by Australians through their superannuation funds. What is going to happen to that money? As a result of changes to the tax system, which discourage superannuation funds going offshore and investing money in all sorts of unproductive speculative stuff, real incentives now exist in the system which will encourage those superannuation funds to invest the money locally in productive Australian enterprise. Of course, that means a future not only for people working at the moment and saving for their retirement but also for their children. The Australian economy, based on a savings and investment culture, with proper recognition being given to research and development and the need to find a place at the top end of the market, will be adequately resourced from domestic savings without the ever-growing reliance on foreign investment capital which has obtained in this country. I think that is a landmark reform by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I also add my congratulations, Mr Speaker, on your ascendancy to the throne. Last evening and earlier today in this place we heard a number of my colleagues on this side of the House highlight the potentially traumatic effect of last Monday's determination by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. Many of us have read also the professional advice of the honourable member for Streeton (Mr Lamb) that the Tribunal was out of touch and that the Government needed to work out a new system of remuneration. Some of us also heard the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) give a very superficial and, in my view, inadequate defence of that determination in this place last evening and during Question Time again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I therefore take the opportunity to reiterate the views expressed earlier by my colleagues and those of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The Executive Director of the Guild, Mr Robert Davies, has made it clear that there is no way that pharmacies can absorb the cuts resulting from the determination and that the determination is, and I quote in part, `disastrous for the community in terms of the ability of pharmacies to service it . . . virtually all of Australia's 5,600 pharmacies are affected and could result in staff cuts'. In a news release the National President of the Guild, Mr Jim Matthews, uses harsher words in his assessment:</PARA>
<PARA>Today's determination . . . means the end of community pharmacy services in Australia as we know them. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This decision is an outrage against the community. The Government is responsible because it urged the Tribunal to take this course. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>`It is totally deplorable that the health, wellbeing and security of the public should be treated so recklessly. </PARA>
<PARA> `The decision means that a great many pharmacies including smaller pharmacies in country towns and outer suburbs will close. </PARA>
<PARA> `Most others will not be able to maintain the level of pharmacy stocks, and patients will have to wait in some cases for days for higher cost drugs to be delivered by wholesalers. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal's decision is based on a flawed and discredited survey . . . The Tribunal itself questioned the quality of the result achieved'. </PARA>
<PARA> `The Tribunal proposes yet a further Inquiry into the structure of pharmacy. This is a cruel joke, as there will be virtually no community pharmacy left to inquire into . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is understandably emotive comment but telephone comments from pharmacists in my electorate today reflect these strong, albeit very pragmatic, views. Clearly the likely consequences will be the curtailment of many of the services which pharmacists currently offer and the closure of even more pharmacies, leaving pensioners and families with children in particular without ready access to the professional services of a local pharmacy. I find it very difficult to reconcile a situation whereby the tribunal is cutting pharmacy incomes by over 20 per cent on top of real cuts of over 10 per cent imposed by the Government in 1988. Pharmacists are not asking for charity; all they want is a fair go in what is a fiercely competitive environment. They simply want to operate on a level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree entirely with what the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) said in this place today, namely, that what is needed is a meaningful partnership between government and the pharmacists in which a two-way dialogue is a critical ingredient and in which there must be avoidance of the `we and they' mentality. On the latter point, it seems that the Government has failed badly. However, I am encouraged to hear the Minister say today that a meeting of all parties is scheduled for tomorrow to resolve the very real differences of view. The Tribunal's recommendations may save the Government $20m. While this side of the House would endorse substantive economies in the public sector-something, I regret to say, which is lacking in the Budget Papers of the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-such economies should not, as they do here, force many pharmacies to the financial wall and, most importantly, should not threaten public health standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Community pharmacies are now fighting for their survival. I hope that the Minister and the parties can come to a reasoned and reasonable accommodation tomorrow. Clearly what is needed in everyone's interest is a more objective fair go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to take the opportunity to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your election to the office of Speaker. I wish you well in your new high office. I wish first to express my surprise at and disappointment with the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). On Thursday, 17 August, in the adjournment debate the honourable member made some inaccurate and, I have to say, offensive remarks about me, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). He referred to us as lunatics, having earlier inaccurately used such words as `insanity', `illogical' and `hurtful'. Honourable members may be wondering what terrible crime we had perpetrated to warrant such strong language. Indeed, with regard to the use of the word `lunatic', I was disappointed that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who was in the chair at the time, did not call on the honourable member to withdraw, because he was obviously using unparliamentary language. Sadly, the honourable member for Gippsland also failed to warn me that he proposed to malign me and the other members, as is the usual courtesy in this House. Needless to say, I tried this evening to contact the honourable member for Gippsland to tell him I would speak, but I was unable to contact him by telephone or in any other way, so I am not quite sure where he is at present. I wanted to criticise him for his use of what I considered-as, I am sure, would the House-intemperate and excitable language and to point out how his arguments were inaccurate and illogical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for his excitable outburst-some might say it was a hysterical outburst, but I would not go as far as that-was the Australian Labor Party's uranium policy, which restricts the mining of uranium to three named mines: Ranger, Nabarlek and Roxby Downs. Nabarlek is virtually mined out, so for all practical purposes it is now a two-mine policy. Contrary to the honourable member's opinions, the majority of Labor Party parliamentarians in the House and the Senate support the existing policy, although some do not quite agree with it. At present, it is under review, but in view of the overwhelming opinion as expressed in the hundreds of submissions received by the review committee, of which I am a member, it is highly unlikely that the policy will be changed to include more mines. If anything, there could be less mining of uranium than at present. I am able to make such a forecast not only because of the ideological and environmental objections to the nuclear fuel cycle but also because it just is not economic sense to open up new uranium mines in Australia. The infrastructure to support such mines is very expensive and it often results in the use of taxpayers' funds in one way or another. Even more importantly, the supply of and demand for uranium on world markets means that Australia cannot increase its exports of uranium. This is something that the honourable member for Gippsland seems totally incapable of understanding. I refer him to an article which appeared just recently, on 18 August 1989, in the Age. Other articles in the Australian Financial Review and the Australian bear out the same kinds of comments. The fact remains that the price of uranium on the world markets is falling. It is falling because there is an excess of supply over demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very glad to see that the honourable member for Gippsland has now entered the chamber. It is good that he is here to hear what I have to say. As I said before, the honourable member was not courteous enough to tell me that he was going to call me a lunatic. I hope he will withdraw that remark very shortly. The honourable member also completely fails to understand that there is an oversupply of uranium on the world markets which means that, if we were to open up another mine or more mines, the existing mines would sell less uranium. Overall, Australia cannot increase the profits it gains from uranium exports. I hope the honourable member now understands this and at least will acknowledge it when he has the opportunity to reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to pay recognition to a most generous act of charity by a well-known family in the Goulburn district, the Gulson family. The Gulson family has been an integral part of the life of Goulburn and, indeed, the development of that city, over several generations. The present head of the family, Mr Jeff Gulson, last week made a tremendous gesture by donating five acres of prime real estate in the city of Goulburn to the Royal Freemasons Benevolent Institute for the purpose of building a retirement complex in the city of Goulburn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members may be interested to know that Goulburn is seriously under-serviced by retirement facilities. We are in urgent need of more self-contained hostel units and also nursing home accommodation. There has been a substantial hurdle to the development of these facilities because, despite the fact that the Royal Freemasons Benevolent Institute has been prepared to proceed with the construction and administration of such a facility for the last seven or eight years, it has not been able to proceed beyond the starting post because it has not been able to acquire appropriate land for the purpose. Last week Mr Jeff Gulson made a decision relatively quickly, having heard an interview on radio station 2GN in Goulburn, and also having read an article in Goulburn's local paper, about the land that he was preparing for subdivision into 20 blocks. I understand that plans for that subdivision had been prepared for council approval. He decided to forgo what was quite obviously a large amount of money for him and his family and to donate that land at no cost to the citizens of Goulburn, for the purposes of ensuring that the elderly of the city of Goulburn have an adequate and proper facility for their care in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> An exciting spin-off of which Mr Gulson may not have been aware at the time of his donation is that, using Goulburn as a central point, we may be able to establish branches of this new facility in other smaller centres such as Boorowa and Gunning which have no such facilities at present and in which there will be an obvious need in the future. It is terribly important for country people, as they grow older, to be able to retire in their home towns. It is important because it keeps them in close contact with their friends, families, and the environs with which they are familiar. The prospects of people who live in places such as Boorowa and Gunning being able to retire in their home town are very slim. Indeed, most of those people have to move to other towns which are not as accessible to their friends and families and whose environment is unfamiliar to them. </PARA>
<PARA> What Mr Gulson and his family have been able to do extends beyond the environs of Goulburn to places like Boorowa and Gunning. I believe the generosity of the Gulson family serves as an example for all citizens of Goulburn and extends the good reputation of the Gulson family that has existed for many generations. It ensures that the Gulson family will be highly regarded for a long time. As residents of Goulburn grow older, we will owe the Gulson family a great debt for which we are forever thankful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I too would like to congratulate you on your appointment. Tonight I want to talk about the emotional hysteria involving the environmental movement. I think it is extremely dangerous to the environment and will be counterproductive if it is not refuted. I believe the media have a lot to answer for in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a starting point I will take the greenhouse effect. I have been talking about the greenhouse effect for over 10 years-true, I admit, in order to promote uranium, which is a far cleaner source of energy than other fuels. I say in passing that I think it was very churlish of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) to refer to three of my colleagues as idiots when it is quite clear that it is the policy, not the members, that is idiotic. He was dealing with the three-mine policy, of course. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a very subtle person, which I thought would have been evident. When we talk about the greenhouse effect, I note that in the last three months the media have run a multitude of stories, most of them emotionally based. In the previous 30 years there had not been a word from the media on this very obvious issue. The danger is that people become jaded. We will find that people will simply say `This is terrible, it will not happen', and they will lose interest. This is a very real problem, but it is a problem we cannot panic about because we simply do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I invested $90-odd in a 2 1/2-inch document by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) on the greenhouse effect. While going to London at Christmas I took the opportunity to read it. I found it a thoroughly boring document and it took a lot to wade through it, but I am sure honourable members will give me recognition for my tenacity. The CSIRO says quite clearly that it simply does not know what the effects are; we do not know where we are going with it. It may be that rising carbon dioxide levels are masking a cyclic return to an ice age. If that is so, in a few years time we could be saying, `More carbon dioxide'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we should operate with extreme caution and that we should be looking to reduce the carbon dioxide output. To do that we must embrace nuclear energy. It is simply nonsense to talk about alternatives because they do not exist. I have been involved in holding patents, which have since lapsed, in the solar energy field. I have taken a big interest in solar energy; I venture to say that I probably know as much about it as anyone in this House. It will not supply the brute power that is needed for industry, but there is a growing place for it and I believe that the price of solar energy is coming down quite rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> If we maintain this illogical position of opposing nuclear energy, the public will simply see through it and the whole movement will tend to lose its credibility. There is a similar situation with the environmental movement not giving enough recognition to the environmentally sensitive proposals of the Western Australian Government to plant trees. The Western Australian Government has a proposal which will see a minimum of two hundred million trees planted, half of them in the private sector. It is true that in the private sector these trees will be mainly eucalyptus globulus. The reason for that is that they are quick maturing and give the necessary cash flow to make the scheme attractive for the private sector. It is very beneficial when we are returning what is now farm land-it used to be timber country-back to forest. Work is also being done in Western Australia by at least one person in agro-forestry. He believes he can demonstrate that there can be a better return from running eucalyptus globulus and emus. This is pioneering work and is very important. It is terribly disappointing to hear the emotional outbursts from the pseudo-environmentalists who really do not understand the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take some time to debunk the work of Keepin and Catts. These two gentlemen, operating from the Rocky Mountains Institute, have put forward a paper purporting to show that nuclear energy is not the answer. No-one suggests that it is the entire answer, but it is certainly a contributing factor. For them to say that nuclear energy affects only about 12 1/2 per cent of electricity use is absurd. I can tell honourable members that in a very short time the public will be demanding that politicians take note of percentages of power far smaller than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have not had the opportunity to congratulate you on your fine step up to the Chair, and I do so now. Somebody has said that the Government could well find that its scrap with the pilots is small feed compared with the fight it will have on its hands from the brutal savaging of the services provided by over 5,000 community pharmacies. To trace some of the history, in 1988 the Hawke Government imposed real cuts of 12 per cent, and these cuts, along with the proposed 23 per cent cut, combine to give a substantial amount of 35 per cent. It is a very severe cut that nobody should be asked to cope with. It is quite obvious that pharmacists have been singled out for punitive treatment from this Government. Clearly the Government has no interest in the well-being and livelihood of the profession. I am sure honourable members opposite will be the first, if they fall ill and require medicines, to rush off to the pharmacists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The chain reactions that will undoubtedly result from this proposal will move into every facet of the medical industry. Charges will increase in certain areas to compensate for losses in others, and this is something that we really cannot allow to happen in this industry which is so well established and serving the community so well. How can the Hawke Government-maybe I will get some answers from the other side of the House-justify that a proprietor pharmacist is only worth $15 an hour, an amount considerably less than that of any tradesperson-and I am not casting any aspersions on any tradespersons. In comparison to Government pharmacists it is less than half their hourly rate. Again, by what means is this decision justified?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pharmacists run a very customer-oriented community service business, and the honourable member for Streeton would be only too glad to agree with that. Their particular profession is of such importance to the health of all consumers. What the Government seems to forget is that when rural and outer urban pharmacies are closed, which will inevitably happen if these cuts go ahead, consumers will experience difficulties in obtaining very important prescriptions, particularly elderly consumers who will have to catch buses and trains in my electorate to go to the pharmacies which will be left operating.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The result has not been reached without regard to the consequences which are likely to follow--</PARA>
<PARA>That makes us wonder just what repercussions the Government envisaged it would encounter. In reality, it has only just hit the tip of the iceberg. Pharmacists are not asking for charity; far from it. All they want, and rightly deserve, is a fair go in a fiercely competitive environment. The blase attitude of the Government today towards pharmacists cannot be allowed to continue in this way. According to the President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, Mr John Ware, up to one-third of Australia's pharmacists could go out of business as a result of this decision. Mr Ware added that many pharmacists are already struggling as a result of Federal Government moves, and this latest blow will send many to the wall. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to state my views on the question of X-rated videos. The reason I do so is that I am a little angered and sick and tired of those who seek to misrepresent the whole debate on X-rated videos. I want to refer to a report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. It is clear to me that we should have a classification of censorship called non-violent erotica (NVE). The single most common problem with X-rated videos is that so few people actually know what they contain. This renders it particularly prone to misunderstanding and/or misrepresentation. Non-violent erotica is a self-explanatory term which is almost impossible to misunderstand; hence the concern on the part of opponents of sexually explicit material. If the NVE category is approved, they will not be able to misrepresent its contents to ordinary people. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of classifications in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

Every Australian adult should have the right to read and see anything that he or she likes, except in circumstances where its propensity to cause harm has been demonstrated. None of the expert and documented sociological evidence presented to the Joint Select Committee on Video Material indicated that there was a causal link between non-violent erotica and any antisocial activity on the part of the normal viewer of such material.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. On the question of sexual therapy, it is worth noting that the Committee received evidence to the effect that material depicting explicit sexual activity between consenting adults was often used as a therapeutic remedial aid in the treatment of sex offenders and the perpetrators of violent sexual crimes. In fact, the material that such people prefer to view in order to attain sexual arousal is usually of the violent, not necessarily sexual, variety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Non-violent erotica does not debase women any more than it debases men. Women are not shown in subjugated roles; on the contrary, their consent is obvious and mutual sexual stimulation and enjoyment are a feature of this type of material. Videos depicting rape, sado-masochistic or other deviant sexual behaviour are illegal in Australia. Neither X-rated nor NVE videos contain such material. </PARA>
<PARA> The wish to protect children from seeing X-rated or NVE-rated video material is acknowledged. However, parental prerogative, not parliamentary prerogative, must prevail in the home. Society deems parents capable of protecting their children from cigarettes, alcohol, firearms and the like.Why would it distrust them on videos? The very people who demand that parents should be responsible for educating their children on sex are those who are now claiming that they are incapable of protecting them from videos depicting sex. Children are not depicted in any X-rated material at present, nor would they be in the non-violent erotica category. The possession or manufacture of child pornography is illegal in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of artistic value, the suggestion that sexually explicit videos should be banned because they have no artistic merit is a furphy on two counts. The first is that some examples of non-violent erotica do have some artistic merit and are well produced. The second is that society does not ban for that reason alone other types of videos or programs which have no artistic merit. I would suggest that most soap operas on commercial television would be banned on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> As a political perspective, the banning of non-violent erotica is not a popular issue. Most people are not worried about explicit sexual material that contains no violence or compulsion. The political heat in the debate, to the degree that there is any, is generated by a deliberate campaign of misinformation combined with ignorance of what the current X category actually contains. I might say that Attorneys-General in Labor States have all received the correct information. Either they are choosing to ignore it because they perceive some political advantage in censorship of X-rated videos, or they genuinely believe that the X rating includes material which depicts violence, bestiality and so forth. The question of enforcement seems impossible to me. Banning X-rated videos is impossible to police. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Details of expenditure on the engagement of consultants, as shown in the Department's annual reports, are as follows:</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Consultancy details as requested by the honourable member are not readily available in relation to the 1986-87 financial year. The details sought would require a substantial commitment of resources to extract and collate. Given the period involved and the availability of more recent information, this level of commitment is not considered justified.</PARA>
<PARA> Details of consultants and contractors employed during the 1987-88 financial year, including the consultants' names, purposes/projects and costs are available.

<PARA> (2) February 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Indications are that the major usage occurs in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. Because Cabcharge invoices do not identify the city of usage and because invoices are sent to the home office address of users it is not possible to readily confirm this. The Department has insufficient resources available to extract this information from individual Cabcharge dockets.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Departmental policy and guidelines have been developed and distributed to issuing officers. These guidelines also contain specific responsibilities of users, which are brought to their attention on issue of Cabcharge dockets.</PARA>

<PARA> (d) Answer as for 1 (a) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Subsequent advice from Mr Prosser's office has been received that this question relates to car with driver hire only.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of billing procedures used it is not possible for clients to differentiate car with driver hire from general hire costs without reference to individual invoices. The Department does not have the resources to undertake this large task. The only records readily available are those held by the Department of Administrative Services.

The Public Service Motor Vehicle Allowances Consolidated Award 1986, which applies to Western Australian State public servants was, subsequent to 29 October 1986 varied to increase the rate of reimbursement. As such State public servants who receive reimbursement under this award are required to abide by the substantiation rules in respect of tax deductions claimed against amounts reimbursed. All employees in similar circumstances have the same obligations. The Commissioner of Taxation has told me that the Western Australian Treasury has been advised of the need for public servants in that State to substantiate claims for income tax deductions against car expense reimbursements paid on a rate-per-kilometre basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commissioner of Taxation has told me that there are no differences in the application of the substantiation rules between State, Territory and Commonwealth public servants and other taxpayers.</PARA>

<PARA>AMNESTY PUBLICITY UPDATE</PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The minutes of the Lodgment Enforcement Steering Committee (12 April 1988) show at Item 7 (Publicity) that the advertising budget for 1988-89 was set at $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA> This budget was set after Director (PIU) Jenny McKenry provided a costing of advertising from June-October 1988 of $1.89 million (see Attachment 1). This was reduced to $1 million by adopting the cost saving options as outlined.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. When public relations and advertising agencies were initially briefed, no indication of budget for either the Amnesty campaign or the TFN campaign was made. Rather, a budget proposal was sought from the agencies based on the brief given.</PARA>
<PARA> Burson-Marsteller public relations and Young and Rubicam advertising were chosen to handle the Amnesty and TFN campaigns because-</PARA>
<PARA> budget proposals were within allocations;</PARA>
<PARA> agencies showed a commitment to subject matter;</PARA>
<PARA> all avenues of information needs were addressed.</PARA>
<PARA> The agencies were appointed on the basis that the cost of 008 lines was additional to the $1 million budget for 1988-89 (see Attachment 2).</PARA>
<PARA>Funding 1987-88</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Given that the budget of $1 million as approved by the Steering Committee (12 April 1988) was for 1988-89, funds were needed to cover publicity costs between 19 May 1988 and 30 June 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Burson-Marsteller public relations submitted a budget proposal for that period of $350 000 (see Attachment 3).</PARA>
<PARA> To facilitate payment of Burson-Marsteller in 1987-88, funds were obtained from FAC (RC) Mr Seberry. Funds were applied to cover all ATO publicity costs to 30 June 1988-both Amnesty and TFN (TFN funding approved in Cabinet Submission No. 5778 is for 1988-89).</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Burson-Marsteller was paid $347 976.20 for its 1987-88 work.</PARA>
<PARA> From this amount, the following costs are not attributable to the Amnesty campaign-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) TFN publicity-$135 983.92</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Administration-$48 480.98</PARA>
<PARA>being  1/2 costs for administrative work not easily categorised as Amnesty/TFN.</PARA>
<PARA> Thus total Amnesty publicity costs for 1987-88 are $163 511.30.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Of the funds contributed by FAC(RC) for the campaign, $150 000 was committed to Amnesty advertising costs for 1987-88.</PARA>
<PARA> However, Government advertising procedures operate so that advertising accounts are paid 2 months after invoicing. Therefore, Amnesty advertising costs incurred in 1987-88 were paid in 1988-89 out of TFN funds.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. A schedule of Amnesty advertising costs to 22 July 1988 appears at Attachment 4. That Schedule shows total expenditure as $1 549 691.83.</PARA>
<PARA> However, some of these costs should be attributed to TFN for the reasons indicated-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Amnesty/TFN 008-$237 641.54. The cost of this strip ad. should be apportioned 50/50 between both Amnesty and TFN Funds because of its dual role.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Production-$63 915.50. Head hours and production costs should be borne equally between TFN and Amnesty funds.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="688" SPEAKER="Kelly The Hon R.J." NAMEID="OH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="RICHMOND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs Kelly</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Since 1969 there have been a total of 4 accidents involving Mitsubishi MU-2 aircraft in Australia. In the same period there have been 19 accidents to other similar aircraft types (twin engine, propeller turbine power).</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics provided from overseas sources revealed that between 1964 and 1987, 1.6% of all MU-2 aircraft were involved in accidents annually, compared with 2.0% for the overall class of aircraft. Between 1983 and 1987 the average for the MU-2 fleet was 1% while the figure for the overall class reduced to 0.67%. It is not possible to provide figures for overseas incidents, (occurrences not involving substantial aircraft damage or serious personal injuries), involving the MU-2, because few countries have a detailed incident reporting program, and none have a system as extensive as Australia. There is no evidence from the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation records to suggest that the MU-2 has a disproportionate number of incidents when compared to similar aircraft types.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The CAA is aware of all known and potential problems notified by the manufacturer and other regulatory authorities around the world.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The details are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) On 24 May 1983 aircraft registered VH-MLU crashed near Bargo, NSW. The pilot, who was the only occupant, was killed. The factors leading to the accident were not positively established.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) On 15 November 1983 aircraft registered VH-CJP was damaged during a landing at Cairns, Qld. Neither of the occupants were injured. The significant factors in the accident included pilot fatigue, an uncertainty as to which pilot was in command, and a misjudgment of the height of the aircraft above the runway.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) On 14 July 1987 aircraft registered VH-MUK was damaged during landing at Toowoomba, Qld. None of the seven persons on board were injured. The nosewheel landing gear had collapsed following heavy contact with the runway.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) On 16 December 1988 aircraft registered VH-BBA was destroyed in an accident near Leonora. All ten persons on board received fatal injuries. This accident is still under investigation, and it would be improper to speculate on the likely factors which might be involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. The MU-2 was subject to the normal checks for the issue of a Certificate of Airworthiness in Australia. This followed its successful completion of similar checks in a number of other countries. Since that time all service bulletins and airworthiness directives relevant to that type have been examined and applied to those aircraft in Australia. The aircraft have been subject to the usual maintenance requirements and routine surveillance.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No special attention was given to auto-pilot electrical interference during certification. The CAA was not then, nor is it now, aware of any auto-pilot electrical interference problems. There have been, however, some problems with clutches associated with the auto-pilot types used in the MU-2 which are common to various other aircraft types. These have all been addressed by Airworthiness Directive action.</PARA>
<PARA> Auto-pilot problems specific to MU-2 aircraft have involved water ingress into the auto-pilot disconnect switch positioning. The former has been addressed by amendment of maintenance action to call for frequent checking of the sealing of the avionics compartment and the latter is subject to promulgation of an Airworthiness Directive.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The CAA is part of an international airworthiness network which ensures that all information on airworthiness problems is shared. The CAA will use this network to ensure that information affecting the safety of operations of the MU-2 is investigated and acted on. In this regard the CAA is also co-operating with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation in a survey which the Bureau is conducting at present. The survey seeks information from pilots on any difficulties they may have experienced with the MU-2 at any time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr Staples</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The affordability of home ownership for low and moderate income first home buyers was boosted by the introduction of the First Home Owners Scheme (FHOS) on 1 October 1983. FHOS provides eligible households with assistance over five years to help buy their first homes. To date, more than 330,000 households have benefited from FHOS at a total cost of almost $1.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA), renegotiated in 1984, there has been a significant increase in the level of funding available for low and moderate income home purchase assistance. In the five years to 1987-88, a total of 68,000 home loans were provided, compared to 50,000 in the five years to 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA> At the May 1989 Premiers' Conference, States agreed on new financial arrangements for public housing funded through the CSHA. In 1989-90, the Commonwealth will provide $1010.5 million to the States and the Northern Territory all in the form of grants. Gearing of Home Purchase Assistance (HPA) funds by the States will enable a far greater number of households to be assisted into home ownership using CSHA funds from previous years. In 1988-89, 26,000 HPA loans were provided to low income households compared with an estimate for 1989-90 of 40,000 loans possible under the new arrangements. Over the next five years, about 200,000 home loans will be made available to low income households if the States take up the Commonwealth's offer.</PARA>
<PARA> Access to housing finance also has been improved under this Government. In the three years to June 1983, housing finance institutions made available only 734,916 loans compared with 913,741 in the three years following to June 1986, an increase of 24 per cent. In the period July 1986 to April 1989, the number of housing loans made available increased further to 949,249.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A number of home ownership assistance schemes co-existed prior to the introduction of FHOS. FHOS was therefore more easily comprehensible to potential beneficiaries, than the range of schemes that it replaced.</PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility for FHOS is related only to income and the requirement that applicants have not previously owned a home. Earlier schemes (the Home Savings Grant (HSG) Scheme and the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme (HDAS)) also involved a savings requirement, which particularly disadvantaged low income families with children. The HSG Scheme also included an age limit and a house price limit for eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA> FHOS provides more generous levels of assistance than previous schemes and gives applicants the choice of three payment options designed to help bridge the deposit gap, increase borrowing capacity and/or manage repayments more easily.</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance under FHOS is provided over five years to help households through the difficult early years of home ownership, rather than previous schemes which only provided a one-off benefit.</PARA>

While some officers are designated as inspectors under particular legislation, for example the Ozone Protection Act 1989, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Act 1988, their inspectorial duties form only a small part of their overall functions. Other officers may on occasion be involved in investigatory and/or enforcement functions incidental to the normal duties of their positions. For example, officers who are employed as Station Leaders and Voyage Leaders in Antarctica may be appointed as inspectors under the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980 and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1988 and as Deputy Coroners and in these capacities may on occasions be called on to undertake investigations or law enforcement functions although their appointment would rarely need to be exercised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (i) The prices of woodchips exported from Eden are approved by the Government on a commercial-in-confidence basis and the Minister for Resources is therefore not at liberty to disclose those prices. The Minister can, however, provide the average price received for Australian hardwood woodchips exported during the three years specified in the honourable member's question. The prices during the period were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 1986 A$113.08 per bone dry unit f.o.b.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 1987 A$127.87 per bone dry unit f.o.b.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 1988 A$140.15 per bone dry unit f.o.b.</PARA>
<PARA> The price of woodchips exported from Eden was slightly below the Australian average, reflecting the poorer pulping quality of woodchips from Eden compared with woodchips from Tasmania, which is the major source of woodchips exported from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Woodchip export prices are negotiated by all exporters on a six-monthly basis and are submitted to the Minister for Resources for approval. In considering the prices, he takes into account prevailing world market prices for woodchips of various species as well as the exchange rates of the relevant currencies, to ensure that Australia receives a satisfactory price for its natural resources. He also takes into account the different pulping qualities of woodchips exported from different Australian ports to ensure that the price relativities between all sources of chips exported from Australia are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Alder woodchips have highly desirable pulping qualities, and their quality and price are widely considered to be a benchmark for other woodchip species.</PARA>
<PARA> Approximate prices for Alder woodchips exported from North America to Japan during the period were as follows:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (2) and (3) The lease arrangements which applied from 1 July 1988 for car rental companies operating at airports under the control of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) were originally negotiated by the Department of Transport and Communications. These contracts as extended by the Department formally expired on 30 June 1988, six months after the FAC commenced operations. The Corporation was not able to enter into new contracts commencing 1 July 1988, given the need for the FAC to evaluate car rental operations and to fully consult the industry on revised arrangements. This process was extensive and included commitments to consult smaller operators, made prior to FAC vesting. The contracts were therefore extended by the FAC from 30 June 1988, by agreement with the operators, on the existing terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> In April 1989, the FAC invited tenders for the rights to conduct self-drive car rental businesses at twelve of its airports for a three year period. The tenders closed on 23 May 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements provide for up to four contracts to be granted at each airport, with up to three let to operators offering a presence at all twelve airports. At least one contract for each airport is awarded on an airport-by-airport basis, which is a significant step towards opening up the market to new and local operators.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The FAC has advised that the new contracts were in place on 1 August 1989.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) External debt can be measured on a ``gross'' basis (ie, the total amount that Australia owes to foreigners), or on a ``net'' basis (gross debt minus the amounts that foreigners owe to Australia). Statistics for both measures are presented below. Net external debt is the more relevant measure for most purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> Gross external debt-The Statistician publishes external debt estimates as at the last day of each quarter. As at 31 March 1989, gross external debt was estimated at $A128.6 billion, made up as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> the official sector (including Commonwealth and State general government and the Reserve Bank) accounted for $35.1 billion (27 per cent of the total);</PARA>
<PARA> public trading and financial enterprises (PTFEs) for $26.0 billion (20 per cent); and</PARA>
<PARA> the private sector for $67.5 billion (53 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA> Disaggregated figures for the official sector as at end-March 1989 have not yet been published. As at end-December 1988, the break-up was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> the Commonwealth (including the Reserve Bank) accounted for $20.6 billion (17 per cent of the total); and</PARA>
<PARA> the States for $13.4 billion (11 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA> Net external debt-The Statistician provides figures on Australia's debt assets overseas, classified by official assets (mainly official reserves, but including some official lending) and other (non-official) Australian lending overseas. A public/private sector classification of Australian lending overseas is only published with a long lag, but this lending is ordinarily comprised largely of private assets. As at 31 March 1989, net external debt was estimated at $A103.2 billion and, if all non-official lending overseas is attributed to the private sector, the components were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> the official sector accounted for $14.6 billion (14 per cent of the total);</PARA>
<PARA> PTFEs for $26 billion (25 per cent); and</PARA>
<PARA> the private sector for $62.6 billion (61 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia's official reserve assets at 31 March 1989 were $A19,509 million, of which holdings of US dollars amounted to $6,267 million (32 per cent of the total), holdings of other currencies were $8,762 million (45 per cent) and other official reserves (gold, IMF Special Drawing Rights, etc) were valued at $4,480 million (23 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Under a `floating' regime, exchange rate adjustments tend to be smaller but more frequent than in the case of a fixed rate regime. Economic fundamentals (notably the country's balance of payments and inflation performance), rather than the exchange rate system per se, determine the exchange rate. Accordingly, over time, effects of exchange rate changes on debt denominated in foreign currencies will tend to be similar under both systems. However, to the extent that a `floating' exchange rate rate system, together with a deregulated financial system more generally, tends to promote a more efficient, flexible and responsive economy than a fixed exchange rate rate regime and a highly regulated financial system, the former can be expected to be more successful in reducing any excessive external debt burden.</PARA>
