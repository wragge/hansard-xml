<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Budget Paper No. 3, Portfolio Program Estimates 1989-90, the Attorney-General's portfolio includes subprogram 2.6, Marriage and Family Services. The subprogram's objective is stated as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To provide for the solemnisation of marriage and to facilitate the present and future maintenance and stability of marital and family relationships and reduce trauma associated with breakdown in these relationships. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will have noted in these appropriations a small but inadequate increase in overall funding in this area of the portfolio. Given that in every Budget since I became a member of parliament in 1984 this area of preventative social work has been underfunded, for the last few years I have made a point of drawing the House's attention to the need to review the poor level of support we allocate to marriage and family preparation and counselling. I usually remind honourable members that most marriages collapse due to external pressures such as work patterns and mortgage rates combined with a neglect of the marriage relationship due to inadequate life skills, an inadequacy increasingly evident in our society. I usually draw the attention of honourable members to just how effective the work of marriage and family educators and counsellors is for the couple involved and for the community which benefits from healthy marriages and stable families. I do not think there is any argument about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I usually point out also the massive imbalance in government resource allocation to post-family breakdown dysfunction when compared to the relatively insignificant resource allocation towards preventing family breakdown. Honourable members need only compare the combined Family Court and social security allocations for divorce and its consequences with the pittance allocated in their appropriations to those counsellors and educators who have shown that they can keep families together and healthy at a great saving to society and to the great benefit of individuals, especially children involved. In this regard I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard two short sets of figures put together by Dr Moira Eastman in her book Family: The Vital Factor, which shows an up to date comparison of funds allocated to prevention of family breakdown with costs of breakdown in the years 1984-85 and 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also note Dr Eastman's research which shows a net return of $20 to $30 for each $1 of an annual grant to guidance and counselling services in terms of individuals who do not end up on supporting parents benefits due to preventative support. I will repeat that, because it is worth listening to again: Dr Eastman's research shows a net return of $20 to $30 for each $1 of an annual grant to guidance and counselling services in terms of individuals who do not end up on supporting parents benefits due to preventative support-the thing that seems to be escaping the reasoning of those who allocate government funds in this area. Needless to say, each of those reminders needs to be issued in this House once again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, however, I wish to draw the attention of the chamber to salient and relevant comments made by the Director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Dr Don Edgar, in the August edition of the journal Family Matters. I relate Dr Edgar's comments to the provision of marriage education and counselling services. Dr Edgar argues as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>More services for families should be aimed at prevention available early on in the process of family difficulties, rather than only being targeted at those who have gone so far down the track they are in real crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Edgar calls for a move from a top-down model of family services to a more sensitive model which focuses on family resources, advice when asked for, family information access and family enhancement skills-all very important areas. He bases his call on the Institute's findings that many of those in need of help do not know where or how to find it and/or stoically refuse to seek help from formal family support services. Dr Edgar argues:</PARA>
<PARA>If we cultivated a community value of using resources made accessible to all families, of expecting advice when a problem emerges rather than a rescue from disaster, a real partnership of family and formal support might emerge and a real strengthening of family life result. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Edgar's focus and prudent priorities should be, but are not, shared by the Government, unfortunately. I heartily endorse his comments. I note, however, that these appropriations suggest that the Government is, as yet, unwilling to go down the path suggested by Dr Edgar who is, of course, the Director of a government-sponsored organisation. I also note the following comments made by Dr Edgar on the need for more research into these matters:</PARA>
<PARA>If policy makers really want the best for families, they should seek more research information on actual family aspirations, the actual ways in which families of different types and at different stages of the family cycle manage to cope and function on the resources they have, and to support and prevent damage to the fabric of family life. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Edgar is right again. It strikes me as indicative of the Government's neglect of such research and an integrated family policy focus that the Institute of Family Studies has been dumped by the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) into the social security portfolio. That dumping occurred after the Department of Community Services and Health was offered the Institute but indicated that it was not interested. That needs some explaining by the Minister. I take this opportunity to ask the Attorney-General to explain the forced move of the Institute from his portfolio, a move which occurred again without consultation with the Institute. I also take this opportunity to ask him to clarify the future of the marriage and family services subprogram, given the rationalisation of the function and responsibility under way in this Department. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I return to my main concern. The Government should be doing more to support and promote preventative programs in marriage and family education and counselling. The appropriations for these programs before us today are totally inadequate, especially given the current pressures on families of having both parents at work to survive high interest rates which, of course, we all know about it. They are short-sighted and imprudent. I suggest that they need to be reviewed over the next 12 months to be the cornerstone, hopefully in what might be called the world's greatest family policy statement, which is what the Government really needs to bring down if it is to be fair dinkum-if I may use that term-on child poverty, welfare dependence, school retention rates, drug abuse, family savings levels and the many policy challenges we face as a result of the neglect of the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, when speaking on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and the appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department, I spoke primarily about the National Crime Authority (NCA). Today I will continue on that theme. As I said last night, organised crime and organised corruption know no boundaries-they are both interstate and international in their operation. The National Crime Authority is one of the great successes of this Government. Its role should be enhanced and its future enlarged. I believe very firmly that one of the problems we now face is a lack of action by State governments in assisting and enlarging the role of the National Crime Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because people were scared and frightened of the royal commission style powers granted to the National Crime Authority and because this Parliament had concerns about the wide-ranging powers created by its legislation, an intergovernmental committee was established which severely limits the capacity of the National Crime Authority to go into investigative areas without a specific reference from that intergovernmental body. Yet we know, from all the available evidence, that there is great corruption emanating from the States, both in governmental and in corporate areas. The South Australian State Government, under Mr Bannon, recognised the problems of that State and was prepared to fund, with assistance from the Commonwealth, a National Crime Authority office in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct first hit the public media I was one of the very few people in this country who criticised that report. The criticisms were founded on the simple basis that the people being asked to repair the corruption in Queensland were the very people responsible for the corruption. Members of the Queensland section of the National Party of Australia, who have had their hands in the till of corruption for the last 14 years, were being given the responsibility to institute electoral and corruption reform. The National Party was given no directions, guidelines or specific references as to how it was to operate. The people who have had their fingers in the bickie tin of corruption for 14-odd years have now failed to institute electoral reform, and today newspapers report that Ahern is now backing away from the fundamental plank of instituting an anti-corruption body within Queensland. Frankly, no-one suspected that the National Party, that corrupt political party of Australian politics, would have done anything about it. It indicates to me the need for a National Crime Authority body to be established in every State of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unarguable that every State requires a body which is national in its approach to organised crime and corruption. The filth and scandal of corruption that exists in Queensland does not stop at the border. It is a nonsense to think somehow that the influence of the Queensland National Party suddenly stops at the border with the Northern Territory or New South Wales. That is another area in which I have made public criticism of the Fitzgerald inquiry-it stopped at the border. If one reads the Fitzgerald report one even wonders whether there is a drug problem in Queensland. That is why the NCA needs that resource. That is why the NCA should be enlarged in its scope and in its power to transcend State borders. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe also that the restrictions placed upon the NCA by the legislation-that is, the requirements for the State Attorneys-General to grant a specific reference to the National Crime Authority before it can undertake a particular inquiry using its royal commission powers-should be limited. If we are seriously to get into the heart and soul of organised crime that body needs to have a bit more power, a bit more strength and to have some of the State Attorneys-General controls removed. I do not think this will happen quickly or readily. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly I do not see many State governments which would like an independent national crime authority body set up in their States. If we suggested to members of the Queensland National Party or to the Federal National Party that we should have a NCA body in Queensland, we could imagine the gulps and the gasps which would occur, as those people thought of their beloved leader Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen as being one of the targets. Those people would fight a battle a million miles off to ensure that that beloved leader was untouched. Yet without such a body people like Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen may well escape the net and they may well escape the fate that they deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said all States. I do not name anyone else. Again, I stress: all opposition members, all States. It is unarguable that the stench of all corruption lies in all States; not just Queensland; not just New South Wales; not just Victoria-every State. We need some greater controls and a more unified national approach to tackle that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I listened with interest to the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) and I find myself in agreement with much of what he said. There is unarguably a need for greater resources in the conciliation and counselling areas of family law. Having said that, I find it amusing for someone from the Opposition to suggest it. If we look at `Future Divisions', that wonderful document of rhetoric, we will not find a dollar sign anywhere in that document. Yet here we have a member of the Opposition who, on the social services side, is looking for a $1 billion cut in Commonwealth expenditure and who is apparently supporting a taxation proposal for split incomes which will cost an enormous amount of money or a two-rate flat tax policy which will cost $2.3 billion in revenue. If we are looking at total cuts on the Opposition's stated policies today of about $4 billion to $5 billion, how can one then expand services as the honourable gentleman has suggested in this chamber? It ill becomes any Opposition member to come in here and to criticise the Government's Budget on that one line alone. Stop to think about it! The Opposition suggests a $2.3 billion loss of revenue caused by the two-rate taxation system which must be met by corresponding cuts to expenditure. That is on top of $1 billion in cuts announced by the Opposition. It does not take into account the inflation indexed proposals floating around the heavens of this chamber on which one day we may get answers. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition who come in here and say, `Look, we can isolate the problems in societal terms and we can isolate the problems in government expenditure terms'-which I can agree with-are really making very shallow calls. I would much prefer to see the honourable member for Macquarie put a dollar sign on the Opposition's budgetary proposals, to lay such proposals on the table where those calls then have some validity, where I can believe that he means what he says rather than using this chamber as a forum for presenting his personal quirks. We all know that nothing occurs in government unless there is a dollar sign attached to it and the money comes out of some appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night I mentioned my great pleasure in the funding of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board computer system in Thailand and in the Philippines. I spoke very briefly on the national crime survey. Honourable members are well aware that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority pointed out that one of the great problems we face in determining policies to tackle the major drug problem is the lack of statistical data, the lack of material as to what is actually occurring on the streets: the price of drugs, the quality of drugs and the source of drugs. This is one of the great initiatives that I believe the Government is undertaking to assist this Parliament and the organised groups who are fighting this battle to find that necessary material.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address a few comments this morning to the estimates of the Attorney-General's Department, particularly the area of company law and associated areas. The honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), who has just spoken, apparently could not have heard what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had to say yesterday about new principles. The honourable member did not talk about Halfpenny or Bjelke-Petersen. This is a new dimension. Apparently those opposite operate under the old dimension. They have not heard about the new one which was referred to yesterday at Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Commission has been allotted an extra $700,000 in relation to its activities. The Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, Professor Baxt, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We are very disappointed that we have not been given funds for the new work that the Commission has been asked to do and is now fully involved in, including telecommunications, the overseas cargo shipping work, transport generally and the new areas of de-regulation . . . We have not been given any specific funds in relation to that. We are still discussing this with Finance, we're hoping that we can persuade them to give us money outside the traditional budgetary formulations. </PARA>
<PARA>On many occasions the Trade Practices Commission has to use all of its resources for one job all around Australia, and these days, with the pilots dispute, it is difficult for it to carry out its work. Imagine the onus that is placed on the Trade Practices Commission to get results. </PARA>
<PARA> This area of the law has now been in vogue in Australia, I guess, for 20 years. It is gradually gathering some practitioners and some legal precedent which will be enormously important in the conduct of commerce in this nation. There is no way that this can be done unless the Trade Practices Commission is appropriately funded. Under a fully integrated and widely discussed privatisation program there will be a very great need for a properly staffed and funded Trade Practices Commission. This is quite clearly not the case at present and we, in government, would absolutely ensure competition in the market place by making sure that the Commission has adequate resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to address is the Australian Securities Commission, the legislation for which is still subject to challenge and, in part, not proclaimed. But despite that, there has been an allocation of $15.7m in the current year. Just to put that into perspective, currently the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) gets $3.5m with the States contributing the same amount. So, $15.7, or nearly double what the NCSC is getting, has been allocated to an operation that is not functioning and whose legislation is subject to legal challenge and, except for a small area, is not proclaimed. </PARA>

The Attorney-General is an amiable fellow. He waltzed down to the Victorians and said, `What about some sort of an inside deal for you guys? We will take over the CAC. You break the line, and we'll take you over'. The Victorians, in a greatly cynical and expedient move on their part, said, `We'll hand over to you the CAC of Victoria and the funds that go with it-and you have to take all the staff as part of the deal-and we will pass some enabling legislation which would make a High Court challenge a bit dodgy'. But the Attorney-General said, `No, we will turn that one down'. He is a New South Wales member and he really wanted to go to Sydney. According to a letter I have here--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is from a member of the Committee, a Mr Beerworth. He is one of the 36 faceless men. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I have seen the correspondence with Mr Bowen which you released and agree that Mr Bowen's ``challenge and no money'' approach-</PARA>
<PARA>which is the approach he has taken in New South Wales-</PARA>
<PARA>is both cynical and improper, particularly having regard to an earlier approach of his that the Commonwealth wanted the States to challenge because of the need properly to discover for the good of the community the limits of the Commonwealth's power. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, in the corporate area. That was the challenge. We have heard it in the House on many occasions. The Government says that the States should put up and challenge. But when New South Wales, for instance, does put up and challenge the Government says, `Drop the challenge. We'll do a deal'. Every constitutional lawyer-particularly the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown)-would know that the challenge currently before the High Court of Australia is extraordinarily questionable. I have no doubt that the High Court will agree to certain parts of the argument, but I have very grave doubts about its agreeing to 100 per cent of it. There is a need for this matter to be before the High Court and for a decision to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutions of all the States in Australia very frequently refer to good government. Good government requires long term thinking. While I remain of the view that the Commonwealth will probably win with a substantial percentage of the High Court judgment, I do not believe that the States will go home empty handed. As a consequence of those proposals the High Court's action in this matter is very critical to all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the main play. In the current year, we propose to spend $15.7m to establish this Commission. We are attempting to deal with the States in terms of taking over their Commissions and various things by saying, `If you challenge you'll get no money. If you drop the challenge we'll give you some money'. The budget projection for the next year is $65m. Even the appointed Chairman of the new Australian Securities Commission, Mr Hartnell, in his first interview said, in summary, that what he was about was bringing good management to the securities industry of Australia. How are we going to do that? We are going to give it an adequate database based on new computers. Whacko! That will do big things for company law. He did not say that, instead of having a cooperative scheme in which all the States could discuss the matter and in which we knew where the money would go, what the States were prepared to negotiate and what positions they held-and instead of the threats of High Court challenges concerning the money-he would wipe that to one side and say to the States, `We'll give you all these wonderful things but it really boils down to new computers and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> Before my time expires I wish to say one thing: in the time ahead there will be an enormous amount of work for company accountants and lawyers. There will be enormous legal costs as the corporations in this nation are required to drag them through the areas of registration in which they are currently involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the observations made last night by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). He complained formally about the methods employed to choke off the supply of information to people. He referred specifically to the Freedom of Information Act. I am able to cite a couple of examples to support his contention that the Act is being used by unscrupulous departments to prevent members of the Parliament and members of the public gaining access to documentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of honourable members in this Parliament would be aware that I had reason, with legal advice and the assistance of some honourable members, to challenge the legality of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) conducting, as compulsory, the 1988-89 household expenditure survey. Indeed, the strength of legal opinion on our side was such that the matter was quite protracted. In the end, the Australian Bureau of Statistics even agreed, because of doubts as to the legality of the survey, not to prosecute more than 200 households that refused to be part of that survey. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, because of my view that the Australian Commissioner of Taxation was responsible for delving into people's lives, via the household expenditure survey, I asked the ABS for details of those people who had suggested questions for the Australian Labor Party's 1984 household expenditure survey. I was advised that if I paid in excess of $11,000 that information would be made available to me. I was at the United Nations at the time this good news came through. I must admit that I thought that $11,000 was just too much. It might be regarded almost as a stamp allowance in the eyes of members of the Labor Party, but it was too much for me to be forking out of my own pocket. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not have the advantage of being able to compare this cost and I have never uttered a word about it in the form of a complaint. But earlier this year I wrote to the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman asking for stipulated documentation relating to the household expenditure survey. I also wrote to the Australian Bureau of Statistics seeking much the same information. There were some differences because the Attorney-General's Department had also been involved. I received a notification from the ABS to the effect that it did not see that any public interest was involved and the only way it would give me the information would be upon the production of a 25 per cent down payment on an account of at least $1,500. </PARA>

So there was the ABS trying to strangle me by applying a charge of $1,500 and the Ombudsman applying a charge of $600. The Ombudsman then ruled that because of the huge public interest in the survey at least half of that cost could be justifiably waived. This is what is going on out there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are the words of the honourable member for Menzies. I had not got to that stage yet, but I will give it more thought. The effect it is having is to prevent people from being informed. I spoke in this chamber last night about the national health survey, which the ABS is lauding in medical journals as having the support of the Australian Medical Association (AMA). When I contacted the AMA at the end of last week after seeing the claims of support, the AMA informed me that its support was given on the condition that it be conducted as a voluntary survey. People are to be subjected to many questions about how many times they go to the doctor, clean their teeth and the like. Women are being asked whether they have an intra-uterine device fitted and about their contraceptive practices. On seeing all this, the AMA said that it was not going to have anything to do with a survey of this type unless it was voluntary. The ABS has this tremendous capacity to attract the crabs and draw attention to itself. I went to the office of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), and said that I would like to see this questionnaire. His office contacted the ABS and an officer in the ABS who was not that senior told the honourable member's office that members of parliament are not going to see the questionnaire until the survey is completed at the end of next year. We have freedom of information, yet 44,000 Australians are going to be subjected to this questionnaire and we, the members of the Parliament, are not allowed to see the questions the public is going to be asked. Not to be rash, we gave the ABS another chance. The shadow Treasurer's office then made a formal application to the Acting Statistician, Mr McLennan, asking for the questionnaire again. The answer came back, `No, not to be given out'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Chairman-and I congratulate you on your recent elevation-what kind of country is this? Who is running Australia when the members of the Parliament who seek documentation and information are being strangled off by fees that only the Halfpennys of this world could afford to meet and are being prevented from seeing questionnaires that 44,000 Australians are going to be subjected to? The Freedom of Information Act was enacted in good faith by a Liberal government-with both a big `L' and a small `l'-so that people could be informed, but the monetary approach is now being used to prevent people gaining access to the documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wrote to the Attorney-General's Department asking for the same documentation. I received a reply only today. The letter is dated 4 September. It says that it is not in the public interest that I be given the documentation without charge and that it will be advising me in due course as to the fees that will be applied. When it came to the 1988-89 household expenditure survey, I suggest that the ABS and the Attorney-General's Department worked hand in glove together to protect the Bureau from its failure to comply with the requirements of this Parliament that a survey be tabled before its commencement. It does the Attorney-General's Department no credit to make a judgment that this information will not be available on the grounds of public interest. A lot of public interest is involved in these surveys. When people are threatened with the force of the law and when they can face fines of $100 a day for not complying with a direction of the Australian Statistician, it is people's rights that come to the top; not the interests of government departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday when we were considering these estimates the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) criticised me for drawing attention to the shortcomings in the way in which the Freedom of Information Act is being administered by the present Government, saying, as he did in substance, that it had nothing to do with this debate. I simply remind the honourable member that the estimates inform us of what are described as the major achievements of the Attorney-General's Department. At page 16 of the estimates one of the major achievements of the Department is held out as being `an improvement in the processing of FOI requests'. Without going on about it at length I say simply that if that is one of the major achievements I would hate to see some of the shortcomings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen how the present Government is allowing the use of the Freedom of Information Act to fall into a complete and disgraceful shambles. It has raised every technical objection it can and continues raising technical objections to prevent the proper use of the Act. It imposes excessive charges on people, including members of parliament, to deter them from using the Freedom of Information Act. When we succeed in getting over that obstacle race what we often get by way of documents released under the Freedom of Information Act is similar to those that I showed the Committee last night. I again draw the Committee's attention to one masterpiece from which it would appear that we were living in Romania or the Soviet Union. That is an example of freedom of information under the Australian Labor Party. That is what we get for a lot of money. I think it is time that the Government woke up to itself about this Act and either proposed to repeal it or started, for the first time, to administer it honestly and efficiently in the true spirit that was the basis of the Act when the former Government introduced it. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply leave the matter there and plead with the Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), to go back to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). It is a matter of regret-I presume there is some good reason for the Attorney-General not being here when his estimates are being debated-that he is not here. I urge the Minister to take that point back to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> While he is doing that I urge him to take back to him my concern about another area of the Department, the Special Investigations Unit. An appropriation of $3,263,000 in the estimates is to be used by the Special Investigations Unit to investigate people who may be charged under the War Crimes Act, or people who, to quote the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-this was at a time before he discovered yesterday the new principle that people are innocent until they are proven guilty-will be charged under the War Crimes Act, and appear to be guilty. That is the way the Prime Minister put it, at a time even before the Bill was passed, let alone before people were charged or convicted. That was in the days pre-Halfpenny. People were not innocent until they were proven guilty. In those days when the Government was in full flight with the War Crimes Bill, according to the Prime Minister people were guilty before the Bill had been passed and before anyone had been charged or convicted. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the operations of the Special Investigations Unit and simply make the point that the Government cannot come in here and ask for $3,263,000 for the Unit without a substantial explanation being given to this Committee as to how that money is being spent and when we can expect some results. It is not that we are pleading with the Government to charge someone. We are simply saying that it started this matter. It put this slur over some ethnic communities in Australia. The Prime Minister was running around saying that they were guilty anyway, and where is the result? I do not know of a case where so much money has been spent on chasing what seems to be now so few people with so obviously little result. Indeed, the only result of the activities of the Special Investigations Unit that I can see is that its principal investigator has been charged with some criminal offences. That is the only result. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be unique in the history of investigating or law enforcement bodies that the only person associated with them who is up on a charge is their principal investigator. The Government cannot allow this shambles to go on. We are simply saying that it has to give an explanation. It has to tell us how the job is going and when we can reasonably expect some results. It began with 500 people on the list. The number went down to 400, 300, 200 and 100. I gather that now it is down to a mere handful. We want to know when we will see some tangible results. If we do not see any tangible results soon, we will ask the Government to address its mind to whether this Unit should continue in existence and whether we should have this War Crimes Act anyway. That point has not been reached, and I say that in fairness, but it will be reached if the Government goes on spending money and fumbling around in the way in which it is in this area without any tangible results. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I want to move briefly to a few other matters. One of them relates to the staff in the Attorney-General's Department who, in my view, have been treated in a very shabby way. They have worked under difficult circumstances and, particularly in recent years, under salary scales which are quite inconsistent with the quality and significance of the work that they do. Indeed, many of them could earn twice or three times their salaries outside the government service. It is about time that the Government faced up to this and set up a sensible career structure for lawyers in the Department and remunerated them adequately in recompense for the high quality of the work that they do. </PARA>
<PARA> Before anyone gets agitated and runs away like Senator Walsh and says that I am advocating a vast increase in government expenditure, let me say that I am not advocating that at all. I believe that there are areas within the Attorney-General's Department which probably deserve a lower priority than the priority the Government seems to give to them, but in the important work there should certainly be a better career and salary structure because the people involved deserve it and need it. If it is not done soon, the Government will find a continuation of this haemorrhaging, this migration, this evacuation from the Department of highly qualified and skilled people. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be placed on record that not only do people in the Department who work in many of these areas perform very well indeed with the very high quality of work, but also they do so in many cases at salaries much lower than they are entitled to and much lower than they could obtain in the private profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, the Attorney-General should give us some explanation about contract employment in the Australian Federal Police. Is this going ahead or not? If so, when? Will there be legislation? When will it be introduced? How are the negotiations going? Do we have to be kept in the dark on everything permanently or will we be let into some of the secrets? That is an important matter which we should have explained to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Attorney-General, although it is in a Bill, should give us some explanation of why the Attorney-General's Department is abandoning the Institute of Family Studies and pushing it off to the social welfare industry. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), who spoke earlier, drew attention to the good work of that body. One cannot but suspect that the Government is concerned about the attention being drawn by the Institute of Family Studies to the increasing interest rate burden and economic burden on families. The Government clearly does not like its reports. The Government wants to move this body to perhaps an area with a social welfare atmosphere where the Government thinks it might get some better results. Whether that is so or not-and I do not know-I believe that the Attorney-General should give some explanation as to why, contrary to the whole history of government in every country, a Minister is willing to get rid of something and surrender some area of his territory. That calls for an explanation. Finally, I would hope that the Attorney-General will look at those matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to say something in praise of a Labor Minister. Further to comments I have made in relation to the misuse and abuse of the Freedom of Information Act, last year I had reason to make a freedom of information request of a certain government department. I do not wish to name the department because I do not want to create any embarrassment. I later went to the relevant Minister who said, `I will get that information for you'. The Minister, his departmental senior officials and I were to meet in his office one evening, where all the information would be given to me. This is a classic example of--</PARA></TALK.START>

Not very much time was extended to me to make up my mind but I recognised that there was a gap in the file-that it just did not flow as smoothly as the River Don. At the time, I said to the Minister, `This does not seem to be right'. He turned to his senior departmental officials and said, `I asked you to get Cameron the whole file. Is the whole file here?'. The departmental officials looked a little bit embarrassed and, instead of saying, `Yes, Minister', said `No, Minister'. The Minister said, `But I said Cameron was to be given the lot'. I think he gave them about another three days to get the lot to me. When the lot arrived the file had trebled in size. This is just an example of how people seem to be frightened to give out information. When I saw the whole file, I was quite happy to let the matter rest from then on. I cite this example and praise the Labor Minister, who will remain unnamed, for the strength that showed on that occasion by insisting that there be no abuse of the provisions of the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members who have been involved in this debate. I think most of them have made a constructive contribution. I cannot say that I agree with the comments that have been made by several honourable members opposite and I will deal with some of those in a few moments. But overall I think everybody has done his best, and one cannot ask for more than that. Firstly, I would like to apologise for the fact that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) is not here. In fact, he is on the way to the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in New Zealand. I am sure that honourable members will appreciate that that is a legitimate and proper reason for his absence. In those circumstances, he is unable to be with us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Initially I want to deal with the issue which was raised by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), concerning the alleged moves of the headquarters of various bodies which are under the Attorney's portfolio. The honourable member suggested that the headquarters of the National Crime Authority, the law courts of the Family Court of Australia and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), et cetera, had been moved for various reasons. If I caught his drift, he was suggesting that these headquarters had been moved possibly at the whim and fancy of the presiding officers. I want to make a couple of points about that. The headquarters of the AAT has been moved to Brisbane for sound economic reasons. This took place, I understand, in the last financial year and I think the matter has been raised in Parliament previously. Considerable detail as to the reasons for the move and the costs involved were set out in a reply to Senate question No. 775 in the Senate Hansard of 4 April 1989. Honourable members who are interested in that matter can refer to the details provided therein. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Crime Authority has always had offices in Sydney and Melbourne. I am sure that the shadow Attorney would be well aware of that fact. I have visited both of those offices and they have extensive facilities in both cities. The fact that Mr Faris, QC, is a resident of Melbourne and prefers to work out of Melbourne has not, in substance, affected the operations of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was suggested that the Family Court headquarters had shifted to the city in which the Chief Justice of the Family Court is domiciled. The Family Court principal registry remains and has always been in Sydney. That has not shifted. The other body that was referred to was the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G4">Mr DUNCAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. That is the situation at the moment. The ASC, as I understand the position, is to be a national decentralised body. The fact that the Chairman happens to live in a particular city is a matter which may well affect the situation while he is the Chairman. But the Commission is to be a national decentralised body and it will not be headquartered in any particular city, much to the disappointment of the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) who seemed to have some enthusiasm for Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal in passing with the issue of contract employment in the Australian Federal Police (AFP). I can advise the shadow Attorney that legislation will be introduced, I understand during this session, to allow for that to take place. The honourable member for Ryan also raised some concerns about the resources available to the Trade Practices Commission. I want to indicate to the Committee that the Government has given considerable and, I think it is fair to say, probably unprecedented attention to providing the Trade Practices Commission with the resources that are necessary for it to be able appropriately to discharge its functions. It is disappointing that the Trade Practices Commission continues to complain that it is funded inadequately when in 1988-89 it under-spent total funds allocated by $95,574 after asking in that year's Additional Estimates for $388,000 and having been given $389,000. Furthermore, in the 1989-90 Budget it received an increase in its total allocation of 15.5 per cent, a significant increase in real terms in the context of an overall reduction in Government spending in real terms. The Trade Practices Commission also received an increase in its running costs component of over 12 per cent. Although there is some continuing agitation from this quarter, the Government has done a very considerable job of meeting the Commission's requirements and needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter I want to deal with is that raised by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), who expressed some concern about the issue of marriage counselling and family services. I appreciate his interest in this particular matter. I, too, believe that this is an important area of government activity and certainly one which needs to have basic priority, but the suggestion that this Government has not given it that priority is quite unsound. During the six years that this Government has been in office there has been an increase of 70.6 per cent in real terms in the dollars available in this area. That compares most favourably with the increase of 4.14 per cent that occurred during the whole of the Fraser Government years. I do not think this Government has anything to be ashamed of in this area. On the contrary, we can be proud of the record we have. In addition, in the recent Budget an amount was made available for mediation and counselling of adolescents, which again shows that the Government is aware of the needs, concerns and requirements of the community to ensure that appropriate support facilities are available. I will ask the Attorney-General to consider the other matters raised by the shadow Attorney-General and respond as appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is appropriate that these issues should come up for debate today when there is a glimmer of light at the end of the runway in terms of the pilots dispute. The estimates we are looking at today cover the whole of the Transport and Communications portfolio, and I will address my statements particularly to aviation. While there is a glimmer of light at the end of the runway, by no means is this pilots dispute over. Indeed, I think we have a very long way to go. At least we have now had some initiatives from the airline companies-or one in particular-and one would hope that this is the beginning of major discussions that might bring this dispute to an end. It is a dispute that is heading this country towards the edge of economic disaster, is causing massive losses within the tourist industry, and has now put 150,000 jobs under threat in that industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was with some interest that we learned last night that Ansett Airlines of Australia was approaching its pilots on an individual basis and, through those approaches, offering individual contracts. The Opposition supports that approach, whether it be to the pilots directly or through the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. Unfortunately, the snag still seems to be that the airlines will not deal with the Pilots Federation. One hopes that cool heads will prevail, and that we will have an opportunity, in the not too distant future, to start getting those planes flying again and making some restoration of what is a very difficult and costly situation in terms of our economy, and a potentially disastrous situation in terms of the employment record here in Australia. I must stress that it is early days yet. </PARA>
<PARA> I was given certain information last night about what was involved in those contracts, and it would seem we are not far off the mark. As Sir Peter Abeles said on the radio program AM this morning, there is a basic package with a 6 per cent productivity increase and the provision to pay a great deal of overtime. The real debate, of course, is whether there is any productivity improvement in the arrangements that have been offered. According to the figures that I have been provided with it would seem that, effectively, there is an increase of about 28 per cent in the offer made to the pilots, and very little productivity increase. </PARA>
<PARA> What this country needs, certainly in terms of the aviation industry, is a productivity breakout. That has been one of the difficulties we have faced for so long under the present system in the airline industry. It is a fact that we have now had a duopoly for three decades, it is a fact that there has been some featherbedding for our domestic airlines, and it is a fact that when we go into deregulation next year the airlines will have to undertake a great deal of restructuring if they are to stay in business. We should never forget that this particular dispute is really all about that. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be fair to say that until relatively recent times there did not appear to be a major threat to the major carriers on the horizon. Now there are two potential players in the airline business and there is probably enough scope within the Australian market for at least one of those carriers to get off the ground. It was interesting to hear the public statements made by that carrier in terms of its fare structure and the nature of its agreements with its pilots, who would be on contracts, have productivity bonuses and be invited to undertake profit sharing arrangements. There is also the fact that that new airline would employ about 110 staff per aircraft, rather than the 300 who are presently employed by Ansett and Australian Airlines. We must not forget that although there is apparently some light on the horizon this dispute is not yet over. The Opposition hopes that at last we will see some cracks in the arrangements, and get flights back in the air. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I would like to address briefly in the short time available this morning is that of international aviation. I read with interest, in the explanatory notes for the Transport and Communications portfolio, the increase in the amount of money that will be allocated this year in terms of international aviation negotiations. That sum is $0.255m. We welcome that amount of money and that increase particularly as, following this strike, we will enter a very critical situation as far as the future development of Australian tourism is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of last session the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) made a statement in this place regarding the Government's new policy in terms of international aviation negotiations. It was a major step, I must admit. The indications were that there would be a great deal of loosening of the arrangements for bilateral negotiations. Indeed, the Government was hopeful that there would be more carriers coming into Australia. Three or four months down the track we have not seen any major movements as yet, and I have not heard of any new airlines being allowed to come into Australia or, indeed, any new charter arrangements being made. I hope it will not be too long before we get some announcements in that regard because we will have a very critical phase in the redevelopment of tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that there is a bipartisan approach between the Opposition and the Government in terms of the necessity for a major overseas promotion campaign, and the Opposition supports that to the hilt. But we must make sure that we have the right infrastructure to match that increased spending. The statement made by the Minister was salient in that he made specific reference to the fact that we would be trying to get more interest in Australia as a destination from overseas charter operators. I hope that part of that increase in expenditure for the Department of Transport and Communications this year will cover that situation so that there will not be a shortage of seats for international visitors wishing to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority, to a very great extent, are off budget this year, we should make some reference to them and the work they are doing. It was interesting to note that this year a sum of $13m has been allocated for future land acquisition and development work at Badgerys Creek. I cannot stress too much the importance of the great necessity to resolve the situation concerning Sydney Airport. It concerns me that, as yet, we have seen no real indication from the Government that it is terribly keen on Badgerys Creek or the development of a third runway at Sydney Airport. We are told that we have to wait, and probably rightly so, for the environmental impact study. There has been a great deal of talk about the environmental study, but it is still not off the ground. We are still working on the guidelines and the longer we delay the redevelopment at Sydney Airport or indeed, at Badgerys Creek, the longer we will have the problem of overcrowding that presently exists at Sydney International Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in most of the research studies from the tourism industry that point is canvassed as one of the disincentives for tourists coming to Australia: people are quite fed up with the delays at Sydney because of the lack of airport capacity and runway capacity and indeed because of the ongoing dispute by the air traffic controllers. We stress to the Government the very great importance of Sydney as the major international gateway to Australia and the very real necessity to get Sydney International Airport right in terms of its runways, infrastructure and navigational aids. </PARA>

The maintenance, especially of runway facilities, has really left a lot to be desired in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see my friend the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan). I am sure he is perfectly aware of a situation that developed recently at Singleton when a commuter carrier, carrying passengers paying the normal fare, got bogged in the middle of the runway. That type of incident comes back to us time and time again. We must make sure that we do not let ourselves get into the situation that we obviously have in recent years of allowing the quality of our airport infrastructure to run down. Unfortunately the time allowed to me this morning is quite short. I stress the importance of maintaining that infrastructure, the importance of that expenditure, and the importance of getting new international carriers to come into Australia. Most importantly, I stress the fact that we have to get the domestic airlines back in the air. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of matters I would like to raise this morning about the estimates of the Department of Transport and Communications. In the communications area, I would like to talk about Radio Australia. It is with some concern that I raise this matter. Numerous reports have been tabled in this Parliament from a number of committees of this Parliament that have raised again and again the plight of Radio Australia and, indeed, the decline in its funding over the years, although in real terms in this Budget we have seen a maintenance of funding for Radio Australia. I will quote from a report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Australia's Relations with the South Pacific, which I tabled in early April this year. We were concerned, amongst other issues in the South Pacific, that Radio Australia's facilities were not as they should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rather than just a maintenance of funding, Radio Australia desperately needs an injection of funds to upgrade its facilities throughout Australia and possibly overseas. At present the possibility of a transmitter in Thailand is being negotiated. There are numerous aspects to all this. At one stage Radio Australia felt that it was in a desperate plight. In my travels through the South Pacific last year there was jamming of the Radio Australia signal by, dare I say, the French. At appropriate times when Radio Australia was broadcasting to the South Pacific the reception was not strong enough. When a tape was played to me of a Radio Australia broadcast in Western Samoa I could hardly decipher the words because of the jamming involved. Because of the poor reception people could not listen to Radio Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from the parliamentary report tabled earlier this year. It summarises quite succinctly the concerns and the recommendations which we put forward and which I would like to raise again in this House today. Page 100 of the report entitled Australia's Relations with the South Pacific the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> 5.47 The Committee was disturbed at other evidence put before it that the effectiveness of Radio Australia was threatened due to declining transmitter effectiveness, as well as increased competition in the region from other broadcasters. The run-down in facilities is disgraceful. Radio Australia has experienced funding cuts over a number of years, and up-grading of transmitter sites serving the Pacific is long over due. The Shepparton (Victoria) site, in particular requires extensive modernisation and up-grading. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.48 The Committee is aware that as part of the Australian Government's review of national broadcasting policy, the future of Radio Australia is under consideration. The Committee finds it hard to see why an inquiry such as this is required. The options appear clear-to provide Radio Australia with sufficient funding under the current arrangement, retaining Radio Australia's links with the ABC; or if this Government is genuine about the value such a service provides, providing Radio Australia with sufficient funds to exist as a separate body. In addition to the above two options, the Committee understands that the inquiry is also looking at the options of merging it with other bodies; retaining Radio Australia in its current form but instituting revised funding and consultative arrangements; or establishing Radio Australia as an independent statutory body. One suggestion made was for funding for Radio Australia to be allocated via the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Committee totally rejects this option, believing it is important that the independence of Radio Australia new broadcast be maintained. More importantly, Radio Australia must be seen to be separate from the Australian Government's foreign affairs bureaucracy, despite the occasional difficulties this might cause Australian diplomatic efforts in the region. For Pacific listeners, the independence of the service being presented must not be compromised. The Committee rejects the idea of any government department determining the content of Radio Australia broadcasts. </PARA>
<PARA> 5.49 The Committee's overriding concern is that Radio Australia obtain sufficient funds to perform its functions successfully. The Committee heard in evidence that Radio Australia relied `very much on the facilities of the ABC to ensure that we survive. There is no way that we could be a totally independent operation' and if that situation continues then continued association with the ABC with an increase in funding would seem the most preferable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the recommendation I support. The Committee goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> 5.50 The Committee fully supports the continued existence of Radio Australia and commends the decision of Radio Australia in 1988 to reorder its regional target priorities to place the South-West/Central Pacific region as its first priority, and therefore to take an even more active role in the South Pacific. The Committee recommends that sufficient funds be allocated to up-dating Radio Australia transmitter facilities, particularly those used in targeting the Pacific region, and in up-grading the programs produced specifically for the region. </PARA>
<PARA>I echo that statement, which was put unanimously by the Committee. All the parties, including the independents but excepting Senator Brian Harradine, were represented on that Committee. I fully support those recommendations. I again ask whether the Government could possibly provide a further injection of funds for the upgrading of Radio Australia in the foreseeable future. It is a very important facility. It is used throughout the Pacific and South East Asia and indeed throughout the world, but in those two regions in particular because of their importance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will touch on another area of broadcasting and television and comment on the Government's television policy. It is no secret that I did not entirely agree with the Government's ownership policy when it was brought forward. I pushed for the 43 per cent policy, as it was known; that is, that a person or company could own only 43 per cent in a company with Melbourne or Sydney access. The Government thought otherwise and the ownership level is now at 60 per cent. As a result of that decision, there were buy-outs all over the place. Frank Lowy bought the Channel 10 Network, Bond bought the Channel 9 Network from Packer, et cetera. Eventually, we saw Skase buy the 7 Network. Another person who agreed with me, if I may say so, is the former Minister for Communications, the present Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy). We did not win that battle. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that Mr Lowy, because of his hastiness to get into the industry, has now lost a reported $280m. My concern is that we set certain hares running that need not have been running because in essence whilst logically the Government's policy is correct-there should not be much logical difference between owning 43 per cent, 60 per cent or 70 per cent-what occurred happened as a result of the Government announcement. When one looks at the matter logically now, there is no reason why people such as Bond or Skase need own all five or six stations around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have always said-and Sir Frank Packer always said-that as long as a person owned Melbourne and Sydney networks it did not really matter. In an economic sense if a person owns networks in those two cities, he controls everything else. Practically the entire economic worth of the network lies in Melbourne and Sydney. If a program is not sold in one of those capital cities, it is not sold at all. Programs must be carried in both of those capital cities. If a person owns networks in both capital cities, the networks in other capital cities may as well not exist. Therefore I would suggest that Broadcom Australia Ltd in the Channel 10 saga will control the network because it will have a huge say. Mr Curran might wish to put forward propositions with his minor holdings in Perth, Adelaide and Canberra, but when it gets to the crunch he will have no effective say. </PARA>
<PARA> I still do not believe that the policy is totally correct. It is a little hard to go backwards now after we have let the genie out of the bottle. I hope Mr Skase and Mr Bond make a go of it. I think Mr Bond is in a bit of a pickle because he cannot sell out. His losses would probably be double that of Mr Lowy. I think that this is a policy that the Government needs to keep under review. It is a situation that the Government needs to keep under review. It is a very important part of Australia's economic and social policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the estimates of the Department of Transport and Communications I want to begin by talking very briefly about the pilots strike although I do not want that to be the burden of my remarks this morning. Just about every aspect of that dispute has been debated furiously around Australia. But one aspect of it that does not seem to have had a great deal of airing is the relationship between the individual pilots and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP), their so-called union. This is a relationship which in some cases is a happy and comfortable relationship but in other cases it is a relationship of strain and even of duress. The simple reality is that the AFAP has put the hard word on pilots and in the present circumstances those pilots who wish to return to work have it made clear to them implicitly or explicitly-it is probably implicitly-that if they return to work they are strikebreakers and their careers will suffer forever and a day because they are strikebreakers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things I think the Government should do is to introduce right to work legislation of the kind that has been introduced around the United States. I think it exists in 40 States of the United States. This legislation guarantees employees, in this case including airline pilots, that if they defy the union, if they resign from the union, that union or any other similar association cannot harass them and, to take an extreme instance, cannot harass them out of work. Right to work legislation would give great comfort to those pilots who wish to return to work. Right to work legislation would be one very constructive way in which this matter could come to an early resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Government will consider right to work legislation, will use a little imagination, perhaps will walk away from some of the more entrenched ideological positions that it has taken over the years in industrial relations and will realise that there is a commonsense solution to these sorts of problems. That legislation is one aspect of a commonsense solution that could apply to the present pilots strike and in future it could apply to a whole range of industrial disputes where union leaders and union bosses bully their employees into industrial action and where those employees very reluctantly have to suffer not only dire personal economic consequences but also from the ignominy of causing enormous inconvenience to the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The burden of my remarks today is about transport infrastructure in Australia and I will pick up on one aspect of that debate which I do not think has been given sufficient airing. We have heard a great deal about the problems of the waterfront and the need for those problems to be solved. That will be an important part of the new Peacock Government's program. We have heard a great deal about coastal shipping and, again, that is something the Peacock Government will be addressing after the election. Deregulation of airlines and improvement in airline facilities will be another important part of that new government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> One sector of transport which is a forgotten sector is without doubt railways. In Australia railways are in as urgent need of restructuring, of reinvestment, of upgrading as is any other sector of our transport industries. The railways in Australia are currently in a state of crisis. Many politicians in Australia, State and Federal, are simply resigned to that crisis. It is estimated that in Victoria and New South Wales alone, the losses of their railway systems constitute a subsidy of about $2 billion per annum. This is an enormous loss. It is therefore an enormous drain on the community-a cross subsidy from the productive sector of the economy to the unproductive, loss making railways of those States. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think we should be too pessimistic about railways because in the longer term efficient railways are something that we can achieve in Australia. There are a couple of bright hopes. There is the entrepreneurial proposition that a very fast train should be built. Whether we think that is likely to happen and whether we think it is likely that money will be made out of property speculation rather than out of the running of an efficient railway service is a matter for individual judgment. It is interesting to see that people are coming forward with that sort of entrepreneurial private enterprise proposition. One only need go to countries like France and Germany to see how these high speed trains can be so very effective. Enormous changes have also taken place in Australian National, the former Commonwealth railways. I think that body deserves to be congratulated on the way in which it has turned that which used to be a substantial loss-making operation into, at least on its freight side, an operation which makes a very small profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Railways in this country can be turned around in terms of freight operations. I do not think that is true of passenger services. Passenger services, in terms of becoming profitable, have very little hope. So far as passenger services are continued, they should be continued as a community service obligation, not as an economic proposition. But freight has very real prospects. One only has to look at the United States and Canada to see how extraordinarily profitable rail freight services can be. In both those countries the private sector has proved that it has done extraordinarily well out of running freight railways as has, in turn, the business community. Therefore the economy as a whole has done well out of being able to use those railways to good effect. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to do that in Australia we have to be prepared to make very substantial changes. Initially we have to address overmanning and restrictive work practices in both our State railways and in Australian National, although that issue is being addressed in Australian National. I guess it is in some of the States as well. If we look at the comparative productivity figures in railways-for example if we take the number of tonnes of freight moved per freight employee-Australia is quite uncompetitive with countries like the United States and Canada. In the United States a little over four times as much freight per employee is moved and in Canada the figures are similar. That says something about the low level of productivity we have in this country. If we take the number of train kilometres per freight employee one would think we would do pretty well because our freight trains cover many kilometres. We are outgunned in this area not only by the United States and Canada-we are really and truly outgunned by them-but we are even outgunned, by that definition of productivity, by little Sweden. We would not have thought that Swedish railways covered big distances. Obviously, by comparison with Australia, they do not. In terms of train kilometres per freight employee, Sweden is substantially more productive than Australia. I do not want to encourage the Australian Labor Party too much when it comes to Sweden. V/Line admits that it could increase its productivity by about 30 per cent. One reason that productivity has been so poor over the years has been that railways are uncompetitive-it is a public monopoly-and they have been used as a job creation scheme and very little else. There has been union resistance to change and that has to come to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that Booz-Allen and Hamilton in New South Wales has estimated that overmanning and restrictive work practices alone on the New South Wales railways are costing something like $110m per annum. I think that makes the point very clearly. We will not succeed unless we improve productivity on our railways. If we do, we have the very real prospect, following the example of Canada and the United States, of turning our freight railways into very profitable and important operations in terms of the revival of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to address the issue of the interrelationship between the different railway systems. It is often said that one of the four or five great mistakes of Australian history is that in Australia we have five different railway systems and at least three different gauges. It is hard to do very much about the stupidity of the different gauges because that will require enormous capital investment. Mind you, if railways become profitable I think that will occur. But we ought to try to better integrate interstate freight movements around Australia, perhaps under the auspices of one organisation such as Australian National Railways, to ensure that those systems can be properly marketed and run. I do not have time to say a great deal more about this. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, if we can make our interstate freight services efficient and have them coordinated by Australian National Railways, even if that involves a shareholding by the States in Australian National Railways, then we can develop a truly profitable railway freight sector in Australia which could lead to injections of private capital and, with a bit of luck over the years, real scope for the privatisation of our railways, turning them into an extraordinarily efficient and dynamic part of the Australian transport sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in the committee stage dealing with the estimates of the Department of Transport and Communications. I will confine my remarks in this debate to transport. Like many members of the House, I receive a lot of representation concerning roads-from councils, organisations and individuals. Of course, people think that their roads are the worst and cannot understand why the Government cannot see the logic of their demands that more money be allocated to their roads. Road allocation in this year's Budget has been increased to $1.341 billion-an increase of more than $120m, or almost 10 per cent, over the 1988-89 funding. This extra funding will be used on the national highways and on arterial and local roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What people overlook in relation to road funding is just which roads the Federal Government has a direct funding responsibility for. As we know, the Federal Government has responsibility for the national highway and national arterial roads. Funding for other roads is the responsibility of the State or local government, albeit at times through a grant from the Federal Government. This week I had a letter from a constituent at Burradoo claiming that the state of the roads reminded her of driving in Africa or Bangladesh. This is utter rubbish. I drove on roads in Africa last year and anyone who thinks our roads are anything like the roads of Africa or Asia does not know what he is talking about. It is a very silly argument. </PARA>
<PARA> It was particularly pertinent that this letter came from Burradoo, because early this year the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) opened the Berrima bypass, a project worth more than $87m. This road is one of the best in Australia. The nonsense about our roads being on a par with African roads is about as silly as the claim that our roads are worse than they were some 10 years ago. People putting these arguments, and those in the Opposition supporting them, lose any credibility in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> During the appropriation debate several members have spoken about roads, including the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks). Even the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) last night spent some time in this wide-ranging debate talking about roads. They have highlighted the tragic loss of life on Australian roads. No-one argues that it is indeed a tragic loss. The honourable member for Gilmore is far too intelligent to believe the nonsense he spoke in his speech the other day. I refer him to an editorial in yesterday's Canberra Times which, in a very intelligent way, indicates some of the causes of death on Australian roads. It actually dealt with some of the issues that the honourable member raised in his speech. There are many causes, including alcohol, speed and driving in a manner not consistent with prevailing road conditions, as the paper says. I always find it interesting that, when members of the Opposition talk about roads, they are more or less saying that if the Government would only put more money into roads we would have no road accidents. That is a silly argument, and they know that it is a silly argument. Road conditions are of course a contributing factor, but they are only one of many contributing factors, as is high speed. High speed in itself does not cause road deaths. Speed kills only when it is combined in the wrong proportions with youth-too often, unfortunately-with alcohol, with weariness, with ignorance or with bad weather. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also pleased to see that the Canberra Times yesterday raised the question of the damage heavy vehicles do to our road system. The honourable member for Gilmore knows-he reminds us frequently in this chamber-that heavy freight hurtles down the Hume Highway through the centre of Goulburn day and night. I believe that much of this freight should be transported by rail. I was very pleased that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) raised the question of rail, because it is the cheapest and most effective way of transporting freight, especially over long distances. Yet rail operators in this country are forced into an unfair situation. Even the levy that they are forced to pay on their fuel goes to subsidise their competitors, the road freighters. If the average person had to pay the full price of transporting goods by road, very little freight would go by road, yet in New South Wales we have a Liberal and National Party government that is closing down railways. </PARA>
<PARA> I agreed very much with what the honourable member for Mayo said about rail. We need an efficient rail system. As I have said, it is the most effective and cheapest way of transporting goods over long distances. I think that there is great potential there for interstate transport. I also support his comments that it should be coordinated. I have a disagreement with him: whereas he wants this all to happen in the private sector, I want it to happen in the government sector. Where a profit motive is involved, I do not see why that profit should not come to government and be returned to the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the long term national economic interest both State and Federal governments should be putting more money into rail. If more freight is transported by rail and some of the trucks that are doing so much damage are taken off the roads, we would not have the constant cry for more money to go into the road system. The ordinary motorist driving a small car is not churning up our roads, it is the trucks carrying all that heavy freight-much of it should be carried by rail-that are churning up and destroying the road system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly annoying that in the politically biased and totally dishonest campaign being conducted by motoring organisations, especially the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA), they never point out who does the real damage to our roads. I sincerely hope that in the forthcoming elections for the NRMA more responsible people will be put in charge of that organisation. The actions of the motoring organisations in advertising have been dishonest and misleading. I personally have no argument with their campaign for more money to be spent on roads, but I feel very strongly that their arguments should be accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in funds to the States and Territories for road projects continues this Hawke Labor Government's pledge to maintain road funding in real terms. It is clear evidence of the strong priority this Government gives to roads. As I say, a large proportion of this money will be spent on the national highway system and national arterial roads. One national arterial road has not been funded-a proposed road in my electorate called Caloola Pass-because, as we know, under the national arterial system it has to be recommended by the State Government. This road will link the highlands to the coast. It will complement the excellent work begun by the Port Kembla harbour task force in getting a grain terminal at Port Kembla, and helping Port Kembla reach its full potential as an export development port. But it will never reach that full potential without adequate infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the first actions of the vicious Greiner Liberal Government was to stop work on the Maldon-Dumbarton rail link, which would have transported coal from the southern fields to Port Kembla. Instead the coal will be trundled through the Sydney suburban system to the dangerous and inadequate Illawarra system, leading to even more congestion. The Greiner Government should have gone ahead with the Maldon-Dumbarton rail link. Most importantly, the New South Wales Minister should have listed Caloola Pass as a priority for funding. The Federal Government would have funded it as a national arterial road. The only link on the southern part of Wollongong, Australia's seventh city, is the Macquarie Pass, which, frankly, is nothing better than a goat track. The first coal or wheat truck to use that road will be the last. It is very important that the New South Wales Government recommend Caloola Pass for priority funding under the national arterial roads system. I have the assurance of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) that, provided the road receives high priority, it will be funded by the Federal Government. In that way part of the transport infrastructure of this country can be made better for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate principally to speak about the road situation throughout Australia. Having passed the Bicentenary, we could say that we have not done so badly in opening Australia up in a couple of hundred years, but the road system throughout Australia is most inadequate. Every member of this House appreciates that fact, even the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). He did not actually dispute the fact that more money from our petrol taxes and from government generally should be used on our roads. I speak of all the categories of roads. I think Australia has done a reasonably good job on the national highways. We have a bitumen surfaced road right around the continent. But the state of the roads in other categories disturbs me immensely as a member of the National Party of Australia and as the chairman of the Opposition's transport and communications committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We appreciate the fact-and we are thankful for small mercies-that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have seen fit to grant an extra $116m for roads this year. That is all right, and we accept it. However, it is a fact that, in real money terms, 30 per cent less is being spent on our roads than was the case when the Government came to power in 1983. Whilst funding has increased by approximately 9.3 per cent this year, if we allow for inflation, in the Treasurer's own words, of 7.5 per cent, this leaves only an extra 2 per cent for roads in real money terms. The inflationary trend of 7.5 per cent will not keep up with the rate of inflation in the cost of building roads. The cost of bitumen surfacing and other road costs, we are told by State departments, goes well beyond the average inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not forget that, in 1989-90, $5,645m came into the Commonwealth's coffers from the petrol excise. The fuel tax has become a tremendous income earner for Consolidated Revenue. I suppose all political parties have contributed to that, but let us not forget that the petrol tax in 1983 was 6c a litre when this Government came into power and is now up to almost 30c a litre. When we go to the petrol bowser we are paying to the Commonwealth Government more than half the cost of a litre of fuel. That money is not being returned specifically to roads in the way in which we want it to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say a few words about the conditions of roads in Australia. We were pleased that certain roads, particularly the Pacific Highway, were reclassified as national arterial roads. We hope that as a result extra money will be spent on the Pacific Highway, which is so very necessary. It is one of the most travelled roads in Australia. I am not talking only about the national arterial roads but also about the ordinary arterial roads and the local, rural and urban roads. These roads are causing deep concern among our constituents. These are the roads that are carrying our children to school and our products to market. These roads link the interior of the States with the coastal areas. It is important that we come up with programs that will overcome the inadequacies of the road system. I was very pleased to see the New South Wales Government imposing a tax of 3c a litre on fuel--</PARA>

<PARA> What about road safety? If anybody should talk about that matter I should, as honourable members would know. As the honourable member for Throsby said, road safety is only one of many factors contributing to deaths on the roads. The basic point is the condition of roads such as the Hume Highway. I drove from Liverpool to Goulburn on Monday morning. It is a wonderful road. I do not know what it is like further on. Apparently there are problems. I want to see the Pacific Highway as a dual carriageway in the years to come. That will be important as we build this nation in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Roads are a big factor in micro-economics. We are told that 15 per cent of our industry costs relates to road transport. Fifteen per cent of the average cost of everything we buy from a supermarket shelf relates to the cost of transport. I do not condemn the Australian Automobile Association, I give it great credit. Somebody besides members of the Liberal and National parties had to come to the fore and point out where the problem lies with road transport. The Association has not told lies. It has been realistic in what it has said. It has pointed to all factors relating to deaths on the roads and to transport problems generally. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) is in the chamber. He knows that I agree with him totally on the issues of rail transport and rail passenger services. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government is now stabilising the State's railway system. It has to be done. Government members know, as does the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales, that something had to be done about the railways. It has been running at a loss of $3m a day. I hope that when the rail system is stabilised it can branch out to new systems that will cater for much of the transport that takes place today on the highways and byways of Australia. We have to be big enough to acknowledge that there is a need for a railway between Alice Springs and Darwin. There is a need for a railway across the very north of Australia. We represent a great nation. Board of directors that we are, we must look to the future and say, `These are the railway systems that we need to build for the sake of Australia to open up the natural resources and to bring people into the north'. These are the big issues that we have to start to plan for now. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said what I wanted to say. I would love to say a lot more about our road system and arterial roads. I could cite roads in my electorate that I am very concerned about. Some of the councils are just unable to meet their responsibilities to cater for future demands. With the channelling of national roads into these areas and with present resources, they cannot meet the demand. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with this: Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is still a worry. What has this Government done for the future of Sydney Airport? Has the environmental study been carried out? We see in the papers articles which state that it will cost twice as much. This Government is waiting for the election to be over, but God only knows what will happen as far as this great central airport is concerned. Will the Minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), or somebody else tell us exactly where we stand with the Sydney Airport? The pilots strike is bad enough, but Sydney Airport is a disaster for interstate and intrastate travellers and certainly for overseas travellers. It is important that we know exactly what is happening; that the matter be expedited; and that something be done about the extra runway that is so very essential. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join my colleagues on this side of the chamber in this committee stage debate in concentrating on the transport side of it. I congratulate the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), who has just completed his speech, on his excellent contribution. I also congratulate my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) on his contribution, which highlighted some of the merits of rail. As has been pointed out by a number of speakers, rail has a very exciting future in this country. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) says that it is probably the cheapest and most efficient form of transport available to us if we can operate it properly. It certainly is a very efficient and cheap form of transport if it is operated profitably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest to the chamber today that probably the most efficient form of transport in this country is actually coastal shipping. The only reason why that does not happen at present is simply that we do not have an efficient coastal shipping service, nor an efficient waterfront. I want to speak briefly on both those subjects today in the 10 minutes that I have available to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I do that I just want to follow up on some of the comments made by the honourable member for Lyne, who spoke principally about roads, and just home in on the fact that, whilst the Government claims that this year it has had an increase in road funding of $120m, in actual fact that is an exaggeration; it is $116m. The Government says that that is a 10 per cent increase but, as the honourable member for Lyne pointed out, it is about 9.3 per cent. The increase in road funding of $116m is only a fraction of the extra taxes that motorists will be paying this year at the petrol bowser. Excises on fuel will increase by $482m through this financial year whilst the Government will be giving back to the motorists only $116m of that $482m in the form of funds for road improvements and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is quite obvious that, despite the claims of this Government, the motorist is being ripped off yet again. Of course, today we have had the unfortunate experience of finding that, in the last 6 1/2 years of this Hawke Labor Government, road funding has been reduced by about 30 per cent in real terms. To give an idea of what effect that will have, I can talk about an area with which the honourable member for Throsby would be familiar-indeed, I am familiar with it in my electorate-that is, the Hume Highway. When the former Liberal-National Party coalition Government announced the Australian bicentennial road development fund back in 1981 or 1982, it stated that the by-pass around Goulburn would be completed by the year 1988 as part of our bicentennial celebrations and that the Cullerin Range deviation would be completed by 1988. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without a rail easement, yes. Unfortunately, today work is just commencing on those bypasses and deviations, and we have a four- to five-year construction program ahead of us before that completion will occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason we are experiencing these delays of five and six years is simply that the Government, over its period of office, has reduced road funding by some 30 per cent. It is also worth pointing out the comments made by the honourable member for Throsby that people on this side of the chamber have been intimating that, by improving our roads, we will, in some way or another, remove road fatalities. He was referring to an editorial in yesterday's Canberra Times. Unfortunately, road fatalities will not be removed completely as a consequence of improving our road infrastructure throughout this country. But the National Roads and Motorists Association, in its research, has found that, if we improve roads to a proper standard, we will reduce the incidence of accidents and fatal accidents by about 80 per cent-possibly by as much as 85 per cent. So there is a direct correlation between proper road funding and a reduction in road fatalities and injuries on our highways. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, fatalities and injuries on the road system throughout Australia cost this country some $6 billion. That is a cost that we cannot afford to bear in the future. There is a very good, sound economic argument why we should increase road funding. The Liberal and National parties, in their policy, will be announcing a significant increase in road funding which will please many people in this country-indeed, even the harshest critics-and which will set us apart from the Australian Labor Party and give those 4.9 million members of the automobile associations around Australia a very good reason to vote for the Liberal and National parties whenever the next election is held. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to turn to the waterfront and just briefly express my disappointment and outrage at the way in which this Government has stopped the Australian Wheat Board and the Grains Council of Australia from enabling the Aegean Dolphin-a ship that was to have unloaded grain at the Brisbane grain handling terminal recently-from using non-Waterside Workers Federation labour, as was the original plan. The Australian Wheat Board agreed with the Grains Council of Australia and the Brisbane grain handling terminal people that Waterside Workers Federation employees would not be used for the first time on the unloading of grain at the Brisbane grain terminal. The Government stepped in and said, `We cannot have this. The Waterside Workers Federation people are our mates. We cannot have them being cut out of a job'. So it heavied the Australian Wheat Board, particularly the Chairman of that Board, and forced it to renege on the agreement that it had with the Grains Council of Australia and to re-employ those Waterside Worker Federation people on the waterfront when that grain was being unloaded. </PARA>
<PARA> I was up there the other day looking at that very terminal and I was informed by the people who operate the terminal that the Waterside Workers Federation employees are absolutely and utterly unneeded for the tasks for which they are allegedly employed. Indeed, most of them sit around; some of them wash their cars; some of them read the newspapers; and some of them just lie about and sunbake; but none of them actually does anything. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member that, in the case of the unloading of grain at the Brisbane grain terminal, as is the case throughout Australia at present, those people are not needed for this task. As a consequence, the Government is imposing an additional cost on grain growers throughout Australia of about $20m each and every year. I believe that that is outrageous, particularly when Australia is in urgent need of extra export income due to our current account deficit, which is reaching record high levels. So this Government is engaged in the business of propping up the trade union rorts that have gone on in the waterfront for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the Government's reaction to the report of the Inter-State Commission on reforms on the waterfront we will see further evidence of that. The Inter-State Commission's recommendations, whilst not perfect from my point of view, were certainly achievable and workable and would have delivered significant benefits to the Australian economy. Unfortunately, the Government reneged on the Inter-State Commission's recommendations. It has watered them down in key areas such as enterprise employment which would have given employers on the waterfront the opportunity to hire and fire people who work on the waterfront, which is currently denied them. The Government backed away from picking up that recommendation. It also backed away from compulsory stand-downs and compulsory redundancy recommendations by the Inter-State Commission, which it said in its report were part of the key aspects of its whole package of reform on the waterfront and that if the Government did not pick them up the whole package would fail. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this has not stopped the Government spending $150m of taxpayers' money on redundancy payments to waterside workers who will be leaving the waterfront over the next three years. Indeed, a 55-year-old waterfront worker with 30 years experience will pick up 247 weeks of redundancy pay, paid for by the taxpayer, which represents a considerable amount of money. A State Rail Authority worker made redundant in the reforms that have taken place recently in New South Wales would enjoy only 26 weeks of redundancy pay. But if one happens to be a mate of the trade unions or this Government, one picks up 247 weeks of redundancy pay through the package which the Government is putting forward. Many people leaving the waterfront are reaching or are over 60 and normally would be retiring anyway. This Government is giving them an additional bonus, which will be well in excess of $100,000, plus their superannuation, so they can have a more comfortable retirement. All that is being paid for by the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Each and every Australian will be hurt as incomes are reduced because of the inefficient work practices that have existed on our waterfront for many years and which are being maintained by the Government, despite a lot of rhetoric about the need for reform on the waterfront. The Government's Appropriation Bill does nothing to help roads, which are collapsing throughout Australia, or make our waterfront more efficient. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget provisions for road funding have left the entire community of Australia aghast. The gross increase of the paltry sum of $120m for the entire road system of Australia is shameful. I refer to some figures which, I think, spell out very clearly the Government's inappropriate determination of road funding. We must bear in mind that the Government boasts a Budget surplus and, at the same time, receives an enormous increase in tax take. I refer to fuel tax in particular. When the present Government came to office the level of excise per litre of fuel was 6.155c, which yielded a total revenue of $970m. From that amount, the allocation to roads was $850.9m. The Budget provides for an excise on fuel of no less than 23.152c a litre, which will yield the enormous and staggering figure of $5,645m. From that enormous sum, the estimated allocation for roads for the current financial year will be only $1,333.2m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is trying to con the motorists of this country into believing that there has been an adequate allocation of funding. The truth is that the total allocation, compared with the tax take, is nothing more than a con. This country's roads are falling to pieces. Tremendous efforts are being made by State government, particularly the Government of New South Wales which, as a recourse, has had to impose a further fuel tax to try to prevent the total collapse of the road system in New South Wales. The reason for this rests squarely on the shoulders of the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Wherever one travels currently one finds the road system in chaos because maintenance cannot keep pace with its deterioration. With the weather conditions that have been experienced in the past nine months or so, there has been tremendous damage to most roads throughout Australia, particularly on the east coast. The Pacific Highway is one glaring example. One can travel for hundreds of kilometres and observe the tremendous damage which has been caused; yet there has been no special allocation made from the enormous sum of $5,645m that the Federal Government will rake in from the fuel tax to try to alleviate the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing could rate as a higher priority need, because of its relationship to the productivity of normal business in this country, than the transport of goods from one part of the country to another, particularly in key areas where there is an export content; yet we find the additional sum of only $120m being provided in the current financial year. The situation is deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the other level of road responsibility, that of local government, most local government bodies are struggling to maintain their road system. Both in my electorate and that of my colleague the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) local governments have no alternative but to revert long sections of road to gravel because there are no funds for the maintenance or upgrading of sealed road surfaces. This is a deplorable state of affairs. People are wondering what is wrong with this country that the Government cannot at least find the finance for such essential purposes. All the councils in my electorate face this dilemma. In particular, the council of the shire of Kyogle has an enormous length of both local and main roads within its boundaries. The rate levels are astronomical. The ratepayers cannot be expected to contribute additionally to the current rating in that shire. The same applies to the shire of Richmond River and to all the local government bodies throughout both the Richmond and Clarence valleys on the north coast of New South Wales. Those councils have appealed for additional funding. They have endeavoured, in a proper and meaningful way, to put forward a case for adequate funding to meet the very difficult circumstances confronting them; yet the Government turns its back on this particular aspect of the public need. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remaining time available, I just want to say that there are other very worrying issues in the transport and communications area. The current pilots strike is an enormous one. It is crippling most of Australia and certainly country areas, except where commuter air services continue to operate, are at a great disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> But the real issue for the whole of Australia is the debacle concerning Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and the provision of an additional runway. There is no way that air transport in this country can adequately serve the needs of both the internal sector and the enormous tourist industry, which is so dependent on international flights, unless the Government faces up to the responsibility of speeding up the construction of an additional runway at Sydney Airport. We find go-slow tactics in all the procedures that the Government has promised to undertake. </PARA>

There is a total absence of that. We find the media carrying reports saying that there are hidden documents. It is now found that it is going to cost another $600m. Surely these are issues that ought to be cleared up and cleared up quickly. This is a consequence of a media report, only at the weekend. I have not seen it rebutted. I have not seen any positive action taken to give confidence to the community that that report is inaccurate. I certainly do not place much credence in the report. Nevertheless that is the impression that the public has of what the Government is doing in this important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, the dilemma facing the television industry in Australia is of enormous proportion. The people who must be considered in it are the members of the public-the viewers, those who require television as part and parcel of their everyday life, and the advertisers and shareholders of the respective television companies. We have a mishmash of legislation which has created an enormous debacle. It may well be true that there has been some management ineptness in the television area. But that and that alone is not responsible for the dire circumstances that now face the television industry in this country. What has the Minister done? He says, `We are considering legislation; we may have some further legislation'. There is no definitive statement, no positive action. In the meantime million and millions of dollars are being squandered because of the dilemma to which no-one has a clear answer, unless the Government takes cognisance of the situation and is positive in its approach to this important issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to add a few words in the debate on these estimates because it seems to me that it is in this area as much as any that Australia is floundering. Last night and during the last few weeks we have heard about various so-called initiatives of the Government relating to the airline dispute. As I suggested then, there is a solution. The solution is not lying in anything that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is doing at the moment. The reality is that the accord has floundered. The industrial relations club, in trying to maintain a flawed system, is pursuing rhetoric which is designed to inhibit the return of airline operations to normal. Whatever the prospects, they are all in tomorrow land and not there for today. I do not intend to talk about that dispute today. Last night I offered a three-point proposal which I would suggest in the light of re-examination remains a positive and valid way by which the airlines could be put in the air, again, and put in the air immediately. There are many other methods of transporting goods around Australia that I want to deal with in the few minutes available to me. I revert to a report that was produced by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) earlier this year on behalf of the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Mining Industry Council, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the National Farmers Federation. In that report it was quite satisfactorily established that unless there are major reforms in the transport sector in Australia there are going to be continuing losses in employment and a loss in productivity that Australia can ill afford. That particular report suggested that while there would be some loss of employment in the transport sector through a reduction in manning levels as a result of reforms-we are seeing something of that in New South Wales-the reality is that on IAC projections there would be an additional 17,000 jobs created if the reforms that I will talk about in a moment were pursued, investment would rise by 4 per cent, real wages would rise by 2.5 per cent and the Government surplus would rise by $1 billion. This could be taken as a tax cut of 3 per cent in the longer term. In other words, in the sector of transport there is available to the Government an immediately applicable way by which it could boost the domestic surplus and stimulate productivity in the Australian economy. Sadly, it is not doing so. Of course, that is not the only recommendation. If we can save $3.2 billion a year, surely the Government should be doing something about it. Neither in the field of micro-economic reform nor in the elimination of unnecessary regulations is the Government doing anything except talk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is regrettable that as far as the road transport, rail transport, coastal shipping and waterfront handling sectors of our economy are concerned the Government has been long on rhetoric and very short on action. We are told that reform of the waterfront, coastal shipping and ports could provide 27 per cent of savings or between $800m and $1.1 billion, with a 20 per cent improvement in productivity, while cheaper international shipping could yield 15 per cent of the savings or $400m. There is little doubt that as far as Australia is concerned the whole of the transport sector is not operating as efficiently as it could. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who spoke earlier in this debate, I would suggest to the House that the Government needs to seriously examine ways by which something can be done to stimulate the development of the rail transport sector. I believe that the way to approach it is not through Australian National but through a cooperative freight movement organisation, which I suggest could have capital injected not just from Australian National or from the main State rail authorities but from those major transport companies such as TNT Ltd, Brambles Transport Services that to date have been handling much of the freight forwarding around Australia. If we set up such an interline group we may be able to overcome some of the difficulties that still continue because of differing rail gauges and the different work practices that apply within the different rail sectors. If we had such a goods movement group which was designed to coordinate freight movement around Australia, then on the summaries that have been produced not just from the IAC but from the Inter-State Commission and various individuals, all of which satisfy me that significant improvements could be obtained, I believe that Australia would be much better off. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to understand that it was the first Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that suspended the railway main line upgrading project introduced by the previous coalition government. If we look at the figures we will find that the railways are contributing a significant sum of money by way of diesel excise. In 1987-88, $118m was paid by railways around Australia through fuel excise. Of that money $32m was put into road transport funds and only $3m was spent by way of rail investment. While representing regional and rural areas I am appalled by the state of the roads and the misleading information from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) suggesting that road funds are increasing. I say to him that it is not only necessary to allocate more funds for roads because of the deteriorating state of our roads and the wet weather which has so affected them in the last 12 months but also essential that we look at restoring to the railways for capital works particularly in the south-east sector some part of that rail fuel excise payment which at the moment is being largely diverted into Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that that program was introduced under a previous conservative government by my former colleague, Peter Nixon, and provided sums up to $70m a year which enabled the first major upgrading of the network in the south-east sector since about 1927. Apart from some electrification and some work on signals, there has been very little work done in the south-east sector since then. Every analysis that I have read suggests that unless there can be significant sums allocated railways are going to continue to be inefficient. All of us know that we cannot even carry the number of carriages or the weight of rail freight that one might wish through the western network from Sydney to Parkes because of the tunnels and the bends on the rail system which have not been designed to meet the requirements of modern transport movement. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to do is not just talk about the problems and not just accept that people have produced reports which suggest there could be an improvement in productivity. We must recognise that there has to be money spent to upgrade the rail network. There has to be an analysis made to try to determine how we can upgrade our road and rail sector as well as our coastal shipping and our goods handling at the waterfront or Australia is going to continue to fall behind. </PARA>
<PARA> By any international comparison, Australian railways are totally non-competitive with systems in North America and Europe. Frankly, they are way behind those in countries such as Japan. Railways are a major method of carrying many goods, not just coal and wheat. They are also a very efficient means by which we can remove some of the noise pollution and traffic hazards that apply on our highways at the moment. It is essential that the Government start addressing the problem of upgrading our rail movements to a degree that would accommodate some of the gains that the Business Council, the Chamber of Manufactures and the National Farmers Federation found to be attainable through the IAC's recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA> In closing his remarks the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson) referred to the third runway at Mascot. The matter does not just involve the airline pilots dispute. The Government is attempting deliberately to delay the construction of a third runway at Mascot. It has only just started an environmental impact study. It is essential that a third runway be built as soon as possible. A coalition government would not only examine and implement some of the IAC's recommendations with respect to rail movement, but also ensure that a third runway is built as soon as possible. If people around Australia want to understand how the Government has failed in the transport sector they can get no better example than the Government's preparedness, through the intervention of the Prime Minister, to address air transport problems while taking no action in other areas. Frankly, unless something is done, Australia's productivity will continue to be less competitive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly what I was going to say in my response. It is obvious that there is a great deal of acceptance of the new restructuring in the telecommunications field with the formation of Telecom Australia, OTC Ltd and Aussat Pty Ltd as government business organisations. Obviously, too, there is a great degree of satisfaction in the chamber with the degree of service that they are delivering. I take the silence of honourable members as endorsement of the wonderful work that is being done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that honourable members would be as appalled as I was by the comments of the telecommunications spokesman in the other place with respect to Telecom being one of Australia's great sheltered workshops. I know that members of the National Party of Australia would be horrified about that because often in other debates in here they have said how important it is that Telecom be in the bush delivering a very good community service. Again, in consideration of this legislation, I place on the record the acceptance of the fine job that those government business enterprises are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to some of the issues that have been raised in this debate, one that recurred constantly was that of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA) and the third runway. I begin my comments on that by saying quite categorically that the Government has made a commitment to adopt proper procedures towards the goal of implementing a third runway. There have been no deliberate tactics to delay, stall or anything else an environmental impact statement at Kingsford-Smith Airport. However, the Government is committed to proper legal procedures being followed to ensure that people in the environs of Kingsford-Smith Airport have an opportunity to pursue this issue through all the appropriate channels. I will go through those channels in a moment, but there would be nothing worse than not following those procedures because-as I am sure the Opposition spokesman at the table, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) could confirm-if they are not, the building of that runway will be held up in the courts for years, as has happened in Frankfurt. Recently I gave an address at Kingsford-Smith Airport and I spoke to many of the operators. One of the representatives from Qantas Airways Ltd came up to me and told me that the Government must follow proper legal procedures because the airline operators did not want to be involved in a fiasco such as the one at Frankfurt. That is what the Government is doing. We are on track. We are keeping to our timetable commitment, but we have to abide by proper legal procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not just relying on the environmental impact statement and all those procedures. We are not sitting on our hands at KSA. Instead, we are engaging, through the Federal Airports Corporation, the Civil Aviation Authority and the airline operators at Kingsford-Smith Airport, in a major capital works upgrade at the airport over the next three years. In that time, we will spend almost half a billion dollars at that airport, leaving aside any third runway work. That is an enormous contribution. Over the next few years the airport will look something like a construction site. Only yesterday I had some discussions with the Chief Executive of the Federal Airports Corporation. I discussed with him the impact of the pilots dispute. He said that undoubtedly it was causing problems but the Corporation was taking advantage of the situation to get on with a lot of construction work at Kingsford-Smith Airport. That is no consolation for those affected by the dispute, but I am trying to demonstrate that we are on the job there. Next month I will turn the first sod of a major development in the international terminal area. </PARA>
<PARA> The other way in which we are approaching constructively improvements in conditions at Kingsford-Smith Airport is by initiating a review of traffic management arrangements. It is quite clear that traffic at KSA has to be managed much better. We commissioned a report. It is now out for industry comment and those comments will return to the Government for a decision. In all those areas we are looking in future to having a better managed airport, with more money being put into capital works at KSA. In the longer term we hope for a third runway, but proper procedures will be followed. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area to look at in the provision of appropriate aviation management in the Sydney basin is Badgerys Creek. That development is going ahead at the same time. Even with the construction of a third runway at KSA, a major airport at Badgerys Creek will still be required in the early years of the next century. Accordingly, the Government has decided to keep its commitment to commence the phased development of the new airport at Badgerys Creek. The Government is accelerating the acquisition of the remainder of properties on the Badgerys Creek site with a view to completing acquisition at the end of this year. Acquisition is being undertaken under the provisions of the new Lands Acquisition Act and landholders at Badgerys Creek have been written to advising them of this and the Australian Property Group has issued pre-acquisition declarations to landowners to begin the acquisition process. This is a four-pronged approach to try to resolve the problems at Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> After all the comments that I have heard in this debate on the problems at KSA, particularly from members of the National Party, one could think that they all happened over- night. In reality, we are getting on with the job of dealing with the problems, but they have been around for a very long time. It has taken this Government's action to get on with the job of solving them. In reality, of course, we will not solve this problem overnight. I do not think we will be able to see great improvement for probably six months to a year. Nevertheless, progress is being undertaken at all levels in everything from construction to traffic flow. But there has to be a multi-pronged approach to solving the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> One other issue that is of great concern to every member of this Parliament is the current pilots dispute. All sorts of solutions to the problem have been put forward in this debate, some of them helpful, some of them not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My responsibility in this area of my portfolio is to ensure safety rather than getting involved in the job of telling the employers in this area what to do. I would like to say a little bit in this debate about the issue of safety. In a dispute like this members of the public must feel assured that safety standards will be maintained in respect of the services that are being offered-and we are doing everything we can to keep a service going in this country. Certain standards must be met by all operators and by any State government that wants to get involved. These standards must always be adhered to in order to ensure safety. This Government maintains that the safety standards will definitely be met. There is no question of permitting expediency to override safety. Operators and crews of foreign aircraft will conform to the Civil Aviation Act, its regulations and orders. The onus for demonstrating compliance with regulatory requirements rests obviously with the operator. All contractual arrangements of an operational or maintenance nature have to be approved by the Civil Aviation Authority. While foreign aircraft are being operated by foreign-licensed air crew, appropriate operational, flight crew and airworthiness requirements will be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian public can rest assured that not only is this Government doing what it can to maintain basic services around this country but also safety will not be compromised in any way at all. As Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, rather than get involved-as the Opposition has done-with gratuitous comments about the strike, my job is to get on with the job of trying to ensure the safety of those who are able to fly. This morning Sir Peter Abeles made some comments that I found interesting. Sir Peter said that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), had got his facts wrong in claiming that the airlines were caving in to the pilots. He said that there had been no consultation with him and offered the honourable member the opportunity to discuss the matter with him before opening his mouth in the future. I hope that the honourable member takes that advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue of some interest in Parliament is waterfront reform. Comments about the Aegean Dolphin generally reflect the Opposition's confrontationist attitude to industrial relations matters. The Government has initiated an agreed process of negotiation among the waterfront industry parties aimed at achieving an agreement with significant reforms of the industry. The National Farmers Federation and the Grains Council of Australia rejected invitations to join the negotiating process, choosing instead to maintain strident and unproductive criticisms through the media. Fortunately, sanity has prevailed. Rather than pursuing a confrontationist approach, the Australian Wheat Board decided that the proper course was to maintain current employment arrangements and for the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority to extend its negotiations to include the grain terminals. Agreement was reached that in the process priority would be given to Fisherman Island and Port Kembla, with a conclusion to be reached by 30 October. Again, this reflects the attitude of the Opposition in its approach to industrial relations: confrontation first, discussion second and facts a long way third. </PARA>

As the honourable member for Herbert said, the Minister should be congratulated for that increase. National Party speakers in this debate, most of whom are from New South Wales, were obviously concerned about the lack of attention that roads receive from the New South Wales Government. The problems may also have been caused by a previous Federal government. However, the fault definitely does not lie with this Government under which, despite the rhetoric of the Opposition, funding has increased in real terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has given real increases to local government as well, recognising its special needs in this area. By any objective measure, the Hawke Government's contribution since it has been in office has been higher than that of any other single Federal government. It is still 21 per cent on average in real terms ahead of the contribution of the Fraser Government. The National Party has about five different policies on roads. It will be interesting to see which one wins. Senator Stone is on record as saying that there should be no increases at all. He says that the country cannot afford it. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) said that obviously there should be an increase, and he repeated that today, as did his other colleagues from the National Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in the second reading debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 I made reference to the Government's 30 or so training schemes which are, for the most part, useless. The extraordinary thing is that almost everybody in Canberra knows this. All the people in the Public Service know that most of these training schemes are useless. The Auditor-General certainly does. The Department of Employment, Education and Training knows that the schemes do not perform their desired function, although this does not stop it dreaming up new schemes. The only two people in Canberra who are oblivious to the fact that the Government's training programs are virtually worthless are the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan). This duo is the mastermind of social engineering that this Government is trying to implement with its training schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States complain about the schemes, even electing to stay out of them from time to time. Local government complains about the schemes, and genuine welfare agencies, such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence, have clearly exposed the uselessness of many of the programs. But the extraordinary thing is that, as each expensive training scheme is exposed for its failings, an even more useless and more expensive program is put in its place. As far as training schemes are concerned, the Government is sitting at the table of the Mad Hatter's tea party. The acronyms ABOUND: CRAFT, ATS, SAT, ITS, Jobtrain, Jobstart, Newstart, Skillshare, NEIS-and so it goes on and on. The brave new world of social engineering has invented and perpetuated all these training schemes, most of which do not achieve their stated objective of getting the unemployed and disadvantaged into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence abounds of the failure of these schemes. Since my speech during the second reading debate on the Budget two reports by the Auditor-General-one on Jobstart and one on the Commonwealth rebate for apprentice fulltime training (CRAFT)-have been tabled in this House. The Jobstart program is alleged to assist the long-term unemployed gain access to employment through the provision of wage subsidies to employers. This is what the Auditor-General had to say about it:</PARA>
<PARA> Departmental procedures may not have ensured equity of access for all categories of participants . . . Some Commonwealth employment service offices had not arranged visits to employers' premises to ensure employers were adhering to Jobstart agreements and to monitor participants progress . . . No evidence was available that the views of Jobstart participants were sought or analysed . . . Reasons for high dropout rates have not yet been determined. </PARA>
<PARA>Incredibly enough, there was no attempt to establish the reasons for the high dropout rates from the program. What is the point of having the program unless the dropout rates are low? The Department did not even bother to determine why the dropout rates were so high. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General advised that the Department agreed that there was a need for review of Jobstart to determine whether it was meeting the needs of the long term unemployed. It is incredible. The Department agrees there is a need to review its own program, which is not working. If ever proof was needed that this Government's training schemes did not work it could hardly come from a better place than the Government's own bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Auditor-General had to say about CRAFT, the Commonwealth rebate for full-time apprentice training, allegedly designed to promote improvement in the apprenticeship system and the quality of training provided by employers:</PARA>
<PARA>Procedures for assessment, timely payment and review of entitlements were inadequate. . . . The processing and payment of claims . . . was inordinately slow. . . . Productivity standards had not been developed. . . . Action had not been taken to obtain an assurance of the integrity and security of the . . . data base although administration of the scheme relied on its accuracy. . . . Adequate statistical data had not been collected . . . to assist in the monitoring and evaluation of program performance. </PARA>
<PARA>In all, the Auditor-General, in the report that was tabled in the House last week, found no less than 19 serious faults in the administration of the CRAFT program. </PARA>
<PARA> As if this is not enough, the Minister for Employment and Education Services found himself under such criticism yesterday of his own Newstart scheme that he arranged a dorothy dix question. However, he was very much on the defensive in his response. This is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA>there were criticisms of the fact that Newstart participants were unsuitable employees in the automotive industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Is it a fact that his former Senior Private Secretary, Mr Syd Hickman, who resigned on 14 October 1988, set up a consultancy firm called Arvin Consultancy Pty Ltd? Did this firm register barely two weeks later to become the lobbyist for the Transfield Group, of which Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd (AMECON) is a member? In view of the fact that certain information, called deliver- ables, which includes costings, was made available by Australian Warships Systems, the other tenderer, between September 1987 and October 1988, can the Minister give an assurance that Mr Hickman at no stage had access to commercially sensitive information from companies competing with AMECON, and that Mr Hickman did not use knowledge gained while he was the Minister's Senior Private Secretary to give his new employers commercial advantage?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rather thought that this question would come a bit earlier since I understand that it was raised in the Senate a few months ago. It has taken the honourable member a while to get around to it. I make a couple of points. The first is this: any arrangements between any company now organised by Mr Hickman, the Transfield Group or any other group, is a matter for a commercial relationship between them. If the honourable member wants to know the status of their relationship, I suggest he ask either one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is this: at the time that Mr Hickman received an invitation to be a consultant for a variety of companies doing business with the Department of Defence, he informed me of the invitation and immediately excluded himself from all work in my office related to defence contracts. The moment he told me that he intended to take up the offer to establish consultancies he left my office. The fact is that at no point did he have access to any tender documents. That is obviously the case for one simple reason: it was some months later that the tenders closed and were placed before the Department of Defence. It was some months after that that the final negotiating process produced the best and final offer. The fact is that tender documentation and that type of thing do not revolve through the office of the Minister for Defence. Recommendations based on the analysis of the Department of Defence on tender related documentation do, of course, but no such documentation could conceivably have come into my office at that point. The simple fact is that tenders had not closed.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot be certain of the particular information Mr Hickman had access to in the period in which he was in my office except that it could not have related to the final tender process, which simply had not been concluded, the documentation not being in. He conducted himself-though this is not required by ministerial staff-in exactly the same way that a public servant would have done in equivalent conditions and in exactly the same way that ministerial consultants for people on both sides of this House have done, not only since we have been in office but also in the time of government of those opposite. Mr Hickman has had no access to tender documentation. It could not have arisen in any way out of his private secretarial duties to me, given the time that he left the office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government, of course, strongly supports the calls from regional Latin American countries and the United States (US), the countries that have the most direct interest in a solution to the crisis in Panama. Their calls have been for the peaceful and constitutional restoration of democracy. We as a government view with grave concern the installation in Panama on 31 August of a President and a Vice-President whose support comes not from the Panamanian people but from General Noriega. Senator Gareth Evans, in a statement on 16 May, made clear Australia's concerns about the situation in Panama following the election on 7 May. Despite evidence of widespread electoral fraud and malpractice by the regime, the Opposition candidate, Mr Endara, appeared to have received more than two-thirds of the vote. But the election result was annulled on 11 May. Subsequent efforts by the Organisation of American States to negotiate an orderly transfer of power leading to free and fair elections have been unsuccessful in the face of General Noriega's determination to maintain control of the Panamanian Government. The new Noriega appointed regime has been rejected by the Organisation of American States, the European Community and many other governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said in a press release on 1 September, the Australian Government calls on those in power in Panama to recognise the undemocratic nature of their current position and the harm that that is doing to the economic and social fabric of the country. The other matter which is particularly disturbing from our point of view is that General Noriega, along with leading Colombian drug cartel members, was indicted by a US Federal Grand Jury on 4 February 1988 on multiple narcotics trafficking offences. These factors underline the threat posed by international drug trafficking to democratic principles and the rule of law, a matter which is of particular concern to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So that the Leader of the Opposition can understand what I think is understood by just about everyone else in the community, I say that there is no question on the part of the airlines that they will be seeking any compensation for any losses that they have suffered. As I have already indicated to the House and publicly, Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia have put it on record, by letter to me at the end of last week, that they want the Government to give consideration to meeting the position of their non-pilot employees, who may otherwise have to be stood down. I said at the beginning of the dispute and also when I received these letters that that is something to which we would give consideration. To this point the Cabinet has not considered this matter. I have indicated the Government regrets very deeply that the tourist industry is suffering inconvenience caused by the actions of the pilots, which essentially the Opposition endorses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not surprising that Opposition members should support the pilots because the pilots are supporting the Opposition's industrial relations policy. It is a quid pro quo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position is that the tourist industry, in some circumstances I understand, unfortunately has been forced to stand people down. It has been able to do that. The two airlines are not in a position where they can readily stand down people who would otherwise have been fully employed were the operations in full swing. In those circumstances it is legitimate for the airlines to put this issue on the table because it is important that everything be done by government, by the airlines and by the trade union movement to keep a skeletal service going as much as we can and through time to build up that service.</PARA>
<PARA> What is disturbing the pilots, the Opposition and its friends in the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is that the careful strategy of the airlines, of the Government and of the trade union movement, in rigorously combating this avaricious claim of the pilots, is working. Our actions are the result of the careful strategy that we have pursued from the beginning of this dispute when we said on the part of the Government, `We will do all that we can'. That has included making available a significant section of capacity from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). That has included facilitating the bringing into Australia of foreign aircraft and foreign pilots. In that way and with what is happening now-the gradual signing up of former airline employees, members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots-we are moving to a situation where, with a combination of the RAAF, of foreign aircraft and of foreign pilots, in the not too distant future we will have planes of Australian Airlines and Ansett flying, manned by their own employees. That is something which is worrying the gruesome twosome: the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and the Opposition in this Parliament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I was provided with a copy of the latest report on revenue statistics of member countries by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published in Paris late last week. The latest comparative statistics are for 1987 and show that Australia has the fourth lowest tax share to gross domestic product (GDP) of all 24 OECD countries. These statistics are well recognised as the most accurate measures available because they incorporate all additional levies, such as specific social security charges, indirect taxes, et cetera. The total tax share of GDP in Australia is 31.3 per cent. That figure compares with an OECD average of 38.8 per cent. There are only three countries lower than Australia: Japan with a tax share of 30.2 per cent, the United States of America with 30 per cent and Turkey with 24 per cent. All three countries are recognised as having a substantially lower provision of public services than does Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, by international standards Australia is a low tax country or, more accurately, a very low tax country. For the information of the House I table the chart from the OECD publication. The same chart published in 1982-before this Government came to office-showed Australia to be the seventh lowest tax country of the OECD member states. In that intervening period Switzerland, Portugal and Spain have all moved above Australia in the international taxing league table. More recent comparisons are not available but, since the Commonwealth's tax share is lower this financial year than in either 1986-87 or 1987-88, we can be confident that the Federal Government has contributed to sustaining Australia's position as a low tax country since 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason we are able to maintain that position-that is, to have Australia go from seventh lowest to fourth lowest tax country in the OECD-is that we have fiscal policy under control. When we came to office outlays were 30.1 per cent of GDP. This year they will be at 23.7 per cent. Excluding Medicare the ratio will actually be under 23 per cent. The Forward Estimates show that with the decisions already made outlays will track down to 22 per cent of GDP by 1992-93, as I have said on a number of occasions, to the average of the 1950s. It is this discipline over fiscal policy which will see Australia continue the progress it has made in slipping down the OECD tax table. Contrary to the myth perpetrated by the Opposition, Australia has an extremely well targeted and efficient welfare support system compared with the rest of the world. The countries which are below us have nothing like the safety net which we have.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a great contrast on fiscal policy between the Government and the Opposition. It is significant that since the Budget we have seen the Opposition shift its policy to endorse the Government's fiscal policy stance. As I pointed out a couple of days ago, the Opposition Leader now says that the $9.1m surplus brought down in the Budget is the right result. In his two major post-Budget speeches he has discarded his earlier commitment to tighten fiscal policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite hope that the Australian airlines will be faced with a situation where none of these pilots will sign up because that would suit their despicable purposes. They want to see a situation where the Federation of Air Pilots, which is following their policy, is successful. I have news for them. Those opposite can go on aiding and supporting, giving aid and comfort to the Pilots Federation. As I said, that is where they belong-in their grisly bed together; they deserve one another. I tell this House that the airlines, the Government and the trade union movement of this country, supported by the people of this country, will beat the Federation of Air Pilots if it insists on its outrageous claim and we will beat its attempt to wreck the Australian economy, in which efforts it has had the consistent support of this miserable Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and it relates to the pilots dispute. Is the Prime Minister or the Government aware of any substance to the claim of the shadow Minister for aviation and tourism, Mr Jull, that contracts being offered to pilots in fact reflect wage increases of 28 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member for his question because in the light of the question just asked by the honourable member for Fadden it is very appropriate. As I have had cause to say to this point, at every stage during this dispute the honourable member for Fadden, with the full support of the Leader of the Opposition, has given aid and comfort to the pilots; and he was about it again last night in his strange, convoluted way. He was out in the media last night saying that under the contracts that had been signed, the number of which he does not know-and I will not tell him-the pilots had got what they had been demanding: a 28.6 per cent increase. Let me just say at the outset that, as with every other intervention by the honourable gentleman in the Opposition, he is wrong. It illustrates again the total confusion that those opposite have on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that it is particularly rewarding to compare the comments made by the honourable member for Fadden with those made by Sir Peter Abeles, because this morning Mr Jull said that he spoke to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots last night. Sir Peter Abeles, the head of the Ansett organisation, made the point as to how disappointed he was that, by way of contrast to every previous shadow Minister for aviation, this shadow Minister for aviation had not bothered to contact him. In other words, completely consistent with the whole line of the honourable member for Fadden, he will talk to the Pilots Federation, but he will not talk to the airline industry and will rely for his continued sabotaging of the Australian economy on what he gets fed.</PARA>
<PARA> The first point to note in answering the assertion by the honourable member for Fadden is this: he should understand that both Sir Peter Abeles and Mr Ted Harris of Australian Airlines have strongly and completely refuted the claim made last night by the honourable member for Fadden. I will quote from the statement. Presumably even those behind and around the honourable member for Fadden might believe that Ted Harris and Sir Peter Abeles know more about what is in the contract than does the honourable member for Fadden. It is just conceivable that the people who are putting the contracts to the pilots may know better than the honourable member for Fadden about what is in the contracts. Let me quote the statement of Abeles and Harris. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>the new contracts offered to them (the pilots) are based on productivity increases and a base salary consistent with the wage fixing guidelines. The 28 per cent salary increase suggested by Mr Jull on the 7.30 Report is totally incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA>So those opposite have been whacked out of the ring yet again.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The abysmally incompetent shadow Minister for housing says, `How do we know that?'. I can only answer the abysmally incompetent shadow Minister for housing and his question, `How do we know that?', by saying that I know it because, if I am saying that he is totally incorrect, I am putting the statement of the Air Pilots Federation spokesman in this place, Mr Jull, against the statement of Sir Peter Abeles and Ted Harris. As is well know, I am a betting man; and I am prepared to wager with the honourable member for O'Connor that Harris and Abeles know better than Jull.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us go to the next area of confusion. The honourable member for Fadden talks about 68 stick hours per month. I wish the honourable member for Bradfield, who is next to the honourable member for Fadden, could take the grin off his face; it is very difficult, I know, but he should. This talk by the honourable member for Fadden of 68 stick hours per month, he might or might not know, is operationally impossible. Under the regulations, 68 stick hours per month is not possible. What were the average stick hours per month flown by Ansett pilots in the last year? They were 31 stick hours per month. The honourable member for Fadden is now talking about 68 hours. What is he on about? He has obviously got totally confused on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The second point is: does the honourable member for Fadden seriously believe that Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia would have gone to all the bother in this dispute just to give the pilots what they were asking for? The honourable member goes on national television and says there was this big dispute, the pilots were asking for 30 per cent and, in fact, the airlines have now given in to it. Only a person so besotted with his commitment to the Pilots Federation would say anything as stupid as that. Further, let me make the point that on 19 August the airlines' representatives told the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission:</PARA>
<PARA>If there are to be variations (to pilots conditions), such variations will be consistent with the national wage case principles set down in recent decision of this commission.</PARA>
<PARA>After all the revealed confusion of the honourable member for Fadden, it is not surprising that I conclude by saying: let us hear about the confusion that existed this morning'. During a four-minute interview-and it is not a bad achievement to contradict oneself so blatantly as this in a four-minute interview-the honourable member for Fadden, when referring to the new contract, said, `I don't think there is too much more productivity in that'. A minute later he said, `There are personal contracts with productivity bonuses in it, and that is fine'.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that from day one of this dispute the Opposition's policy and position have been marked by two things: firstly, total confusion and lack of knowledge about the facts and, secondly, a treacherous commitment to the position of the Federation. The Opposition has put its lot in. As I said, it has got in the grisly bed with the Federation because they are partners. It is implementing the Opposition's policy and in return the Opposition is supporting it. I say, `Good on you. Keep on doing it'. As long as the Opposition identifies itself with the Federation of Air Pilots against the interests of the Australian economy, it will remain where it is inevitably destined to remain-on the Opposition benches.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood that the honourable member had already been provided with a copy of it. Does the honourable member have it or not? I do not have a copy of it. What we have here is a continuing presentation or illustration of what the Opposition is prepared to do to support the pilots in this attack on the Australian economy. That is what it is about. We have had it from the honourable member for Fadden consistently over the past several days. On the one hand, he is decrying this Government for the damage being done to the tourism industry and, on the other hand, he has been making phone calls late at night getting updates from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. He asks, `Where are you up to? How many pilots have signed up? What is in the contract? Is it in accordance with the guidelines? Tell me quickly because I want to put up a question in the morning about it'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the duplicity that is going on in this place. He rings the pilots late at night and he is on the radio of a morning. The honourable member for Fadden has the contract but he cannot understand it because he does not understand the terms `duty time', on the one hand, and `stick time' on the other. The honourable member for Fadden cannot understand-and some of my colleagues will not believe this-the difference between duty time and stick time. The position is that Opposition members cannot understand what is involved in the negotiations between the pilots as individuals and their employers. They cannot understand the terms used. They are confused. All that is happening is that the individual pilots are pursuing the industrial relations policy of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We propose this matter of public importance to discuss essentially the pilots dispute. I say at the outset that last Thursday I wrote to the Speaker indicating that I wished to discuss a matter of public importance relating to the pilots dispute. It was clear to me through conversation with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) over the table that he was to follow me in that discussion. But as a consequence of the debate commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War, appropriately I believe, we mutually agreed that the discussion would be deferred. I would also hasten to add that there was no undertaking from the Prime Minister that we would engage in debate, but we mutually agreed to defer it. Having brought forward this matter today, I see by the attendance at the table of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) that the Prime Minister is not prepared to debate this issue, and it begs the question: Why? What has transpired between Thursday and today to make the Prime Minister flee the chamber without participating in this debate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for that. Quite apart from that, the harsh reality is that the most significant occurrence has been the statements by Sir Peter Abeles, both before and after his meeting with the Prime Minister last night, which represented a massive-indeed, monumental-backdown for this Prime Minister. The developments announced by him unquestionably can be interpreted that way. Bear in mind that it was this Prime Minister who, at the outset of the dispute, said that he would break the pilots, who said that he would declare war on the pilots, who denigrated the pilots, who brought in the Royal Australian Air Force and who allowed overseas aircraft to come here. But what has transpired?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has gone to the bunker while Sir Peter is having discussion with the people upon whom he declared war. So the reality is that there is no preparedness on the part of the Prime Minister following that backdown to come in and discuss the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say additionally at the outset that the current airline dispute is a shambles and a national economic disaster. It has been exacerbated by the words and actions of the current Prime Minister, both by the words I have just used in his traducing and his playing of politics and, of course, by his own talk of compensation for the airlines which has done nothing to solve the dispute. What has occurred is that Ansett Airlines of Australia has moved away from the nonsense in which he was engaging. In principle, Ansett is now doing what the Opposition has advocated all along-entering into voluntary contracts with the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> This dispute is the direct result of Labor's industrial relations system and the accord. The accord is doomed to failure, because it grants across the board wage increases irrespective of the needs of individuals and their employers and irrespective of productivity in the workplace. It hands down decisions on how much to pay people without having any means of knowing what they should be paid at the industry or enterprise level. It is inevitable that after years of pressure building up in such a rigid system many groups of employees and employers would want to settle wages and working conditions between themselves. Despite the failure of the Government's centralised system and despite the Prime Minister's politically inspired and inept exacerbation of the dispute, the shreds of a solution may now be emerging. Obviously, key elements of any solution are in the coalition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Prime Minister's failure to solve the dispute within the Government's industrial relations system heralds the end of the centralised wage setting system and spells the death knell for the accord. The dispute would not have happened under the coalition's industrial relations policy. Let it be remembered that under our industrial relations system the pilots and the airlines would have faced a choice: either they remained in the industrial relations system with effective enforcement provisions as outlined in the Bill introduced into the Senate by the coalition; or they negotiated a voluntary agreement, either on an individual basis or through a union, which was binding on both parties. If, for instance, the pilots and the airlines remained in our industrial relations system, wages would be set according to the circumstances in the industry, including productivity and competitiveness-that is, the Industrial Relations Commission would not be handing down wage decisions unrelated to the individual's workplace, as occurs under the accord. On the other hand, if the pilots and airlines choose to negotiate a voluntary agreement, any such agreement on wages and conditions would by necessity be based on productivity as well as taking proper account of other factors affecting the viability of the industry. In short, the wages and conditions would have to be affordable. The discipline ensuring that both parties reach an affordable outcome is the force of competition facing the industry. If they were to reach an unaffordable agreement the airlines would be forced out of business and the pilots would lose their jobs. To achieve a truly competitive airline industry, the coalition has always maintained, freeing up the labour market must go hand in hand with real competition within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate now on behalf of the Opposition that when in government we will act to ensure maximum competition in the domestic air industry and will ensure that there are no artificial barriers to entry, such as through restrictions on the use of domestic terminals. Furthermore, we will give serious considerations to permitting foreign airlines to operate domestic air services in Australia after the two-airline agreement expires. It would create a whole new series of pressures on both the airlines and the airlines' employees to behave in a totally different way. In short, a wage breakout by the airline pilots would not take place in the decentralised system advocated by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> For days, even weeks, the coalition has called upon both parties to enter into negotiations. Now at last Ansett Airlines is offering to negotiate voluntary agreements with the pilots. Moreover-surprise, surprise!-there is even talk of an enterprise based union for Ansett pilots. So it is clear that Ansett Airlines is grasping at elements of the coalition's industrial relations policy to find a way out of this dispute. It is clear that the only way out of the dispute is for negotiations between the airlines and the pilots, either individually or through the union. What a shambles we have had-a dispute caused by the Government's industrial relations policy inflamed by the Prime Minister's intervention and prolonged by the Government's talk of compensation to the airlines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By putting a bit of oomph into something the Minister is mutually exclusive. I would not start raving on about that, if I were him. It is obvious to all that the Government's system has led us into this chaos and the only way out is by our means. Ansett Airlines is negotiating contracts with individual pilots. What about Australian Airlines? Does that not raise a number of interesting points? Let me focus on one. Australian Airlines is after all now incorporated, with its shares held by the Government. In a sense it is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Government and therefore of the taxpayers. Clearly, the Government as the owner should encourage the management of Australian Airlines to begin negotiations with the pilots, either individually or through their union. All through this dispute the Government's behaviour regarding Australian Airlines has been strange, to put it mildly. From day one the Government, as the owner of the airline, could have encouraged Australian Airlines to open negotiations with the pilots. But no, it did not. The Government could have encouraged Australian Airlines to lead the way in opening negotiations. This does not mean that Australian Airlines should cave in to the pilots, or to anybody else for that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been an opportunity for the Government, through Australian Airlines, to give a lead. Now it is clear that the Government should encourage or even direct Australian Airlines to continue or to open, depending on how one interprets the Prime Minister's remarks, negotiations with the pilots. Negotiations with the pilots: is it not interesting? The Prime Minister constantly says that the Opposition is on the side of the pilots. We are not. We condemn this dispute and have throughout. We do not side with the pilots. So frequently in this place does the current Prime Minister raise this question in an increasingly agitated manner that it begs the question `Whose side is he on?'. He is certainly not on the people's side, nor on Australia's side. His behaviour has been erratic, his interventions ill judged and inflamed and, more than any other person, he is responsible for the exacerbation of the dispute and the damage that it is causing our nation. The irony of it all is that now he is trapped into supporting a form of settlement which will place a bomb in the basement of the outmoded system from which he has so long profited and to which he has for so long been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord has institutionalised inflation at about 7 per cent, created a rigidity within the labour market which is choking this country, created a very restless work force, and failed to deliver productivity improvements. The outmoded system is now seen for what it is-a brake on the productive capacity of the country. At last, by the settlement process now being mooted, it has been seen to fail, as has the accord throughout. The system and the accord have failed. It is the coalition's policy which is providing the way forward. It was to the coalition's policy that the Government should have turned from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA> If he were here the Prime Minister would rant and rave, agitate and perhaps salivate, seeking to condemn the Opposition, for there have been but two constants in his behaviour in this dispute-to traduce the pilots and to traduce the Opposition. He did it again today. Playing politics, he has completely overlooked the broad national good. He has not given a damn if this strike ruins hundreds and thousands of people. Oh no; he wanted to declare war on the pilots. Even when I said that, in the circumstances, bringing in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to seek to break the dispute was a worthwhile measure to allow a movement of people, he sought to play politics with that-not one cubit of concern about the broad national good. Had he still been President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions he would have been appalled had a Prime Minister behaved as he has done throughout this dispute. To hell with negotiation, to hell with settlement and to hell with Australia has been the standard of his behaviour. Some Prime Minister! Some failure! He has been on the wrong foot from the start and even at this stage there is total confusion in the community as to whether compensation is on or off. As late as midday today, when the program The World Today went to air, in answer to a question he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let's get it quite clear-</PARA>
<PARA>here is a conflict in terms!-</PARA>
<PARA>on this question of compensation. There is no suggestion that there will be any consideration of compensation for losses suffered by the airlines. The only matter which will be on the agenda, and I will take it for determination by my colleagues at an appropriate time, is whether the Government, in the unique circumstances of the airlines, should provide some recompense in respect of employees, in the airlines, who are not being stood down. </PARA>
<PARA>What the hell does that mean? If it is not payment to the airlines, what is it? If it is not a form of compensation, what is it? The confusion is abounding throughout the community. That point has continued the strike unquestionably. At root, this Prime Minister is not the national leader. He is a fix-it man, one who normally stitches up a deal. Even he has not been able to do this on this occasion. It is our economy and our nation that have suffered. The mooted settlement that came out has been a massive backdown for the Prime Minister. He has been on the wrong foot from the start. There has been nothing but a massive shift. He says, `Break the pilots, declare war, import airlines and use the RAAF'. Now, glory be, after all this time there are negotiations. The fix-it man has flunked it. The only people to suffer are the people of this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This dispute began almost eight or nine months ago when there were the first soundings from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. First, there was the 24-hour ambush dispute in February of this year, which was condoned by the Opposition. It said not one word. Then there was preparation such as would be given to a complex military manoeuvre for how the pilots would arrange the dispute, how they would comply with periods when they may be out of work, when there may be a dispute, what actions they would take and how they would prepare for it. It was a carefully planned, almost military type, attack on the economy and people of this nation. There was not a word from the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the pilots had negotiations with the airlines on each occasion they made it abundantly clear that they were not interested in negotiation in the usual definition of the word. They were interested in putting a gun to the head of the country by demanding that the airlines give them a 30 per cent increase in salary. They would accept nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA> They then moved to the next stage of their activity, which was to start to soften up the airlines by working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., at the same time saying that they did not want to disrupt the economy or the travelling public. The airlines responded by giving the pilots 24 hours to indicate whether they were prepared to carry out their obligations under their award. They did not give that undertaking. Some 24 hours later the pilots resigned en masse. As I understand it, many of those resignation forms were prepared in advance, undated, and then collected and dated by other people and lodged together. It was a carefully planned exercise by the people involved in an attempt to wreak maximum damage on their industry and this country, while at the same time escaping their obligations as employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout that exercise the Opposition said a range of things. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Government was right and should be supported in the course it followed. On the other hand, other members of the Opposition said it should be left to the pilots and the airlines to negotiate what they wanted, that they should sort it out among themselves. The Leader of the Opposition said something similar again later during the dispute. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), said that the pilots could not get what they wanted under the Opposition system. Opposition members continued to present conflicting views on what should be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it very clear that from the Government's point of view if the airlines had yielded to a demand for a 30 per cent increase in salaries from the pilots that would have been followed by a host of other organisations and groups of employees across industries. The result of that would have been massive wage inflation of the sort the Opposition put this country through in 1980-81; there would be a wage explosion, inflation and mass unemployment. In no way will this Government accede to those kinds of demands and allow that kind of wage breakout. </PARA>
<PARA> Some members of the Opposition said that it should be left to the pilots to sort it out themselves. Others said they should be able to get productivity gains. I say to those members of the Opposition who believe that the pilots should negotiate their own arrangements and leave it to the market to determine the matter and to get some productivity improvement that from discussions we had in recent days it is clear that there are 350, maybe 400, pilots too many. Someone might explain to me how, in a market with such an oversupply of pilots, a higher level of productivity would enable the market to give the pilots a 30 per cent increase in wages and salaries. That is a nonsense. But that effectively is what the Opposition is trying to present. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that what has been negotiated between the airlines and the pilots is new arrangements for each pilot and each airline. Those new arrangements include a considerable increase in effective, productive time of the pilot-hours at the stick, hours controlling aircraft. If the pilots want to work longer, they have the opportunity to earn overtime by engaging in longer hours of productive activity. What is happening here-the disruption, the damage that is being done-is the Opposition's policy in practice. The Leader of the Opposition referred to real competition in the industry and spoke of the two-airline agreement. The two-airline agreement is a product of the Opposition's creation. It is its agreement; it is its system; so it is very good of the Opposition at this stage to be trying to place on us responsibility for that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to contrast what would happen under the Opposition's policy of letting the system rip, of letting the pilots have what they want, the damage that would follow, with what has happened under this Government. The Opposition is obsessed with denigration of the accord, obsessed with having a reduction in industrial disputation. It is obsessed with a whole system of consultation between industry, the trade union movement and government and it wants this free-for-all system that it has referred to. The damage which it would wreak on the economy-the unemployment, the inflation, the collapse in growth, the collapse in the economy-is to be contrasted with the increase of one and a half million new jobs in the last 6 1/2 years; the record low level of unemployment in this country over the past seven years; the record rate of business investment; the stability; the growth which is occurring because we have had industry, trade unions and government exercising restraint; a 14 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs over the last 6 1/2 years because there has been a joint commitment to improvement, to stability, to consultation and restraint in wage costs, a restraint in wage levels. The Opposition seeks to destroy that and to go back to a free-for-all policy that could have only one result-the destruction of the economy, the collapse of growth and the loss of jobs such as we saw under the previous Government in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> If we turn to what is currently happening in the system, we see that the Leader of the Opposition asked why the Government had not fixed it. The industry is practising the Opposition policy but the Leader of the Opposition asked why the Government has not fixed it. Under the Opposition policy, there is no role for government. The honourable member for Bennelong wants pilots and employers to sort out their own arrangements. There is no role for governments at all. Under that policy, the responsibility for discussion is between the pilots and the airline concerned. The Opposition also asked why negotiations did not begin before. Negotiations and discussions between individual pilots and both airlines have been going on almost since the day of the first mass resignations. In this dispute, the Government has resisted demands for wage increases that would destroy the economy and hurt the people least able to defend themselves. We have sought to bring in additional aircraft from abroad. We have changed our policy in respect of international airlines operating in this country, enabling them to operate domestic services. We have utilised the services of the Royal Australian Air Force to provide some level of service-as I said previously, not sufficient or adequate but preferable to the damage that would be done to the economy and to this nation had the Government yielded to the pilots' demands as the Opposition has exhorted us to do. That is really what the Opposition has been about throughout this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently we have the provision of something like 13 per cent of normal air services. That does not help everybody but it enables the people most needing to move to travel by air. Some 16 international airlines are helping to move people on domestic services. I believe, with some optimism, that some of our own domestic aircraft will be back in service within a matter of days. Both airlines are bringing in foreign-registered aircraft to commence domestic services in this country. Both airlines have indicated that they have signed up qualified pilots with the endorsements that they need to operate their aircraft. The numbers have not yet been stated but, as I said, there is now a sign of optimism and the opportunity for both airlines to look to some resumption of services. That has been done at considerable inconvenience to people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout this campaign by the pilots support, succour and encouragement has been given by the Opposition to the Pilots Federation. There is not a role for the Federation. Pilots have resigned but the Pilots Federation, the group that is controlling this whole operation, is in regular contact with the Opposition. It has been given support and encouragement by the Opposition. I do not need to assert that. Anybody who has read in Hansard the statements made in this Parliament over recent days or has listened to the statements of members of the Opposition can draw his own conclusion. It is abundantly clear that their comments, criticisms and statements, by their nature, are designed to give encouragement to the pilots and the actions they are undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not countenance that attack upon Australia or the Australian economy. It is a case of crocodile tears when the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) stands up here and asks questions about the damage being done to tourism and that evening is on the phone talking to the Federation: `How are you going? Have they got any of your side up? Has anybody cracked?'. The next morning those opposite say, `What a terrible lot of damage is being done to the tourism industry'. That is the utter hypocrisy of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has no intention of yielding to the demands of the pilots. The negotiations now going on between the individual pilots and the airlines are matters for them to follow through. The airlines have given assurances to the Industrial Relations Commission and this Government that the terms of contracts will be within the guidelines of the national wage case. We will continue to try to improve the alternative and supplementary services that are currently available to minimise the disruption that is going on, but under no circumstances will this Government give in to the demands put upon the economy and the airlines by the Pilots Federation with the support of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an ironic and irrelevant performance we have just had from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris). It is ironic that a man who was at some stage the Minister for Transport is in here defending the Government's performance in a transport dispute when he was moved from that portfolio because of his failure to accommodate the requirements of some of the more significant players. It is also irrelevant because, as Pamela Williams has reported in the Australian Financial Review on behalf of Mr Kelty on a number of occasions, the Minister for Industrial Relations is not part of the main game when it comes to industrial relations, and he certainly has not been part of the main game when it comes to this industrial dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This dispute has been run by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and we should have the butcher and not the block in here today to explain the Government's position. But we should be grateful in one respect that we do not have the Prime Minister here. The Minister is going through the motions-the same old tired lines: `The Opposition is in bed with the pilots'. That is absolute rubbish. Everybody knows that we have consistently called on the pilots to go back to work. More relevant questions for the Minister and the Prime Minister are: who are they in bed with? Who do they spend most time on the telephone with? Who spends most time in their offices? Is it the employers or the employees? How many discussions has the Government had with Mr McCarthy and how does that stack up with the number of discussions the Prime Minister has had with Sir Peter Abeles, Mr Strong and others involved in the dispute?</PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the Government's big propaganda approach to the whole issue is that this is the coalition's fault. Let me give the Minister and the Government some news. They are in power. They have the treasury bench. They are running the so-called industrial relations policy of this country at the present time. This dispute is caused by the Government's policy. But, of course, it is not the Government's policy. The Prime Minister does not set the industrial relations policy of this country. It is not set by the Cabinet, and it is certainly not set by the Minister for Industrial Relations, who is at the table. All of us on this side of the House know who it is set by. It is set by Mr Kelty and Mr Crean. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been interesting in regard to this dispute to know who has been in the Prime Minister's office: as I said, not Mr McCarthy, but Mr Kelty has been in there. He is not a party to the dispute. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots is not part of the Australian Council of Trade Unions but Mr Kelty has been in the Prime Minister's office. He has been there in a big way. Why? Because the Government's actions in the whole dispute have been designed to prop up the accord and to prop up Mr Kelty. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the facts of this dispute, which are clear and straightforward. The dispute was caused by the accord. That is simple and clear. It was caused by the Government's wages policy. It was inflamed by the Prime Minister. He rushed up to it, doused it with petrol, threw a match into it and walked away. He has been belligerent, he has been aggressive and he has made some incredibly stupid statements. The dispute has been prolonged by the compensation carrot that, as late as midday today, the Prime Minister was still waving around in the air. There has been no commitment to meaningful discussions while some people thought that compensation was on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing more than this dispute and the Prime Minister's actions reveal the inadequacy of the Government's policy, the inadequacy of its strategy and the inadequacy of the Prime Minister. The accord is a centralised system; it is rigid and inflexible. At the very outset it prevented the parties getting together to settle the dispute. The dispute would not have occurred had there been a more flexible decentralised wage system in this country-a system that the coalition has advocated for years. </PARA>
<PARA> This dispute would have been far less costly to the Australian people had the Prime Minister not been so stupid and aggressive. We see evidence of that here in this chamber today. Normally there is standing room only in the public galleries. Today they are virtually empty. Why? Because people cannot get here. The tourist industry is paying a price of $36m a day and the Prime Minister is not prepared to come to the chamber to justify and explain his attitudes and tell us what he will do to solve the dispute. The bottom line is that he is in power, he was keen to get in there and kick the pilots, he is the one who declared war, and he is the one who said that the pilots are only bus drivers. The Prime Minister learned to fly in seven hours. It is a wonder he is not out there captaining a 767. It is a wonder he is not at the stick himself. Where is he now? He is not prepared to debate the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very interesting thing is the double standards of the Prime Minister-the workers' mate. He may not agree with the pilots or like what they are saying but he ought to be talking to them. This is the man who claims that he is interested in conciliation and consensus. Where is the conciliation and consensus in his approach to this dispute? Nowhere at all. The Government did not want a peaceful resolution to this dispute. It set out with three objectives: to break the pilots; to maintain the accord at any cost, no matter what the cost to the tourist industry or the average Australian; and to stop negotiations. The reality is that the Government has failed. It has not broken the pilots; the accord is dead-let me say that clearly and categorically-and the Government has not stopped negotiations. Otherwise, what are the airlines doing?</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Government's approach was stupid, irresponsible and costly. The Prime Minister's motives in this whole issue are questionable, and one wonders whether the country is being run on a political agenda again. He talked about bringing in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The RAAF arrived and carried 2 per cent of the normal passenger load. Then there was interlining, which accounted for 7 to 8 per cent. Then he said-and the man was obviously poorly briefed-that foreign pilots would be brought in. He did not know that there is a worldwide shortage of pilots and that that would not happen. The next thing was charters. What arrived? We have a dodgy airline from the United States of America, someone from the Middle East and an Ilyushin. If the Prime Minister wants to fly in an Ilyushin, I wish him luck. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of this dispute, which is also quite interesting, highlights the double standards in this matter. The pilots started with a work-to-rule. That was deplorable and it is not to their credit that they acted in this way. The full dispute started a couple of days after that on 23 August-two weeks ago. This dispute has been costing us millions of dollars a day and still there is no progress. The pilots' awards were cancelled within 24 hours. Within 24 hours the Government had acted against the pilots. Some of us remember the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). It took this Government two years to do anything about that body. It all depends on one's priorities and Mr Kelty's attitude to these sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA> All the Government has done, from the very beginning, is escalate this dispute. Even last week the Prime Minister was still insulting the pilots and calling them hypocrites. Again there was talk about compensation. If anything is designed to remove the resolve of the airlines to get together and start talking about a resolution of this dispute it is the suggestion of compensation. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) proved so conclusively a few moments ago, the Prime Minister still does not know what he is going to do about compensation. It may not be a live issue, but it is certainly on the agenda. Compensation may not be given to the companies. But if it is given to the employees, surely it will benefit the companies. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a confused, chaotic approach to this dispute. The Prime Minister, in spite of what has been said by some of his Cabinet colleagues, still makes statements such as the one about compensation. I cannot believe that he does not understand the need to address this dispute more vigorously than he is at the present time. Apparently this dispute has cost the country $100m in August in terms of our balance of payments; the current estimate for September is $180m. Yet, the Prime Minister is not even in the chamber now and we have not seen a statement from him. Five thousand Australian men and women have been stood down. They are not on the Prime Minister's compensation list. Their families will not be able to ask the Prime Minister to help them pay the rent. Hotel occupancy rates throughout this country have dropped like a rock. What is the Prime Minister doing about that? Our international reputation continues to be damaged. We have damaged our reputation for the next decade as a tourist destination for visitors from countries like the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The work that has been done at great cost by this Government-and it frequently claims credit for this-and others in the tourist industry to promote tourism has been wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Government should recognise that the Prime Minister has made an unholy and unmitigated mess of this dispute which is the result of the failure of the Government's accord and social wage policy. There is no credibility in the Government's policy or strategy on this whole issue. The Government should recognise that it owns an airline and that it is in a position to direct the management of that airline to do something-to talk to the pilots and to begin moving to resolve the dispute. It is within the power of the Government to act, but it will not do so because of political reasons. It is important that this Government understands that the accord is dead. The accord should be buried and Mr Kelty should be buried with it. The Government should act to end the suffering and cost and resolve this dispute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -This matter of public importance clearly indicates that the Opposition has decided to put itself forward as the advocate of the pilots. The Opposition claims that the present situation has been caused by the failure of the Government's industrial relations system to bring about a settlement of the pilots dispute. Let me go back a couple of days to 25 August when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) first made statements in relation to this dispute. He said, in an interview on AM on that day:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It's a classic case where you've got to go beyond the employer/employee fight and look after the national interest. And the Government is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>On 25 August the Leader of the Opposition said that the Government is correct. He went on in that interview to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I think, that in fact, you might only have to use that sort of power [ie, directions power] once in a decade. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us put the record straight as to whether the Opposition is confused in relation to this dispute. The Leader of the Opposition, who led for the Opposition in this debate today, clearly indicated on 25 August that what the Government was doing was correct. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look at what a few other members of the Opposition had to say to see where they stand. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when addressing the National Press Club on 31 August 1989, said this:</PARA>
<PARA>I want it [the pilots dispute] settled in a way that undermines the centralised wage fixing system because I don't believe in the centralised wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, at a press conference on 31 August, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . look I am not here to advocate a settlement according to the Government's views. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is clearly supporting the pilots' decision to act outside the system-a system which all other people in this nation seeking wage adjustments are prepared to accept. We are told over and over again by the Opposition that there should be secret ballots. At the press conference on 31 August, Mr Peacock said:</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, on secret ballots, the mere fact that one union may vote in favour of the strike does not negate that as a proposition to be worked at. The reason for secret ballots is to ensure that the membership of a union has a direct say as to what they want to do and that it's not assumed by the leadership alone as we've found time again. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been a secret ballot in this dispute. The dispute was planned, as the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) said, months ago on the basis that the pilots would take a particular line. They took the line espoused by the Opposition that there should be a secret ballot. Once again, this is proof that the Opposition's position is clear in relation to this dispute. The Opposition has never mentioned whether another secret ballot needs to be held to undo the decisions that were taken in the first place. In other words, this option for negotiation has been closed off. I will quote other members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) spoke at the Victorian Employers Federation Industrial Relations Conference on 29 August and said the opposite. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have never understood the fetish some people have for secret ballots for strike action and for bans against compulsory unionism. The latter is not a problem in Australia and the former is rarely a deterrent to strike action. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly it was not a deterrent to strike action in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, this matter of public importance is an approach by the Opposition to attack the system that has operated successfully in this nation since 1983 when we took over from a government which, at that time, had no wages policy, no industrial relations policy and was in absolute chaos. The people of Australia are very concerned about the terrible damage that this dispute is doing to the economy and many sectors of the community. A comparison can be made between the industrial relations policies of the Government and the Opposition. A cake of a certain size is available to the employees in this nation. No matter which industry people work in, a certain amount of funds is available within the structure of that industry for wages. In the early 1980s, the policies of the coalition Government led to wage break-outs. We saw the policies of the present Opposition in action. Under those policies, the unemployed are eventually left to carry the burden. People in Australia have seen what happened and they would be horrified to think that that approach is being put forward by our opponents. I have not heard them say to the pilots, `If you want to go down our path bear in mind that at the finish there may not be 16,040 pilots; there may be only 1,000. And under our policy the pilots themselves will lose out in relation to employment opportunities'. That would be the result of that type of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> But a break-out within a system cannot be allowed to occur. When the greedy take more than their share, the burden of carrying that break-out falls on those at the bottom, the unemployed-the ones who eventually lose their jobs because the economy of the industry cannot carry them. That is the basic difference between our policies. Do we develop an industrial relations system, such as the one we have at present which has worked effectively? The proof of that system is in the 1.5 million jobs created for Australians; not a greedy grab for a few, but a system that has allowed people to go before the Industrial Relations Commission and develop their arguments for productivity, wage increases and adjustments while at the same time taking into consideration the whole economy-and that means people. It means that every industry has been able to develop a system and create more employment within the economic sector. That is the difference between the two policies. The Opposition's arguments today in clear support of the pilots' approach were put forward as a test case for its policy. If the pilots are successful the Opposition will claim that its system is the way to go. It will say to people, `Get out there and bargain for what you can get. Use your strength'. Of course, that would mean more for the strong and less for the weak. We reject that system entirely. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), blamed the accord, of all things, for causing the dispute. Not once in his speech did he say that the pilots had anything to do with causing this dispute-it was the accord; not the pilots. I ask him a simple question: Why was he not prepared to say, at least in one sentence, that the pilots had some effect in initiating this dispute? They certainly planned it. They certainly had a secret ballot to have the dispute. They certainly decided to strand Australian people wherever they could and whenever they could. It is not true, as the Leader of the National Party said, that they had very little to do with it. He said it was the accord that forced them into it. He then said that there should be negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has been on the phone talking to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, which is no longer in the system. Its employees are not able to speak about the dispute. If we want proof of that we need look no further than at the interview with Sir Peter Abeles on AM of 6 September 1989. In answer to a question from John Shovelan, Sir Peter Abeles said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we sincerely hope to fly them very soon because we offered-contrary to what Mr McCarthy and his group is permanently saying on every program-that we are not prepared to talk to our employees, or ex-employees because they are ex-employees, the one's who haven't signed up. We offered to talk to them. </PARA>
<PARA>There are opportunities for negotiations to take place. The Opposition has put itself in a corner which it will have great difficulty getting out of. At the next election the Australian people will have the choice of voting for policies that will cause chaos or for policies that have been proven in the last seven years and have created 1.5 million jobs. The structure in which those jobs have been created must be maintained. We will continue to maintain it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the House of Representative Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure I am making a statement to the House on behalf of the Committee on whether Mr Christopher Charles Skase, Chairman of Qintex Ltd, misled the Committee in evidence he gave before it on 15 June 1988. This evidence was given the inquiry into the role and functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT). The Committee reported on this and other evidence on 1 December 1988. The origins of this statement have the following sequel of events. On 5 July 1989 the Sydney Morning Herald published an article which said that Mr Skase `appears to have given conflicting evidence to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and a parliamentary committee on his reasons for buying two television stations through a shelf company, Kaycliff Pty Ltd'. On 5 July 1989, whilst on Committee business in Kalgoorlie, I was contacted by a Sydney Morning Herald reporter on this matter and indicated that the Committee would examine these allegations. The Sydney Morning Herald of the next day, 6 July, carried the following headlines, `Inquiry ordered into Skase evidence'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I brought this matter to the attention of the Committee at a special meeting on 11 July 1989. The Committee resolved that I consult with the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and report to the Committee on whether the evidence Mr Skase gave misled the Committee. For the information of honourable members, Qintex Ltd, through a chain of companies which it owns or controls, owns the Australian Television Network, Channel 7. In April 1988 the Perth TVW and Adelaide SAS television stations were purchased through a company called Kaycliff Pty Ltd, which does not hold any other interests in any of the television licences held in the Qintex group. Mr Skase held five of the 100 shares of Kaycliff. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo and I have examined the relevant sections of the Committee transcript of 15 June 1988 during which Mr Skase was questioned with regard to Kaycliff Pty Ltd. We also examined the transcript of evidence taken from a hearing of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in the period from 10 April 1989 to 12 April 1989, during which time Mr Skase was questioned with regard to his purchase of the Perth and Adelaide television stations. The honourable member for Mayo and I have come separately to the same conclusion after full examination of those transcripts that there is no inconsistency in information provided at our hearing on 15 June 1988 and the evidence given at the hearings of the ABT during April this year. It may be that what Mr Skase told the Tribunal in May 1988 was different from what he told the Committee a month later. But what he told the Tribunal in 1989 was not inconsistent with what he told the Committee. He made it clear to us that he controlled Kaycliff, an assurance he also gave the Tribunal, and that he knew the purchase of the Perth and Adelaide stations would put him above the audience reach limits. He also made it clear that this was not in itself illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> In reading the transcripts of both hearings it is clear that the direction of questioning at the Tribunal hearing was somewhat different from that taken by the Committee. The Committee was more concerned with the possible misuse of the period of grace inserted into the Act in 1981; whereas the Tribunal questioning appeared to concentrate on the ownership and control provisions of the Act. It is useful to note how the Committee viewed the Skase evidence. The Committee report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>5.46 The periods of grace under the Act are deliberately being used to acquire excess interests, with a view to corporate restructuring and advantageous disposal of the excess (if at all) at a more convenient later date, and possibly to a carefully selected purchaser. The Committee regards this as an abuse of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>5.52 In conjunction with the above, the Committee further recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 14:</PARA>
<PARA> (B) The `periods of grace' under the Act for the disposal of excess interest should be amended to ensure that they cannot be used deliberately to acquire excess interests. </PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Chairman and I have reported our views to the Committee, which has endorsed them. This short statement has been made pursuant to that endorsement. The Committee has concluded that Mr Christopher Skase did not mislead the Committee in the evidence he gave before it on 15 June 1988. We are therefore of the view that no further action should be taken other than to report our findings to the House and to inform the relevant parties of our findings. The announcement of this inquiry by the Committee was given some prominence in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 July 1989. I trust that this statement will receive the same treatment. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill introduces measures to give effect to some of the Treasurer's 1989-90 Budget announcements. The income tax law will be amended to require major employers to remit pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) tax deductions, withheld from the salary or wages of their employees, to the Commissioner of Taxation on a twice-monthly basis. Other Budget announcements to be given effect will vary the operation of the quarterly provisional tax system and provide for the method of calculating 1989-90 provisional tax. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now outline in more detail these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Twice-monthly remittance of tax instalment deductions</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will require some employers registered under the group employer scheme to pay to the Commissioner of Taxation on a twice-monthly basis, the PAYE tax instalment deductions they make from the salary or wages of their employees on or after 1 December 1989. Employers affected by this change will be those who deducted more than $5m in tax instalments in the financial year ended 30 June 1989, or who do so in a later financial year. Employers who are members of a wholly-owned company group may also be required to remit their tax instalment deductions to the Commissioner on a twice-monthly basis. This rule will apply where the total amount of the deductions made by all the employers in the company group during the financial year ended 30 June 1989, or in a later year, exceed $5m. Employers who are subject to the new rules will be required to pay all deductions made in the first 14 days of a month by the twenty-first day of that month. </PARA>
<PARA> Deductions made in the balance of the month are to be paid over by no later than the seventh day of the next month. Once employers start to remit tax instalment deductions on a twice-monthly basis they must continue to do so unless the Commissioner determines otherwise because of a significant change in their circumstances. This measure is the first step towards revised PAYE remittance arrangements that would require larger employers to remit twice-monthly but with less frequent remittances than at present by smaller employers, which could obviate the need for the tax stamps system. The amendment will produce a one-off revenue gain of $550m in 1989-90. Additionally, outlays on public debt interest will reduce by $20m in 1989-90 and $70m in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Quarterly provisional tax</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will give effect to two Budget proposals adjusting the operation of the quarterly instalment system of paying provisional tax. The threshold for general exemption from the instalment system will be increased from $5,000 to $8,000. As a consequence, a taxpayer whose provisional tax payable in a year of income is $8,000 or less will not be required to pay instalments of provisional tax in the following year. This change will apply to provisional tax payable in the current and subsequent income years. Some 130,000 of the existing 320,000 instalment payers will now be required to pay provisional tax only on an annual basis. Of this large number who will benefit from the change, some 45,000 are over 60 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal is estimated to increase outlays on public debt interest by $20m in 1989-90 and $70m in subsequent years. The Bill will also give effect to another proposal to preclude a too early offset of provisional tax credit in a year of income against provisional tax charged for the succeeding year. Credit arises where income tax assessed as payable for an income year is less than the credit for provisional tax previously paid for that year. Under the change, any excess provisional tax credit will no longer be offset against a quarterly instalment of provisional tax for the succeeding year which has been notified but is not yet due for payment. This change will apply from the date of royal assent to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisional tax for 1989-90</PARA>
<PARA> Provisional tax is that part of the pay-as-you-earn system designed to collect tax on non-salary or wage income within the year in which the income is derived. It follows that the amount of provisional tax charged should approximate as closely as practicable the amount of tax actually imposed for the year. This Bill provides for 1989-90 provisional tax to be calculated on the basis of 1988-89 taxable income increased by 10 per cent, and by applying the 1989-90 rates of tax, Medicare levy and the increased low income thresholds for Medicare levy that are to apply in that year. Subject to the exceptions I will announce, rebates and credits will be allowed in the provisional tax calculation at the levels allowed in 1988-89 assessments. Any rebate of tax allowed on franked dividends will be adjusted, before being increased by 10 per cent, to account for the reduction in the company tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, credits for foreign tax paid will be uplifted by 10 per cent. Concessional rebates claimed in 1988-89 for a dependent spouse, daughter-housekeeper, invalid relative, parent or parent-in-law or for a housekeeper and the sole parent rebate will be adjusted to reflect the new higher 1989-90 levels. Changes will also be made to some claims for zone rebates and the rebates for Defence Force members serving overseas or civilians serving with the United Nations. The 1989-90 provisional tax will be calculated after increasing any such rebate by 20 per cent of the adjustment made to the taxpayer's 1988-89 concessional rebate claim. Taxpayers who estimate that their taxable income from 1988-89 will increase by less than 10 per cent, or who consider that their rebates or credits will be at a higher level in 1989-90, will continue to have the right to `self assess' and have the provisional tax for 1989-90 recalculated on the basis of their own estimates. The reduction in the uplift factor from the 12 per cent that was applied in calculating 1988-89 provisional tax to 10 per cent for 1989-90 provisional tax is estimated to cost $160m in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill and the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Income Tax Act 1986 to formally impose the rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for the 1989-90 financial year and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for the 1990-91 financial year. It will also impose for the same period the rates of tax payable by companies, registered organisations and unit trusts that are treated as companies. In addition, it will impose the rates of tax on superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. The rates to be imposed by the measures in this Bill are those declared in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986. New personal rates of tax apply for 1989-90 following the changes announced in the April 1989 economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA> A five-step tax scale applies. At the lower end of the scale for resident taxpayers, no tax is payable on taxable incomes up to $5,100. On taxable incomes in the range of $5,101 to $17,650 the rate is 21 per cent. In the range of $17,651 to $20,600 the rate is 29 per cent. For income in the range $20,601 to $35,000 the rate is 39 per cent and a rate of 47 per cent applies for income in the range $35,000 to $50,000. Income over $50,000 is taxed at a composite rate of 48 per cent, reflecting the reduction in the top rate of personal tax from 49 per cent to 47 per cent from 1 January 1990. These general rates also apply to non-residents who receive Australian social security and repatriation pensions that are taxable in Australia, or who were residents at any time during the income year. For other non-resident taxpayers, the rate of 29 per cent applies to incomes up to $20,600 and the higher general rates apply to incomes above that level. </PARA>
<PARA> For 1989-90 the rate for all unearned income of resident minors, subject to shading-in arrangements for such income just over $416, is 48 per cent. That rate also applies to trustees assessed under section 99a of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and on other categories of income that are subject to anti-avoidance provisions of that Act. The general company tax rate payable in respect of 1988-89 income, which applies also for unit trusts that are treated as companies, is 39 per cent. Specified tax rates apply in respect of the various components of taxable income of life assurance companies and registered organisations. For any component of 1988-89 income referable to policies held by complying funds or in respect of rollover annuities the rate is 15 per cent. A rate of 49 per cent applies for any component referable to policies held by non-complying funds. The rate for the component of income for 1988-89 referable to other life assurance and accident and disability insurance is 39 per cent where the insurer is a life assurance office and 30 per cent where the insurer is a registered organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the rate of tax generally applying for complying superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts is 15 per cent. The provisions of the Bill are explained in detail in explanatory memorandum that accompanied the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 I have just introduced. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989 will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to impose the basic rate of Medicare levy for 1989-90 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for 1990-91. The basic rate of the levy will remain at 1.25 per cent of taxable income, the level that has applied since 1 December 1986. The Bill also contains increases in the income threshold levels below which people with low incomes will not be called on to pay any levy. </PARA>
<PARA> For 1989-90, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $10,330 and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $17,400 will not be required to pay the levy. The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will continue to be increased by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student. For example, a married couple with three dependent children will pay no levy until their combined taxable incomes exceed $23,700. The estimated cost of the increased low income thresholds is $10m in 1989-90 and $35m in 1990-91. The new low income thresholds will be reflected in provisional tax raised for 1989-90, and in tax instalment schedules from 1 January 1990. The explanatory memorandum on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 about which I have just spoken contains an explanation of the provisions of this Bill.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a national scheme for the notification and assessment of industrial chemicals to protect people at work, the public and the environment from the harmful effects of industrial chemicals. The scheme will be known as the national industrial chemicals notification and assessment scheme-NICNAS. This scheme will form a vital component in an overall chemicals management strategy for Australia. Notification and assessment of chemicals will improve the efficiency of other elements of this overall strategy such as labelling, provision of material safety data sheets and education and training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill reflects the continuing priority that the Federal Government gives to ensuring safe Australian workplaces and a cleaner environment. Worksafe Australia and the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council, whose 1984 proposal was the basis for this legislation, have conducted consultations with Commonwealth departments, State and Territory authorities, unions and industry and other interested groups to ensure that the proposed scheme will take into account and achieve a fair balance between the interests of these parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is to apply to industrial chemicals imported into or manufactured in Australia. It will apply to the individual chemical substances, but not mixtures or formulations. Because it is not possible to determine the hazards of a formulation unless the properties of the ingredients are known, this scheme will also provide the fundamental information with which formulations can be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will not place controls on chemicals. This will necessarily be through the existing body of State and Territory legislation. The legislation will, however, promote the development of uniform controls by ensuring that adequate, independently reviewed information is available to State and Territory authorities, and by making recommendations about appropriate controls for national adoption. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial chemicals are used in virtually every commodity, including textiles, paints, plastics, adhesives and cleaners, and are an integral part of modern life. Over the past several decades the number of industrial chemicals introduced by industry has increased dramatically. It has been estimated that, worldwide, there are in excess of 100,000 individual industrial chemicals in commercial use. Over 30,000 of these are used in Australia and found in a bewildering number of chemical products. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is long overdue. Unlike therapeutic drugs and agricultural and veterinary chemicals, industrial chemicals are, and have been, introduced into Australian workplaces and the environment without any national assessment of their hazards. This is in stark contrast to the majority of our trading partners who have had similar legislation in place for a number of years. This legislation will ensure that new industrial chemicals are evaluated before they enter the Australian market, and that selected chemicals already in use are reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> Control over industrial chemicals is currently exercised by the States and Territories through many and various pieces of legislation, covering, for example, the transport and storage of dangerous goods, occupational health and safety, consumer protection and environmental protection. To date, standards and controls for chemicals have largely been developed on a piecemeal basis by individual States and Territories, often only in response to damage to health or environmental pollution. Differences in approach between States and Territories have led to a lack of uniformity in requirements and controls. This situation results in significant, unnecessary costs for industry, as well as increased hazard to the public and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware of the enormous cost of rectifying the damage done by chemicals such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and asbestos. Hardly a day goes by without an incident being reported involving hazardous chemicals, whether it is a chemical fire in Melbourne or pollution of an historic waterway in Sydney. Such incidents have led to international recognition of the need to anticipate potential hazards of chemicals prior to their entry into commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> Based on extrapolation of overseas data, the cost of occupational injury and disease from exposure to chemicals can be expected to be very high. As a consequence, even modest reductions will have major benefits in monetary and human terms. For example the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive has recently estimated that seven million working days are lost each year in the United Kingdom due to skin problems, at a cost of $A1.3 billion. Occupational dermatitis resulting from chemical exposure makes up the `large majority' of these skin problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The public is exposed to industrial chemicals directly through use of consumer products and indirectly by the presence of these chemicals in the environment through pollution. Contamination resulting from release of industrial chemicals to the environment has many negative effects apart from those to human health. Pollution of waterways leads to loss of environmental amenity-for example, swimming or recreational fishing-and also economic loss; for example, to commercial fishing industries. Accumulation of chemicals in animals, particularly those at the top of food chains, can threaten individuals and, on occasions, place entire species at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The exaggerated fear of chemicals has in recent years become a source of considerable cost and delay to both industry and government. Such fears can result in industrial action against changes in workplace processes using chemicals and adverse community reaction to proposals for new chemical plants, waste disposal and destruction facilities. A persistent complaint of workers, environmental groups and the general public is the lack or inadequacy of chemicals information. Clearly a mechanism is required in Australia to ensure that sufficient data is provided for new chemicals to permit the adequate assessment of their potential health and environmental hazards. In this way the safeguards recommended will properly reflect both the potential exposure to the chemical and its physical, chemical and toxicological properties. Such a mechanism should not, however, impose unnecessary time or cost burdens on industry. The establishment of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, otherwise known as Worksafe Australia, in 1985 was early evidence of the Government's commitment to occupational health and safety. The scheme will be administered by Worksafe Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the details of the legislation, part 2 of the Bill refers to the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances. This central feature of the legislation is currently being compiled by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The inventory will list those industrial chemicals which are already in use in Australia and which therefore will not be regarded as new under this legislation. Chemicals listed in this inventory, and certain other chemicals, will be exempted from the requirements for new chemicals. These may be reviewed if they give rise to concern. New chemicals which are notified and assessed under the scheme will not be added to the inventory for a period of five years after the assessment has been completed. This will prevent others who wish to introduce the chemical from unfairly profiting from the work of the original applicant in satisfying the requirements of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill describes the process of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals. New chemicals will be notified to Worksafe Australia together with a notification statement of the chemical's intended use and properties. The cost of providing this information will be borne by the importer or manufacturer. The information will be assessed to determine the potential hazard to occupational health and safety, public health and the environment. The information required is similar to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) minimum premarketing set of data, which has been agreed internationally as that necessary for an initial hazard assessment of new industrial chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> There are provisions in the legislation to provide a lesser information package if it is justified on scientific or economic grounds. For example, in the case of polymers, small volume chemicals, research and development chemicals and site limited chemicals it is recognised that parts of the prescribed minimum data set may not be appropriate. These classes of chemicals are therefore subject to special consideration. For chemicals which have been in use overseas and are on overseas inventories this Bill provides discretion to allow an incomplete notification statement. On the other hand, in a small minority of cases, data beyond the prescribed minimum level may be required; for example, chemicals for which there is widespread human or environmental exposure or those chemicals for which the basic data package foreshadows a need for further information. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that occupational health and safety, public health and environmental health hazards are considered, assessments will be undertaken jointly by Worksafe Australia, the Department of Community Services and Health and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories respectively. For each chemical, the information package, including the material safety data sheet, will be reviewed to determine appropriate recommendations for the safe use of the chemical. A consolidated assessment report will be prepared within prescribed timeframes by Worksafe Australia and distributed to responsible Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities. As it is sometimes necessary to review assessments to ensure that the original one remains valid, the Bill provides a mechanism for secondary notification. For instance, secondary notifications may be required for chemicals if they are used in a wider variety of applications than originally intended or if new information about their properties becomes available. </PARA>
<PARA> Several important provisions exist for the estimated 30,000 existing chemicals, which are listed on the inventory. These provisions allow the Federal Government to tackle, on a priority basis, those chemicals for which there are particular Australian concerns. In some cases, classes of chemicals which are related either by chemical structure or by their use or function may be declared as priority existing chemicals. In selecting existing chemicals for review, maximum use will be made of international collaborative efforts such as the OECD chemicals program and the United Nations international program on chemical safety. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no prescribed information requirements for the assessment of existing chemicals. Instead an initial request for information will be made to assist in defining the extent of the problem. Information requirements will generally be directed to the specific concerns which prompted the review. Where only one aspect of a chemical is of concern, for example, environmental damage, information requirements and assessment may be limited to that aspect.</PARA>
<PARA> One important outcome of this scheme is the information on chemicals that will become available to the public. A summary of each assessment report will be published in a special issue of the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and the full public assessment report will be available on request. Confidentiality of information will be maintained when this is necessary to safeguard commercial interests. However, there will be a prescribed set of basic information, including summaries of health and environmental effects, which cannot be confidential. </PARA>
<PARA> The appeal provisions in the Bill are drawn widely. Industry and third parties will be able to appeal decisions made under the legislation to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. For example, appeals may be made against the content and recommendations of an assessment report or the selection of priority existing chemicals. The openness of the scheme, as evidenced by availability of information and by the wide appeal provisions, is unique, and is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a number of offences. It also sets out the levels of fines to apply to a natural person and to a corporation. Consistent with standard practice, the maximum fine for a corporation is five times that for a natural person. The detailed implementation of controls and their enforcement will be the subject of memoranda of understanding to be developed between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. Proposals for regulating hazardous substances at the State and Territory level are being developed to be consistent with this legislation. For this reason there are provisions in the Bill to declare equivalent State and Territory schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA> The costs of implementing this legislation are estimated to be $1.25m after 50 per cent cost recovery. Cost recovery is consistent with the practice established in August 1987 for the review of agricultural chemicals and veterinary drugs. Fees will be specified by regulation. The legislation has been developed to achieve its objectives at the minimum possible cost and includes significant provisions to allow flexibility in application to minimise impact on industry. Information required for both new and existing chemicals is limited to that necessary to perform an adequate hazard assessment of the chemical. The inclusion of statutory timeframes for assessment will ensure that hazards will be promptly reviewed and delays and uncertainties for industry minimised. Harmonisation of the scheme with those in operation in most OECD countries, and adoption of agreements on such matters as chemical test methods, good laboratory practice and mutual acceptance of data, allow a system of notification of new chemicals which does not duplicate equivalent testing and assessment processes carried out by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill specifically make maximum use of overseas assessments resulting in reduction of costs. Where the chemical has been notified and assessed under a recognised equivalent scheme of another country, that notification and assessment will suffice providing it is accessible and relevant to Australia. On the other hand, there may be occasions where additional tests are required because of unique Australian circumstances. The Bill allows for such occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not suggested that the proposed legislation will, in itself, solve all the problems associated with hazardous chemicals and the considerable costs that flow from these. However, even small percentage reductions in the damage caused by chemicals represent very substantial benefits to Australia. The Bill, operating in conjunction with other mechanisms such as requirements for material safety data sheets, will maximise these benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's intention that the commitment of industry and trade unions to the scheme be maintained and their involvement continued. To this end, an advisory committee will be established within the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. In addition, a coordinating committee will be established external to the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to deal with issues of common concern to interested departments and to provide advice to the Government on the development and operation of the scheme after its inception. </PARA>
<PARA> Major effects of the scheme will be evident in the areas of occupational health and safety and protection of the environment. Overall, we believe that real benefits will follow because the legislation will encourage uniformity of regulation by the States and Territories; require those introducing chemicals to `know their products', to be aware of the chemical's identity and properties; and increase rational debate in the community on chemicals issues.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides another strong indication of the Government's desire to ensure that significant occupational health and environmental issues confronting society are managed effectively and safely. Chemicals are an essential part of our society and require responsible management by manufacturers and importers, workers and consumers as well as by government. The provisions of this Bill show that the Government is addressing this important area. I believe this Bill represents an important step in the management of an extremely complex issue. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to control the export and import of hazardous wastes in order to protect human health and the environment. The Act will enable Australia to take part in international measures to control the movement of hazardous wastes which also have this objective. With the development of modern industry has come the generation of hazardous industrial and chemical wastes. These are wastes that cannot be disposed of in municipal landfill or the sewer, but need to be recorded and tracked to special treatment and disposal facilities. In the last two decades it has become recognised in every industrial country that special regulation is needed for these materials. Consequently, in industrialised countries such special regulation has been put in place, to protect the environment. In Australia, regulation of hazardous wastes is primarily a State and Territory responsibility and they administer appropriate controls. In this area of regulation, in Australia and overseas, the term hazardous wastes does not include radioactive wastes, which have separate regulatory needs. In this country the import and export of radioactive materials are controlled under the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It became clear as national control systems were developed that gaps existed at national borders. Well publicised incidents, such as drums of waste being `lost' at European borders, or wastes being dumped in African ports, led to the conclusion that an international control system was necessary to protect the global environment. This was recognised by the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, which recommended in its 1982 First Report on the Inquiry into Hazardous Chemicals that Australia should control the export and import of these materials. Subsequently the Australian Environment Council endorsed Commonwealth control on exports and imports of hazardous wastes. I should add that there is no evidence that Australia has been involved in unacceptable movement of these materials. </PARA>
<PARA> The international body which acted first in this area was the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In 1984 it began developing international agreements to control hazardous wastes when moved, to ensure their satisfactory disposal. However, it became clear that a global agreement was necessary, and in 1987 the initiative was taken by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). In the light of these developments, the Government decided in March 1988 to control this trade in order, amongst other things, to take part in international control arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> On 22 March 1989, at a UNEP conference held in Switzerland, the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was unanimously adopted by all governments represented. Australia was active in drawing up the Convention. Australia can become a party to the Convention once this legislation has been put into effect. Before becoming a party the Commonwealth will consult with the States and Territories. Fundamental features of the Basel Convention include: the requirement that parties shall prohibit the export of hazardous wastes from their jurisdictions to States that do not consent to the import; the requirement that countries treating and disposing of wastes do so in an environmentally sound manner; and the tracking of wastes to acceptable disposal, when moved across borders. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence the Bill before us provides for the issuing of permits to control both the import and export of hazardous wastes to ensure that they are disposed of by an environmentally acceptable method. The legislation has been designed to control the movements of wastes as required by the Convention. However, several of the obligations in the Convention, such as the requirement to minimise waste production and the provision of acceptable disposal facilities, fall within the responsibilities of State and Territory governments. Therefore the controls introduced by this Bill will be complemented by State and Territory waste management legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, a few hundred tonnes of hazardous waste are exported from Australia each year. These wastes fall into the category of intractable wastes for which the only widely acknowledged environmentally acceptable method for disposal is high temperature incineration. The majority of those wastes that have been exported have been sent to Pontypool in the United Kingdom for destruction in a high temperature incinerator. As far as is known no hazardous wastes have been imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, hazardous wastes are generally defined as those wastes that cannot be disposed of in the usual way such as to municipal landfill or the sewer. They present a potential threat to the environment or human health and therefore require special treatment. However, in addition to what are usually considered to be hazardous wastes, the Basel Convention also controls the movement and disposal of wastes collected from households and residues arising from the incineration of household wastes. Accordingly, the definition of hazardous wastes in the Bill has been expanded to include these categories of wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the Minister must issue a permit for the export of wastes only if he or she is satisfied, amongst other things, that the hazardous waste will be permitted to enter the proposed country of import and that any exported waste will be disposed of in the receiving country in a manner that will not be harmful to the environment. It will be necessary for the applicant for either an import or export permit to demonstrate that he or she has adequate insurance or is able to meet any liability arising in relation to the activity proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters that the Minister may take into account when considering an export application are whether there are facilities for disposal of wastes in Australia which could be used for the disposal of the exports. This ground could be used to make more viable Australian treatment facilities. It is also consistent with the Basel Convention, which seeks to minimise movements whenever possible. The Minister may also take into account Australia's international relations, when considering issuing permits. Other clauses in the Bill provide for the Minister to vary, extend and revoke permits, with appropriate safeguards for applicants. Particulars of permits are to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, unless there are national interest reasons not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill, the Minister may make orders to deal with the wastes and recover costs if the orders are not complied with. This power will include the power to order wastes illegally imported to Australia to be returned to the country of origin. This is consistent with the Basel Convention. Principal offences under the Bill will be punishable by up to five years imprisonment. Enforcement of the Act will be by inspectors with appropriate powers. The Bill provides for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, against the Minister's decisions whether such decisions are to grant or not to grant a permit, to vary or not to vary a permit, or other decisions relating to permits. Third parties with an interest may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for amendment of the Customs Act to ensure that where hazardous wastes are the subject of illegal movement under the proposed Act, they are not thus forfeit to the Crown. Hazardous wastes have a negative value, that is ownership of them is a liability. Therefore a person should not be able to get rid of them simply by illegally importing or exporting them and then forfeiting them to the Crown. There is provision for fees of up to $4,000 to be paid by permit applicants. It is intended that these will cover the costs of administering the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The States and Territories have been consulted during the drafting of the Bill. Their cooperation will be needed in the administration of the Act through, for example, informing the Commonwealth authorities of suspected illegal import or export activities. Memoranda of understanding will be developed with them for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to ensuring that hazardous wastes in Australia are managed in an environmentally acceptable manner. The introduction of controls on the import and export of hazardous wastes complements the domestic regulation of these materials which the Commonwealth is helping to implement through the Australia and New Zealand Environment Council, formerly the Australian Environment Council to which I referred earlier. The Commonwealth, in concert with the States and Territories, is encouraging industry to minimise its production of hazardous wastes. Many companies are now finding that waste minimisation is in fact cost-effective in terms of the valuable materials that can be recovered from the so called `waste' stream. This Government, together with the New South Wales and Victorian State governments, is examining the possibility of establishing a facility for the high temperature incineration of intractable wastes in New South Wales. The incinerator is proposed as a national facility but, if established, it will be operated by a New South Wales government agency. Setting up such a facility would reduce the current need to store or export intractable wastes. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has as its near neighbours many small nations, such as the Pacific countries, which may well have relatively small quantities of hazardous wastes which they wish to dispose of safely. Australia has a responsibility to assist these countries to dispose of their wastes in an environmentally acceptable manner. It is inconceivable that these nations could justify the building of a high temperature incinerator given the small amount of wastes that would need to be incinerated. Accordingly, if the wastes are to be disposed of safely in our region, it may be necessary to import those wastes into Australia for incineration. Through the adoption of the measures contained in the Bill, Australia will be in a position to control the movement of hazardous wastes into and out of Australia and to require that these wastes are only treated and disposed of using methods of the highest standard. In this way we can demonstrate to the rest of the world our commitment to the protection of the global environment. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensions payable to, or in relation to, most former Commonwealth Government employees and Defence Force personnel are increased in July each year in accordance with the increase in the weighted average of the consumer price index for the eight capital cities to the previous 31 March. In 1986, the extraordinary circumstances of the economy required all members of the community to share the cost of reducing government expenditure. As part of these arrangements, the Government legislated in October 1986 for the 2 per cent wage discount that had been applied to wages to be extended to the 1986 pension increase applied to Government superannuation benefits payable to, or in respect of, former Commonwealth Government employees and Defence Force personnel. Since 1986 those pensions payable to former Commonwealth Government employees and Defence Force personnel have been adjusted by the full consumer price index increase. Persons receiving those pensions have therefore suffered a significantly lower reduction in living standards than the average person in the work force at the time when real wages for full-time adult workers have fallen by 2.2 per cent since 1982. In the context of the decision announced in the April statement to bring forward indexation increases of social welfare benefits by 12 weeks, the Government also decided that former Commonwealth Government employees and Defence Force personnel whose 1986 pension increases were reduced would have the level of those pensions restored from November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill is to implement the Government's decision. It amends the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948, the Superannuation Acts 1922 and 1976 and the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) (Superannuation) Regulations to provide for the levels of pensions payable under that legislation to be increased from 20 October 1989. This is the first day in the pay period which ends on the first pension payday in November. Pensions will be increased from that date to the levels that would have applied if they had not been reduced in October 1986. The increase will be applied only to pensions directly or indirectly affected by the 1986 reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that, as a result of the proposed amendments, total costs of the relevant pensions during 1989-90 will increase by approximately $17m and during 1990-91 by approximately $27.7m. Increases in outlays effects are estimated at $12.1m for 1989-90, and $19.8m for 1990-91. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provision of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fitout of the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters building, Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work, recommended by the Public Works Committee, is the fitout of a building to house the headquarters of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in Canberra. The Civil Aviation Authority purchased building No. 6 of the National Convention Centre in March 1989. The building has only very recently been constructed. It was purchased for $49.5m as a commercial investment with the aim of reducing the long term cost of providing office accommodation in Canberra. The fitout work extends over 16,500 square metres of floor space and will cost an estimated $13.4m at July 1989 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The work is being designed to comply with the requirements of relevant authorities and will combine individual offices with open plan office space, using modern systems furniture to handle cabling requirements and to promote flexibility. Extensive consultation has occurred with staff associations and examples of the proposed systems furniture have been set up to permit staff comment. In order to ensure earliest termination of existing leasing costs totalling $350,000 per month, the CAA seeks to achieve completion in early 1990.

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of an additional domestic apron facility at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA>There is currently a shortage of domestic apron facilities at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport to accommodate jet aircraft ranging from small corporate jets to larger wide-bodied domestic aircraft. The situation is expected to become more critical following deregulation of the domestic aviation industry in October 1990. The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is proposing the development of an additional apron facility to meet this need. The proposed apron will utilise the largely undeveloped area in the north-east sector of the airport, which is conveniently located close to the existing domestic terminal aprons. It will be capable of accommodating six domestic jet aircraft and additional stand-off positions for smaller aircraft. The scope of the work includes associated engineering infrastructure and the relocation of some roads and staff car parks near the present entry to the domestic terminal complex. </PARA>
<PARA> The FAC has advised that the works will cost an estimated $9.6m at May 1989 prices. In order to ensure that additional domestic aprons are available by the October 1990 deregulation of the domestic aviation industry, the FAC seeks to award a contract as early as possible in 1990 and to achieve completion by October 1990. I table layout drawings showing the extent of the proposed works and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes this initiative and wishes the Public Works Committee well with this particular project. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) rightly said in his statement, there is almost a desperate need for this work to be completed as soon as possible in light of the fact that Australia will be entering domestic airline deregulation on 31 October next year. During the parliamentary recess I managed to visit Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and have a look at this site to the north-west of the airport complex. I understand that there is already some space available there but, obviously, if it is going to take up to six additional domestic jets there will have to be some extension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While it is not particularly mentioned in the Minister's speech, I commend the Federal Airports Corporation for its negotiations with the prospective new carriers in the domestic aviation business for trying to get together some form of plan for the development of a joint user facility terminal adjacent to this apron space. That is going to be essential. Obviously, if domestic deregulation is going to work from the end of October next year we must have the proper infrastructure available. It has been indicated by some of the prospective new players that, without that infrastructure, they may not be able to start their operations. So there is some urgency in this inspection and recommendation from the Public Works Committee. I would certainly wish this inquiry a speedy resolution. </PARA>

<PARA> The men also believe the course structure is more an attempt to keep the unemployment figures down and the training statistics up. </PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment of the Newstart program when the course structure is designed to keep the unemployment figures down and the training statistics up. Surely what we need are courses that meet their objective, namely, to get the unemployed, and particularly the long term unemployed, and disadvantaged into the work force. The newspaper article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> What riles the men most is that those who should be concerned about the failure or success of the course do not seem to care about their plight. </PARA>
<PARA> Although they have written to a number of politicians and union officials whose input and discussion they believe could make the course a viable alternative to the dole, there has been little response. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Adelaide Advertiser of 2 September there is another criticism of the Newstart course. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Car manufacturing companies with hundreds of jobs available cannot recruit workers despite Government schemes aimed at providing staff. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Nissan recruitment manager . . . said that . . . he was advertising for staff through newspapers and radio but he still had difficulty finding acceptable applicants. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . he also said Nissan had not been able to recruit a single person taking part in Newstart despite a commitment by his company to give the program a go.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), who ought to be in the chamber listening to this debate on the appropriations for his Department, said that he was not surprised that some people applying for jobs under Newstart were seen as unsatisfactory. What kind of program is that? It is supposed to be a program designed for those people but the Minister says it is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government does not seem to understand that the social engineering associated with these training schemes will not work. What is needed is an incentive framework and a freer labour market if we are to realise the full employment potential of our citizens. We need an incentive framework of lower taxes to encourage employers to invest the necessary funds to ensure effective apprenticeship and trainee programs. We need a freer labour market with pay related to productivity to ensure that the pay scale relativities are such as to encourage employers to find the appropriate positions for their employees. Then and only then will we have an industrial situation that will make us more competitive internationally and so allow us to solve the massive overseas debt problem that this Government has brought on our nation. </PARA>

It convincingly affirms the Hawke Government's determination to dramatically increase and expand the higher education system in Australia. This Budget is also a practical testament to the tenacity and indomitable will of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to ensure that all qualified Australians have access to higher education. He is owed the gratitude of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Funding for higher education has been boosted by $843m and an extra 40,000 student places will be available over the next three years. By the end of 1991 about 130,000 student places will have been created beyond the 1983 level, a massive 50 per cent increase. During the 1989-91 triennium higher education will receive approximately $9 billion to sustain operating grants and new capital works. In contrast, during the 1976-82 period under the Fraser Liberal-National Government, funding for higher education decreased in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the Hawke Government had allocated $3.4 billion for higher education in 1992 to continue the massive building program now under way and also to fund an extra 14,000 new student places. This strategy of continuing expansion and funding will provide more opportunities for Australians from all walks of life to enjoy the benefits of higher education. Since the release in 1988 of the White Paper on Higher Education the Hawke Government will have increased funding for higher education by $1.3 billion. This is a magnificent accomplishment of which all Australians can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> The pursuit of excellence, equity, access and growth is a hallmark of the Hawke Government's policy on higher education. The commitment of vast sums of money, nearly one per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), by the Hawke Government to higher education carries with it the duty by higher education institutions to be accountable for the money they receive on trust from the Australian people. Australia's higher education system must respond to national social and economic imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The rapid growth in higher education requires a huge expansion in capital facilities. Funding for capital works in this Budget will rise from $78.5m this year to $126.7m in 1989, $145.4m in 1990, $177.2m in 1991 and $191m in 1992. The 1992 funding allocation represents an increase of 125 per cent on the 1988 level and is recognition of the urgent need for adequate facilities to meet the growth in enrolments and the existing backlog in building projects, including new student residences. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget provides a major expansion of funds for research. The annual budget available for competitive research will rise from $78m in 1988 to $140m in 1991. This is in line with the Hawke Government's commitment to the pursuit of excellence in higher education and its insistence that all research be of the highest quality and relevant to the national, social and economic aims of the nation. For this purpose an additional $138.5m has been allocated between 1990 and 1992. Over this period $107.5m will go to the maintenance and development of research infrastructure in higher education institutions and $31m for post-graduate research students including industry scholarships. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 there will be an increase of 150 in the number of research scholarships awarded and stipends will be at a non-tax- able rate of between $12,734 and $16,433. This is equivalent to a taxable level of $15,000 and $20,000 and is a dramatic increase-by 68 per cent and 125 per cent respectively-from the 1988 taxable level of $8,882. Furthermore, over the past year the Australian Research Council has increased its funding for research grants by 47 per cent, from $31.5m to $52.1m. The Council now funds 32 key centres for teaching and research including the Key Centre for Economic Geology at James Cook University at Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the inspired leadership of one of Australia's most distinguished academics and vice-chancellors, Professor Ray Golding, James Cook University of north Queensland is Australia's only major university north of the Tropic of Capricorn. It serves an area that stretches from Mackay in the south to Thursday Island in the north and westwards to the Northern Territory-Queensland border, an area of 747,800 square kilometres, and a population base of nearly 500,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> James Cook University is the only higher education institution in a region three times the size of Victoria and with a population larger than that of Tasmania. Within this region the participation rate in higher education is one-third the Australian average-eight per thousand as against 25 per thousand nationally. Australians living in north Queensland are disadvantaged by isolation and distance. The current student population at James Cook University is about 5,000 and with a growth rate of 10 per cent per annum more than 6,000 students will be attending James Cook University by 1992. James Cook University is determined to bring participation rates in this region up to at least the national level. The policies of the Hawke Government demand no less. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this goal, James Cook University will broaden the range of its already extensive academic program by the addition of important disciplines-for example, nursing, creative arts and, within the Faculty of Engineering, a new discipline of building. Over the next few years, the tropical health and medicine programs in the Faculty of Science will expand considerably, leading to the introduction of a full medical school in about seven years. James Cook University has always placed strong emphasis on engineering, science and technology, economics and business studies including accounting and also intends to establish an Institute of Asian Studies. This is in recognition of the University's unique proximity to South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> James Cook University was Australia's first university in the tropics and from the beginning one of the objectives of James Cook University has been to encourage and provide facilities for study and research in relation to subjects of special importance to the tropics. It has achieved national and international acclaim in recognition of its high standard of research and research training in cyclone engineering, geosciences and geotechnology with special reference to the mineral industries, applications of computing, information sciences and electronic engineering, tropical veterinary science and animal production, human adaptation and cultures in the tropics, and marine science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA> James Cook University is giving special support to new research initiatives which have already attracted non-government funding but which involve collaborative research with industry and government. These include the Anton Breinl Centre for Tropical Health and Medicine under the leadership of the brilliant Dr Hedley Peach. James Cook University is also paying special attention to space technology and associated activities, now that moves to establish a space port on Cape York Peninsula are well under way. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 James Cook University established a campus in Cairns-350 kilometres north of Townsville-and through a successful fund raising appeal is acquiring land for the site. The university is also in the final stage of acquiring a facility at Mackay-400 kilometres south of Townsville-when it will then offer a program of undergraduate activities to serve the rapidly growing population in the Mackay-Whitsunday region. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding increase for capital facilities announced in this Budget is welcome news to James Cook University. For years the university has been starved of essential funding for new buildings and student accommodation. For the 1992 higher education building program the university has identified three essential priorities: a general purpose academic building primarily for commerce and economics, a biological sciences building and a mathematics and computer science building. In addition, the university requires at least 100 further places for student accommodation and it has requested a further $2.7m for student residential accommodation. A high level of accommodation on campus is essential in Townsville because of the limited rental accommodation available in a rapidly growing city with a large itinerant population. Many parents from rural areas send their children to the university only if accommodation on campus is guaranteed. By Australian standards, a high proportion of such places has been provided with substantial financial support from churches; but the 900 places available fall well below current demand. This acts as a serious limitation on the university's rate of growth and, consequently, on the desired increase in the participation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the essential equity goals of James Cook University is to enhance the existing special programs for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. The Budget decision to create an additional 200 places for Aboriginal and Islander people is good news for a university which is dedicated to the educational advancement of more than 36,000 Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who live in North Queensland. I commend the Budget allocation for education, particularly for higher education. It will serve this nation well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this Appropriation Committee I want to talk about funding for the Aboriginal affairs area. I spoke at length about the Aboriginal affairs area last evening and during the course of that speech I tabled several documents by leave of the House which related to the funding allocations over a long period from the 1970s to the current period. Those tables showed that the Forward Estimates for the Budget year 1990-91-that is, what we in this country would spend on the Aboriginal affairs portfolio and other areas of government-are somewhere in the vicinity of $900m. That is nearly $1 billion, which is a lot of money. Today we are talking about the allocation of $462m, but when we add it all up the projection is for nearly $1 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The growth in budgetary outlays has not seen an improvement in outcomes in a whole range of areas, including housing and health and in subprograms such as substance abuse, training, education and so on. Further, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) proposal would, in our view, not assist that. The estimates of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs reveal that there is to be an allocation of some $9m for the ATSIC start-up costs. As far as I can see from looking at the estimates there is no breakdown as to where that money will actually go. My view is that under the ATSIC proposal, if it gets through the Senate-I can live in hope that it will not-the staff in existing agencies will be amalgamated under a new Commission. The estimates do not explain where these funds are being spent. I do not suppose that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) will respond to points made in this debate but I think that point needs to be made clear. The broader point is that the starting costs of ATSIC have been very expensive in terms of sheer money and the morale in the departments that administer Aboriginal affairs. There has been a great deal of discontent about the administration of Aboriginal affairs. That is not new to any of us in this place. There is a whole range of reasons for that, but the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country is a difficult task for whoever takes on the role of Minister, whether he is a Liberal or Labor Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The support that experts in the field give to Ministers is particularly valuable and many in this place rely on it very heavily. In this area, when one is dealing primarily with very detailed and complex people problems, low morale is cause for concern. Many positions are vacant in Aboriginal administration in this country. I am sure that honourable members have seen the advertisements in the press designed to try to fill those vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA> Many discontented senior officers have left and at the top of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs there is a gap of people who have very detailed experience in this complex area of administration. I seek leave to table some documents which I would then like to refer to. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first document relates to a staff circular dated 30 August 1989 and the second to a memo written by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to the Secretary of the Department, Mr Gray, dated 30 May 1989. The first document, dated 30 August 1989, refers to senior staffing arrangements. I am trying to point out one of the reasons why I think that morale is so low and to give an example to the Committee of some of the concerns that are being expressed-which quite alarm me-about the attitudes that have been held by people in the Aboriginal affairs administration. The senior staffing arrangement is quite normal but it shows that many positions are being filled with new people. This particular document shows four promotions, three expected appointments and another eight acting positions-all involving reallocation of new jobs. I understand that many positions are yet to be filled. By way of interest, one of those positions is a new Assistant Secretary, Housing and Infrastructure, which has been filled by a Ms Dawn Allen, now on the Minister's staff, who was mentioned in this place yesterday as being the recipient of a phone call that Mr Perkins claims was directed to someone else. We are still to hear the final story on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to comment on how these documents came to be with me. They arrived in my office yesterday. Attached to them was an anonymous memo addressed to `Warwick Smith, House of Representatives'. I have it here. It still has the creases in it. What it says worries me. I would like to read it into Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> Attached is for your information, the heading is unusual it should have come from the Department!</PARA>
<PARA>Why it comes from the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council I do not know. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Mike Dillon-</PARA>
<PARA>and it refers to individuals-</PARA>
<PARA>to be AS Corporate Planning is a typical Hand Labour party action to give jobs for the boys and a payoff for his ATSIC work. His ATSIC contract ran out this month so they had to give him a job somewhere in Hands patronage. Dillon has no expertise but they still gave him the job ahead of better people as a payoff and to make certain when ATSIC comes that Hand and his bureaucrats are in charge. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Dawn Allan to run housing is another political joke as she was kicked out of South Australia for incompetence. Better people wanted the job but got knocked back for a ministerial hanger-on. People from both here and the ADC had more experience but not the political connections. Do we all have to join the Labor Party to get on under Hand? Charlie did not go because of the Woden Town Club but because he told the truth about ATSIC. We do not want it even if it would work. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not subscribe to those views but I am making an important point: that document could only come from somewhere in the higher levels of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Aboriginal Development Commission. If those views are widely held within the administration of Aboriginal affairs and the supposedly apolitical Public Service it ought to give every member of this House cause for pause. If a public service in this very sensitive area of Aboriginal affairs starts to run off the rails and is subject to such extensive scrutiny as this Department has been over a sustained period-it began well before I took up my position as shadow spokesman-I think that we have to stop and take stock. Admittedly, ATSIC is a revolutionary proposal and it draws strong opinions. That sort of information coming to someone in my position could be due to someone having a cheap political shot-and I suppose that may be the way it is written up-but there is considerable lack of morale in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and I think that it is a sad day for Aboriginals who, at the very most, if I go back to my first point, want to see improved outcomes. All of us as taxpayers, for the $1 billion we are about to spend, want to see that too. </PARA>
<PARA> The second document is a memo dated 30 May 1989 from the Minister, Gerry Hand, to the Secretary. It is a fairly innocuous document which states:</PARA>
<PARA>As you know I wish to continue my visits to Aboriginal communities around the country, including in the winter break. </PARA>
<PARA>To paraphrase, the Minister says that he wants to make it clear that when he approaches communities he does not want them to assume that he is making promises about the possibility of allocation of funds to them for respective projects that they might ask him about. It says at the conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>If it is alleged by an organisation that I have given such a promise or a guarantee, it should be taken to mean no more than I have given an undertaking to examine a bid in the context of possible savings and competing priorities. I would appreciate it if you would advise your officers accordingly so that there is no misunderstanding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was looking forward to speaking at the committee stage of this debate. Unfortunately, that prospect has turned to some disappointment which comes from hearing the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). Yesterday in this chamber I followed him in a debate in which he attempted to undermine the integrity of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). During that debate I spoke about the way in which people in another place had been using their privilege to name individuals and organisations and to cast aspersions upon their characters-just as the honourable member has cast aspersions on the character of two people who now work in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It seems to me that there can be no other purpose for what the honourable member for Bass has done than to do what his colleagues in the Senate have done and try to tie those people-Dawn Allen and Mike Dillon-to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and suggest that because they may have had some association with him in the past, in the case of Mike Dillon as a consultant for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and to say that Mr Dillon has no credentials--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but the honourable member for Bass was quite smart about the way in which he spoke. I ask him: why would he bother to read such a scandalous, unsigned document in this House? Why, without some evidence of the truth of the document he was given, would he read such a document in this House? Why would he name those two individuals? Perhaps I could understand it if he had read such a document, not naming the individuals but saying `blank and blank', but he did not. Indeed, I think he took great delight in naming those two individuals. It is not unknown in this place, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has said on a number of occasions-indeed, he said it yesterday-for every Aboriginal person who has worked for him in his office, or has been associated with him, to be pilloried by the Opposition. It has been done here again with Dawn Allen by innuendo. This is a shameless attack on the character of these individuals. The honourable member for Bass knows nothing of the professional capabilities of either Ms Allen or Mike Dillon. He knows even less, I suggest, about the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country. It is extremely unfortunate that he should parade in here, as the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, purporting to have some knowledge, perhaps even expertise, and use his position in a debate about estimates to attack individuals who work in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bass said that he made it clear in his discussions that he thought there was a fall in morale within the Department. Let me make it very clear to him that the only reason why there has been a breakdown in morale in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and this is directly related, is the witch-hunt into Aboriginal Affairs, the Department, its organisations and Aboriginal people who work within it and outside it by the shadow Minister's colleagues in the Senate-a matter which I raised here yesterday. As I said yesterday, I thought the honourable member for Bass had more integrity, but he has very clearly demonstrated that both he and the previous shadow Minister are alike. They are peas from the same pod. They share the same conviction and, if I may say so, what is unerringly like a racist tendency to attack Aboriginal organisations because they are Aboriginal organisations. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I am. I am looking straight at you; I could not avoid you. The Shadow Minister said, without passing any opinion upon the document, that he would read it anyway. For what purpose would he name two prominent people who are acknowledged, certainly within the Australian community, as having expertise in Aboriginal affairs? For the information of the shadow Minister, Mike Dillon has probably more of a background in Aboriginal affairs than 85 per cent of the people presently working in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He has acknowledged expertise in public administration; he holds a masters degree; he won the essay prize in public administration at the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration; he holds a masters of economics degree; he has worked in Aboriginal organisations for over a decade-and the shadow Minister is trying to tell me he has no expertise. I suggest that the honourable member ought to know better. If he is fair dinkum about finding a way through the so-called problems of Aboriginal affairs he would do well to give credit to the people who work for those organisations instead of attacking them. I also suggest that he should not imply that there are people who are less than satisfactorily qualified in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which he has done again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bass may have some purpose for this exercise. I know not what it is, but he does himself, his party and the Australian community no credit by the vicious way in which he has used an unsigned document, dropped to him from the Department, to attack individuals, saying, `I don't know whether this is true or false'. He had no purpose other than laying an implication that these people are less than worthy of doing their jobs. He has no proof of that. If he knew anything about public administration in this country, the shadow Minister would know that the Minister has no role in appointing those people. They go through the selection criteria of the Department and the Public Service. Is the shadow Minister implying that political patronage exists within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs? Is he implying that these people were chosen for their positions, not as professionals and because they have expertise, but because of some political patronage? If that is what he is implying he should say so. </PARA>
<PARA> If the shadow Minister is wondering why there might be a lack of morale in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, his speech this afternoon demonstrates exactly why that is. Every time an appropriately qualified person gets a position of authority, or has the potential to hold such a position within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, he and his friends on the Opposition benches do their utmost to attack that person by way of imputation or direct attack, as he has done this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not my purpose to talk about that. I had hoped to give a demonstration to the Parliament of how outcomes had been improved through the expenditure of money in the area of Aboriginal affairs. I will be happy to talk to the shadow Minister at a time convenient to him, when he is less inclined to believe intrigue and false documents and takes some notice of fact instead of fiction. It is odd that when I have had contact with the shadow Minister in another arena in this Parliament he has been a very reasonable person. He has not attempted to use his position to attack individuals or organisations in the way he has this afternoon. There is absolutely no doubt that the areas we are examining in terms of the Budget need close examination. It is a pity that the shadow Minister did not take the opportunity to examine the Budget instead of trying to do character assassinations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to conclude what I was saying, because we have an extra allocation of time. Given the approach of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), I will not be tempted to respond in any inflammatory way except to say that perhaps he ought to read Hansard to see the approach that I took. We can differ as to whether or not I ought to have read the memo, which I have now given to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). I am sure that the Minister will take the opportunity to respond. As I said, I make no judgment about those people at all; I was drawing upon the broader point, and I thought I did so in a reasonable way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I wanted to deal with about the budgetary situation was one of the points in the explanatory notes of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). It is stated in the notes:</PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the loss of experienced staff caused by ATSIC related recruiting restraints and the limits of staff costs imposed by the Department of Finance, all program funds were committed in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>That comes back to the broader point I was raising about staff. I do not know whether there has been difficulty in getting staff but certainly there are many vacancies. Perhaps when the Minister speaks, if he can return to the issue of the appropriations, he will tell us what will happen with the $9m-odd allocated for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Will there be additional staff? If so, in what area? There is a reference in the papers to a $250,000 allocation for treaty consultations, but I have yet to see where the funds are to be appropriated and what they are to be appropriated for. Perhaps the Minister can give some guidance on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will return to the tabled document dated 30 May, which I found curious. It is rather strange and I wonder why it was sent. On the surface it seems very normal, but when I went through the minority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs I found a lot of evidence about enticements. When I made my speech on ATSIC in the chamber the Minister took objection to what he felt was an imputation that he was involved in something not proper and correct. I do not make that charge at all, and he, as Minister, is at liberty to assess the priorities as he so desires; as indeed he has done in taking 53 per cent of the funds of the ADC and giving them to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The point was made-again, at some time before I was involved in this area-that during the term of this inquiry evidence was given that led the minority to say:</PARA>
<PARA> For all of the reasons set out above, we consider that the consultation process was not only inept, incomplete and inadequate but was also distorted to the extent that enticements were offered in return for a favoured outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently that view was echoed. An article in the Australian dated 2 December, quotes Shirley McPherson as saying that she told a parliamentary committee, in camera:</PARA>
<PARA>enticements were offered in the form of funding commitments if support was given for ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>One can draw one's own conclusions. It would appear that the Minister's memo is proper. I do not doubt that it is, but why has it come out now? Why has it again been delivered to my office? I again make the point that the enticements issue raised extensively in the media last year has not been fully answered. Perhaps the Minister can make some comment as to why this particular memo has come out in the way it has. An article in the Australian dated 15 December 1988 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The secretary of the department, Mr Bill Gray, revealed last week in a submission to the Senate select committee on ATSIC, that more than $800,000 had been promised to Aboriginal communities in the wake of the consultations. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that has ever been refuted. The Minister will refresh my memory, but I understand that during the ATSIC consultations he talked with some 46 communities. No-one draws the conclusion, and I certainly do not, that that $800,000 was promised in direct support for ATSIC, but that allegation should probably be answered by the Minister, to make clear the exact meaning of the memo and whether there are any linkages with this matter of enticements. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the final point I wanted to make. Actually, the Minister wrote to me to clear it up. It involved a mathematical error in the Budget Papers that was subsequently cleared up. I could never quite work out whose error it was, but I am glad it was cleared up. The only person I know that does not make mathematical errors is my bank manager. Extreme care should be taken with the preparation of Budget documents. Errors of that magnitude, regardless of who is Minister at the time, need to be avoided. It may reflect that broader point I wanted to make, not about the level of the ability of the existing staff-I cast no aspersions on them-but about the many vacancies, the many departures and the many resignations. It ought to be of concern to the Minister; it is certainly of concern to us. Whilst I do not care to respond to the attack from the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), I again ask him to look closely at the Hansard and the approach I have taken this afternoon in bringing these matters before honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was hoping to speak only about the issues in the Budget Papers. As I was sitting in my office engaged in discussions with my senior officers, who are currently talking with officers from the Northern Territory Government following a meeting this morning between the Chief Minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and me, my attention was drawn to the remarks of the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). I do not normally charge down to the chamber to respond, but I assure honourable members that if we were in the old House I would have got here a hell of a lot more quickly, and I am not quite sure what I would have done. As I commented in here the other day, one of the great difficulties in my job relates to employing people. Everybody I have employed has been subject to probably the most outrageous attacks that any staff member of any Minister has ever received. Honourable members have to remember that I worked for politicians before I came here and I have been involved in the trade union movement, so I have followed this place fairly closely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not understand a person whom I really had high hopes of being able to work with closely-the shadow Minister-coming into this place with an unsigned piece of paper that makes the lowest, most outrageous statements about two people who have impeccable records in their portfolio activities. It is not as though they do not know anything about the area; it is not as though they have not worked in a wide range of jobs. One of them has won a couple of awards for his portfolio activities. I thought that the shadow Minister was better than this. The great regret I have in this job-if I can put it this way-is that, unfortunately, I have to talk to people. Every poor character that I speak to gets this sort of treatment. Everybody that I employ is described in some of the most outrageous ways. The shadow Minister and I have talked about this. I am absolutely shocked and upset with him. I had high hopes that we could work together in a different way than was the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It is outrageous, as I said in this place yesterday, that the honourable member for Bass can just come in here with an unsigned piece of paper and have the gall and audacity to ask why there is a morale problem in my department. The honourable member has had this sort of trash posted to him. I bet that there is not even a stamp on it. </PARA>

Anyone could have come to my office and picked up a dozen of them. It is unfortunate that the honourable member would cast aspersions on the processes undertaken by the department. The most proper processes that one could imagine were entered into and the selection process has been adequate. Not only does the honourable member cast aspersions on people who, after years of activity in the Public Service, in the portfolio and in related areas, go through the rigours of the process and successfully get appointed to a job, but also he casts aspersions on the panel. He not only attacks the people who got the job but he also attacks the people on the panel. It is a disgrace! He would not make those statements outside Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member ought to talk. Here is the bloke that sold out the trade unions in his electorate at Portland. He should look after his meat workers and let us look after this area. We have here today, when the opportunity for the Parliament is to discuss policy and expenditure, the honourable member for Bass wasting the time of the Parliament by raising the matter of an unsigned letter. I thought he was better than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The processes have been proper. I am used to the vendetta against me. It presents no problem to me because I have one advantage over these other people: I can come in here and say what I like about people, but I will not do that while I am in this job. I have told honourable members that. The day that I finish in this job a few people will want to duck for cover, but while I am in this job I will not enter into the personal responses that Opposition members have in terms of people outside this place. </PARA>
<PARA> As members of Parliament, we can protect ourselves by coming in here and refuting statements. People who work for me cannot do that. Those people can be named in the Hansard; they can be called all sorts of things. All that officers of the Department, who slave their guts out year after year in a department with the highest pressure of probably any department because of the nature of the jobs, get from Opposition members are accusations and unsigned statements being read into the Hansard. In a pious way the honourable member for Bass says, `I know not who sent it to me but I will read it into the Hansard if you like, Mr Chairman'. How pious and presumptuous of him!</PARA>
<PARA> A number of matters have been raised. There is the question of my meeting communities and the result of those meetings, after the proper processes were followed, being that funds flowed into those communities. That matter was well and truly addressed in the Senate Estimates Committee. Opposition members know this. Maybe, God help us, one day the honourable member might be a Minister. I reckon I will be very old and crotchety then, but maybe he will be as he is a little bit younger than I. God help the mob he is looking after, that is all I can say, if he carries on like this. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that when I visit a community a couple of hundred kilometres from anywhere, it is a little hard not to talk to people. So with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) consultations we would go to the central meetings; people would be there from a wide range of organisations and districts. Of course, this was after they had had days of discussions on all sorts of things prior to my arrival. We would then have the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> We had one rule at those meetings. We tried to stick to it but sometimes it was a bit hard to do so totally as is anything that is set down as a rule. We would talk to the communities after the meeting about their specific problems. We went to some 48 or 49 venues around the country covering 50,000 kilometres on that trip. It is usually a while before I can get back to a lot of these places. So people say, `Well, you're not going, Gerry, until you discuss these issues with us'. So we would discuss them. But the processes were followed. That is, assessments were properly made on submissions and requests made to me or to officers travelling with me. Those requests have been documented as having been responded to. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the assertion is made that some misconduct or something that is inappropriate has occurred. I do not know how many times I have to come in here and to say that the officers of my department and I have not been engaged in some activity which resulted in our owning holiday homes in the south of France or our going around with a bucket of money, throwing bundles of it at people as we travelled around the country. It does not work like that. I know that that might be the perception of the honourable member who comes from Tasmania. That is unfortunate for him. It means that he has had a sheltered life and he probably has not seen a lot. But I have offered to take him around after this parliamentary session is concluded to show him how the system works. </PARA>

<PARA> It is appropriate every now and again for me to write a circular because I am travelling all the time. I am either here or in the electorate by day and out by night to be somewhere else the next day. That is the nature of my job. I cannot run it sitting behind a desk. My officers come with me and we work as a team. The circular is pretty self-explanatory. There is no mystery about it. If I wanted to go over to Bill and say, `Look, Bill, I want you to do this. Keep an eye on this', then that is okay. But this matter is referred to in a letter. It is on our files. It is on our records. There is nothing secret about it. It means what it says. There are no misunderstandings. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member then talked about consultation in terms of ATSIC. I repeat that this whole attack on the portfolio area is politically motivated. It has no regard for the human beings involved in the area-none at all. Look at the list of individuals who have been attacked under parliamentary privilege and we will see what I mean. This issue is all about stopping ATSIC. So Opposition members have to shoot me, the messenger; they have to deal with anybody who speaks to me; they have to deal with anybody in the portfolio who likes me; or they have to denigrate people who work with me. But it is all about stopping ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members can go over to the Senate and see the ATSIC legislation being debated. That is the proper way to handle these issues: debate them as Senator Peter Baume is doing, clause by clause, on the issue. Honourable members know that Senator Peter Baume has said that he plays the ball and not the man or the woman. But there are some Opposition members who are not in that category. The honourable member for Bass is now in that category of playing the man and the woman, not the ball, and he has to redeem himself. There are a couple of people around that the honourable member should sort out and have a word to because he has played the man and that is not fair. That is not the way things ought to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the Budget Paper error, it was not my portfolio's mistake-I am pleased to say-and that only leaves one other area. I will leave it to the honourable member to work that out. If he wants a briefing on it I will explain it all to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a small amount of money allocated for treaty consultations but I will just say this on that matter: there is no way known that anything mischievous or any mysteries will occur regarding that issue. Again I say that the treaty issue will be handled openly and properly. I will have to go to Cabinet in the not too distant future with a process proposal. We would envisage that that would lead to some form of announcement. I will be quite happy to keep the honourable member and his party briefed on that situation when the time comes. Again, when we act in this area I would brief the honourable member and the whole community would be advised. We have no intention to hide anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member spoke about consultations. I can provide him with a full breakdown of that expenditure if he requires it. I will organise that and provide him with the information tomorrow, if that is what he wants. He used the words `cut the ADC funds by half'. I think that was a bit of an exaggeration. I hope he did not mean that. It might have been said with regard to one particular area. In relation to our trip, a new approach was adopted last year with the priorities community program. It has been a very successful approach. We combine all the activities of the portfolio and eliminate a lot of duplication that occurred in the past. Communities with dire needs were listed for this program. A whole range of activities take place before any bricks and mortar work starts in terms of assessments, town plans, et cetera. These communities have enormous needs for housing, roads, sewerage and proper water. We are trying to address the problems of these communities in a way which is not piecemeal. One problem we have always suffered from in this portfolio is that outcomes are very difficult to judge. The question is: when do we assess the success of a project-in 12 months' time, five years' time, or whatever?</PARA>
<PARA> The priority community program will address the needs-that is, the bricks and mortar needs-of the community. Rather than build 2.2 new houses, as has been the practice in the past, we will fix the existing housing needs pretty well, as well as the roads, sewerage, water and infrastructure needs of that community. At the same time, through the Department of Employment, Education and Training we will discuss combining our resources for training so that hopefully some mechanism is able to be established within the community in terms of community management programs. We are striving to improve our lot with the community development program and training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The priority program is a very exciting concept. We have moved the Aboriginal Development Commission funds across to our community infrastructure program, which is a little bit broader than the two-year program announced in last year's Budget but is very similar. We have singled out a whole range of communities within the States and at the end of this financial year the needs of those communities will be addressed and the programs will be running. This will ensure that communities in isolated places will have proper roads and all the things that we in our community take for granted. In places in Queensland we are ensuring that water is not lying 18 inches deep under hospitals or child-care centres. When the water dries up the dust is about a foot deep and as a result people suffer from crook eyes, colds and pneumonia and insects breed. </PARA>
<PARA> When I put this proposition to members of the Cabinet last year they wanted to know how to assess the outcomes, so we have put in place a whole range of before and after exercises. The first year was a bit difficult and there was a learning curve there for us all, but it has improved substantially this year and next year it will be even better. In the first year we worked on program management and those sorts of matters. We are very confident about that. That is where the money was spent. It was not taken by me and pocketed or used for things other than housing and infrastructure. Once I had the opportunity to explain that to the commissioners, within the limitations of the Budget processes, we had an acceptance of that by them. One problem is telling people about the Budget processes before the Budget is announced. Once we were able to explain what we intended to do the commissioners were supportive and we worked together to make sure that they had sufficient to meet their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are basically the issues that the honourable member has raised. Having calmed down a little from my initial reaction, I make the plea again to the shadow Minister, who I think is a decent human being, to forgive me if I do get a bit upset when I come in here to defend my staff and my Department. One day he may well find himself in that position. As I said, the vendetta against me as an individual has been going on for some time. It is not over yet. That is one of the joys of the job. I suspect that the persons involved will continue, but when I finish in the job I will address many things said about me and others which are not true. The honourable member and I are in a unique position in this place. We have a job which is not easy and which is not necessarily an area of interest to many of our colleagues. We have to be very careful about what personal information we use in this place. The shadow Minister for science and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), finds all this boring. I have to listen to him every Question Time.</PARA>

<PARA> The point I am trying to make is that this is a very difficult area where the shadow Minister and the Minister ought to be able to work in a particular way that perhaps need not apply in other areas. Every time the shadow Minister and I engage in what has just taken place with that document, it is not the shadow Minister and I who are hurt by it. In the main, Aboriginal people are hurt by it. After 18 months or so of this sort of nonsense, the honourable member will forgive me if I come into the chamber and talk about it. It is never talked about in positive terms. It is always about some mystery, mischief, or failure or something that is wrong, or an inference that somebody has gone off with the dough. Many members in this place approach us in a certain way and we fix matters up. I just make the plea: for God's sake, let this place not slip into what the Senate is all about. Let us not adopt the style of the Senate in regard to this policy area. If we do, we are finished and we can pack up because the Senate style is wrong. The advisers in the chamber-whether they be from my Department or another department-in my opinion are owed some sort of right not to be named in the way they are. It is wrong. I see the former Speaker of the House in the chamber. Parliamentary privilege is just that-a privilege. It is abused too often. Honourable members on the Opposition back bench do not like what I am saying, but it is abused and it is abused by both sides of the chamber. That is something we have to be very careful about. This is a lesson I learnt very early in my time here. I thought it was clever to get up and carry on, but I was wrong. I do not claim to be perfect. I say again to the shadow Minister that this is a very difficult area and we have to be extremely careful. </PARA>
<PARA> My staff work very hard. Every time the shadow Minister gets up and has a chop at my staff in the way in which he did today I will respond in the way I am now responding. When my departmental officers are attacked-whatever position they hold in the portfolio-the honourable member will be confronted in the same way as he has been today. There are processes to deal with people who have done the wrong thing-if they ever do-and cowards' castle in which, parliamentary privilege can be used, is not the arena in which to address those sorts of issues. My offer to continue to work with the shadow Minster-and I hope that happens-still rests. Circulars signed by me or sent to the Secretary are not secret. Circulars distributed within the Department are not secret. They are open to everybody to see because there are no secrets in the Department under my administration. It is an open book. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to the last hour of debate, I believe there is some hope that the offer the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has again given to the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), in respect of this difficult area will be taken up. It saddens me as one of the many observers of this complicated area that requires a great degree of bipartisanship that over the last 18 months to two years we have seen a series of negative events that have not been totally helpful, if we are ever to put policies in place which are heading in the right direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee is at present debating the appropriations of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It is my intention in my contribution to speak to the Department of Employment, Education and Training appropriations and, in particular, to youth affairs. The Employment, Education and Training portfolio deals principally with employment and training, labour market programs, education other than migrant adult education, the Commonwealth Employment Service, the coordination of research policy, research grants and fellowships, and youth affairs. In October last year the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), in his capacity as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Social Justice, announced that there would be a review of the Government's youth policy within a social justice context. They also indicated that in this review they would be considering all responses to the Burdekin report on the needs of homeless youth. At that time the Burdekin report had recently been released. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of youth affairs, the achievements of the Government are substantial. Its youth strategy that was put in place in 1985 has achieved overall improvements in employment, education and training opportunities for young Australians. For example, the unemployment rate for 15- to 19-year-olds has fallen in six years from 22.8 per cent in May 1983 to 14.4 per cent in May this year. There has also been an increase in the proportion of young people staying on at school. Between 1983 and 1988 the figure increased from 62.4 per cent to 72.1 per cent for 16-year-olds, and from 33.6 per cent to 46.1 per cent for 17-year-olds. Nevertheless, the Government has recognised that some young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have not had full and equal access to these opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to Budget Paper No. 7.6A, which contains the explanatory notes for the Employment, Education and Training portfolio. I refer in particular to table 6 on page 37. I want to raise a question in respect of retention rates which has played on my mind for some time. My electorate, by a whole host of criteria, can certainly be described as one containing young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Table 6 shows a comparison of the changes in estimated year 12 completions by socioeconomc status (SES). According to the table, in 1984 the lowest decile in this so-called SES rating was 41.2 per cent and the highest decile was 75.9 per cent, giving an average of 48.8 per cent. Clearly, this shows that those in the higher socioeconomic portion of the community have a greater opportunity of completing year 12. The figures for 1987, which is part of the period that I have previously pointed out had an increase in the average retention rate from something like 44 per cent to a tick under 57 per cent, still show a wide range between the SES deciles-the lowest decile being 48.2 per cent and the top decile 80.1 per cent. The Government needs to pay full attention to the problem of retention rates to ensure that the gap between those two figures lessens. Not only should we in overall terms improve retention rates to year 12 but also we must introduce some form of justice and equity in the way that is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the Department's appropriations that I want to speak to briefly concerns the Skillshare program. I was flicking through some speeches that I made previously in this House and I noticed that two years ago in the committee stage debate of the 1987-88 Budget I spoke on this Department's appropriations. At that time the Government was considering the amalgamation of the then community youth support scheme (CYSS), the community training program and the community volunteer program. It was the consideration of those three programs that led to the introduction of Skillshare. At that time I was concerned that we were going from CYSS, which was directed at youth in particular, to a program that had a wider target group. I was concerned that there might be some problems in attracting youth into the scheme because of the way this program was implemented. I am pleased to see that that has not been as great a problem as I thought it might be. In fact, groups in my own electorate have managed to retain the participation of the younger age group as well as attracting the older, long term unemployed. Of course, there has been some strengthening of the labour market-type programs that these Skillshare groups have been able to offer by having a variety of age groups. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to speak about one Skillshare program-Mature Action-which operates not only in my electorate but also in the general northern suburbs region of Melbourne. Mature Action started out under a community employment project grant and later got funding under a community training program. It has as its focus the older unemployed-people in the age group of 35 to 60. This is a quite difficult portion of the population to offer some hope and appropriate training to, but Mature Action has been able to do this with a great deal of success. I should perhaps indicate that this group started very much under the auspices of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) in his capacity as the honourable member for Jagajaga. It is to his credit that he was able to give encouragement to those actively involved in Mature Action to see that it was successful. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the people involved in the programs that that group undertakes. One program, called modern office skills, aims to give people a chance to adopt appropriate secretarial skills to go into that part of the labour market. The average age of the people undertaking that program is 44 years and they last had a job on average about 111.8 months prior to participating in the program-about nine years out of the work force. It is an indication of the success of that program that over 50 per cent of these people have been able to get jobs after attending Mature Action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 10 minutes allotted to me in the consideration of the Defence estimates, I just want to raise some of the key issues which we face in defence for the next planning period. I will just go through these quickly, because there is limited time, and sketch them out. If we are to take an intelligent view of the requirements for adequate defence forces to protect Australia's security, first of all, there is a need for an integrated strategy for national security. At the moment there is a lack of an integrated strategy for national security-I will explain what I mean by that in a moment-and a lack of process for determining and updating such a strategy. By `national security strategy' I mean a strategy which involves the integration of foreign, economic, trade, defence and other policies in a forward looking way with the objective of maintaining peace in our region and in the hope that our defence forces will never be needed against any aggressor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Hawke Government to achieve this integration has been most evident in South East Asia and in the south-west Pacific. A number of statements from different Ministers are in potential conflict. Until recently there was a distinct lack of interest in the south-west Pacific, for example, by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, and it certainly could not be said that one had any degree of confidence that the Government knew in advance the kinds of things that could happen in the region and that it was fully prepared to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons for the lack of the integrated strategy is that there is not an adequate process for linking politics with the departments in examining these issues together. There has to be a mechanism for ensuring that the Ministers in the Government who have the most clout-including the financial Ministers-are involved in advance in looking at national security strategy and are committed in advance to the kinds of preparations we need to take in defence and in other areas to meet that strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there are gaps in the defence strategy itself and the related force structure arising from inadequacies in the 1987 White Paper. I regard the 1987 White Paper as a considerable advance in defence thinking. In most respects I think it is quite a good document. It builds on the idea of self-reliance, which was introduced by the coalition Government in the 1976 White Paper, but it has certain gaps in it which have become quite evident and some of which have been highlighted by Kangaroo 89. For example, one of the major gaps in it is its failure to define what our commitment is in the surrounding region. I do not think anybody knows what kinds of things Australia believes it is responsible for in the region and, therefore, there has not been any clear definition of the force structure needed to deal with such contingencies. That is something that has to be resolved. There are other gaps relating to forward defence in that paper and they have to be sorted out. There are also equipment gaps which have not been filled, such as airborne early warning and control and mine counter-measures, called for in the 1987 White Paper but still not there. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue is a poor resource allocation in defence itself, caused partly by Government failure to meet financial guidance targets, but also by inadequate internal management within defence. Here I do not mean military management-the military forces have their own management systems and they train people in command to manage the forces. I am talking about general management; I am talking about the kinds of things that the head of the Department, or the head of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), or those senior military and civil officers who have to make the main decisions within defence, have to worry about. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the time that has been made available to me and with the briefings I have had-and I am grateful for those briefings-I have identified serious failures in organisational structure and in management systems which mean that the defence organisation as a whole is not very good at all in assigning responsibilities for things. It is very hard to know who the boss is anywhere in defence and that is not terribly good, therefore, in allocating the vast resources which are under the control of the defence organisation. That is an issue that I will be developing at some length in succeeding weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The next issue is really a part of that-the organisational structure of the Department itself, which I think is unsuited to the management requirements of the Department and the ADF. One of the things I have mentioned already-the difficulty of finding out who is actually responsible for anything-is one of the symptoms of that. Some improvements have been made in that following the Sanderson report, but I do not think that really gets to the heart of those kinds of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The next issue is the outdated management information and control systems throughout the Department and the ADF. I have questioned those in naval support, for example, about how the enormous inventory in naval stores is managed. The management information and control systems and backup computer systems are very dated; they are not really adequately designed for modern management of such a major resource. I think there are big issues there. </PARA>
<PARA> The next area is the shortcomings in management of personnel and in service conditions. This has been dealt with by the Cross report, entitled Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force. Quite a lot of that needs to be looked at more thoroughly than has been done, but I acknowledge that something has been done about that. The main problem in morale is to do with management. I have been into many places where there has been poor personnel morale, of which there are instances in defence, as brought out by the Cross report. Of course, people complain about conditions of service and all that sort of thing, and that is part of it; but when one goes into an organisation and one finds difficulties concerning morale it is usually because of failures in management: the management systems are not clear enough; the responsibilities are not clear enough; people are not clear enough about who the real boss is and whether their boss has sufficient power to carry out the kinds of things they are responsible for; and, because of divisions of responsibility, inadequate management structures and inadequate delegation of financial responsibilities, there is a serious shortcoming in the kinds of management systems and approaches that would lead to higher morale. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to overstress morale problems in all areas of the service. For example, when an exercise such as Kangaroo 89 is taking place one sees morale in the Services at its best because people are doing things. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) has just entered the chamber and will acknowledge that when people are actively engaged in doing real tasks under command, people have a capacity to demonstrate their leadership and are responsible for that particular occasion, morale goes up. Unfortunately, that is not the norm. There are quite serious shortcomings in management organisation and systems which prevent, in the ordinary course of events in the defence organisation, people having a very clear idea who the boss is. For example, does the boss have real authority or is it constricted in ways that apparently are inexplicable to the person below? That results in loss of morale for the manager concerned, irrespective of whether it is a civil manager or a commander-the manager in a military sense. Do people have confidence in the commander if they believe he does not have the right kind of delegated responsibility?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally-and this relates to the problems I have identified-there is inadequate training of top management in both the civil and military streams. I am not talking about military management; I am talking about general management. The problems arise, partly, because in neither the civil nor the military stream is there adequate training for general management. There are excellent civil advisers and military people and each is trained in their own particular skills, but neither is trained systematically through a planned career path in general management. I have just opened up some of the issues I want to develop. The Minister has done quite a few things to make improvements in these areas. I acknowledge that and, indeed, I have supported them. I am just identifying the kinds of issues that I will pursue in succeeding weeks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), although I would like to pursue the discussion, as the honourable member indicated, when we have time for a fuller debate on the issues that he raised, particularly the one relating to management. Suffice it to say that I refer the honourable member to a comprehensive report which was tabled in this Parliament a few years ago by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that went to some of the issues that he raised about management. If the honourable members reads that report, he may get some ideas about where the Government is going. The Government has addressed many of the questions he has raised, but I am sure that we can have a fuller debate on many of these issues some other time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said during the second reading debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90, when one compares a number of the appropriations that were brought forward under the Hawke Government in this Budget, and indeed when one goes back to the last Budget of the last Liberal Government in 1982-83, it is interesting to note that at that time the defence appropriation was $4.6 billion. This year it is $8.3 billion. That represents an increase of a little over 80 per cent, and I worked it out as a compounding increase of around 9 per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA> I would agree with most honourable members that it does not matter what one does with statistics, because one can come up with different answers depending on how one presents them. However, I present four sets of statistics to try to give honourable members a fuller appreciation of where defence funding has been and where it is going. As a percentage of gross domestic product, the average for the Fraser Government over seven years was 2.6 per cent. The average for the Hawke Government so far has been 2.6 per cent. This year it is 2.3 per cent, and it is likely to be around that figure in the next one or two Budgets. In the very unlikely event that the Opposition wins the next election, I suggest that that figure will probably not vary very much. The percentage of government outlays is interesting, because the average for the Fraser Government was 9.4 per cent. The average for the Hawke Government so far has been 9.5 per cent. This year it is 9.6 per cent. There is not much difference, but the percentage of government outlays has been a fraction higher under this Government than the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the rate of real growth. Under the Fraser Government the average rate of real growth over and above the inflation rate was 2.5 per cent. The Fraser Government did very well, although when one compares the real growth figure with the government outlays figure it is slightly down. As one will see, it is way above the average for the Hawke Government. The average under the Hawke Government is 1.3 per cent. Of course, that comes about with the tightening of the budgetary situation in the last couple of years. There will be zero real growth this year and an estimated 2 per cent real growth in the next couple of Budgets. One could ask: What did the Fraser Government do with the money? As a percentage of expenditure on investments, which is basically capital equipment and the like, the Fraser Government spent an average of 19.1 per cent of the Budget on defence. The average expenditure of the Hawke Government on capital equipment is 29.1 per cent. So the figure is 19 per cent for the Fraser Government as against 29 per cent for the Hawke Government. This year it is 27.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This really gets back to the fundamental question that the honourable member raised about the 1987 White Paper and the report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities 12 months earlier when we, on this side of the chamber, under the guidance of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), undertook a review that had not been undertaken before on the re-evaluation of our capabilities. Dibb identified what our capabilities were and what we needed. The aftermath of that was the review of that report and that 1987 White Paper. Everyone, including the honourable member for Mackellar, thought that the White Paper was an excellent document. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of that we have seen a tremendous lift in our capability. Indeed, there has been a rethink on the replacement mentality such as whether we needed all the tanks we kept replacing. Obviously we did not, because in a priority sense they did not do a lot for the defence of this country when compared with other items such as submarines, FA18 fighters, et cetera. This Government has continued with the submarine project-and I will say more about the Anzac frigate project in a second-and the replacement of the FA18 fighters continues. We have continued the Jindalee over the horizon radar system which will be developed further. I hope to see its completion as it will become a wonderful system. There will probably be three such systems across the north of Australia in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA> All this has enhanced our defence self-reliance, or our defence in depth, as some people have called it, which concentrates on early interdiction; long range sea and air strike capability, which is being introduced-highly mobile ground forces for the Army-and the significant development and upgrading of our surveillance and intelligence facilities and operations. That is what this Government's defence policy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The submarine project and the Anzac frigate project are about to get under way. Looking at the overall expenditure of those two projects and all the others that are under way, such as Jindalee, around $12 billion worth of defence manufacturing will occur in Australia over the next decade. That is a massive amount and it is something that would not have occurred under a conservative government. Industry has been right up to the mark very early in the piece in relation to the submarine project and now the Anzac project because it has realised that this Government is genuine in its desire to build all those boats, submarines and Anzac frigates in Australia, and in New Zealand in regard to the latter. This would not have been done under a conservative government because there were elements within the Navy very early on in the submarine project that wanted them bought off the shelf. Later it was moved to the point where they wanted the first one or two bought overseas and the rest built here. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the committee I chair within the Government, which said, after discussions with the Minister, that it wanted a recommendation put to Cabinet that all the vessels be built here. That was done and approved by Cabinet, with some difficulties because such a project had not been undertaken before. We have seen two major projects, one on top of the other, put into play by this Government. Indeed, it is a resurrection of our defence manufacturing, our shipbuilding and our manufacturing industry in many parts, and the spin-offs from that, not just from the military area but commercially, will be vast in the coming years. With the involvement of the Swedes in the submarine project and now the Germans in the frigate program, I can envisage expenditures by those countries not only on those programs but also in other areas, particularly the commercial area. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important Budget. Whilst this defence appropriation does not give any real growth it is significant, as I said earlier, that we have maintained an average growth of around nine per cent per year, which is a real increase of nearly 1 1/2 per cent. That will continue. A figure of two per cent is projected for the following year. Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways: they cannot cut back fiscally, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) wants to do, and maintain real growth at the same time. We on this side have had a tight fiscal policy, and continued growth in defence, and the programs and capabilities of our Defence Force show up to the great delight of those who take an interest in our forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before turning to a specific issue, I express my broad support for the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) in his expose of some of the defence shortcomings. Clearly, we do need a more bipartisan approach in national security matters. Like a lot of my colleagues I welcome the honourable member's move in that direction. This evening I welcome the opportunity to refer particularly to division 230, administrative item 2.07 of the defence appropriations, covering compensation and legal expenses, on page 85 of Budget Paper No. 2. For the financial year 1988-89 we find an appropriation and expenditure of a little over $42m under that heading. For the financial year 1989-90 we find an appropriation of a little over $35m. In themselves those comparative figures and the projected reduction in appropriation are unexceptional. However, this downwards trend and my reference to similar divisional appropriations in the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Finance and the Treasury give no comfort. Indeed, they generate understandable concern and a sense of hopelessness for a group of ex-servicemen and their families. These people are clearly what I would describe as the forgotten one hundred-100 ex-naval personnel who are frustrated at every turn by the Government's double standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In yesterday's media reports and again last evening on the television program The 7.30 Report, many of us would have learnt of or seen the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) explaining the Government's decision to compensate a small number of Australian veterans involved in the British atomic tests at Maralinga in the 1950s for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. This is a welcome, albeit limited, move in the area of Commonwealth compensation liability. However, it does not clarify the apparent inconsistency of this Government when it comes to application of the statute of limitations, particularly as it has been applied to my so-called forgotten one hundred. </PARA>
<PARA> On two occasions earlier this year I have raised in this place the Government's apparent double standards in dealing with compensation claims by survivors of the sinking of HMAS Voyager off the New South Wales south coast in 1964, most specifically the case of Mr Bernard Verwayen of Buderim on the Queensland Sunshine Coast whose fight for justice has already cost him $100,000 and has placed him on the verge of bankruptcy. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Chairman, I would like once again to precis the history of Mr Verwayen's case. In 1985 the Government, through the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), admitted liability in relation to at least six, and arguably all, survivors to waive the statute of limitations to allow common law action. After two successful common law actions involving damages payouts of nearly $500,000 it did a rapid about-face and moved to reapply the statute of limitations, which prevents action being taken if seven years or more has elapsed since the accident. This was relied upon as a specific defence against the claim of Mr Verwayen. In March 1986 the Government altered regulations to facilitate the imposition of the statute of limitations in relation to Voyager claims. At about the same time it also took certain psychiatric examination measures with specific claimants but seemingly discontinued those when the examination results favoured those claimants. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1987 Mr Justice O'Bryan of the Victorian Supreme Court, although critical of the Government's behaviour, ruled that the Commonwealth was entitled to rely on the statute of limitations to bar the claim of Mr Verwayen. I refer honourable members to the Hansard record of this place on 9 December 1987 in which the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) defended the Government's change of mind in 1985, at the same time imputing ulterior motives to those involved, including legal counsel. Of the latter he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not a fact that a firm of lawyers in Melbourne decided that it might be an opportunity to ginger up a bit of business?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Carlton" NAMEID="DF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those imputations are rejected in the strongest terms. Indeed, they are disgraceful. The Attorney also said that the Government had not admitted liability, whereas court records and correspondence on the matter show that this is untrue. In November 1988 the Full Bench of the Victorian Supreme Court overturned Mr Justice O'Bryan's decision, clearing the way for Mr Verwayen to continue his claim. In handing down their decision Mr Justice Kaye and Mr Justice Marks said, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There can be little doubt that the promise was made deliberately and with the knowledge and intention that Mr Verwayen pursue his claim and have his damages assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>In March 1989 the High Court of Australia granted the Commonwealth leave to appeal to that Court against the Victorian Supreme Court ruling. I understand that this might not be heard until February next year. In April 1989 the Government introduced in this place the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Bill, which we supported, allowing a twelve-fold increase in maximum compensation for loss of life or personal injury to passengers, including companies of naval ships. On the surface this was a very commendable initiative by the Government but it was seemingly at major odds with its persistence in its appeal to the High Court in the Verwayen case where the same principles are at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attitude on Voyager compensation seems to me to be driven by the substantial resource implications rather than by an overriding need for equity. Public feelings are best demonstrated in the words of a letter to the Melbourne Sun on 26 April this year from the brother of one of those lost, which concludes with the words:</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the people of Australia to let Voyager and her lost crew finally rest in peace by pressuring the Government to stop its scandalous behaviour and allow the survivors the opportunity to put their case before the courts so that justice can finally be seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>I support an early equitable resolution of Mr Verwayen's claims and those of others. The two key Ministers involved in these matters, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Defence, are reasonable men under many circumstances. I add to that list the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who is at the table. That reason, apparently, has deserted them in the case of Voyager compensation. I wonder whether once again the unsympathetic hand of the `world's greatest Treasurer' might have been a major player in their deliberations. While I accept that the budgetary implications may be substantial in the short term, I can only appeal to the Attorney-General, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to withdraw the Commonwealth's appeal immediately, to stop hiding behind the statute of limitations, and to allow justice to take its natural course. Only then can Mr Verwayen and others once again be confident that the political barriers have been removed and that they can be heard unimpeded in the courts of our land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) focused upon an area of concern that he has brought to the shadow Defence portfolio, the issue of management. Throughout a number of the contributions he made this afternoon that particular theme, that hobby horse of his, was very obvious. I am appreciative, though, of the supportive comments of the honourable member for Mackellar, which, I am sure, will be appreciated by members of the Defence Force, particularly his comments supporting the Defence Force's involvement in Kangaroo 89.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that the honourable member was an observer in that particular exercise, along with the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and me. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) also spent time there. A significant number of other members, particularly from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, took the time to go along to that exercise. It is very important that members of parliament take such opportunities to demonstrate in that public way that members of the Australian Defence Force follow a unique profession and that the profession of arms is a very valuable one which often is taken for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I have had the privilege of having this portfolio, time and time again I have said that the public generally take for granted the men and women who serve in our Defence Force. Only in a time of natural disaster or when there is some sort of a defence emergency do people focus upon those people who serve their country in that way. Irrespective of our different views on the current crisis-the controversy with the internal airline dispute in Australia-I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the chamber very strongly support and appreciate the men and women who serve in the Royal Australian Air Force, in particular, for their contribution during this dispute. I certainly thank the honourable member for Mackellar for his supportive comments. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take up some of the other issues on management raised by the honourable member for Mackellar because I think they are important issues which need to be addressed in a very serious way. The honourable member asked just who is the boss in Defence. If one took it to its logical extreme, one could say that those people who have ministerial responsibility to some extent are the bosses within Defence, but I know that he is talking much more in terms of the day to day management. The honourable member talked about integrated strategies and what he saw as a lack of process for the determination of such a strategy. I remind the honourable member that a body within the Federal Government-that is, the Federal Cabinet-has a very important role in terms of an integrated strategy and particularly in terms of the very important liaison that would take place with such other departments as Foreign Affairs and Trade, along with other interested players, in determining what would be considered an integrated strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the other issues the honourable member raised with respect to management also need to be commented upon by way of looking at some of the larger projects that the Government has been involved in and the actual control of those projects. Each of those projects has a project director who is responsible for its overall guidance. There has been a project director for the submarine project. Commodore Peter Mitchell is in charge of the Anzac ship project. Overall responsibility rests with the Chief of the Defence Force, General Gration. The Secretary to the Department obviously has overall responsibility for the administration of the Department, and the important coordination role between the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Department is significant in that area. To be fair, the honourable member mentioned some of the significant progress that has been made by the Government in terms of rationalising, streamlining and making more effective the structures in management and the organisation in defence. That certainly suggests that there is a level of bipartisan support for some of the things that have been done. </PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious and recent action concerns the higher defence reorganisation resulting from what is generally known as the Sanderson report. The changes that are now taking place in the organisation of Defence Force headquarters and within the Department of Defence itself will obviously improve and streamline the whole process of doing what people would consider defence business. We believe that the job will be done better and, significantly, with fewer people. The overall thrust of the Sanderson report is that it is important that value be put back into rank so that the status of the senior officers who are carrying out those roles is enhanced. By the process identified in this higher defence reorganisation, we believe, the organisation will become more effective and efficient-by greater centralising of policy development, but decentralising the execution of that policy. That is very important for those people who are serving within the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The obvious importance of the integration of the military and civilian streams to a great extent is very obvious. The staffing duplication that inevitably happens in large departments will be removed and we are looking at much flatter hierarchical structures which will certainly improve the general efficiency and organisation within the Department. The Sanderson report suggests that, while some of those important policy areas are being decentralised, we should certainly try to achieve a greater devolution of real authority and financial delegations and responsibilities to service management in the field. In the five months in which I have been Minister, senior officers have often said to me that they see their job being very much enhanced by their being able to perform what they would consider to be a much more meaningful and satisfying role in having a much better opportunity at the coalface of defence, so to speak, out in the field. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area I should comment upon, an area certainly directly within my ministerial responsibilities, is the issue of personnel which the honourable member for Mackellar raised. The Government can take a great deal of satisfaction, but not smugness, in its role in this area. I pay particular tribute to my predecessor in this area, who I believe did much to make sure that the general thrust in personnel management had a real impact for the men and women who serve our country. I would say to the honourable member for Mackellar that some of the important initiatives that were running prior to the tabling of the Cross report, Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force, in November last year were being addressed by this Government. We do not see my ministerial response to that statement on 11 May this year as some sort of finite point as far as personnel management and the whole question of addressing conditions of service are concerned. Obviously it is an ongoing thing. Most people would recognise this, but it should be pointed out that the Government did accept wholly, or in principle, 41 of the 48 recommendations of the report. A number of those initiatives are very much appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> Later this month a review of service pay in accordance with structural efficiency principles is to be presented to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. I have talked about the review of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) fund being very important. Back in May I gave an iron-clad guarantee that no serving member of the ADF had any need to be concerned about that review because his or her conditions would not change, but quite clearly we need to question whether or not 20 years is an appropriate time for people to be eligible for the DFRDB scheme and whether or not some other aspects of the scheme need to be examined. I am delighted that Sir William Cole, a very distinguished public administration figure, has agreed to chair that review. I am sure that it will be very useful as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The renegotiation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and the great work being done by the Defence Housing Authority are very much appreciated by people in the Services and are having a real impact in addressing the question of morale that obviously figures from time to time. Let us face it: if we give people good accommodation we go a long way to having them think that, apart from the remunerative aspects of service within the Australian defence forces, there are other considerations. Obviously good quality housing is very important to families. This Government is spending $103m this year on defence housing, compared with an annual rolling average of about $35m a year during the Fraser Government's period. We are making an impact there and it is being appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> I could comment on the question of personnel in relation to a whole range of other areas, but I will get back to the point raised by the honourable member for Mackellar about a supposed lack of personnel morale. His answer, which is to rely on better management systems, is not really the answer as far as this Government is concerned. We believe that it is a matter of giving the ADF clear direction and purpose. Obviously the White Paper, Kangaroo 89 and those sorts of activities give that sort of sense of direction and purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that we as a nation and as a Parliament recognise the very valuable and significant role that the men and women who serve our country play in the defence of Australia. I have often likened it to a very significant insurance policy in the sense that when we shell out money each year for our housing insurance and motor vehicle insurance we hope that we do not have to use the policy for the purpose for which it is intended. The same could be true of the expenditure that the Government makes on defence. We need defensive preparedness. We need to recognise there is a very high cost in terms of government expenditure. I believe that it is money well spent and I am sure that most honourable members would share that view. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the comments of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles). I think that all members of this House-certainly those who have been in this Parliament over the last six years or so that I have had the privilege to serve-would recognise the honourable member's continuing commitment to and interest in the whole question of defence and foreign affairs. The honourable member mentioned his role on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and in the Caucus committee on foreign affairs and defence. The honourable member for Isaacs placed very important and well-deserved emphasis on Australian involvement in defence industries. It is a significant landmark as far as this Government is concerned that we have moved away from off-the-shelf overseas purchases of major defence items. That is good for this nation and for the Defence Force itself. Most significantly, it gives us a very significant economic and industrial base that can have spin-offs other than the obvious defence-related ones. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention was made of the submarine project and the Anzac ship project, and their obvious importance to the overall economy as well as their defence-related impact. The honourable member also mentioned the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar project. In that context it is worth while in this debate, since I am also the Minister responsible for defence science, to mention another area of my portfolio responsibility that is often overlooked, that is, the very significant contribution made by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Many people recognise that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation makes an important contribution to the nation, but often the impact and the contribution of DSTO are overlooked. Tonight I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the several thousand people who work in DSTO, who support the Department of Defence and who are at the cutting edge of defence technology and innovation. That needs to be put up in lights so that people can wave the flag about it from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the contribution by the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). His contribution focused largely upon the question of compensation and legal expenses in relation to the Voyager tragedy in 1964. I do not want to dwell upon this. I am not seeking to make a series of cheap political points with these comments. But I want to say this: from 1964 to 1972 and from 1975 to 1983 this country was governed by conservative governments. If it is fair to criticise this Government for alleged inaction and for not dealing with the problems of the particular person nominated by the honourable member for Groom, I think it is fair enough to look also at the action or lack of action by those people who were in government at that time. As the honourable member for Groom suggested, it is not an area that is being dealt with simply by the Department of Defence; it has other legal implications. In his contribution the honourable member mentioned the role of the Attorney-General. A debate like this, which deals with defence proposals for expenditure in this fiscal year, is not the opportunity to proceed too far on the question of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to thank the three speakers for their contribution. We can be critical from time to time of some aspects of defence-management systems, morale questions and other challenges. But it is also a reflection of the general maturity of debate within this Parliament that in many respects the big policy questions in terms of defence preparedness and where we are going in a strategic sense are, in fact, bipartisan policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government does not give due credit to our rural industries as our major net export income earners. Recently, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) lauded the fact that tourism has now surpassed wool as Australia's number one export earner. He said that foreign exchange earnings from international tourism reached a record $6.5 billion in 1988-89, an increase of 17 per cent on the previous year. I join with the Minister in commending tourism on that tremendous achievement, because we need every export dollar we can get, and it is only tourism, primary industry and mining that are playing their roles for Australia. It is particularly sad to see the devastation of the tourist industry at present because of the ineptitude of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Minister did not say was that the $6.5 billion was the gross figure. Tourism is a two-way business. People leave Australia in large numbers just as, fortunately, they are coming to Australia in large numbers. The Australian Financial Review dated 29 August details this two-way expenditure as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> International tourists visiting Australia brought in about $4.5 billion worth of foreign exchange in 1987-88. But expenditure by Australians travelling abroad was estimated at $5.2 billion in the same period, according to the Industry Assistance Commission's recent assessment, Economic Implications Of Tourism Expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> This left the ``boom'' with a blow-out of $700m. </PARA>
<PARA>In the year 1988-89 to which the Minister was referring, the tourist industry earned a net positive figure of $430m. However, during the same year the net earnings from wool were $5.72 billion. This is because wool and sheepskins sold overseas earned $5.96 billion as against the $6.5 billion earned by tourism, but imports of raw wool, wool fibre, yarns, textiles and carpets during the year amounted to only $240m, as opposed to the $6.07 billion spent by Australians travelling abroad. The real net figure for wool would be even higher because there is a lower percentage of dollars repatriated overseas from the wool industry than from the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this great and continuing achievement by the wool industry, this Government is more generous when it comes to recognising the export achievements of and providing assistance to industries other than primary industries. For example, during the last financial year the Government spent $46.4m to help with wool research and promotion to earn a net $5.72 billion in export income, and spent $42.3m on tourism, which had a net foreign exchange benefit of $430m. In addition, Australian woolgrowers spent $442.2m themselves on research and promotion and in support of the wool market. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next few years, according to the Budget figures, the Commonwealth's contribution to tourism will be $38.76m in 1991 and $40.3m in 1992-93. On the other hand, assistance to the wool industry in those years will decrease to $26.46m and $26.3m respectively. This is because the Government is ending its assistance for wool promotion. At the moment it contributes $25m a year, which goes to the International Wool Secretariat to ensure the promotion of wool overseas. Incidentally, Australian woolgrowers provide about $200m a year for wool promotion overseas. The wool industry wants a firm commitment from this Government that it will honour the promises it has made over the years to maintain wool promotion. One has only to point to the fact that $25m is about half what the Government should be providing for wool promotion, and the industry needs this sort of forward commitment for its planning. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is the Government cutting its assistance to rural industries, but also it is not helping those industries to reduce costs, particularly those applying to the waterfront and shipping. The wool industry is the largest container shipper in Australia and stands to gain most from waterfront reforms which this Government keeps putting off. Over the last seven years there have been four reviews and reports. The latest of those is the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA). There is to be an agreement, in principle, by the end of October of this year, and that agreement, whatever it is, is to be in force by July next year. So there is no hurry to reform the waterfront. While the Government is racing to take action against the pilots it is prepared to take years to do anything about the waterfront. This deal or fix, the so-called reform of the waterfront, will not necessarily help the wool industry, either, because there will be at least a $300m redundancy package for those affected, which the exporters of this country, significantly in this case the woolgrowers, will have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been even more negligent with regard to the live sheep trade. It is a major export industry for Australia-$250 to $300m a year-and exports to Saudi Arabia, which represented half this trade, have now ceased. Prices for sheep have halved in many areas because of the loss of this very important export industry. There is no sense of urgency or priority on the part of the Government to do something to resurrect and save this important export trade. We certainly need every export dollar we can get, with a projected trade deficit of $18.5 billion to $20 billion this year. No Minister is considering visiting Saudi Arabia or the Middle East. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is not prepared to intervene. He washed his hands of any intervention or responsibility for this important trade in this Parliament last week. The Saudi Arabian government showed its contempt for Australia's Ministers when its Minister for Agriculture disappeared when a delegation of officers from Australia went to that country. Once again, I ask the senior Ministers of this Government to give this important export industry the priority it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two current issues of concern in relation to Canada and our trade with that country. The first concerns the United States-Canada free trade agreement, which commenced on 1 January, and its impact on our canned fruit industry. The second is the possibility of pork being imported from Canada. As the United States-Canada free trade agreement comes into force it is taking over, by the method in which it is being interpreted by those governments, from the Canada-Australia trade agreement. That has negative implications for a number of our export commodities, such as meat, sugar and particularly canned fruit. At $35m the Canadian market is the major market for our exports of canned deciduous fruit. That represents the livelihoods of about 1,000 people in the Goulburn, Murray and Murrumbidgee irrigation areas and the Riverland of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a 10-year period, at 1 1/2 per cent a year, a tariff advantage encouraged a move away from Australia in favour of Californian fruit. I give credit to the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) and, on this occasion, the Prime Minister for being involved in representations with the Canadians, including the Prime Minister of Canada. They are awaiting a reply. However, the United States of America has now put forward a proposal to Canada to accelerate that transition period so that from 1 January next year the 10-year period would be compressed and there would be a 15 per cent tariff advantage for American fruit. With this increased threat and concern, I urge the Government to make a greater effort to protect this valuable export market for Australia. In addition, one should recognise the danger that these bilateral trade pacts, such as that between the United States and Canada and others around the world, are posing for access for Australian goods to those markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem concerns the desire of the pig industry in Canada to export frozen pig meat to Australia. This is a subject of considerable concern to the industry for two reasons. First of all, there is the possibility that transmissible gastroenteritis will be introduced. Australia is one of the few countries free of that disease. Tests at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong have shown that the disease can be transmitted, through frozen pork, to live pigs. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is to make a decision in the near future. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) will be recommending that minimal or acceptable risk be accepted by the industry. This recommendation should not be accepted. In the last few years atropic rhinitis has been introduced to the pig industry because of the laxity of our quarantine procedures. The industry wants an opportunity to discuss the old recommendations with the Minister before a final decision is made. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) indicated in the Senate yesterday that that would happen. It is very important that this be done. In conclusion, I believe that the AQIS policy of acceptable risk-we already have fire blight risk from New Zealand and a nashi pear scab and spot risk from Japan-is putting at risk one of the great natural advantages of Australian agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in the debate on the appropriations of the Department of Primary Industry and Energy I would like to pay tribute to the emphasis that is now being placed on research and land and soil management, which is a welcome change in direction from the days of high subsidies and protection. Indeed, the changes in world prices put massive pressure on primary industries. Developments in other producing nations put additional competitive pressures on Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The existence of a corrupt international regime of subsidies and assistance, especially in the United States of America and the European Community, contributes to an unstable trading environment. This is not unique in the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These misfortunes are shared by all Australian agricultural industries. Wheat producers face similar difficulties, similar misfortunes. The same can be said for our meat and dairy producers. This, however, does not describe a disaster. Adjustment occurs rapidly in these industries. Through adjustment, new technologies are introduced, new enterprises are developed and new capacity is added. Through adjustment, changes are made in the structure of the family farm business, which guarantee its survival and ensure its prosperity. To not adjust, to not have the capacity to adopt the most efficient, low cost operation on farm and within industry defines a real disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains the case that the sugar industry is rigidly and tightly controlled. This control acts to diminish the efforts and returns to dedicated and competent growers. It remains the case that there exist levels of interference, intervention and regulation which are unparalleled in any industry. It remains the case that it is the individuals-the producers and the sons and daughters of producers who make up the sugar industry- who are clearly disadvantaged by the current industry structure. But also, new players in the sugar game are also disadvantaged. The cost of entry remains extremely high. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply not possible for this industry to ignore the developments in industry policy which have characterised the 1980s. The intensive efforts which this Government has made in negotiating a general decline in international agricultural protection have made the previous levels of domestic assistance unsustainable. It is now just not possible to speak with any authority in the international arena if, simultaneously, we indulge ourselves at home. Clearly, the win-win approach is an opening of our markets whilst maintaining the pressure for change in the world trading environment. We are just not going to win in our dispute with the United States if we are two-faced and inconsistent. The major trading powers will seize upon any excuse, any weakness and any delay in order to buttress their own flawed position. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that this is in stark contradiction to comments made just recently by the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Harper, who believes that the answer to the corruption of the international trading environment is to adopt policies just as distortionary and just as ineffective. Mr Harper advocates that we should jeopardise our efforts in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round and sacrifice investment projects in Thailand worth billions by closing the Australian market to imports of pineapples. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not underestimate the difficulty of achieving substantial reductions in levels of world agricultural protection. Thankfully, the benefits of unilaterally moving to lower rates of assistance are immense. By going it alone, by not waiting for other laggards in the protection game, we increase the competitiveness of our own industries, we expand the opportunities of our manufacturing sector and we increase the welfare of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided to reduce all high levels of industry protection. This, I emphasise, applied across the board and will benefit Australian primary producers by $2,400 a year. As I keep saying, there is no way that the sugar industry could have expected to see the maintenance of the administered pricing arrangements. I mention that in this we have received the full and welcome support of the National Farmers Federation. It realises that to engage in a program of subsidies, protection, bounties, marketing arrangements and pricing agreements is to indulge in a beggar-thyself process. This Government has moved to bring the sugar industry in line with other less well cosseted agricultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government lifted the import embargo, which had existed as a `temporary' measure since 1923. The administered domestic arrangements, which allowed for price discrimination between international and domestic prices, were similarly abolished. The removal of these measures has been accompanied by the introduction of a tariff at the flat rate of $115 per tonne, to be continuously reduced to $70 per tonne. The measure of protection afforded by this measure cannot be compared to that which exists for other Australian agricultural industries. For example, in wheat the effective rate of assistance is around 4 per cent, in wool about 2 per cent and in beef around 6 per cent. For sheep meat the figure is about 3 per cent. Even the rice industry is assisted at the comparatively low rate of 26 per cent. Yet these industries face corrupt markets where competitors are assisted by the full resources of national governments. Part of the reason why these industries have been able to exist, adapt and succeed in international markets is that the domestic industry structure favours rapid adjustment to the often rapid changes in the world situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the case in the sugar industry. The current high prices which canegrowers are now enjoying and the strong expectation for continued high prices have given an opportunity, a precious opportunity, to change the industry. Now is the greatest opportunity we have had to change. More than at any time in the past, the domestic environment is now ripe for change. </PARA>
<PARA> The two key issues of interest must be, first, how can present industry arrangements be altered so that resources currently employed in industry are better utilised; and, secondly, what benefits are to be gained from industry expansion and an increased production and export of sugar? In other words, how can the present arrangements be altered so that the individual growers and millers will have the production capacity and industrial flexibility to respond more quickly to changing opportunities in the world market? The present arrangements restrict production growth. So, despite the desirability of increasing exports, that option is simply, and brutally, closed. </PARA>
<PARA> Considerable potential exists for the expansion of our industry. In fact estimates have been presented which suggest that a 50 per cent increase in production is achievable. This implies, using the price figures of 1988-89, an increase in export income of $520m. Given the current requirements for Australia to increase export income, it remains a disappointment to me that the expert producers of sugar are so comprehensively shackled in their efforts to trade their way to prosperity. I do not think I am being too provocative when I say that if this attitude prevailed in all sectors and in all industries, there would be no chance of Australia turning around the current account deficit. This is, thankfully, not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional production would benefit not only growers but also those who are dependent on the income generated by sugar producers in Queensland. It is no surprise that the prosperity of our rural towns revolves around the successes of our rural industries. Thus, benefits would necessarily flow through from producers into the regional economies. This implies increased employment, increased income and increased opportunities for youth. Importantly, by expanding production, by fully utilising the resources which are available for full and proper exploitation, we act to secure the industry's future. </PARA>
<PARA> The ability of canegrowers to stay in the industry, the long term capacity of growers to resist the siren's call of land developers, white-shoe salesmen, smash and grab speculators and get-rich-quick sleaze vendors, depends on the resilience and dynamism of our own operations. By resisting change, this industry guarantees change. But it guarantees change in a way which, irresistibly, disadvantages those who are presently operating within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that individual producers have the ability and the inclination to increase production. New peaks and assignments have been taken up soon after their issue and then have been fully maintained. There is also no doubt that a substantial market exists for any additional increase in Australian exports. The Federal Government has done as much as is possible. The removal of the embargo was necessitated by the need for change as a catalyst which would force a re-examination of existing practices and policies. Further gains depend on movement by the State Government. This is, simply put, a real problem. The catatonic inability of the State Government to resolve its own pressing internal problems does not bode well for the development of proper industry policy. Indeed, I understand that some recent changes may make the situation worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the guise of streamlining administrative arrangements-a long overdue step-Mr Harper has moved to take hold of yet more of the decision-making process. This is an attitude of Mr Harper's which I find increasingly disturbing. He has made it clear that he believes that ministerial responsibility means that he personally decides who will receive what benefits from Government programs or who will pay the cost of the administration of regulations. Ministers should set policies, programs, priorities and guidelines. They should review the efficiency of the implementation and effectiveness of these results but they should leave the administration to the public servants who should be held to account. Failure to do this is a recipe for policy chaos. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in the committee stage debate of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 which allocates $408,377,000 to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and associated areas dealing directly with primary industry. The difficulty I have with this debate is the perception we leave with the community that the Government is tonight earmarking $408,377,000 for the purpose of primary industries across Australia. The impression that the Government has left is that this is the measure of its concern for farmers, growers, viticulturists and all sorts of intensive primary industries around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge that in this Budget and in this committee stage debate we have to recognise that there are areas of Government allocations that flow to rural industries that are not a part of this specific Department of Primary Industries and Energy allocation. Take, for example the Department of Social Security allocation; take, for example, the money made available for roads. All of those funds, in part, flow to assist Australia's primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I want to say that we should not in this committee stage consideration of the Appropriation Bill be sold on the idea that this money will go solely to benefit farmers. The reality is that this is not a lump of money being made available to Australia's primary producers; this is a lump of money being made available to encourage the very industries we need to address our balance of payments deficit. If we run through the Budget Papers and look at the total allocation of funds to farmers-the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) suggesting that a figure of $1.3 billion has been earmarked by the Government for the purpose of encouraging primary industries around Australia-we should not see that amount as a sum of money being made available to farmers. Of that $1.3 billion, rural industries of their own volition contribute, it has been estimated, $882.9m because of what they pay through levies, taxes and charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we are dealing with the industries that have the capacity-the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has alluded to this in his address-to address part of the disastrous balance of payments deficit from which the nation currently suffers. These are principally export industries. Even some of the smaller primary industries, even some of the labour intensive primary industries, even some of the horticultural primary industries are now finding that they are in demand in export markets. There is great opportunity for the Government to do something about having a more productive nation by fostering the industries that the member for Hinkler has referred to and industries such as the cut flower industry, the fruit growing industry, the viticultural industry and the vegetable industry, particularly into the Asian market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government simply cannot expect the farmers of Australia to commend it for its Budget surplus while the nation continues to go broke. I have used an analogy, as the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) who is at the table will be aware, in my Appropriation Bill speech, but I will not bore her by repeating it tonight. I want to make the point that farmers who rely on productivity to keep them in surplus are saying to the Government that this lesson in productivity is the same lesson the Government must learn in budgeting terms. A surplus in the Government's own Budget means very little in turning around the productivity of the nation. That is as far as I will go with that farm analogy in the time that is available to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers continue to be burdened by what has been the blunt tool of interest rates in that every time they seek to expand, every time they seek to borrow money, they are discouraged from doing so because of the Government's present interest rates policy. Inflation has been a further burden under which Australia's primary producers and exporters are forced to labour. I want to take up the point made by the honourable member for Hinkler and say that neither the farmers nor the Department of Primary Industries and Energy expect to be supported by the Government. They simply expect to have unreasonable burdens removed. The honourable member for Hinkler ran through a litany of effective rates of protection currently being enjoyed by primary industries relative to those being enjoyed by secondary industries. I support his remarks that the primary producers that he and I represent have nothing to apologise for in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget allocation farmers expect to be treated fairly, not favoured. On that note I refer to one particular farming industry that I think has been treated fairly-some will say it has been favoured but that would be quite unfair-and in its fair treatment, highlight what has been the inequitable treatment of another primary industry. In the Budget Papers-I did not have time to run through this point in my Appropriation Bill speech-the Government moved to change the taxation rate on flavoured milk. Whereas previously a milk product had to have 95 per cent milk in it in order to attract the favoured 10 per cent tax rate, now that level of milk product can fall to 90 per cent and it will still attract the favoured 10 per cent of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is to be consistent in its approach to primary industries-perhaps, Mr Chairman, you would pardon me if I were to take the milk analogy one step further, and say that if the Government were to be homogenised-it has to ask: Why are we prepared to take this decision regarding flavoured milk and treat fairly-not assist-the dairy industry but not do precisely the same thing in the case of 100 per cent fruit juice? If we have a 100 per cent fruit juice product we have a commodity which is nothing more than that fruit wrapped in a carton. Let me use orange juice as a good illustration. If we have a product that is 100 per cent orange juice, it is effectively a food. But that product is currently taxed as if it were nothing more than a beverage. I will just plead to the Government for a little--</PARA>

But that product does not attract a sales tax. I am pleading for a little effort from the Government to be homogenised in the way in which it deals with what are effectively food beverages. I think, entirely properly, the Government is determined to change the tax structure on flavoured milk. To be consistent it should do the same thing for fruit juice. I simply plead with the Government in this committee stage of the Appropriation Bill for that measure of consistency in its approach to what is a primary industry with the capacity to earn further export income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in the committee stage of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 tonight. Firstly, I would like to focus my remarks on the coal industry and in particular those fields in my own electorate of Oxley. The recent announcement by the discredited National Party Government in Queensland on the cutting of rail freight rates for coalmines is long overdue. However, it only goes half way as the new rates will only apply to new mines and big expansions to existing mines. What about the existing mines? They just miss out. Understandably the local coal industry is upset at this half-baked decision, for even members of the National Party in Queensland should realise that it would give new mines a competitive edge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another recent problem for the west Moreton coalfields has been the granting of a sole contract by the Queensland Government to the Ebenezer open-cut mine to supply coal to the Swanbank power station, the largest domestic contract in the district. This open-cut mine was purchased by a Japanese company, Idemitsu, last year. At the time of the granting of this licence by the Queensland Coal Board, it was understood that coal from this mine would be sold on the export market only and the company would not enter the domestic market. However, we now see this large domestic contract go to the Ebenezer mine although the coal from this mine comes from a different seam from that currently used by the Swanbank power station. The power station was designed to take coal from the known Bundamba seam. The letting of this contract to the Ebenezer mine should therefore mean that expensive alterations will need to be done to the power station. The granting of this contract to the Ebenezer mine will see the loss of jobs in the labour intensive underground mines which have previously supplied the coal to the power station, and especially so with the Rhondda Collieries Pty Ltd mines. Once the Queensland Government realised that it had come up with the wrong decision, did it then attempt to rectify things? Not a chance. Similar to the rail freight decision, we see another backflip that only went halfway, for we now find that the Queensland Government has advised the Ebenezer coal mine that it will be excluded from any future domestic contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the Queensland Government to exclude the Ebenezer mine from all domestic contracts, including the one it has just granted, and to recall the tenders for this contract at the Swanbank power station. Mine owners and unions together accept marketplace realities, but the commercial domination of open-cut mines has led to fears that the underground mining will be phased out, naturally at the cost of many jobs. The Queensland Government, instead of offering assistance to existing mines with reduced freight charges, goes out of its way to put fear into the industry by allowing the running down of one section of the industry against another. With the loss of the Swanbank contract, the Rhondda underground coalmine has no buyers for its coal when that contract runs out. This is despite the reports of an anticipated increase in demand for steaming coal from Japan. The exploitation of cheaper open-cut coal has jeopardised at least 100 million tonnes of west Moreton reserves. The State Government has ignored every call to ensure that contracts were evenly divided between open-cut and underground mines; it has seen fit to ignore the calls of the unions and the mine owners. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Federal Government must learn to do, and what in fact we are doing with other industries and trying to do with the coal industry, is minimise the adverse impacts of fluctuations. The first thing to do is to make sure that as many as possible of the producers at the margin are as competitive as possible and able to withstand downswings. There will always be downswings and we must learn to accommodate them and not try to ignore them. The answer lies in a very strong industry involvement in the information development and assessment process-that means unions, companies and governments together. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989-90 Federal Budget also saw an increase of funding for land care and rural research. Funding for soil conservation has been increased to $23.4m for 1989-90, which is more than the $10.6m spent in the 1988-89 year. This money will go to some 400 projects across Australia directed towards achieving sustainable utilisation of our soil and land resources in line with the recently released national soil conservation strategy. In 1988, the Australian Soil Conservation Council adopted a proposal to declare 1990 the year of land care, and to declare 1990-1999 a decade of land care. The year and decade of land care are a joint Federal-State exercise with the active support of the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> Major items of expenditure will include public awareness, participation and education campaigns to build community awareness, and action on soil conservation. In 1985 this Government undertook to match dollar for dollar industry contributions to joint rural research schemes up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of each rural industry. Nineteen rural industries are covered by these arrangements and the Government funding to match industry levies will increase by $15m to $80.4m for the 1989-90 year. To further our understanding of the geology and prospects of finding petroleum in the offshore basins around Australia, the Government funds the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics continental margins program. Funding in 1989-90 will be $14m. </PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for 1989-90 will be $1,406m, as against $1,335m in the 1988-89 year. This includes $775m, an increase of some $7m over the 1988-89 year, from levies on industry to fund research, marketing and promotion schemes. This more than shows that this Government is committed to the rural sector. We have in the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) a very capable and competent Minister. He is well respected and highly regarded throughout the industries he represents. The people in those industries know that they will always get a fair hearing from this good Minister. A total of $10m will be allocated for the national afforestation program in 1988-90-double last year's expenditure. This will maintain the stimulus the program has created in hardwood establishment and encourage research into increasing the viability of plantations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government provides direct financial assistance to the agricultural, forestry and fishing industries primarily in the forms of price support, rural adjustment and disease eradication schemes, quarantine and inspection services, and contributions to research and promotion. It also provides cost recovered services for the sector, including the exercise of compulsory taxing powers to collect levies on behalf of rural industries. The aim is to foster more efficient, productive, innovative and adaptable primary industries, remove constraints on Australia's export performance, and improve Australia's international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> One other area I wish to comment on is the funding of electronic transfer of export documentation, better known as EXDOC. The decision made in this area will provide the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service with additional resources of $2m in 1989-90 for the implementation of EXDOC. This expenditure will be fully recovered by charges on industry. Both the meat industry and the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation have been closely consulted during the development of this secure and efficient system. The direct benefit to exporters-initially meat-includes no longer having to physically lodge documents for each export consignment, more rapid validation of documentation, and the consequent earlier release of payments for the consignments. Other commodities falling under the control of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will be phased into the EXDOC arrangements over a period. Under the States and Northern Territory Grants (Rural Adjustment) Act 1988, the Commonwealth provides funds and services to enable farmers to overcome financial difficulties arising from circumstances beyond their control-to improve their performance by changing the size of their farms, improve managerial and financial skills, adopt better practices and technology and, after all options have been considered, allow those farmers without prospects in the rural industry to make an orderly exit. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government currently conducts a number of energy management programs both in its own right and in concert with the State and Northern Territory governments. In the government sector the range of training courses on energy efficiency and post-training materials and services will be expanded. A data base of government energy use will be developed and a monitoring and reporting system established. In the transport sector, activities to promote vehicle fuel efficiency projects will be expanded. The Government's programs will also target the residential sector where actions to reduce high levels of electricity use could have considerable beneficial impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The Commonwealth will join the States in a range of promotional activities to encourage improved household energy use. Information will be provided to local governments on the potential for improved domestic energy efficiency through the administration of building and planning by-laws. Energy efficient housing design, both in public and private housing, will be promoted. </PARA>

The story is not about the Lebanon that used to exist years ago with its capital Beirut the financial centre of a prosperous part of the world; the story that we read these days is one of suffering, tragedy and desolation. Largely that is brought about by the Syrian forces in Lebanon whose aim seems to be no less than the destruction of Lebanon and the destruction of Beirut itself. That is an extreme charge because it amounts to something close to genocide; yet it is a charge made by no less a person than the Pope himself. In the Australian Financial Review of Thursday, 17 August, a report states that, referring to the Pope:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the latest shelling of Beirut was an attempt at ``genocide'', and compared the Syrians to ``Cain who made himself culpable for the death of his brother''. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also reported that the Pope said:</PARA>
<PARA>In the name of God, I appeal to the Syrian authorities, asking them to cease the bombings that aim at destroying the capital of Lebanon and the entire country. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not the truth? Do we not know that that is what is taking place? Yet so little is done. So little diplomatic international energy seems to be given to this truly disastrous problem. If one picks up the International Herald Tribune of a few days ago one will see on the front page a photograph of an exodus from Beirut travelling south. It is one of the worst looking traffic jams one could ever see. Cars are 10 abreast. Those people are fleeing for their lives from a city that is being destroyed around their ears. </PARA>
<PARA> The Syrian Army has around 40,000 men in Lebanon. It occupies two-thirds or more of Lebanon. It seems determined, under President Assad, to drive other forces out of Lebanon and to dismember that country. The dream of greater Syria has not disappeared. The dream of greater Syria is there. What do we do for the Lebanese people? We do very little. God knows it is a difficult problem. There is no easy answer, but can we not do more? Can the countries of the world not do more than they have so far? Recently-and again this was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 17 August-the Secretary-General to the United Nations convened a meeting of the Security Council. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> A declaration, adopted unanimously by the 15 members said: ``The Council . . . urgently appeals to all the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing and shelling on land and sea.''</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that nothing has happened. The truth is that destruction continues, shelling continues, and loss of life continues. The demolition of the city of Beirut and the lives of its people continue. What I hope the Government will do, as part of its international diplomatic efforts, is give high priority to some coordinated action to bring pressure on Syria to get out-to bring pressure on the other parties, the other foreign forces in Lebanon, to get out. It needs a program of constructive diplomacy. If the superpowers can agree on the resolution that was agreed to in the Security Council they may even agree to work together with the other major powers to put some pressure on Syria to get out in the name of decency-for the lives of the Lebanese people and give them an opportunity to reconstruct their country. That opportunity is being denied them and it will be denied them for as long as Syrian forces remain in Lebanon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The attempt under way to form a solidarity-based government in Poland marks the first attempt at a peaceful transition from a communist regime to one with a non-communist leadership and substantial political pluralism. While non-communist authoritarian systems have made the transition to democracy, there is no precedent for what seems to be under way in Poland. As Lech Walesa said recently, `Nobody has previously taken the road that leads from socialism to capitalism'. The Polish developments are important for Australia because of their intrinsic significance and because Australia has direct interests in East-West security. The next Polish government faces a severe economic situation, with high inflation, low output, outdated manufacturing plant and an exhausted and alienated work force. A Solidarity-led government must try to cope with these problems and simultaneously set up a new structure of political authority. The solidarity movement will clearly face substantial internal strains as well, as it moves from a repressed opposition force to be a leading force in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The political and economic problems facing a Solidarity-led government indicate that there is no room for complacency in the West about prospects for change in Poland. Gorbachev's courageous and audacious policies in Soviet domestic and foreign affairs have created a window of opportunity for peaceful change in Eastern Europe which Poland and Hungary in particular are seeking to use. Change in Eastern Europe, however, needs to be well conducted and effectively implemented; otherwise it will not be lasting. It is clearly in the interests of Western states to support the process of reforming Poland and to give Solidarity a chance to achieve success in its economic reforms. Aid and support must clearly be given in a cautious manner so that it is not seen to be aiming at compromising Soviet interests and not bringing into question Poland's membership of the Warsaw Pact alliance. This point was made recently by a senior American analyst, Brzezinski. What is needed from the West is a combination of material support and rhetorical restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several ways the West can help. Poland clearly needs substantial amounts of capital to make it possible and feasible for the economy to revive. There are critical shortages of both consumer goods and capital equipment. The West can help substantially by acting to alleviate this capital shortfall. There are grounds for concern that so far some major Western countries are not responding to the pace of change in events in Poland and to the critical need to support moves towards pluralism and democracy in a concrete and not just a rhetorical way. So far the United States of America has committed just $119m in aid to Poland, which is one-fifth of the cost of one Stealth bomber. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Community and other interested Western states could organise programs to allow a substantial number of Poles to gain skills in running economic enterprises. Western countries could encourage the process of economic reform and recovery by providing wider access to Polish goods. It is clearly anomalous that exports from East Germany freely enter the European Community through the Federal Republic while Poland's exports cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> The West did not create the problems of postwar Poland, but it is very much in the interests of Western countries to support those who are fighting peacefully, valiantly and intelligently for political and economic renewal in Poland. At a time of economic stringency this issue, none the less, deserves Australia's interest and support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I, like the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), acknowledge that this is the first time I have spoken before you and I congratulate you on your appointment. I note from the Budget Papers and from considerable discussion on the matter in recent days that Commonwealth road funding is to be kept at alarmingly low levels in the coming financial year. Total funding will be only $1,333m, up from $1,217m last year. An increase of $120m is but a drop in the ocean of real road funding need. It is not much more than a drop out of the bucket of fuel excise returns to this Government. As the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) pointed out a couple of nights ago, this increase represents only 2.2 per cent in real terms. Furthermore, it needs to be considered against the drop of around 30 per cent in real terms over the last 6 1/2 years. It contrasts with the last coalition Budget provision for road funding of $1,203m in 1983; $1,203m several years ago and countless consumer price increases ago against Labor's best of a paltry $1.3 billion this year. I often wonder what it would be like to travel from one side of the electorate of Gwydir to the other on bitumen roads in about 20 minutes, as many on the other side of the chamber and a few on this side can do in their electorates. It must be a wonderful luxury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under this Government, the principle of user pays is as hollow as the Budget we have just had presented to us. The users have been paying but they have not had much of a return on their investment. This year they will pay out an estimated $5,645m in excise tax, and they will not be amused to know that, of that amount, around $4,300m will go elsewhere rather than on road funding. This Government has become very professional at robbing Peter to pay Paul and the Australian fuel user and road user has had enough. He or she recognises this Budget for its hypocrisy in this regard. In the townships which are not connected by bitumen in my electorate-and there are plenty of them-I am sure that the users would find sufficient materials on this issue to tar and feather the Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> Has any honourable member on the other side of the chamber been required to send children by bus over 40 or 60 kilometres of rough and dangerous dirt roads-roads that become impassable in the wet? What does that do for family life?</PARA>

The Treasurer would not be able to comprehend the impact of this lack of provision on families, farmers, travellers and operators of small businesses in rural communities. In places such as Pilliga and Burren Junction-little towns in isolated areas-the reality for many people is no bitumen for many kilometres. Those communities have paid their way in more ways than merely the fuel excise tax, and they deserve better. Good roads mean better productivity, lower accident rates, less damage to machinery and equipment, and faster delivery of produce to marketplaces and export destinations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any business manager would know that, if one neglects part of a business, that neglect will cause the rest to suffer. I submit that this Government's neglect of roads will contribute to its downfall. The coalition is committed to a substantial increase in road funding. We are listening to the concerns of the motorists and road user organisations, whom this Government has regarded as milking cows for too long. Over the last six weeks or so I have visited every township in my electorate. I can say with absolute confidence that the condition of roads is uppermost in the minds of most of these people there. They have had enough. We have an urgent requirement to address their needs in this area because the prosperity of the nation depends upon their having the wherewithal to give of their best. Labor will not give it to them; the coalition must. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself compelled to comment that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who spoke before me, comes from the outer suburbs of Sydney, yet he complained about roads. The reality is that, if he wanted to do something rational about improving roads in this country, he would be advocating that we put a lot of money into rail. I believe that there is room for at least $1 billion worth of expenditure to upgrade rail services in this country. In this way we would be serving some useful purposes. We would be making a rational decision to carry long haul freight on rail, where it is most efficiently carried, and taking off the roads the heavy trucks which do the damage to the roads. The honourable member talked about people paying. The reality is that heavy trucks do not pay; they cost. The Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport in Western Australia showed that heavy haulage costs far more than is recouped in the way of taxes and charges. So if the honourable member wanted to do something serious about roads he would strongly support the modernisation and unification of the rail system. If honourable members opposite were to have any policy at all that is the policy they should have. That is something they could berate this Government with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not meant as such. The only people who play on level playing fields are good losers. I think we ought to recognise that it is not the way industry performs anywhere in the world. If we have good and successful industries we should be giving them all the support we can, not trying to make the playing field level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are serious about our overseas earnings we must look first at adding value to our natural resources. Herein lies the greatest opportunity to get improvements. I think the Western Australian Government leads the way. It leads the way in adding value to gold and wool. It is desperately trying to get mineral sands off the ground against the strong objection of the environmentalists, or, as I prefer to call them and as they are more accurately called, the prohibitionists. There is nothing in Australia to equal the Western Australian timber trust concept at the moment in the area of forest products. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the criminal actions of the Victorian Government. I have just spent some time at Orbost and I must say that I am appalled at the Victorian Government allowing 100 tonnes per hectare of usable timber to lie and rot or be burnt on the forest floor. It stays there as half-burnt logs and debris. I am told that that material amounts to about 1 1/2 million tonnes. In woodchips alone it is worth $100m to us in income, but a lot of that timber is actually millable timber. It could be milled and only the residue, the waste material, put to woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government seems paralysed in its actions because down there the environmentalists-these prohibitionists-say, `If we allow woodchipping we will need to get a pulp mill, and if we get a pulp mill political pressure will continue the practice of forestry'. Forestry has a proud history; forestry is an industry that deserves to continue; and forestry, through forest products, is one way in which we can address this nation's $1.7 billion deficit. It is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I applaud the stand of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who has told those silly National Party people in Victoria that the future lies in the development of the industry. Those people are resisting the development of the industry to protect their own selfish, short term interests. They are frightened that, if we get timber workers there, they will probably take over the local government. Would that not be a shame! It is in Australia's national interest that we should be ensuring that this timber is used, that we are addressing our current account deficit problem, and that jobs are created. I believe that the Victorian Government ought to get a very strong message from the more responsible Ministers in this Government such as the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that that is the way to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The adjournment debate certainly provides some entertainment. There has been a broad range of issues discussed today from the closing of pharmacies to the postage entitlement. The airlines dispute was prominent. It appears that the olive branch held out by the airline pilots will be rejected by the employers. That is a pity. I guess that Australia still has a long way to go. As regards the stick hours which have been cited today, my information suggests that the figure is more like 62.63 hours for a Boeing crew.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I would like to refer to some people who are marvellous volunteers in Australia's charities, as we enter sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) week. The Lady Mayoress's charity function, held every two years in the electorate of Adelaide, is an initiative which supports local fashion and industry. It was started by Mrs Mary Joseph, who was the then incumbent. She has been followed by Mrs Natalie Bowen; Mrs A. J. Watson; Mrs Rosemary Boucat, representing Wendy Chapman, the Lady Mayoress; Mrs Levaun Jarvis-who does not enjoy good health but who is a very inspiring lady-and Mrs Angela Condours, the wife of the current Lord Mayor of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> The charities that are being supported this year are the Minda Incorporated homes, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, Judith House, which is a crisis care centre, skin cancer research, and the Aboriginal Catholic Community. The categories were for student designers and new professional designers who have been in the industry for under four years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to link this to some friends and colleagues of mine, and certainly constituents, who have supported this event since its inception-George Gross and Harry Watt, internationally acclaimed couturiers of George Gross and Harry Who Design Co. Pty Ltd of North Adelaide and Gilbert Street. They are international designers in Tokyo and London and throughout Australia. They have supported this marvellous charity since its inception. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my favourite ladies, who has been a great support to me, is Phyllis Southgate of Impulse Promotions, a marvellous and creative talent. In 1984 I was invited to come down from Blyth in the mid-north of South Australia for the primary producers executive committee to write, produce and play in a revue called On the Sheep's Back-A Jubilant Revue. It was here that we linked together a very exciting concept of theatre and fashion which played very successfully in South Australia in 1986 for the Jubilee 150. Phyllis and I have stage-managed many fashion awards and fashion parades together. This was her final parade. She is hanging up the glitter and turning off the spotlight on charity functions, including the Lady Mayoress's fashion parades. </PARA>
<PARA> I continue with the rag trade theme. I refer to a great enterprising company within the electorate of Adelaide called Saville Row Pty Ltd. Neville and Patrine Quist are the principals of Saville Row. Last week in Sydney they were grand finalists in the prestigious Australian fashion awards. This international fashion house has huge export potential which is being realised in the United States of America and Europe. I know that the party of Misses Giorgio, Morant and Luca supported Saville Row in Sydney last week and in Adelaide's Quest for Success. The fashion manufacturing, supply, retailing and employment industry is alive and well in Adelaide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sport has always been an important part of the Australian way of life. This is particularly so in the City of Ipswich, on which my electorate of Oxley is based. This city has a long history of producing many sports stars of both national and international standard in a wide variety of sports, including all the major codes of football. Ipswich has had such high representation in international competition that it has its own international club.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, when we think of sports people, we do not always think of the administrators behind the scenes. Tonight I would like to speak about a man who made a lifetime commitment to rugby league. The contribution of that man to ruby league will be sadly missed in Queensland rugby league circles, particularly in Ipswich. That man is John Clark better known as Gov. Gov passed away on 10 June this year at the age of 74 after suffering heart failure following surgery. His involvement with rugby league spanned 59 years, from a fourth grade junior player with the premiership local side through to senior administrative positions. Gov Clark's dedication to rugby league was all-consuming and his long involvement with the game, particularly at the local level, has made his name synonymous with the Ipswich league. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, his involvement with the game commenced 59 years ago in 1930 as a fourth grade player with the local premier side. The next year he played half-back for the side which was then known as Starlights, and in 1934 became team captain for Norths. His playing career was interrupted by a four-year stint in the Army when he served in North Queensland at Townsville and Thursday Island. In 1965, Gov became secretary of the Ipswich Rugby League, a position he held for 16 years. During this time he fought long and hard in the interests of Ipswich Rugby League. He had very firm views on the future of the game he loved so much and was not afraid to take on anyone who would try to sway him in those views. This strong commitment often brought him into conflict with his good friend the late Ron McAuliffe, who was a former boss of the Queensland Rugby League. Many honourable members will remember Ron as a member of the Australian Parliament, representing Queensland in the Senate for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Gov continued his administrative role as president of the Ipswich Rugby League for three years and as Queensland Rugby League, Ipswich and West Moreton branch chairman of directors for three years. His role extended nationally as the Queensland delegate to the Australian Rugby League for three years and as a proxy delegate for 10 years. In 1972 he co-managed the Australian World Cup side which toured England and France and attended an international rugby league conference in Paris during the same year. His dedication to the game was recognised when Ron McAuliffe awarded him life membership of the Queensland Rugby League. I understand that he also received the British Empire Medal about six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Gov Clark's role as an administrator in the local league has no doubt contributed to the production of so many great rugby league players from the Ipswich region, many of whom are still making their impact on the State, national and international competition. His efforts for the game he loved will not be forgotten. His memory will linger in the minds of present and future players and administrators in rugby league circles. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to Gov's great contribution to rugby league, he was also a keen Australian Labor Party supporter. He was always proud to display a Labor sign in his front yard during election campaigns. He will certainly be remembered in my local area as a great rugby league supporter, worker and player for many years. I offer my condolences to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As there is a chance to put in a couple more minutes in this adjournment debate, I want to refer to the airlines dispute which has now raged over a couple of weeks. Some very salient points come into this debate. A lot of flak has been flying. I have had the opportunity to speak to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, which is easy to contact at 132 Albert Road, South Melbourne. Its phone number is in the book. I was amazed when it was indicated to me that no politicians had bothered to ring up to get a point of view. The pilots recognise, as I said in my press release, that a 30 per cent pay increase is obscene, is difficult to comprehend and is always going to be challenged. The pilots are a group of professional dedicated men who have always said that this dispute was tacky. Their claim has always been open for negotiation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to statements which have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in challenging the stick time hours. A roster shows that the flight time for a Boeing 767 for the month in question was 62.7 hours. For the A320 roster, the flight time-again referred to by the Prime Minister as the stick time-was 61.68 hours per month. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight the pilots have issued a press release saying that they are prepared to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. I believe that the olive branch that has been held out to the employers has been rejected. Ansett Airlines of Australia has said that it will not negotiate. I guess that its guidelines are that one cannot really go back to work and still be on strike. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is haemorrhaging and the tourism industry is suffering. Both parties to the dispute have thrust and counterthrust across the table. I plead with the politicians to ring the pilots to see whether something can be achieved. Surely, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) or the Prime Minister can pick up a phone and dial into Melbourne. </PARA>

<PARA>4. 1988-89</PARA>
<PARA>15158.43</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Following an investigation into the services provided by both Cabcharge and DAS, it was decided that Cabcharge was the more efficient alternative, particularly interstate. The Cabcharge facility was therefore introduced in November 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Officers must sign Cabcharge dockets prior to being issued Cabcharge vouchers. For Cabcharge Credit Cards and vouchers, dockets are attached to the invoice for verification purposes. Random checks are carried out periodically to ensure that the Cabcharge facility is only used for Departmental purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Present recording systems do not allow easy retrieval of expenditure figures on Commonwealth Car Hire (either with or without Driver). To extract amounts relating solely to the Department for Commonwealth Car hire either with or without Driver over the period requested would involve the deployment of considerable resources.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) $2,143, (b) $5,496, (c) $49,000, (d) $550,356.</PARA>
<PARA> The figures for 1987-88 and 1988-89 exclude expenditure in Western Australia since this information is not available. However, Western Australia expenditure is minimal.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Although there was minor expenditure on Cabcharge in Financial Year 1985-86, the use of Cabcharge cards was first endorsed for use in the department in February 1987 with use of Cabcharge vouchers being progressively introduced from June 1988. It is not yet in operation in all areas of the department.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Expenditure information is available only by State rather than cities, however the bulk of expenditure has occurred in Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT and it can be assumed that most of this was in the capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Prospective travellers must indicate their requirements for Cabcharge vouchers on their Movement Requisition which is considered and approved by an authorised departmental delegate under Finance Regulation 48 (c). On approval of the Movement Requisition, Cabcharge vouchers are issued by authorised departmental travel or administrative sections. There are also a number of Cabcharge cards on issue and these are under the control of nominated senior officers.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) $7.443m, (b) $6.983m, (c) $7.494m, (d) $7.945m, (e) $9.221m.</PARA>
<PARA> These figures include hire details for all areas of Defence except Air Force. They include Commonwealth cars, taxis and both short and long term hire of self drive vehicles. It has not been practicable to extract from those figures the costs associated with hire of Commonwealth cars with drivers nor to extract Air Force data in the form requested.</PARA>
