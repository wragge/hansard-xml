<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I present the Committee's report entitled Going for Gold-First report of an inquiry into sports funding and administration, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report which I have just tabled is the result of four months concentrated work by the members of the subcommittee over what is normally a relaxed time for the Parliament. I wish at the outset to pay tribute to the members of the subcommittee, who worked extremely well together. The honourable members for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), Perth (Dr Charlesworth), Canning (Mr Gear), Higgins (Mr Shipton) and I spent many hours poring over the report itself to come to the recommendations that come before the Parliament this morning. I would also pay tribute to the sporting administrators and athletes who took the time not only to make submissions but also to meet the subcommittee. As is noted in the report, some 100 witnesses appeared before the subcommittee, and the transcript of evidence runs to over 2,000 pages. There are also the unrecorded discussions which took place at the sporting ovals, around the pool or in the stadium, and they go to help make the impressions which the subcommittee formed and which have led to the 32 recommendations that make up the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has concentrated in this report on high performance or elite sports. While there are 32 recommendations, the most important statement in the report is that the Forward Estimates as published by the Department of Finance are unacceptable. To suggest that this nation should allocate only $23.6m in Federal funds to sport while at the same time allocating over $60m to assist the arts and over $80m to the film industry is not acceptable to the Committee. I would suggest that the Australian nation gets a far better return from our investment in our sports people than it does in many of those other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has noted in the report the impact that sport has on the economy. It is one of the unrecognised contributors to our economic development, and the Committee has suggested that the studies into that matter, which are under way, be expedited. The Committee has made a number of recommendations to provide our elite athletes with a career after sport. To encourage firms to do this, the Committee has recommended the introduction of a scheme, which we have called the taxation incentive scheme, to allow business enterprises that employ designated elite athletes to be able to claim as a taxation deduction at an accelerated rate the additional costs of employing that athlete. </PARA>
<PARA> Athletes have to bear many costs, such as costs of travel, costs of attending competitions, the cost of equipment-a range of things on top of their normal living expenses. The Committee is very cognisant of those problems as a result of talking to athletes. Equally, we are concerned about career paths for athletes. It is simply not good enough in this country to tell our elite athletes who represent Australia at the highest level, `Here is a pittance; go and train, do your bit for Australia, but after sport, we are sorry; there is nothing for you and we can't help you'. </PARA>
<PARA> One witness, Mr Ted Harris, who gave evidence in Sydney on 18 February, foreshadowed to the Committee a proposal for Australian Airlines to employ a number of Australia's elite athletes. That announcement was made yesterday. The airline will employ four of Australia's elite athletes. I congratulate Australian Airlines on this initiative and hope that other firms in the private sector are prepared to follow suit and employ elite athletes. We have also suggested that each Commonwealth department and authority report on prospects for the employment of elite athletes in those departments and authorities and that this issue be raised with the respective State governments. This is an alternative way of helping our elite athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has considered the operations of the combined Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and Australian Sports Commission. In the other place there has been a great deal of debate about the Australian Institute of Sport, drugs in sport and a range of other options. The Committee is concerned about factual information and the benefits that flow to the Australian community through investment in sport. We have suggested that the AIS has a specific role to play as a national training centre, as a scientific resource centre in sports and as an assembly venue for teams. We have suggested a major review of the present assistance schemes, the Australian Institute of Sport scholarship and the sports talent encouragement plan grant. We believe that both of those need to be reviewed. We believe that there is an argument that those sports men and women who are AIS scholarship holders should not be bound to residential units in Canberra. If they want to train in the pool and live at home in Brisbane, they should have that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe that the sports talent encouragement plan grant, the STEP program, needs to be reviewed. It should be realised that many athletes are not eligible for the unemployment benefit as they are not actively seeking work. At present those in receipt of an AIS scholarship do not even receive pocket money. Accordingly, a cash allowance would, to quote one of the athletes, `not go astray'. Recommendations have been made accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has suggested that Australia cannot provide assistance at the elite level to too many sports. Australia should concentrate on those sports in which Australia is internationally competitive and which enjoy widespread community support. In that respect, evidence suggests that Australia should limit assistance at the elite level to between 15 and 25 sports. Sports which would be included at this stage include basketball, canoeing, cycling, hockey, rowing, track and field, swimming and netball. We are not saying that the Government should not support sport; we are saying that at the elite level there needs to be a greater concentration on fewer sports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the number and types of sports to be supported at the elite level should be the subject of regular review and take account of established international performance indicators. There is also a recommendation that the AIS establish talent development programs in association with the States and national sporting associations. These programs should feed into the national senior squads which represent Australia. With regard to coaches, the Committee has recommended the establishment of a coaches assistance grant which could be used by coaches to travel to competitions with the athletes they coach. Eligibility for the grant should include the coaches of high performance athletes, even though they may not have acceptable coaching qualifications. We have made a recommendation about the need to expand the funding for Aussie Sports, which assists people getting into sport at a young age. Talent identification programs are something we believe in very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the report contains 32 recommendations. Unfortunately, time does not permit me to outline them all. Some of my colleagues from the subcommittee will concentrate on one or two of the specific aspects of the report, but the recommendations and the background to them are all contained in the report. I commend it to the House and I commend it to anyone who has an interest in sport in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would particularly like to thank Hansard for making available the transcripts of evidence in a very short space of time and Pat Norris and his printing staff for getting the reports printed in an even shorter period. I also thank Sharon Fisher and Amanda Garlick from our secretariat for the work they have put into constantly rewriting and retyping the drafts; Dorothy Miles, the Project Officer, who had all the dreadful jobs to do in putting the report together; and in particular Phil Bergin, the Secretary of the Committee, who worked long hours, weekends and well into the night redrafting and redrafting when the members of the subcommittee had the opportunity to sit down and read the Chairman's draft and suggest word replacements, sentence replacements and paragraph replacements, seemingly ad nauseam. Phil Bergin is indeed a credit to the organisation and to the House of Representatives, and I think this report is testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude by expressing a personal view. As I said, it is my considered opinion that, on the evidence that has come before this subcommittee in reference to sports funding in this country, it is not only inadequate but also in a lot of ways ineffective. There is certainly a need for the injection of further funds into sport in this country but at the same time there is a requirement that private industry and people in the community help Australia's talented and elite athletes. Governments should not be expected to do it on their own. There is a need for the community to recognise that economic as well as social and health benefits flow because of the influence of these people in sport on our children and on our lifestyles. The Government needs to review urgently its forward estimates for sports funding, which are piddling in comparison to the estimates for other areas which are seen to be excellent for a variety of reasons but which some of us on the subcommittee cannot possibly agree with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I rise to support the Chairman of the subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in tabling our report Going for Gold!. This report is tabled with a background of a new era in world sport for top class athletes. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia had the presumption that we would win gold medals at Olympic Games and other world class events. Now, in the 1980s, and soon in the 1990s, at the world championships and the Olympic Games, sport is a very serious, tough and competitive business and gold medals are very hard to come by. The athletes who reach this international standard have very heavy demands made on them. They have to train for between four and six years, up to six days a week, with total commitment and with little personal life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The psychological and physical demands now made on athletes were unheard of some 10 years ago, when we were still winning gold medals. In May 1954, when Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile barrier, work, study and athletic endeavours were able to be undertaken together. This is no longer the case in this modern Olympic era. Therefore the subcommittee had to look very carefully at Australia's position and the way in which we would support our elite or high performance athletes. In 1989 the problem of the six day week, four-year athlete emerges as to who is to support the athlete and the coach. My colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) has a personal problem in this matter in that his son is now training in the sport of rowing. He has represented Australia in the Youth Eight but has a very critical decision to make as to whether to continue competitive rowing for another four years, totally devoting his life to that sport with very unknown results in the way of success and whether he will be selected, or whether to undertake a course of tertiary study. So we have one man on the subcommittee who is personally concerned as to whether government should allocate large sums of money to elite sportsmen or whether he personally should help his son. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem faced by the honourable member for Higgins and other honourable members on the Committee who viewed the question of government allocation was: what level of government money should be allocated to high performance athletes? Some witnesses that came before us gave evidence that in some areas the lean and hungry approach was still successful. Athletes in the areas of rowing, cycling and swimming as well as canoeists had very few facilities and little support from government. Yet they were able to bring home some first-class results at the recent Olympic Games. It is conceded, from the Committee's point of view, that they did have a considerable amount of government support. However, looked at from international standards, these athletes were the poor of the Olympic Games village. </PARA>
<PARA> The support that the Committee is recommending to athletes here in Australia brings to mind the difficulties facing elite athletes in Australia. We have a vast geographical problem in Australia. The main centres of population are spread from Brisbane to Perth. We have the problem of State rivalry. We have the problem of local governments making a contribution in their own way to the broad base of sport. We have climatic variations between Queensland and Tasmania. We have national bodies that, in their own way, have State rivalries in the way in which they organise their affairs. And, of course, we have the difficulty of our distance from the Northern Hemisphere competition and the costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA> We have 100 sports in Australia. The Committee is very strong in its recommendations that if we are to support the elite athletes we should concentrate on the allocation of finance to between 15 to 25 sports. The Committee has estimated that about $900m of government funds has been allocated to support sport. The breakup is: 73 per cent from local government; 20 per cent from States; and 6 per cent from the Federal Government. This supports the Chairman's suggestion that the Federal Government could add its contribution to the total sporting life in Australia. In the last year the Federal Government allocated $33.2m directly towards high-performance athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of whether taxpayers are getting a true return for their money is one which the Committee had a good look at. There is a variation of opinion. Does the allocation of money to elite athletes who perform in front of television cameras change the attitude and approach by average Australia? Or does it create a nation of Norms-that is, people who sit in front of the television to watch their high-class athletes? My view is that there is a tendency to create a nation of Norms. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the Institute of Sport whose original charter was to develop potential champions and train our current Australian representatives for gold medal achievement. At the moment there are 300 athletes and 30 coaches in the Institute of Sport. Our observation was that the Institute of Sport, being located in Canberra, has a certain air of unreality to some of the athletes and to some of us who had a look at the Institute. The Committee was encouraged to see some of the decentralised policies. The swimmers had moved to Queensland and the cyclists to Adelaide to enjoy better climatic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the training schedules of two athletes. This really demonstrates the concern that the Committee had for support to elite athletes undertaking very high performances. Gold medal winner Duncan Armstrong has received considerable publicity. I draw the attention of the House to his personal schedule over six days per week. Duncan Armstrong rises at 4 a.m., has swimming training and gym work from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. He has breakfast and rests from 8 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. He has road work and gym work from 9.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and a mid-morning meal from 11.30 a.m. to 12 noon. He sleeps from 12 noon until 2 p.m. He has lunch and then begins swimming training at 3.15 p.m. until 6.30 p.m. He conducts the rest of his life in the remaining hours. That schedule clearly indicates the pressure that one of our gold medallists is under in undertaking his training program while looking at other possibilities for work or study. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the cyclists' program in Adelaide we will see that on day one they cycle 250 kilometres. On day two they have the following possibilities: half an hour of stretching; 120 kilometres of cycling in the morning; in the afternoon a track session, weightlifting and ergometer training; and a bit of a ride in the evening to finish off. This happens six days a week. The athletes in that training camp range from 18 to 23 years of age. That very clearly indicates the sorts of pressures that the athletes are under and why we are keen to give them some sort of support. </PARA>
<PARA> The final couple of comments I wish to make concern coaches. The Committee was concerned about the problem of who selects the coaches, how much we pay them, and what sort of criteria we apply when selecting them. The evidence brought to the Committee showed that there was a problem in selecting world-class coaches. There was the question of the sort of money they could demand at an international level. Likewise, the Committee was concerned that there remained the kitchen mentality to the administration of sport in Australia. The recom- mendation, which I support, is that a sports marketing organisation be set up to assist and lead sports administrators. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the facilities. I support the recommendation that first-class facilities should have regard to the end use and to utilisation by the public. I end my comments by quoting the final paragraph of the report, which I think sums up our position. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> This report has suggested both increased accountability and funding for Australian support, in the expectation that those athletes who carry the Australian flag and the hopes of the Australian people into international competition do so in the expectation that their contribution will be recognised by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>I add my own comment: `and athletes can have a life after sport'. I thank Mr Bergin and members of his staff for their great contribution in providing this report. The Committee's considerations began in November and the report is tabled in this Parliament today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is worth saying that sport is not the most important issue, by any stretch of the imagination, that we discuss in this Parliament, but it is a quality of life issue, and any government would be tardy in its duty if it did not consider it. The issues of income support, housing, health and education are those that come before the Parliament, but we should not underestimate the contribution that sport makes to our economy. That has been mentioned by other speakers, and it is something we took into consideration in this report. A technical report of the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories suggests that between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of gross domestic product evolves from expenditure on sport and recreation. It is a very significant industry and it plays a very important part in our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) made some suggestions as to its impact on the health of the nation. It is very clear that it plays a very important part in promoting Australia overseas. More important than that is the view that the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration took-that we in this country need to say that we need an environment in which those who wish to pursue excellence in sport are able to do so. Just as there are in our community people who wish to be excellent at mathematics, the arts, or any other area of activity, we need to provide opportunities for those who have excellence or ability in sport to pursue their chosen role. I say, in a philosophical way, I suppose, that in an increasingly complex world in which we are divided by many things-by geography, by language, by religion, by culture and by politics-sport is something that speaks a universal language; it is a universal communicator. We can all appreciate the power and the strength of a United States sprinter at the Olympic Games. We can all appreciate the skill and grace of a gymnast from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In the same way, we can appreciate the endurance and determination of a distance runner from Kenya. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is another issue. Sport brings into the homes of people throughout the world an appreciation of success, or perhaps disappointment, and a feeling of empathy with those who are performing in sport. The very nature of our human condition is one which is reflected in the emotions of those who watch such events. The honourable member for Corangamite said very rightly that all we see is Duncan Armstrong swimming up and down the pool. What we do not see, and what the public does not appreciate, is all the time and effort that goes into such an outstanding performance and success at the Olympic Games. We came to the conclusion that the Commonwealth must have a fundamental responsibility of providing assistance to those who represent Australia overseas. Many of those who represent Australia in a professional sense are well catered for by the private sector but there are many in the development area and in particular sports who do not have that sort of assistance who are worthy and needing of assistance from the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Probably the showpiece of Australian elite sport over the last eight or 10 years has been the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). The concept was something which came to fruition under the Fraser Government and which was to the eternal credit of that Government. It is something that over time has evolved and changed. It would be fair to say that the considered view of the Committee is that it has not evolved and changed quickly enough. More than anything else it does not take into account the extreme distances and geography of Australia in the way in which it has been structured. There is also a belief-and this is the considered view of the Committee-that the balance between the elite performance area and the developmental area in the development of the AIS has been one that has fallen out of kilter in some sports. Each sport has its own needs and criteria. It is the hope of this Committee that this report will be a catalyst for producing a more flexible, efficient, accountable and performance oriented AIS. A number of models have been suggested within the recommendations of the report which could bring this about. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the prime considerations of those involved in this report was that athletes should come first when we consider the funding of elite and high performance sport in this country. In many areas there were suggestions that the convenience of administrators or coaches had been the first priority. It is important for us to consider that, when we structure an infrastructure for sport in this country, it is necessary that the athlete-first ethos must prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> We should consider one very important aspect for athletes. Increasingly it has become the case, as the honourable member for Corangamite mentioned, that it is impossible to pursue a career, further one's education or have job prospects while training at the level at which these people train. It is important for us to provide incentives for industry and the Government and income support for these people. The incentives for industry to employ people and the incentive and flexibility within the education system will give them an opportunity to pursue a worthwhile career and give them a future after their time in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> Very often it was put, and accepted by the Committee, that the AIS had provided an excuse for athletes to not study or not pursue a worthwhile career during their time with the AIS. I believe that it is important that in the future we try to change this balance. I am very well aware of the fact that people within the Australian Institute of Sport are alerted to this problem. It is necessary for us to provide opportunities within industry. It is also necessary for us to provide within our education system much more flexibility. We will not necessarily follow the path that has been taken by the Eastern Bloc or by the United States of America in respect of their scholarship schemes for colleges. But it is necessary for us to provide a system which is flexible and one which works for athletes who are in their training phase. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other matters which have been taken up by the report but in the 10 minutes available to me it is not possible to cover them all. We make a recommendation on the Aussie Sports program, which is a very good program that has worked well. The program is a fundamental part of talent development in Australia and it needs our support. There is a recommendation in respect of primary schools and the availability of facilities for the teaching of the basics to our children in those schools. This was brought to our attention by many of the coaches we spoke to, and it clearly is deserving of consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> There was discussion in many places throughout the country about the facilities available in Australia. It was interesting to note that many of the athletes suggested that, rather than it being a matter of priorities for facilities, there is a need for better coaching, better programs and athlete assistance. It was brought to the attention of the Committee that when we plan and build international facilities we need to know that there will be some sort of ongoing future for them. We saw throughout the country white elephants such as the Perry Lakes stadium in Western Australia, the Bruce stadium in Canberra, which is now being altered, and a cycling track in Brisbane which is used maybe half a dozen times a year. Sporting associations and national sporting bodies came under some criticism from athletes and coaches. Discussion took place on administration and marketing skills and the amount of liaison that occurs. Again, the athletes first philosophy that I have talked about needs to be given priority within those administrations. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is very much in sport in Australia that is good. Our performance in Seoul showed us to be more successful in more sports than ever before. We were in the top four in the world in more sports than at any time in Olympic history. So we have made progress. We have increased the number of sports in which we are internationally competitive, and we are being successful at the highest level in a number of those. But we need to realise that we can get much better. Our programs can be leaner, more efficient and more accountable. More than anything else we need to consider our athletes first. We need to consider their performance and their future. If we set up a structure which makes this the prime goal, we will be setting up the right structure. I say in conclusion that the work of Phil Bergin and all of those on the Committee was outstanding. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House supports the introduction of democracy to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>In two days the people of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) will be voting in the first election for the Legislative Assembly. This is an event of major importance in the development of the Territory for it marks the movement from political dependence to responsible government. Provided a government is formed after the election on Saturday, the ACT will become a representative democracy. Since being declared the national capital, Canberra has been under the shadow of democracy but without the reality of it. Being the seat of government, Canberra has been the second home of parliamentarians from all over the country. They have taken responsibility for Canberra but only rarely have they been directly accountable to the people of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Canberra residents do not understand the reality of the way we are governed. At present final responsibility for most ACT policies and programs is held by one man, the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding). He is elected by the voters of Melbourne Ports. He is an effective Minister who listens both to his officials and to community representatives before making decisions, but he is directly accountable for what he does to his ministerial colleagues and to the voters of his electorate rather than to the people of Canberra. Three representatives of the ACT-Senator Bob McMullan, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mrs Kelly) and I-are colleagues of the Minister. He discusses important issues with us and normally takes note of our advice. So, there are indirect channels for democratic influence in the ACT but the Minister has final legal authority for decisions-and he is neither elected nor selected by ACT residents or their representatives. He is, in a sense, a benevolent dictator appointed from outside and largely accountable to people outside the Territory. He is also one man. Therefore, many of the policies and programs for the ACT are never considered by him. They are prepared and implemented by his public servants. If these policies or programs become controversial, he will hear about them and make decisions. Otherwise, they will be managed in relatively unaccountable ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT Administration is assessed from time to time by the Auditor-General's Office. Its programs are scrutinised by the Department of Finance, but that scrutiny is incomplete and mostly unpublicised. The public servants are generally both efficient and sensitive to public opinion; but they are not required to do what the majority of ACT residents want, even if they could work out what the majority wanted them to do. Community opinion is difficult to discern. Their responsibilities turn senior officers of the ACT Administration into unelected quasi-politicians. They apply their own values and philosophies to the difficult task of sifting conflicting views and setting priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> This paternalistic system of government has led to the building of a fine city. Canberra is a beautiful and largely generously serviced city. The built environment mostly enhances the natural environment and extensive parks have been preserved or established to reflect the natural qualities of the region. That is why some people would like the current system of government to be preserved. But Australia is a democracy and we do not have democracy here in anything approaching the full sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Democracy means, literally, rule by the people. There are three important aspects of a democracy. First, it is a form of government in which the citizens exercise the right to make political decisions through representatives chosen by and responsible to them. Clearly, that central expression of democracy has not existed in the ACT until now. Secondly, a democracy is a form of government in which the powers of the majority are exercised within a framework of constitutional restraints designed to guarantee all citizens the enjoyment of certain individual or collective rights such as freedom of speech and religion-a liberal or constitutional democracy. Democracy in this second sense has existed in Canberra through the constitutional rights and traditions of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a third sense also. A democracy requires systematic policies aimed at minimising social and economic differences, especially those arising from the unequal distribution of private property. This is the sense of term implied by Abraham Lincoln when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy. </PARA>
<PARA>The ACT has been a democracy in this sense too, though many people are concerned that the powerful influence of property developers on the ACT Administration has not been adequately counterbalanced by concern for residents or the environment. If so much construction had not been allowed in the civic centre, there would not have been a justification for building the car parks on City Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> On Saturday the ACT will become a democracy in the fullest sense. As well as being a liberal democracy and a social and economic democracy, we will become a representative democracy. This is a step in the best traditions of Australia-a step which is required by the commitment of Australians to a democratic system of government. There was an extraordinary anomaly that the ACT was the only part of any Western country in which such a democracy did not exist. Those people who are standing for election will have the opportunity of making that representative government fully effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the principal reasons for the introduction of self-government to the ACT, there has been a disappointing amount of opposition and misunderstanding. I want to comment briefly on four of the reasons for opposition or misunderstanding. Firstly, some people argue that self-government in the ACT was imposed undemocratically. I think the answer to that is that parliamentarians are elected to lead as well as to follow. We are charged with ensuring that the principles embodied in the Australian political system are embodied in the systems of government of every part of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that there was a referendum about a decade ago, the results of which reflected opposition to self-government, but the questions in that referendum were confusing and there was no information about the implications of the questions that were being presented. Nevertheless, it was an important expression of opinion and has to be taken seriously. But in a democracy do people have the right to refuse to govern themselves, to refuse to take the responsibility for their own affairs? I do not think so. Self-government for the ACT is like growing up. When we become adults we are expected to take responsibility for ourselves unless we are intellectually handicapped. Adulthood includes the responsibility for voting and for paying taxes so as to contribute to the cost of the community services we receive. </PARA>
<PARA> If a referendum about self-government in the ACT had been taken throughout Australia it would probably have passed. I think most people in the ACT want democracy. I do not think that they understand the extent to which we do not have it now, but they want it, and most of the opposition to self-government comes more generally for other reasons, such as the alleged increase in costs, which I will come to in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I do that I want to deal with the issue of whether people elected to the Legislative Assembly on Saturday could reverse the situation and return to the situation that we have now, that is, the situation before self-government. The Labor Party has received a legal opinion which says that that would be quite impossible. Clearly it would be impossible. This House has voted unanimously in favour of self-government for the ACT; it is not about to reverse its opinion. But, quite apart from the powers of the House, it is quite clear that the Legislative Assembly has been given power by this House to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory. A statute purporting to terminate the existence of the Legislative Assembly, which is what some of the people opposed to self-government say they would try to enact, could not fall within these purposes but would rather serve the opposite objective. There is a whole series of other reasons that Mr Shand, QC, has given why it would be impossible for people elected on Saturday to reverse the situation and restore the undemocratic system we have now. </PARA>
<PARA> A second reason for the opposition of some people is that the electoral system proposed is undemocratic. It is quite true that many of us would have preferred to have single-member constituencies in the ACT. I certainly believe that that would have been a better system of government because it would allow people to identify who their member was and to vote for a particular person or vote against him or her if they wished. </PARA>
<PARA> The system that we have is the result of a compromise between the parties represented in this House and the Senate. The d'Hondt system is widely used in Western Europe. It is a thoroughly democratic system in that it ensures a fair representation of the parties that stand for election. The fact is that that system is making it possible for many people to stand for election. The reason we have got so many parties running is just that it is a very democratic electoral system, and the fact that there are so many candidates, 117, and so many parties demonstrates that the system itself is encouraging people--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope they will wake up beforehand. I think that the d'Hondt system is a very fair system because it ensures that parties will be elected in proportion to the vote they receive. The third and perhaps most important reason for scepticism about self-government is the allegation that it will cost more. I do not think that is a realistic fear. It is quite clear that all parties in Australia are going through a period when expenditure is being cut back. The ACT is not going to be exempted from that. The question is: how can we maximise the resources that we receive from the Federal Government? We will do that more effectively by having our own representatives in negotiation with the Commonwealth than we will if we depend on public servants in negotiation with Department of Finance officials.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another is that, under self-government, taxes will rise more than would otherwise occur. That is extremely unlikely because the whole point of a democratic system is that the party in government can be thrown out at the next election if it becomes unpopular, if it adopts policies which most people do not like. The last thing the first government of the ACT is going to do is increase taxes in a way that it knows will be electorally unpopular. There is far more danger of electorally unpopular taxes being imposed by a Commonwealth Government which is not going to suffer directly than there is if we have an ACT government which is directly accountable to the people and which would have to try to justify those taxes to the people it represented. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that under self-government we will have a less costly system of government than we would without self-government. We will also have a government that is directly accountable to the community for the pattern of expenditure which occurs. That is perhaps the most important reason for self-government after the principal reasons about democracy because at present the priorities in the Budget are set by a Minister and by officials who are not directly accountable to the people of the ACT. When we have our own representatives making those decisions, then the priorities of the majority will be represented in the Budget effectively, and that will undoubtedly lead to some changes in the pattern of expenditure in ways that people want. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth complaint that some people have is that there will be too many politicians. That is simply not realistic either. It is true that after self-government there will be 17 more, but there will be fewer per head than in any other part of Australia if we include both State and local governments. Even excluding local governments, there will be fewer parliamentarians per head in the ACT than in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania or Queensland. Thus in any sense the proposal is a modest one. It is also a new system of government for the ACT, a regional government rather than a government that involves both State and local governments. Therefore we are reducing by one the number of layers of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Support for this motion is bipartisan. All parties in this House support the motion. This expresses the strength of Parliament's commitment to democracy. It also demonstrates clearly the strength of support within Parliament for self-government in the ACT. This commitment is principled. The House will not change its view. I hope that the voters of the ACT will use the opportunity available to them responsibly and that they will vote for the party or individuals which they believe will represent them most effectively in the Legislative Assembly. That Assembly will have all the powers of local government and most of those of State governments. Its members will therefore have great responsibilities. We ACT voters have an opportunity denied us until now. Let us use that opportunity effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the opportunity to second the motion today. As mentioned by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), the support for the motion is bipartisan. It is clear that it is bipartisan because the legislation that established self-government for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was passed in this chamber and passed in the Senate. If there had not been that level of support it would not have passed and the people in the ACT would not be voting this weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of very good reasons why the people of the Australian Capital Territory ought to be enthusiastically embracing this opportunity, and I want to outline some of those reasons in this debate today. The first reason is self-interest. One of the aspects of life here in the Australian capital that I and people around Australia have found of concern is the extent to which people in Canberra have felt isolated from the rest of Australia and concerned at the attitude of other Australians to them. When I, as shadow Minister for the Australian Capital Territory, had the opportunity of meeting many people here in the Territory on a frequent and regular basis, the number of occasions on which people spoke of the hostility they felt as Canberrans when they visited placed like Sydney and Melbourne never ceased to amaze me. They asked me this question: `Why do they feel so hostile to us? Why do they feel that we are living in a different environment, that we are sort of sponging off the rest of Australia? How are these attitudes going to change?'. A significant factor that will bring about change is people in Canberra having to take decisions for their own well-being, their own welfare, determining their own levels of taxation and being seen to be making decisions on the same basis as other Australians have to make decisions through their own representatives in their own communities or in their own States. </PARA>
<PARA> To get some picture of it, one had only to listen to the radio program AM today to hear the Premier of Western Australia speaking about loan funds for the State. I thought it was fascinating to listen to him. He spoke about the ivory tower attitude of Canberra bureaucrats. He spoke about the rarefied atmosphere in which the decisions for Australia are made in Canberra. That was fine for the audience he had in Western Australia, but I think the people in Canberra ought to be asking: `What is it about the place in which we live and the way in which decisions are made for us that brings about this attitude to Canberra?'. I put it to the House that a significant factor is that the people who live and have their homes in Canberra are not seen to be responsible for the city and community of which they are a part in the same way as other Australians are responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to deal with is the financial implications. Senator Walsh-not always a Minister with whom I agree-made some interesting observations this week which were reported in the Canberra Times on Wednesday. I think they are worth thinking about for a little while. I understand that one of the significant factors that are determining the attitude of some Canberrans to this matter is that they want to go on living in an environment in which they continue to be supported to a greater extent than other Australians appear to be supported by the Federal Government, because the Federal Government has responsibility for providing the facilities and services for them in the community. There is an expectation that things will go on unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Walsh was really saying was, `Look, the Parliament has been advised by the Grants Commission of the extent to which Canberra generally has benefited to a greater extent than other parts of Australia from funds from the central level. The Grants Commission has now quantified that and the Government has that information available to it'. There seems to be an expectation that, if there were no self-government, things would go on as before. I would have to say that, regardless of whether Canberra had self-government or not, things would not go on as they did before. The Commonwealth was looking for ways and means of making savings in its own expenditure, and it has been shifting that responsibility for paying for the services for Canberrans to ratepayers, to taxpayers, and to the services that Canberra has provided for on a user-pays basis. Senator Walsh made it very clear:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the process of putting the ACT on the same footing in regard to federal funding would be going ahead with or without self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> I don't particularly care about self-government or not for the ACT -</PARA>
<PARA>I might say that I do not share his view in relation to that-</PARA>
<PARA> But I think we all have a duty to disabuse people of the notion that by rejecting self-government they could escape from having the same financial regime applied in the ACT as that applied to the States,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the fact-that the financial arrangements for the ACT will be the same as the financial arrangements for the states, with or without self-government. I believe that any group that sets out to misinform the public is doing it a disservice, and to the extent that some of these groups are telling people in the ACT that people can escape from the fiscal discipline that applies in the states, it is misinforming them. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think it could be made any clearer,</PARA>
<PARA> I do ask, because there seems to be some doubt in the Australian Capital Territory, that the Government make it clear that this is the Australian capital and that there are parts of this capital for which it is unreasonable to ask the people of Canberra to pay when they are part of the national function. It needs to be made very clear that the Commonwealth will continue to accept its responsibility for properly servicing and maintaining, and not seeking cross-subsidisation from the people of Canberra for, those national capital functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I want to talk about is some comments by Andrew Fraser in that same article in the Canberra Times that suggested there had not been any support from Federal Liberal parliamentarians for their ACT party colleagues. I want to make it very clear that, while I believe the ultimate result should be in the hands of the people-I think the people in the Australian Capital Territory ought to be supporting Liberals-we have let the Australian national capital Liberals fight their own fight. We have not sought to manage it for them. We have not sought to pull the strings for them. Of course they have our fulsome support, and to suggest that they do not is quite wrong. I point to one matter in relation to the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, absolutely, Minister, fulsome support. When we came to the consideration of the future merger of those two major institutions, about which there is concern in Canberra, we were not afraid to express our view, and it has been expressed in a timely fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final matter I want to deal with is the question of democracy generally. I do not think that one can opt out of democracy. If one takes the opportunity of reading the writings of major political philosophers, one will see that if there is going to be effective democracy-and I am talking about democracy not just for the Australian Capital Territory but for Australia-there have to be areas of decision making relevant to the people whom those decisions are going to affect. The argument of noted French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville was that local centres of authority were being undermined by the growth of state central power. He said that pluralism in a democracy disappeared when one had a situation in which bureaucratisation of society and increasing nationalism were seen as being able to grow and take hold as against local decision making. He argued that with the emergence of central power there was a real risk that it would become so strong that no one group would be able to oppose it. He argued that local government-and that is what he called it-and voluntary associations are required to compete with state central power. </PARA>
<PARA> Max Weber, another political philosopher, argued that the rule of law was threatened by the loss of control over the administrative implementation of law which results from the rise of bureaucracy at the expense of the power of local officials. He saw the emergence of a superstate, in which all power was at the centre, through the rise of a malleable, centrally controlled bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another philosopher, Lipset, said that the effective running of a democracy means that, of course, periodic awarding of authority to one particular group or another must take place. In other words, for it to function effectively, one needs a high level of education, an effective system of choice and situations in which that choice can be availed of. He argued that dictatorships survive through ignorance of the masses and that urbanisation, literacy, freedom of media and high rates of political participation are all evidence of a society in which democracy is flourishing and surviving. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Keith Graham said that to make a judgment as to whether democracy is functioning effectively in a country, one must look at participation in, and influence of, entities that are smaller than the whole society. He is essentially talking about decision making at a local government level. What he called the participation theory-democracy-depends upon participation in the political process by the people. It stands somewhere between the total exclusion of people from any influence-totalitarianism-and the involvement of people in every decision. As the honourable member said, democracy, translated from its Greek origin, means `government of the people'. Obviously, not everybody can be involved in running the country, but the more and diversified the political representation of the people, the easier it is for democracy to survive. In other words, in order to have effective democratic institutions in Australia, one needs effective democratic institutions in the Australian Capital Territory as well. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very good reasons, in the national interest and in the interests of Australia why people should recognise that democracy is important and participation is important. I certainly hope that in the Australian Capital Territory next weekend people will make wise judgments. This is not a debate about who they ought to vote for. I recognise that 117 candidates are standing for 17 seats. While that is probably frustrating for the average voter-when one looks at the size of the ballot paper, one will see that voters will have to show that they have been well educated to be able to participate-the fact that so many people are participating is a healthy sign. I think it shows that democracy will work effectively in the Australian Capital Territory. Even though my Party and the Australian Labor Party will find it uncomfortable if we do not secure a majority of votes, if that is the result of the development of the democratic institution in the Australian Capital Territory, so be it. I encourage people to vote for those who are committed to making the system work rather that those who want to ensure that it is sabotaged in its infancy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had the opportunity of holding the position that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) referred to, that of being the sole political arbiter of the decisions that affect a quarter of a million people who live in Canberra. It is not a position which I believe should, or could, continue to exist in a democracy. I introduced the first legislation for self-government into this Parliament. I suggest, as the honourable member for Fraser suggested, that direct representation, as occurs in all other Australian parliaments, would have been the most satisfactory form for electing a government. It is not the form which is to be used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, a misconception is being promoted, probably by people who do not want to see, rather than those who cannot see. I cannot believe that the residents of this city are so uninformed and unintelligent that they believe that they can remain in the womb indefinitely. Some people are advocating that the city remain a totally enclosed dependant of the national Parliament and that, forever, it can partake of that protection and use such of the resources of the Federal Parliament as it desires; it cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh's statement is absolutely correct. Several years ago the Federal Government set out to bring Canberra's financial relationships and expenditures into line with those practised by the States. The Grants Commission was asked to report, and did so. A progressive series of changes to the financial arrangements and taxes in Canberra were set in place in order to recover from the citizens of Canberra those taxes that people living in cities and states would have had to pay. Canberra now has a Budget which is presented separately to this Parliament. It has an expenditure and a revenue column. Within the framework of Commonwealth assistance to the States, the Australian Capital Territory has to live within that Budget. Canberra suffers from a lack of respect from people outside the ACT, because most people who come to this city hear local news programs and small groups demanding more and more of the national cake. They are asking for more, but not receiving any more. They have to justify their requests in the same way as every one else. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the election on Saturday, I think that the most important single factor is for the people of Canberra to recognise that who they vote for will determine whether their hospitals are run efficiently or at all and whether their children will get proper treatment if they are sick. They will be electing the decision makers. It is not some gimmick or slogan. It is not an election-this is what all previous elections in Canberra have been for-for an advisory council. It is an election to choose people to run this city; to determine what proportion of the revenues of the city will be spent on health, education and transport; to determine how those revenues will be raised and who will pay them; to determine what welfare services of a State or municipal nature will be provided in Canberra. That is what the election is all about. If people are stupid enough to believe that the Federal Cabinet will revert to a situation which occurred a few years ago, when an hour was spent deciding whether Canberra bus fares should increase by 3 cents, or two years ago, when the Federal Cabinet spent over an hour arguing about how many teachers should be allocated to Canberra schools, I think they are deluding themselves almost to the stage of insanity. </PARA>
<PARA> Canberra is, like any other area in a democracy, about to take responsibility for the decisions it makes on its behalf and to pay for those decisions from the taxes that are already paid, or variations thereof. If the voters do not get it right on Saturday, if they elect people who do not have the experience, the capacity or the will to govern, who have not considered the responsibilities of government, they will pay a very high price, because there is no going back. Canberra, like all other areas of Australia, will be a responsible, democratic society, answerable to itself for its own actions. The citizens of Canberra have to choose how they will vote and who they will vote for. Obviously, I suggest that they vote for the Labor team, but other speakers would disagree. </PARA>
<PARA> If citizens wish to continue to live in a city which has appropriate facilities, which has in the past been provided with the stability that it is entitled to, they must vote for candidates or political parties who can, and will, govern. It is the height of stupidity to suggest that someone, some time in the future in Canberra, can persuade the Assembly to pass a resolution to abolish an Act of the Federal Parliament. It cannot be done and it will not be done, and no political party in Australia will take back to this Parliament the responsibilities that are those of the people of Canberra. I ask that everyone in Canberra accept that they have an obligation to themselves and to their fellow residents of the Australian Capital Territory to exercise their vote properly, responsibly and on the basis that they will live with the decision they make on Saturday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity of supporting the motion that this House supports the introduction of democracy to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). I commend the three previous speakers for the contributions they have made. They have all made excellent contributions which the people of Canberra would be wise to listen to. I must disagree slightly with my friend the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who said that the large number of candidates was a healthy sign that democracy is alive and well. Certainly that is true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the great things about democracy is that any man or woman has the opportunity to stand for public office, but I have a feeling that already democracy in the Australian Capital Territory has been trivialised by the gaggle of parties which are confusing a very important issue. There is the Surprise Party, but that has shot through already. Then we have the Party! Party! Party!, the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato party and three separate Australian Democrats parties, because they could not agree among themselves. As we all know, that is normal. There are three anti-self-government parties. How crazy is that? We have 117 candidates for 17 positions and a ballot paper a metre long. I believe both of those facts have already made the Guinness Book of Records. The Australian Capital Territory election should not be recorded in the Guinness Book of Records just for the number of candidates or for the length of the ballot paper; it should be there for democratic absurdity. At the end of the day democracy will win. Democracy will reign but, equally, I think it is fair to say that confusion will reign supreme on the actual day. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), I cannot understand the absurdity of the anti-self-government parties. They are totally out of touch with reality. There is no way that this Parliament is going to go back to the old days, good or bad-it depends how we see them-so they are a total irrelevance. The members of those parties, in exercising their democratic right, are just confusing the issue and will achieve nothing. Many of them, in taking advantage of the democratic system, as they are, may well be on a little ego trip and will probably drift back into obscurity after next Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who are making ridiculous promises are also totally out of touch with reality. I have not been following the election campaign in great detail, but I believe there are those who say that there should be no more parking tickets and others who say that people should be able to buy one bus ticket and ride free for the rest of the day. These things have to be paid for. They do not come about through a cargo cult. I suppose we could excuse some people in the ACT and Canberra itself for having a cargo cult mentality, because over the years successive governments of all parties have been more than generous in setting up Canberra to be Australia's premier city. It is a city of great beauty. If Australia may not any longer be the lucky country, certainly Canberra is still the lucky city. The people who live in Canberra are very fortunate indeed. If they do not recognise that, they demonstrate the truth of what the honourable member for Dundas alluded to this morning-the comments of Mr Dowding, the Premier of Western Australia-that they are in an ivory tower and are out of touch with the reality of the rest of urban and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is already recognised that the new ACT Government will need to raise $80m. If all the promises which have been floating around were to be realised, the ACT Government would probably have to find hundreds of millions of dollars. It is just not going to be possible. The people who live in the ACT are Australians, the same as the people in the rest of Australia, and they will realise, once the hoo-ha of the nonsense parties disappears, that democracy involves obligations as well as rights. If I lived here I would be delighted that there is to be an election next Saturday, because as a citizen of Australia it would gall me to live in Canberra and not have the opportunity of participating in the normal democratic function of directing and living my life. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been surprised at some of the television advertisements. I see them only in the morning as I am scurrying through my coffee and getting dressed. Promises are being made about better education and better this and that. The people of Canberra must realise that they are so well off compared with many other parts of Australia. I am constantly told by people that they have moved to Canberra from Queanbeyan, Yass or somewhere else purely because of the advantages here for their children. I have yet to meet any person in Canberra who will not tell me with pride about the educational standards, the sporting facilities and all the rest of the things that are there for their children. Canberra has an unemployment rate of only 5.8 per cent, compared with the rate in my electorate of Cowper on the north coast, which ranges from 19 per cent to 25 per cent. A lot of it is imported because of the climate, but Canberra is less fortunate there. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that for me the ideal democracy is one where there is the least government possible, there is the least taxation, the expenditure of government is as little as possible, and there is the least interference in individual lives and the least intrusion into people's private affairs. I urge the people of Canberra who are voting next Saturday to vote for serious candidates. I certainly hope that for my side of politics but also for the other side. The important thing is to vote for a serious candidate and not to waste one's sample of democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Gippsland interjects, it is abysmal. It is certainly time that the spotlight was put on our long term energy needs. It is my view that the Ministers responsible, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) have put energy on the backburner. An Australia which seeks sustainable development requires a continuum of growth that is dependent upon energy being available and being able to satisfy today's needs and to ensure that growth and development can be sustained for tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why, then, are we in this predicament? The strength of overall commodity prices has deflected any serious debate about Australia's impending oil import bills and the capacity of other sectors of the economy to cover the costs of those imports. Nothing could better illustrate the impact that these import bills will have on our balance of payments than the recent headlines, such as, `Refinery strike had disastrous results', `$286m rise in import bill boosted by strike' and `Falling oil output blow to trade deficit'. The Government has called its Energy 2000 publication a national energy policy paper. It is a reasonable paper but it has gaps. It ignores some fundamental issues. It pats itself on the back for what is being done and leaves us little the wiser about the future. That is something that all of us in this place ought to be concerned about. Energy 2000 forecasts that Australia's future net energy exports will be crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), coal, uranium and liquefied natural gas (LNG). These include a net crude oil import bill rising from $193m in 1986-87 to between $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion in 1994-95, and up to $5.2 billion and $6.6 billion in the 11 years up to 1999-2000. That is what it will cost Australians to bring the oil that we will need to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, claims that his current energy policies are adequate and concentrates on what he says will be a positive trade balance of some $60 billion in the 11-year period of 1989 to 2000. When he tabled Energy 2000 he told the Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> These exports will more than offset any projected crude oil imports over this period. We will clearly be able to finance our oil imports. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook declined to highlight, however, the fact that our energy trade balance is a declining one. In 1986-87 our net energy exports were worth $5.85 billion. By 1999-2000 they are expected to be between $5.5 billion and $3 billion-quite a drop, especially if the $3 billion figure is realised. Much in Energy 2000 is predicated on stable, reasonably priced international oil supplies. That may well be folly. The favourable energy balance Senator Cook is relying on pivots on strong commodity prices for coal, LNG and uranium, and no adverse terms of trade. In my view that policy and that direction are both risky and, at worst, extremely complacent and could leave Australia extremely vulnerable. Significant pressure will be placed, too, on other sectors of the economy, especially to address an ever-worsening of Australia's balance of payments deficit which is now apparent to every person in this place. How will those other sectors respond?</PARA>
<PARA> Energy 2000 makes no analysis of many of the issues that need to be considered, certainly in the macroeconomic areas such as balance of payments, inflation, government revenue, gross national product, employment and standards of living, notably interest rates. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has only recently undertaken a study about these macroeconomic effects. We still have no data prepared. There are other issues that are not considered: international oil markets and future world price trends; the impact on the search for and production of energy resources of the greenhouse effect and acid rain on environmental politics; and the domestic problems of multiple land use. Multiple land use is being addressed by the Government through the resources assessment commission, of which no-one knows anything. To date it has been only an announcement. Much more needs to be said to the community about that proposal. There are further points: there is the possibility that large scale production of petrol and diesel from natural gas may break crude oil's monopoly supply of transport fuel; energy conservation in the face of increasing fuel use in vehicles; the cost to the economy of maintaining the existing uranium policy towards the end of the century; and the appropriateness of the present level of direction of energy research. All of these issues did not receive the detailed analysis that they ought to have done in a document such as Energy 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> Any crude oil price increases above the modest levels assumed in Energy 2000 would obviously worsen Australia's energy trade balance, even in the event that the price of other energy exports would also rise. Indeed, it is worth pointing out that the significance to government revenue of the excise on crude oil and LPG has contributed enormously in the past. As a percentage of total taxation revenue, it peaked in 1981 at 9.3 per cent at over $3 billion. This financial year it is expected to raise only 1.6 per cent or $1.3 billion. Low world crude oil prices are bad news for government revenues as every $1 a barrel fall translates to about $70m lost in government revenue annually. The 1986 crash saw government revenue almost halve in one year. </PARA>
<PARA> Of greater significance to government revenue is the run-down in Australian oil reserves. With declining self-sufficiency, crude oil revenue will almost disappear in the 1990s. As a result of the crude oil price crash of 1986, the Government switched its revenue base to petroleum products, with a doubling of excise to 20c a litre. As every motorist will know, it is now 22.3c a litre. This financial year the petroleum products excise is expected to rake in over $5 billion or 6 per cent of total Government taxation revenue. We are therefore, extremely reliant on this as a source of revenue for the Government. The crude oil market is volatile. The market for products, by contrast, is fairly stable. A one cent a litre rise in products raises about $235m in a full year. This also has an inflationary impact, as a one cent a litre rise adds one-quarter of a percentage point to the consumer price index and excise is automatically indexed in February and August each year. For the Australian consumer there are no benefits in falling crude oil prices, as would now be apparent to all of us, as they are clawed back via an increase in excise on products. It is a classic case of giving with one hand and taking back with the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking back to the 1988-89 Budget, it is significant that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made no specific mention of the oil and gas industry in that Budget. He did not address the implications of falling crude oil revenues and rapidly escalating import bills. That was a missed opportunity. The growing gap between oil demand and production and the volume of imports to meet this demand will significantly compound Australia's balance of payment problems but one would hardly get this impression when one looks back at that Budget. This year's Budget must address those issues as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> Energy 2000 provides no analysis of international oil markets and future trends. Of course, these are difficult to predict but one would have felt that in an overview of Australia's energy areas those issues would have been canvassed. If one looks at the demand for oil in Australia one can see that it is relatively fixed, as oil substitution and conservation measures set in train by the price hikes of the 1970s leave much less room to manoeuvre. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the issue of supply is extremely important to Australia. Australia produces about 200 million barrels a year. By the year 2000 that will be down to about 80 million barrels. The discovery of any large fields would narrow the gap between demand and production but, importantly, much hinges on the industry perception of the Government-imposed resource rent tax. As exploration companies cannot write off the cost of drilling in unsuccessful fields against the resource tax they will pay on successful wells, many are discouraged from taking the risk entailed in finding new oil off-shore. Instead, many are switching to more lucrative fields outside Australia. I have addressed this issue numerous times in this chamber. During the 1960s three billion barrels of oil were discovered in Australia; in the 1970s, 800 million barrels; in the 1980s, less than 350 million barrels were found. They are sobering figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Few now question our security of supply, but that too is complacent. There is no guarantee that we will physically obtain our oil requirements in the future. Although it is a mistake to assume that history will repeat itself, it might also be a mistake to assume that it will not. It is possible that, as some oil analysts suggest, the whole flat price of oil is an Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) exercise to increase demand, to lock in consumers to such an extent that price can be increased by withdrawal. Nor is it the whole of OPEC we have to worry about. Five countries-Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Republic-have the ability to adjust production by over 14 million barrels per day. They will be the power brokers.</PARA>
<PARA> The message is this: there are strategic, economic and political consequences of an eventual reliance on Middle East oil. They require urgent action rather than soothing pronouncements from Ministers of this Government. Energy 2000 does not deal with it and no-one in the Ministry has dealt with it. The contribution of fuel oil imports-about half the $260m increase-to January's disastrous trade deficit underlines the importance of oil to our economy. This result was the consequence of only a one month long strike at the Altona refinery. Had we to import this volume for the year it would have cost about $1.7 billion. That is a precursor of what is to come. That is why I say that this Government is being complacent. </PARA>
<PARA> Energy exports are also an area that we need to be looking at far more carefully. Energy 2000 makes no analysis of the effect on the exploration, production and export of energy resources, of land use conflicts and policies in Australia or of the worldwide problems of the greenhouse effect and acid rain. The conference on the changing atmosphere in Toronto in June 1988 called on industrialised nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent before the year 2005. Acceptance of such a proposal has major implications for Australia's energy exports. Assuming supply was secure and price was moderate, importing more oil would not be the economic threat proposed if we demonstrated our resilience by increasing the exports of our other abundant energy and mineral resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government estimates a favourable energy trade balance of $60 billion in the 11 years to 2000, including $15 billion from LNG and LPG, $30 billion from steaming coal, $40 billion from coking coal, and $9 billion from uranium. But how realistic is this? It would take a massive 75 per cent increase in other energy imports to pay for our projected imports and something in the vicinity of a 53 per cent increase in other energy and mineral resources. The question is posed: can Australian energy corporations maintain or increase their market share? Much hinges upon greater productivity, aggressive marketing and the development of new markets in face of stiff competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at each of those areas briefly. Firstly, coal: the composition of Australia's energy exports indicates the extreme importance of coal in our future energy trade balance. It comprises some 70 per cent of the value of our total energy export revenue. Coal produces 15 per cent of Australia's total export income and comprises 28 per cent of the world's trade in coal. Yet all is not bright. Coal is an industry which historically has been plagued by industrial disputes and rorts, in which improved work practices are merely offset by wage increases, and in which mine closures and takeovers by foreign companies are rife, suffering crippling rail freight charges, threatened by the high dollar and low export prices, hit by accumulated losses over the years, facing a world oversupply, and in competition with foreign countries with high levels of protection and support for those industries. We cannot ignore the possible implications of the greenhouse effect worldwide and the better-recognised effects of acid rain. Australia will benefit from the next crude oil price rise only if it can expand its coal output at prices which remain competitive against those of other major world exporters such as Canada, South Africa and Colombia. </PARA>
<PARA> Liquefied natural gas is perhaps our brightest prospect. The North West Shelf project comes on stream this year when it begins exporting. The important point is that it will not balance the cost of oil imports because it is contingent on a higher oil price. The original project was predicated on a $US28 a barrel price. That is now down to $US16. So the actual cash flow on that project is now not nearly as great as what was originally envisaged. LPG plays an important role in our domestic economy and its use in Australia has expanded rapidly. LPG is one of the most promising alternative liquid fuels in the short to medium term. How we encourage the substitution of automotive gasoline by LPG is a challenge for us all. Some domestic companies, notably the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria have taken some steps in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to uranium. Australia has 30 per cent of the world's low cost recovery resources, but supplies only about 10 per cent of the world's demand from the three mines authorised to export it under current Government policy-Nabarlek, Ranger and Olympic Dam. Thus Australia earned only $400m to Canada's $1.1 billion in 1985. This Government continues to put decisions relating to uranium into the too-hard basket. One is tempted to say that it must be an election year. We are missing out on great opportunities in the uranium area. </PARA>
<PARA> Other areas that require study and mention concern conservation and efficiency. All industrial market countries, including Australia, have improved energy efficiency since 1973. However, in Australia primary energy consumption has increased 20 per cent since 1979. By contrast, North America has decreased consumption by 2.5 per cent. Western Europe shows little net change, and Japan has increased consumption by a mere 2 per cent. Energy conservation and energy management have lost much of the early momentum following the oil crisis of the 1970s. That is an area we need to address with great urgency yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I am saying in this motion that the Government has been far too complacent, that Energy 2000 does not go far enough, and that we need a far more comprehensive national energy policy which takes into account a couple of key points: our increasing reliance on oil imports, our heavy reliance on coal exports, and global warming and other environmental issues. Australia needs to be resilient to changing patterns of energy production and consumption. Measures that need to be taken, in my view, now include a broadening of tax deductability on the oil exploration industry to encourage even more exploration, a reduction in the high marginal excise rates on old oil, a greater funding for research and development of alternative transport fuels and conversion technologies, a far more determined drive for energy efficiency-Australia, I think, is leading the world in its complacency in terms of improving its energy efficiency-and a far more realistic appraisal of uranium exports and nuclear energy. We cannot stop the clock. We must get to those issues this year, and we must address them urgently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government set up the National Consultative Council on Energy. It has met once and it is due to meet again. That is a step in the right direction, but that body is not in a position to sufficiently address these issues urgently. Energy 2000 was developed by the departments administered by the Ministers. In my view, we need to have a fully independent stocktake of Australia's energy position with some view as to what the options might be for the future and what policies ought to be pursued. I do not doubt that there are some people on the National Consultative Council who have the capability to assist in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to take the urgent step of establishing a specialist independent panel or group to undertake an immediate study-interestingly enough, this was done in Canada-into what Australia's current energy position is and what the likely effects will be of those very important issues that I have mentioned. To do otherwise is to tie Australia's hands behind its back as we enter the 1990s. We know that here, in the Pacific Rim, we have great opportunities for trade in the near future. We are in the fastest growing economic area in the world at least that is the projected view of the experts-over the next 11 to 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Energy underpins all of the success in trade. We can be the major player. We need to assess now the opportunities that are before us. We also need to determine the level of risks we are running. In my view, the Government has been far too complacent, the Treasurer has been far too complacent, and all of these issues need to be addressed urgently. To do otherwise is an abrogation of responsibility which this Government unfortunately is showing a continuing inclination to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many elements in the contribution made by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) on which there would not be any fundamental disagreement. We recognise that energy is a very important subject that often is neglected in debates in this House. Those of us who, either in this Parliament or before we came into the Parliament, have had something to do with some of the major forms of energy recognise, I am sure, the contribution it makes to our lifestyle. For that reason I particularly welcome the Energy 2000 document of 1988. We all agree, as that document states, that energy is fundamental not only to our standard of living but also to our lifestyle and to our economic prospects and overall performance in the immediate future and in the long term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Figures for 1987-88 indicate that the energy sector provided about one-fifth of our exports and about 7 per cent of our gross domestic product. So it is a very significant contributor to our overall economic well-being, particularly when we have to focus upon the current account problems that are currently before this country. It is significant that the Government certainly believes that the general energy policy that has been developed is appropriate in the current situation. That is not to suggest that we need to be complacent in any way. I believe, and I am sure the honourable member for Bass agrees, that a particular document such as Energy 2000, important as it is, focuses our attention on the problems and the future directions of energy policy, and should be considered not as a static document in isolation but as part of a dynamic process. In other words, it is not good enough simply to produce a piece of paper or a worthy document from time to time. We recognise that the situation will change. After all, the sorts of planning that concerned governments in Australia in the mid-1970s as far as energy prospects and energy policy were concerned were significantly different from the general directions that are being taken at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that competition, reinforced where necessary by Government initiatives, should be the major driving force that will determine Australia's energy production mix in the future. The Government's macro- and micro-economic policies are attacking the costs and facilitating the structural adjustment that is necessary so that our resources are efficiently allocated to exploit to the full our capacity in industries where we have a comparative economic advantage. That is a very significant statement. It is important that we make the most of our comparative economic advantage in the areas of many of our commodity exports. We certainly do have a great advantage in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made a number of important decisions with respect to energy, energy production and energy policy. We have deregulated the crude oil marketing arrangements. There have been significant crude oil excise concessions introduced. We have replaced the excise and royalty regimes with a resource rental tax for most new offshore projects. Significantly, in the area of taxation regime in the May economic statement of 1988 the corporate tax rate was reduced from 49 per cent to 39 per cent. If there is going to be something that will add incentive in terms of corporate action and corporate responsibility in the energy field that would appear to me to be a very significant step in the right direction. We have reduced costs through reductions in import tariffs and abolished the 2 per cent import duty. Foreign investment guidelines have been relaxed. We continue to release offshore exploration acreage regularly. </PARA>
<PARA> A very important area of energy that concerns me in my electorate is the coal industry. The Government last year announced a very significant long term strategy. It is true, as the honourable member for Bass has stated, that coal exports do make a very significant contribution to the export income of this country. Therefore, I welcome that particular strategy announced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). If we are going to safeguard our industry where there is now, and certainly likely to be into the future, fierce export competition in that area we have to make some long term changes. As the honourable member for Bass pointed out the coal industry has been an industry that has been fraught with industrial difficulties and all sorts of other problems. It has been an industry unfortunately where distrust has characterised a lot of the industrial relations. Hopefully, as a result of some of the changes that have been made through the Coal Industry Tribunal last year some of that may be behind us. I am not foolish enough to suggest that the road ahead is going to be a bed of roses; far from it, in an area that has been characterised with the problems in industrial relations we have seen in the coal industry for many years. However, I think it is a step in the right direction. At least if we have a strategy in place we are likely to make some sort of progress in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of our long term strategy we announced that there was an $8m package available for labour retraining and relocation. We recognise that there will be significant changes that will affect the lifestyles of many people who have over a number of generations been part of the coal industry, particularly in New South Wales. There was a $20m commitment that was matched by the New South Wales Government for rail freight reductions in New South Wales in 1988. That recognised the special problems that were facing the industry in New South Wales, particularly as far as the passage of freight from the inland areas to the seaboard was concerned. For example, in the district that I represent-the Lithgow-Mudgee-Ulan area-there is some very fine steaming coal but the essential characteristic of its location is the fact that it is some 160 to 200 kilometres from the seaboard. This does impose a lot of strains. At a time when there was a downturn in coal prices at that stage something had to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the other changes that have been made by the Government in other areas of energy. We recognise the implication of low world oil prices. The Commonwealth Government recently made a proposal to industry to reduce the top marginal excise rate on old oil produced in Bass Strait by linking the rate to market prices. Industry has not accepted this proposal and further discussions are taking place. I hope there will be a degree of goodwill and sensible negotiation on the part of all players in that area. It is important, given the potential for action by the Middle East countries in that area of immense political instability, that we are safeguarded from the problems that we could potentially face if there was a ganging up on the world by the Middle Eastern countries. The Government is confident that these adjustments will enable us to pay for the expected increase in oil imports. Recent trends in petroleum exploration activity are consistent with current economic conditions and are similar to those being experienced overseas. We are no different from any similar Western industrialised countries and the current economic conditions are obviously going to reflect the capacity of the industry to involve itself in exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important element in the energy scene that we will continue to rely upon is the technology improvements and achievements to maintain our efficiency and competitiveness in domestic and external sectors. Energy research and development is especially important for Australia notwithstanding a period of low energy prices. Simply because we do have a period of low energy we should not lose sight of the need for ongoing research and development. As a government we support energy research and development through the national energy research and demonstration program. To demonstrate that commitment, in 1988-89 $25m was allocated to this program. Government support for such research in Australia, expressed as a percentage of total energy research, is much higher than in most other countries. If we are to achieve the maximum benefit from research and development it is important that industry, as well as governments and institutions, are closely involved and, more importantly in my view, outcome oriented. I repeat that the Government in Energy 2000 did address the fundamentals. It examined the Australian energy situation to the year 2000 and set out the Government's energy policy response. It did so not in total isolation but by recognising that this document was going to be the basis of dynamic ongoing energy policy. However, we are not complacent and we will continue as a government to review the situation and where necessary make the appropriate policy adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> In his contribution the honourable member for Bass mentioned the National Energy Consultative Council. That particular Council will make an important contribution to the debate on energy. It has been established to monitor the energy situation and focus in particular on any changes which may require a new policy response from the Government. That Council will be the basis of that dynamic approach to energy policy that I referred to. This Council will be chaired by the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook. It consists not only of representatives of major energy industries but also of representatives from all State and Territory governments as well as representatives from the work force and consumers. Significantly, given the community's concern on issues such as the greenhouse effect, the conservation movement will also have a very important role to play. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I welcome this debate in the House this morning. It is important because we are a nation, like most Western industrialised nations, that will need to rely on a very sound energy policy for the future. I think that perhaps in the future it is significant that debates like this take place on a more regular basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too welcome the chance to debate this motion on national energy policy because, after all, we are talking about the lifeblood of Australia. Long term policies and long term education are absolutely crucial to our future as we go into the twenty-first century. It is fair to say that at present we are only scratching the surface of what we may be able to achieve with far-sighted government. We should not be misled by the current oil glut and low prices into being complacent about the future of our energy resources. Our basic energy resources are oil, coal and wood, and of course all of these are non-renewable. Obviously, they have to be used as wisely and as efficiently as possible to be cost effective. We should also bear in mind that energy costs are a major fraction of the overall costs of both our productive and our service industries, and if we want to achieve what I think all of us would agree is the major long term aim for this country's economy-that is, increasing our productivity-obviously great attention has to be given to the energy resources we use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) mentioned, this is also important from an ecological point of view. As the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) mentioned, it is particularly important in terms of the greenhouse effect and the acid rain problem, which fortunately has not affected Australia to anything like the extent that it has affected Canada and some of the European countries. Obviously, we have to look at the pollutants we release into the atmosphere. It is fair to say that at this stage we are still not as aware of this problem as we might be. The Government should be taking a greater lead up front in terms of community awareness of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is rare in the world in having an abundance of electrical energy producing material, especially open cut coal. On current rates of usage we have probably about 300 years worth of coal still available in Australia. The problem is whether we should burn it or use it for other purposes. Coal is a source of many other products and it may be more appropriate to convert it into those products rather than just burn it as a source of energy. The other products are indicated by a poem which comes to mind and which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>There's hardly a thing that man may name</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K4">Dr WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not write the poem myself; I have to be honest about that. One of the questions that raises is whether coal should be burnt or used for some of the many chemicals and pharmaceuticals of which it is the base. We should remember that, whilst oil wells are not yielding such large volumes as previously, there is still a large glut of natural gas reserves, particularly at such sites as the Bonaparte Reef and Barrow Island. We have not been aware of that, and have not understood the situation. We certainly have not used these reserves appropriately. We have been self-sufficient in the light fractions of oil, but unfortunately not in the heavy end, the tar and bitumen end of the oil fractions. We have to be aware of this particularly in relation to the importance of oil to our balance of payments. As the honourable member for Bass pointed out, any increase in oil imports is crucial to our balance of payments. Even a small increase in the cost of the oil or the volume of oil needing to be imported adds billions of dollars to our balance of payments bill, which, as we know, is already completely disastrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More importantly, increased importation may not be necessary. There are a number of measures which can resolve the matter before it really becomes a problem. This is an area in which the Government does not perhaps need to regulate, but it certainly needs to give a lead. This is a question of energy conservation. According to the International Energy Agency, a country can reduce its energy requirements by about 30 per cent with no change in living standards. This can be done by simple means, some would say very obvious means, such as using smaller or more fuel efficient cars; not using fuel oil in industry but rather electricity from coal sources; and conversion, for example converting vehicles to use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The proof of that is in the large number of taxi fleets which have been converted to LPG on economy grounds, leading to large savings for those fleets. About 90 per cent of Canberra's taxis are converted to LPG. We as a government and as an opposition may be able to persuade car makers to install LPG tanks away from the boot, where precious space is taken up by the large tanks. </PARA>
<PARA> Simple measures such as this have been ignored, and they should not be. They can make a major contribution to energy conservation. I recall that the Labor Government at the beginning of its term moved away from a commitment to convert some 3,000 vehicles a year to LPG. That was a major mistake in terms of energy conservation. We should also be looking at our knowledge of some of the conversion experiments. For example, the Mobil gas experiment in New Zealand springs to mind. That involves converting natural gas into methanol and then into petrol, which of course can then have a number of uses. Natural shelf gas is quite clearly grossly underused. There is room for a large expansion in the use of natural gas, as well as other gases such as ethane and the byproducts of ethane which may be used in industry in the production of plastics and similar materials. </PARA>
<PARA> There should not be a need to import extra oil, particularly the lighter fractions, because the conservation measures I have mentioned, in particular the use of LPG, should cut down our oil requirements. The regulation of air-conditioning has been widespread in the United States of America, although that regulation has fallen into disuse somewhat in recent years. It was clear in the mid-1970s, when restrictions were placed on temperatures that could be induced by air-conditioning, that large savings could be made in that way. I think the Government should take the lead in this regard. Some of the larger institutes we visited during the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training indicated that, by the use of sophisticated technology, they were able to cut down their fuel bills enormously. They had infra-red or microwave devices which monitored whether any person was in a room. If there was no-one in that room for a given period, the lighting and the heating was turned off. It involves capital expenditure, but that is very much recouped in the long run. Perhaps the Government should be giving more consideration and more encouragement to this sort of approach. Nationwide those savings would be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly we need to look at energy generation, and particularly power stations. In the 1960s energy requirements were doubling every seven years. They are still rising but not as rapidly. The heavy engineering requirements of power plants are almost universally imported, and importing this equipment means that our balance of payments deteriorates further and further. If we reduce our needs-and it is quite clear that we can reduce our needs-we will certainly improve our balance of payments. I believe there is a major need for a public inquiry into the efficiency of electric power stations, covering work practices, maintenance, inefficient design and inappropriate sized plants. Overseas countries use about 80 per cent of the minimum of the total installed capacity of their power stations, while Australia uses 60 per cent. Clearly that is grossly inefficient and a waste. </PARA>
<PARA> No discussion on energy can be complete without our looking at the transportation of coal and other fuel products around the country. Thirty years ago sea transport was a very efficient and cheap mode of transport. Now it is almost useless, mainly because of the work practices followed by unions involved in this area, both on board the ships and on the docks. These work practices are grossly inefficient and very expensive. Freight costs are often one of the single largest factors involved in production costs-in some areas they are as much as 40 per cent of the total cost-so clearly there needs to be a major investigation into freight costs, including rail and sea handling and also in relation to the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these factors contribute to Australia's lack of productivity and competitiveness. We will not survive as a country, or will finish up as a Third World country, if we do not sort out the problems of productivity and competitiveness. The larger problem is, of course, that we are overall still very much dependent upon farming and extraction processes and we need to increase our productivity and manufacturing industry base. Energy is a crucial part of any procedure to increase our manufacturing base. A resource rich country like ours should be one of the leading countries in the world, both in living standards and in many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of specific legislative initiatives that the Government should consider. To date I have been talking of general encouragement for energy conservation and efficient energy utilisation. I refer to the bidding system. The bidding system just does not work. The problem with that system is that the richest companies are able to achieve successful tenders but there is no requirement, indeed no incentive, for them to explore tenders. Often they may use those tenders as blocks to prevent other companies from exploring or developing leases. We need to make sure that the companies which are given exploration licences are those which have not only the ability but also the motivation to explore. Clauses need to be inserted into the licence documents to make sure that exploration is carried out and that development is carried out. It is clearly important that the new oil which is discovered be tax free and that the levy regime encourage, as far as possible, exploration and production. The resource rent tax, I think, has already been touched upon as being inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, let me summarise by saying that we need two approaches. We need the educational approach; we need the lead from government. We need to make sure government buildings are not lit up like Christmas trees all night long as they so often are and we need a lead in education and, secondly, we need stable policies. We do not need the day to day changes in policies from this Government which we so often see. We need stability in our policies, and preferably they should be as consistent and as simple as possible. We need to make sure that any disincentives to exploration and development are removed, and that is part of the minimisation of government interference, regulation and intervention. We have to recognise that government interference in this area, as in so many other areas, is basically just counterproductive. We must make efficient use of our current resources, those which are known and those which are unknown, and we must encourage discovery and development of new resources. After all, it is a question of survival in the twenty-first century. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6J4">Mr SCIACCA</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Bowman)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.11)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this motion moved by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) mainly because it gives me the opportunity today to rectify some misconceptions that are occurring in the community, ably fuelled by members of the Opposition and also by a number of motor vehicle clubs throughout Australia. It is that particular smear campaign being waged by some of these clubs that I wish to speak about today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have absolutely no problems with the wording of the motion of the honourable member for Gippsland. One would have to be a fool not to acknowledge the critical importance of Australia's road network, to recognise that a deterioration of this national infrastructure would be highly wasteful and to accept the need to redress the issue surrounding road funding by the three tiers of Government. </PARA>
<PARA> To accept the honourable member's motion would entail an acceptance of not only the words but also their clear implication, not to mention the content of his highly misleading introductory speech, which seemed more intended to cause the Cain Government electoral harm just prior to the last Victorian State election than raise any real concerns about road funding. Agreement to the motion would also involve acceptance of the highly deceitful and politically motivated campaign being waged against the Federal Government by a number of automobile clubs and associations. </PARA>
<PARA> As previously stated, I want to make particular mention of this campaign and, because of my own local knowledge, to concentrate on the club which operates in my State, Queensland, the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ). All honourable members, I think, would have received from a consortium of Australian automobile clubs a fancy card with two one cent pieces attached to it making all sorts of accusations and making it look as if those of us who do not support an increase in road funding are going to be targeted at the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) is smirking. In an interview I did this morning with Rod Henshaw of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation I debated this question with the President of the RACQ, Mr Love, who specifically stated that not only is the Government to blame on this but the Opposition is just as bad because it has no policy at all when it comes to road funding. I would not be smirking if I were the honourable member for Moreton. </PARA>
<PARA> The RACQ should really be spending its members' dues in a far more responsible way. By way of illustration, if a trade union chose to spend its money in the way the automobile clubs are, I am sure there would be cries from the Opposition to deregister the union. I understand that many policy holders are changing their insurance policies over to other companies that are more interested in providing a good service than in siding with political parties and campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> The RACQ's campaign, waged as it is with the complete support of the Opposition and conservative State governments, completely lacks credibility, and people will see right through it. Take, for example, the photo which it has chosen for the cover of its latest glossy brochure. The photo is staged, unless the photographer went into the desert and waited for a flood. It is obviously a scare tactic, yet the RACQ expects the Queensland public to believe that it is a fair and impartial assessment of the state of roads in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the attempted deception contained in the photo is nothing compared with the misleading nature of the text of the leaflet. I presume that similar leaflets have been handed around by other affiliated clubs throughout Australia. The leaflet states that less than 20 per cent of fuel taxes was spent on improving roads last year. This is a half truth at best. Not only did the Federal Government spend more than 20 per cent directly on federally funded road projects but the statement also completely ignores the fact that the tax also contributes to over $12 billion in untied grants to the States and $650m to local governments, some of which money is spent on roads. I might point out that these figures represent in real terms 11 per cent more in the case of State grants and 30 per cent more in the case of local government grants than assistance provided in a comparable period by the Fraser-Howard Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the RACQ not campaigning against the Queensland State Government and local authorities in an attempt to have them devote more of their increased Commonwealth grants to road funding? The Federal Government has devoted more money to road funding than its conservative predecessors did. I do not want to get on the bandwagon about previous governments. However, I think the comparison is fairly made. There has been an increase of 21 per cent in real terms, taking into account inflation, over the last six years compared with the last six years of the Fraser-Howard Government. Why was the RACQ not campaigning in the same vitriolic way then as it is now against this Government? Why was the Queensland State Government not jumping up and down as it is doing now? All the evidence suggests that this is a purely politically motivated campaign which the general public will see right through. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand, as I previously said, that various automobile associations throughout Australia plan to campaign against any member of parliament who does not support the campaign. This completely confirms the fact that their motives are political. Opposition members will gladly support the campaign because they do not have the responsibility of running the economy. They will gladly announce that they will spend more on roads. They will gladly announce that they will spend more on everything. But they do not say what services-health, education, et cetera-they would cut to do that. They just make empty promises which I am sure the public of Australia will see through at the next election. The automobile associations will leave them alone despite their dismally appalling record in government in this area and despite the cries from their leaders that government expenditure must be cut. The members who will face this campaign are those on this side of the House, the members of the Government, who have spent more on road funding than the coalition Government ever did. </PARA>
<PARA> The campaign does not particularly worry me because when the facts are made known the public will see the campaign for what it really is. The leaflet also states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government gets most of our taxes including fuel taxes so it has the major responsibility for road funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that the Federal Government has no constitutional responsibility whatsoever for roads. It is a residual power which remained with the States at the time of Federation. If all the self-proclaimed constitutional puritans on the other side of the House wanted to be consistent for a change, they would have to advocate that the Federal Government spend nothing on roads. The Federal Government has taken responsibility for the national highways system, which any reasonable person would expect should be the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. Most of the roads in serious need of maintenance, particularly in Queensland, are roads which fall within the jurisdiction of the State and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another suggestion made by the RACQ in its leaflet is that funds raised by Federal fuel taxes should all be spent on road construction and maintenance. That is an absolute nonsense. Is that to say, for instance, that sales tax on certain goods should go back to the industry that produces those goods? Is that to say that stamp duty, for instance, that has been paid to State governments-and in my State of Queensland millions of dollars have been raised-as a result of the housing boom should go back into housing? It does not. That money does not go back into the real estate industry to help builders or to help home ownership. It is the same principle. If we were to put all the fuel taxes into roads we would have to take the money from somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> The RACQ's leaflet also indulges in some good old-fashioned scare campaigning. In a macabre twist, towards the end of the leaflet the RACQ seems to suggest that road accidents and deaths are caused primarily by road conditions, implying that the Federal Government is responsible for these deaths. Frankly, I am disgusted by that sort of connotation. I totally reject it. The implication is made without any reference at all to the body of evidence that indicates that the major factor in road accidents is in fact driver behaviour and a failure to adjust driving to suit road conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this Government has spent 21 per cent in real terms, more than the previous conservative Government did in the last six years of its rule. This is a great achievement, and there is no doubt that it is one that we can be absolutely proud of. I say to the RACQ and all the automobile clubs: `At least be consistent, be fair, do not be politically motivated; and if you want to get stuck into the Federal Government do the same thing to the State governments and to local government, because the responsibility is with all three tiers of government'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that in this financial year the Commonwealth will receive from the bowser almost $7,000m in tax, and out of that only 20 per cent will be allocated back to roads throughout Australia. That is approximately 9 per cent of the total government income from all forms of taxation. In return only about 1.6 per cent of total Federal Government income will go back to the maintenance and building of roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In March 1983 the excise on petrol was 6.1555c per litre; in February 1989 it was 22.39c per litre. Allowing for the effects of inflation, 35 per cent less money in real terms is now being spent on the roads of Australia. Let us look at road expenditure from the Commonwealth to the States: in 1982-83 it was $850.9m; in 1983-84 it was $1,195.2m; in 1984-85 it was $1,242m; in 1985-86 it was $1,245.1m; in 1986-87 it was $1,245.1m; in 1987-88 it was $1,244.5m; and the amount to be spent in this year, 1988-89, is $1,209m. Despite that, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) stands up in this place and condemns the Australian Automobile Association and its affiliated bodies for drawing to the attention of the people of Australia the inadequacies of government spending on our roads. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VF4">Mr COWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What did we do about it? We brought in the Australian bicentennial road funding program. That is most misleading because 1983, which was the first year the Australian Labor Party was in government, was the the first year that there were benefits from the Australian bicentennial road funding program. Since that time the Government has reduced in real money terms the allocation of funds to the roads of Australia. Australian citizens are well aware that the facts presented by the Australian Auto- mobile Association are true and correct. They have awakened the motorists of this country to the fact that, of the price of every litre of petrol bought at the bowser, over 22c is going to the Commonwealth and only approximately 5c is being returned to roads. This history of this Government in respect of road funding is very poor compared with the tax that was actually collected by the previous Administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no greater priority in this country today than expenditure on roads-for the sake of the nation, for the sake of industry, and for safety's sake. Look at the number of deaths on our roads over the last few years. Road crashes claimed 2,755 lives and injured 30,137 people last year. The Federal Government's own Office of Road Safety estimates that that cost Australia $5.7 billion in property damaged, lost wages, hospitalisation and rehabilitation. Crashes, not heart disease or cancer, are now the single largest cause of death of all Australians under 45. Since 1980 road crashes have claimed 24,700 lives-more than the number of people who live in the towns of Taree and Raymond Terrace in my electorate combined. In eight to nine years a multitude of people have been wiped out. Is that not enough to prove to every member of this House that it is time that greater priority was given to road funding in this country?</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government at the moment is anxious to improve its roads and to pass more money back to the local councils. It is examining the question of toll roads. I am in favour of them. There will be one in my own electorate of Lyne. The fact is that the motorist of Australia, who is paying tax at the petrol pump, through the registration of his vehicle, in sales tax and in other forms of taxes, is already overburdened. He will still have to pay to travel upon the toll roads, but he is willing to do this for the sake of safety and efficiency and the care of his own motor vehicle. Sixty per cent of the money supplied by the Commonwealth is being spent by the States on the maintenance of roads, not on the rebuilding of roads. Many of our asphalt roads today are over 20 years old, which is the estimated lifetime of a bitumen road. These are the ones that the States are actually trying to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time 70 per cent of all freight in Australia is carried by road. It is recognised that by the year 2000 there will be an extra 60 per cent of freight over and above that carried by road. Ninety-seven per cent of all passenger journeys in Australia are made by motor vehicles. There will be an increase of over 30 per cent in the number of motor vehicles on our roads by the year 2000. The simple fact is this: investment in road funding is productive so far as our economy is concerned. Investment in road funding is something that is going to affect the assistance given to industries. It will save lives, reduce industry costs, ease the demand on our health system, reduce labour, maintenance and fuel costs for businesses and individuals, create jobs, ease the demand upon the social security system, stimulate tourism, improve the environment and, as I said earlier, will add to the efficiency of industry and ease consumer costs generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While, during this week, particularly during the last two days, we have not only enjoyed Canberra's pleasant climate but also the air-conditioned comfort of Parliament House, including this chamber, my constituents in the electorate of Wakefield in South Australia have sweltered in temperatures of 40 degrees celsius. I do not rise to grieve on their behalf because of the temperatures recorded in South Australia; I point out that in electorates such as mine and that of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), people have been harvesting the vintage crop in those temperatures. As I say, I do not rise to grieve for them for that reason, because I know from my own experience that picking grapes can be a much more pleasurable experience than, for example, some sort of factory floor occupation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise largely on behalf of the honourable member for Barker, who has found not that there has been a shortage of pickers per se but that there has been a shortage of pickers willing to work. This has occurred because the Australian Taxation Office has not made available in the Riverland area sufficient employee declaration forms to allow the employer to fill out the form and so employ the employee. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), as usual, is looking cynical. The Minister does not appreciate that the employer is placed in an impossible bind. If he employs a person and takes out tax at the maximum rate, the employee refuses to work. If he takes the person at face value, without such a form being filled out, and takes out tax at the minimum rate, as the employee wishes, he runs the risk of being prosecuted. In my initial remarks in this grievance debate I plead with the Tax Office either to send some forms to the Riverland, which would seem simple enough, or, even more realistically, to show some tolerance for an industry which is currently harvesting a vintage crop under conditions which are difficult enough without those conditions being further exacerbated by the actions of the Tax Office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On that note, and without any further assistance from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I turn to an even more exasperating exercise which is currently occurring in the South Australian wine industry. The South Australian wine industry enjoys an enviable reputation for the production of quality wine. So concerned is it about its quality that less than two weeks ago it undertook an exercise of self-regulation and introduced some minimum standards of appellation to ensure that the wine that people buy contains what is listed on the label. This industry, which is anxious to self-regulate and to maintain its enviable reputation for quality, seeks nothing more than tax equity. I do not plead for a tax advantage for the wine industry; I plead for a measure of tax equity so that it is treated in the same manner as other primary industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lest the Minister at the table should imagine that this is a plea from the Opposition provoked by the honourable member for Barker, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) or me, let me remind him that what I am saying has not come from the Opposition benches but from the Adelaide Advertiser, which on 2 December last year started a campaign for a reassessment of what was known as section 31a of the tax Act, relating to tax on stocks. This section was repealed, not surprisingly, by the Whitlam Government in 1973. I will return to that point in a moment. The Adelaide Advertiser, anxious to give an appropriate status to the South Australian wine industry, has also run a campaign over the last two months called the Adelaide vines project. It encouraged all Adelaide residents to take bunches of grapes from their backyard vines, bring them to the Adelaide Botanic Gardens last weekend and have them transported to Peter Lehmann's winery in the idyllic electorate of Wakefield, where the grapes will be crushed and the crushed grape juice, and ultimately wine, will either be made available to the contributors at cost or sold as a marketable product. Honourable members will be pleased to note that the proceeds will assist the Adelaide Central Mission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Adelaide Advertiser ran this campaign and, simultaneously, said, `We ought to look at what we are doing to the wine industry and the way in which we tax it'. Before the Minister takes his usual aggro approach, I say that I am not seeking to make a cheap political point but to have the 31a provisions, which were repealed in 1973, reconsidered. I can understand if the Minister instantly responds by saying, `What did you do from 1975 to 1983?'. I remind him that, contrary to the line--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is very sensitive. I hasten to indicate to him that, while I do not defend the Liberal Party or the National Party in this area, I make the valid point that from 1975 to 1983 no sales tax applied to wine. What has this Government done? It has both hit the wine industry with the sales tax and refused to look to the re-introduction of section 31a. It has done so in the face of what was its policy for agriculture in 1983 when the Australian Labor Party released a document which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The taxation disadvantages suffered by winemakers with respect to stock holding will be objectively examined on the basis that wine making is a primary production process, not a manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1983 to 1989 there has been not so much as a whimper of consideration for what was to have been the 1983 policy. Today, all I plead is for the Treasury to be prepared to hear the wine industry on this question of section 31a. It is not a plea for the wine industry to be treated in any exclusive manner; it is a plea only that it be treated as other primary industries are treated. The wine industry should be told, `If you are taking a primary product and producing something consumable from it, just as the beef industry, the livestock industries generally and the cheese industry do, you ought to have similar taxation consideration'. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this plea has not come from the Opposition benches; it has been gingered up, if honourable members will pardon the term, by the Advertiser. It has also come from the Australian Wine and Brandy Producers Association, which wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Keating), making what it felt was a very valid claim. The Treasurer's reply, or in this case the reply of the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris), was that he could see the validity of its claim but that he thought that the extension-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . of primary production status to the winemaking industry alone would be unjustified and could create a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA>I would be prepared to accept that if it were true, but this plea is not for a status to be extended to the wine industry alone. This plea from the wine industries is to be treated as other primary production industries are treated. I will now quote from one of the articles in the Advertiser to which I referred earlier. Mr Dennis Reimann, a constituent of mine and a former President of the Australian Wine and Brandy Producers Association, said that he did not mind if the change did not involve section 31a. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the key to the industry's submission for the reintroduction of a system of minimum stock values-not by reintroducing 31a but by the simple means of changing Section 6 (1) to add the words `the manufacture of wine, brandy and other products of the grape', along with other primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a plea for sales tax avoidance; this is not a plea even for some form of tax elimination. At most, this is a plea for a technique for deferring tax. The wine industry, which has placed so much emphasis on producing quality products and the key to the export expansion of which is the expansion of quality products, says, `Let us be encouraged to lay down stocks and vintage fine wines so that we have something uniquely Australian to export'. If this Government believes in value adding, I can think of few industries that offer the value adding potential of the already existing wine industry, which seeks simply to export a more valuable product than the product it is currently being encouraged to lay down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I am going to speak about legal aid for New South Wales veterans. The Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales has decided to eliminate the right of New South Wales veterans and war widows to legal aid. This outrageous decision, I hope, will be condemned by all members of this House. The attacks on the rights of these ex-service men and women and their dependants have been endorsed by the New South Wales Liberal Government and in particular the Liberal Attorney-General, Mr John Dowd. Prior to 1987, when the Federal and State legal aid services were amalgamated, veterans and war widows were entitled to free legal aid from the Australian Legal Aid Office for repatriation cases heard by the Veterans' Review Board (VRB), the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and the Federal Court of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Dowd might well ask why veterans should have easier access to legal aid than anyone else. I point out to the House that the whole repatriation system is designed to provide compensation to veterans and war widows for the injuries veterans suffered during their war service. If veterans do not receive the benefits to which they are entitled because the New South Wales Government has taken away their legal aid, then surely they will not be able to get the compensation to which they are rightfully entitled. This legal advice is essential, given the sheer size and complexity of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the fact that most of the veterans concerned, and war widows especially, are elderly and often in very poor health. </PARA>
<PARA> The Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, with Mr Dowd's help, has removed the main source of legal counsel for these people. Given that the overwhelming majority of these men and women are low to middle income workers, they cannot afford the massive cost of private expert legal advice. The end result is that these people will not receive the repatriation benefits to which they are truly entitled and which they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> During the legal aid service merger negotiations in 1987, the Federal Government agreed to provide funds and staff to the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission on condition that the free legal aid service for veterans and war widows continued. This year the Federal Government will provide $28m to enable this to occur. The New South Wales Liberal Government has allowed the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales to break this agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable members some of the history of this. Last July the Legal Aid Commission decided to impose a means test on veterans, so that only those living at a subsistence level could qualify for legal assistance. Honourable members might recall that I raised this matter in the House on many occasions last year, challenging Mr Dowd and the Legal Aid Commission to remove the means test which they intended to impose from 1 November last year. I mention my appreciation of the efforts of other members such as the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) and the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), who also pressed the New South Wales Liberal Government on this issue. Many veterans organisations and individual veterans wrote to Mr Dowd asking him to use his sway on the Legal Aid Commission to have that decision reversed. On 16 November last year the Legal Aid Commission backed down and removed the means test. It had not to proceed with it. Mr Dowd is still responding to letters which he has received from constituents in my electorate about the proposed means test with the following letter. I have deleted the relevant name. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter expressing concern about a decision by the Legal Aid Commission to impose a means test on war veterans' matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Director of the Commission has now advised me that at a meeting on 16th November, 1988, the motion to impose such a means test was rescinded. The policy now, as previously, is that all veterans' matters, with the exception of war service pension claims, are exempt from means testing. </PARA>
<PARA> You may wish to note that the provision of aid in veterans' matters in New South Wales is considerably more extensive than the provision of aid in such matters in other States. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dowd, of course, is trumpeting the fact that the means test which was proposed is not proceeding. But the problem for Mr Dowd is that late last year his Legal Aid Commission, with the support of his nominee, decided to implement cost recovery on most veterans cases. I suppose that is not unusual when we realise that the Liberal Party, under Mr Greiner, says that it is committed to the user pays principle. Here is an example where the veterans are paying simply for seeking to get legal advice on repatriation matters. </PARA>
<PARA> On 12 December last year I received the following letter from Ken Bott, the welfare officer for the Central Coast and Hunter Valley sub-branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Michael,</PARA>
<PARA> Information has come to this Association and our members that the New South Wales Government has enacted Section 46 of the Legal Aid Commission Act when dealing with any client, Veterans, War Widows etc included . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, our information, if it is correct means the Veteran has to pay all costs to Legal Aid when appealing to the VRB, AAT or the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> At the VRB for instance, a Veteran would have to pay all disbursement costs i.e. phone calls, letters, postage etc. They would also have to pay for any medical visits to specialists, as well as any specialist reports, a minimum figure of $500 plus 50% of the schedule solicitors fee, at approximately $100 per hour to peruse those documents and then to represent them at the VRB. </PARA>
<PARA> If this is correct no Veteran or War Widow would be able to afford to appeal any decision given by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to put themselves in the shoes of the typical World War II digger. He is in his mid to late sixties and suffers from perhaps a heart complaint, a hearing defect or some deteriorating bone condition. If he wishes to appeal successfully to the VRB, after applying, perhaps, for an increase in a disability pension or to have a new illness recognised as war caused, he will need informed, up-to-date advice and detailed expert medical opinion to support his case. This veteran's file is probably one to two inches thick. Yet, Mr Dowd wants that veteran to pay for an advocate at $50 an hour to read the file and research the relevant cases. The veteran will have to pay for any visits that are made to expert specialists. One can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, how much it would cost to get a Macquarie Street specialist-a cardiologist or psychiatrist, or anyone else-to provide a report. Imagine how much it would cost a veteran a day if a Macquarie Street specialist were required to appear before an AAT hearing and give an opinion. As a result, there is no way in the world that this veteran could afford to pay these costs and there is no way, therefore, that he could proceed with his appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this decision by the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission is the most callous attack on veterans and war widows in recent times. It does not matter how tight or loose the Veterans' Entitlements Act is if no veteran can afford to appeal any of the decisions made in the repatriation system. As a result of the Legal Aid Commission's decision, the New South Wales veterans community is in total confusion. There have been some rumours that destitute veterans may be exempted from this user pays principle. But no-one knows how the Legal Aid Commission will define a destitute veteran. </PARA>
<PARA> Many welfare officers from the Returned Services League of Australia, the Legacy organisation and the VVA, the front-line advisers to New South Wales veterans and war widows, are now advising their veterans that there is no point in appealing to the VRB or higher courts because no-one can tell them how much it will cost them. They simply do not know. All veterans, not just the destitute, really need legal aid and that is something which I hope all honourable members would support. All veterans in New South Wales should continue to get the legal aid which the Federal Government and this Parliament is paying millions of dollars for. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dowd and the Legal Aid Commission are double dipping. They took the Federal legal aid staff in 1987; they are happy to take the $28m this year, which we are providing to them; and, yet, they will not provide the assistance to veterans and war widows which they agreed in 1987 would be provided to New South Wales veterans and war widows. </PARA>
<PARA> In January this year, the Federal Labor Government's representatives on the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission board sought to rescind the decision to impose section 46 cost recovery on veterans. This resolution was defeated. I have received information that at that January meeting Mr Dowd's representatives voted in favour of imposing user pays cost recovery on veterans and war widows. Yet Mr Dowd-and I have read to the House his letter dated February this year-is still writing to New South Wales veterans trumpeting his success in removing last year's proposal to impose a means test. I think that letter is totally misleading and it is about time Mr Dowd stopped misleading the New South Wales veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dowd has singled out veterans for miserable treatment; Mr Dowd has breached the merger agreement with the Federal Government; and, worst of all, Mr Dowd has not the courage or intestinal fortitude to tell the veterans what he has really done. He keeps on pretending that he has done something for veterans when, in fact, he has hit them with the greatest slug that we have seen for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the New South Wales Premier, Mr Greiner, to urgently intervene in this matter. If Mr Dowd will not stick up for veterans' rights in New South Wales, I call on Premier Greiner to dismiss him forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I subscribe very firmly to the view that the Parliament, belonging as it does to the people, is the supreme court in the land and, therefore, each member of the Parliament has an unbridled responsibility to ensure that at all times democracy is preserved and the parliamentary system works. In this respect, we have a responsibility to hold government and government departments accountable. Unfortunately, in recent years-and not just during the administration of the Hawke Government-we have seen the establishment of statutory authorities which are less accountable by virtue of Ministers not being as directly responsible for them as they are for government departments which they have to answer for from the floor of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make no apologies for my continuing watching role of government instrumentalities. In recent months I have had cause to challenge the administration of and the methods employed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian Taxation Commissioner and, in respect of a less serious matter, the Health Insurance Commission. In the latter case, the errors involved are most likely acts of repeated carelessness rather than anything untoward. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Australian Taxation Office has committed a most serious breach of the recently enacted privacy legislation by posting out tax file numbers without having first checked that the person whose number it is forwarding actually lives at the address to which the letter is being sent. The Tax Office does not have in place a system under which letters are registered to ensure that they fall into the hands of only the addressee and returned if the addressee cannot be found. </PARA>
<PARA> Thousands upon thousands of tax file numbers have fallen into the hands of other people. The Tax Office was apparently so inundated with calls some weeks ago from people wanting to know their tax file number that it took a rather rash decision to post out people's tax file numbers to try to reduce the number of inquiries. It would seem that the Tax Office has seized on names dating back as far as 1981. The actual envelope itself carries no identification to say that it is from the Taxation Office. I would suggest that, from one side of Australia to the other, near relations of deceased persons have been naturally opening these letters as have people who are curious to see who has written to the previous residents of the homes they now occupy. It should be remembered also that, if a person's income level falls below the taxable threshold, there is absolutely no obligation on that person to continue to communicate with the Taxation Office. There are many scenarios as to why tax file numbers are falling into wrong hands. I know of one case in which three tax file numbers belonging to other people were sent to a person's home and another was sent to him at his post office box address. Despite all this, Taxation Commissioner Boucher had the audacity to put out a press release on 13 February with the following warning:</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who discloses the tax file number or other related tax information of another person when they are not lawfully allowed to, may be liable to imprisonment for two years or a $10,000 fine or both . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government itself is guilty of breaking this very requirement. Surely the laws of the land apply as equally to the Government and the Taxation Commissioner as they do to the people. Under the Privacy Act a file number recipient is defined as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who is (whether lawfully or unlawfully) in possession or control of a record that contains tax file number information shall be regarded, for the purposes of this Act, as a file number recipient. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Taxation Commissioner is himself a tax file number recipient. Yet he has been utterly careless in that he has disregarded the requirements of this Act in terms of the way in which tax file numbers have been communicated to various people. </PARA>
<PARA> I have lodged a formal complaint with the Privacy Commissioner on behalf of four individuals, including a member of parliament from this side of the House whose father had been sent a tax file number even though he had died 6 1/2 years ago. I believe that the approach that has been adopted to this whole exercise is totally outside the spirit of the assurances that the Government gave in terms of ensuring that the tax file number systems would have safeguards and people would be protected in terms of their numbers falling into the hands of others. Indeed, tax file numbers can be wrongly used. These numbers will be a godsend to the tax cheats that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been telling us about for three or four years. They will be able to use an official number to beat the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Boucher said in his press release of 13 February that tough new penalties would apply to anyone who misuses a tax file number. However, he should not adopt any system to send them out. A tax file number is supposed to belong to an individual. Of course, it can be given to another individual who has a legislated right to know. Yet the system is one of utter carelessness, expediency and disregard for the law. Section 3.3.1 of schedule 2 of the Privacy Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax file number recipients-</PARA>
<PARA>and this includes the Taxation Commis- sioner-</PARA>
<PARA>shall take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to (a) introduce information handling procedures to protect the privacy of individuals in relation to their tax file number information;</PARA>
<PARA>Section 3.3.2 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Tax file number recipients holding tax file number information shall take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure that security safeguards and procedures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to, modification or disclosure of, and loss of, such information, whether that information is stored in physical or electronic form. </PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that the integral part of the whole system is the number. Yet, those numbers are being sprayed across Australia without any regard to the requirements of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the Privacy Commissioner not to waste time, to move in on the Taxation Commissioner and the Government now. They have no right to continue with a system that does not meet the requirements of reasonable safeguards. The Taxation Commissioner is unsure, which he has every right to be and he even concedes that in his press release. But he should have a system of establishing whether the relevant person actually lives at the address to which the number is being sent. To be writing to people who have died six or seven years ago, to be writing to people who have shifted five years ago, to be writing to people who do not even have to send in returns is reckless and irresponsible and a contravention of spirit which existed when the Opposition finally supported the introduction of the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a matter which has been of concern to me for some considerable time and I believe it is appropriate that it be raised now. The matter concerns the access of children from working class suburbs and state schools to the higher education system and, in particular, to the older established institutions, the universities in what one would call the `ivy league' belt. The Whitlam Government took the step of cancelling university fees and of greatly expanding Commonwealth responsibility for tertiary education in an attempt to increase the access of ordinary Australians to the ability to improve themselves and to provide Australia with a greater resource in educated people than had previously existed. At an earlier time there had been only one university in Victoria, for instance, virtually no state high schools and a very limited capacity for people from working class families to proceed to the various courses of law, medicine, engineering and others which guarantee a person a professional status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Figures which were compiled in the 1970s showed that an abnormally high proportion of those people graduating from Melbourne University and latterly Monash University came from the non-Catholic private school system and had parents who had also graduated through the same system. Unfortunately, almost 20 years after the education system was expanded to provide more tertiary places, access to the major courses in the major universities in Victoria-and I can talk only of Victoria here-is still as it was. Something like 50 per cent of the entrants to the universities of Melbourne and Monash for courses of law, medicine and engineering are drawn from 5 per cent of the community. The state system provides education to something of the order of 80 per cent of all children in Victoria, yet that system accounts for about 50 per cent of enrolments in those courses at those universities. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1970s, conservative governments in Canberra and Victoria, on the basis of a totally irrelevant forecast of the need for graduate engineers, decided to reduce the access to engineering in that State and did so by taking away the faculty at Deakin University, a faculty which drew the majority of its students from working class families. It appears that nothing has been done, and nothing is proposed to be done, which would provide positive opportunities for children from state school and working class backgrounds to enter those fairly privileged professions in our community. Melbourne and Monash universities have devised massive self-protection mechanisms which have successfully prevented any change in the balance or in the opportunities to enter those professions. We still have a situation where nearly 50 per cent of the students in the three professions that I have mentioned, who study at Melbourne and Monash universities, are drawn from 5 per cent of the educational institutions or fewer. In a country where everyone pays for the education system, I believe it is highly improper that that system should be designed for and have the effect of protecting privilege in our community in a manner which has been out of date for 50 years. I would ask those responsible for reviewing our educational institutions, and for the amalgamation or otherwise of educational institutions, to have a good look at the entry capacity into those courses I have mentioned and to come up with answers as to why the great mass of the community are still excluded from what is basically a public education facility. I am extremely concerned about this and about the extent to which those universities are prepared to use their influence in order to prevent change. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention one other area of education where, fortunately, the efforts were not successful. Some years ago, an off-campus master of business studies course was introduced in Victoria and it was the subject of a major controversy and a very substantial effort by the people who run the economics faculty at Melbourne University to prevent that course going ahead. Initially, that effort was made to protect the Harvard graduates who wanted to maintain their own exclusive position of having that education, despite the national interest, and ultimately it was to restrict the number of people in Australia who could receive that higher level of training in order to improve our business and commercial performances. It had nothing to do with the good of education; it had to do with the protection of privilege. Unfortunately, the protection of privilege is still driving at least two of our major education institutions in Victoria, which are not prepared to take action to accept a balance of entry into their courses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known in Victoria that if one wants to do law one goes to Wesley College and if one wants to do medicine one goes to Scotch College. If one wants to try to do these courses, one will find few opportunities if one has attended a State education institution. It does not matter about the quality of the student; what does matter is where he comes from, who he is and how much he is prepared to put into the maintenance of privilege in our society. These institutions and these courses must be opened up, or new courses must be evolved to allow more Australians, particularly from working class families, the opportunity to derive and to pursue their full educational potential. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in this grievance debate, on what I believe to be a most important issue. It concerns the number of deaths that are occurring from overdoses of a drug called serepax. Out of courtesy I informed the relevant Minister, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, that I intended to mention this because I believe it is that important. I start by quoting from the Sun-Herald of 21 February, 1988, an article headlined `What the drugs can do to you'. Under the sub-heading `Minor tranquillisers' it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most prescribed group with 6.5 million scripts a year, they replaced the dangerous barbiturates in the 1960s for treatment of anxiety, neurosis and sleeplessness. </PARA>
<PARA> One-in-three Australians have used them at some time, twice as many women as men. </PARA>
<PARA> They are safe (10,000 Serepax would be required for a lethal overdose) but because of widespread availability and use are responsible for 40 per cent of drug overdoses admitted to hospital. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is then relevant to look at an advertisement, published by the manufacturer of serepax-Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd. This advertisement quoted a 60 Minutes interview, shown on Sunday, 29 September 1985, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>``Well I've seen a few people on Seras you know, a few of my friends have OD'd on 'em'' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In its advertisement Wyeth then tries to contradict that by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> In the grapple for higher ratings, the media continue with alarmist misinformation, which does little more than worry and confuse many of your patients. </PARA>
<PARA>This is obviously directed to doctors. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Studies conducted in animals have shown that it would take around 10,000 30mg Serepax tablets for the average person to overdose. (And that would be like swallowing a bucket full of them). </PARA>
<PARA>I am grateful to Dr Warwick Wickham, from Port Macquarie in my electorate, for bringing this matter to my attention and also to the attention of the Minister. In one letter to the Minister, Dr Wickham said:</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, 18 deaths resulting from oxazepam (i.e. Serepax) overdoses have now been located, and still a responsible retraction has not been published to an advertisement that says it's O.K. to take 10,000 Serepax tablets. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is totally irresponsible. Mr Staples did see Dr Wickham on 7 February 1989, but he did not have the courtesy to allow me to accompany him, which I found very disappointing. I do not know why he did that, I do not know what he was afraid of. But after that meeting, in a note to me Dr Wickham said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Staples, Dr Ashley and Dr McEwen-</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Ashley being head of the Drug Evaluation Branch of the Department of Community Services and Health and Dr John McEwen being head of the Evaluation Support Branch-</PARA>
<PARA>appeared to consider that the danger to public safety that resulted from the irresponsible Serepax advertising did not warrant any action, because apparently they considered that the self regulatory process of the pharmaceutical industry had improved recently. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, that is most definitely not good enough because self-regulation is not working. In the very short time that is available to me, I would just like to go through a letter from Dr Wickham to the Minister, dated 28 January 1989, because this gives the story. What we are being fed is a load of garbage. By extrapolating the LD50 test on animals to human beings, it is assumed that a human can take 10,000 without overdosing, but I would like to see the Minister or perhaps the manufacturers take 10,000 serepax. Then we would see what happens. There is evidence of one death by overdose on only 40 tablets. This is very serious and it is not good enough for the responsible Minister just to shut the door on this. In this letter of 28 January, Dr Wickham said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Staples,</PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the figure of 10 000 Serepax tablets being required for overdose is not safe to supply to doctors, and the advertisement which stated this was withdrawn . . . This advertisement was derived by extrapolating animal data to human, and the following statements have been made . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I must point out that in that LD50 test the stuff is fed to rats until 50 per cent of them die. That is then taken as the basis for extrapolating the test to human beings. In a letter dated 11 May 1987, the Commonwealth Department of Health said to Dr Wickham:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the matter of the Serepax promotion has been taken up with the APMA in terms of that organisation's Code of Conduct, with a view to achieving withdrawal of these advertisements and a retraction of the statements relating LD50 data to clinical safety. </PARA>
<PARA>In a letter to Dr Wickham on 13 October 1988, Mr Staples said:</PARA>
<PARA>I have asked the Department to write to the APMA requesting that their members be alerted to the fact that it is not scientifically valid to extrapolate animal data when making statements concerning dosage in man . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, in spite of the above, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd were reported as saying as recently as 16 January 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>Wyeth maintains that the advertisement is still accurate. The clarification letter that it sent to all doctors was not a retraction. </PARA>
<PARA>This information was supplied to the general public. However, no retraction has been published relating to the printing of the statement in the Sun-Herald on 21 February 1988 that 10,000 serepax would be required for a lethal overdose. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to put to you that it is totally irresponsible for any pharmaceutical company to say that it is safe to take 10,000 of these tablets when there is evidence of death as a result of taking them. In his letter to Mr Staples, Dr Wickham went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Although benzodiazepines are relatively safe in overdose, the following statistics highlight the dangers of irresponsible advertising regarding overdose:-</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the widespread availability and use, benzodiazepines are responsible for 40 per cent of drug overdoses admitted to hospital . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We saw that from that Sun-Herald report I started with. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> A recent study of 6,000 post-mortem examinations carried out to determine cause of death by poisoning, found that 66 per cent were due to therapeutic substances, the benzodiazepines being the fifth most common group of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that lethal benzodiazepine overdoses do occur, and the Australian Government appears to consider that while it is irresponsible to advertise to doctors that 10,000 serepax tablets would be required to overdose, it is okay for this information to be distributed to the Australian public, as has been done on at least two occasions. We now know that a fatal overdose has occurred with 40 serepax tablets and I defy the Minister to prove that an even smaller dose would not be lethal in susceptible individuals. In summary, it has been established that 18 deaths resulting from oxyzepam-that is, serepax overdoses-have now been located, and still a responsible retraction has not been published to an advertisement that says that it is okay to take 10,000 serepax tablets. I believe that the Australian public deserves far better treatment than this, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I cannot for one minute believe that any responsible Minister would refuse to take further action on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I must make the point that we are a drug-ridden society. We pay a lot of lip service to the need to cut out drugs. We concentrate on marijuana and heroin, but we all know-all of us-that the family bathroom cabinet drugs are just as important and just as dangerous. Here we have a situation where a zealous doctor has drawn the attention of the Minister to the fact that action should be taken. I appeal to the Minister to take the appropriate action to ensure that Wyeth Pharmaceuticals retracts its statement and makes it widely known that one cannot and should not take 10,000 serepax tablets with impunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the grievance I wish to address today is very strongly felt in the electorate of Banks at the moment, especially in the East Hills area which comes under the authority of Bankstown Council. The drawn out saga of the fate of the East Hills Golf Course has been resolved in a most unexpected way. For years the golf course operators complained that they were unable to operate a golf course profitably and called for rezoning to enable the course to be combined with medium density housing. This was unacceptable to the Council and local residents who wanted the course to remain as it was. The call went out for a buyer who would take over the course as is, but no-one could be found. Council sought and gained State government funds to buy the course. Due to excessive delays, Bankstown Council lost its chance and the course was bought by a developer, with the fate of the golf links still undecided. With the benefit of hindsight, the matter could have been resolved if a more compromising approach had been taken by Council in relation to the original development proposal. The golf course could have been retained and a modicum of badly needed houses provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Late last year the course was bought by an unknown Japanese developer, a man whom we now know as Mr Shiyoda. The price of $16m was four times its market value. Honourable members may ask why my constituents should be concerned-after all, foreign ownership is not unknown to Australia, especially Japanese ownership. Besides, our colleagues in the National Party of Australia and their fellow members in the State Government have often bent over backwards to encourage Japanese buyers to purchase choice industrial and tourist properties. But I assure honourable members that there are many good reasons why the people of Banks are less than enthusiastic about the deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Banks is the home of a large population of working class people, including many ex-servicemen who have settled in the area. Quite a number of veterans are golf club members, and they are understandably wary of seeing their club being taken over by a Japanese citizen. I would refute claims that this is a racist stance. After all, we do not charge the Japanese with being racist because they would prevent similar land sales from going ahead in their own country. Japanese ownership rules prevent Australian buyers from doing the same thing in Japan as Mr Shiyoda is doing in Australia. In fact, when a similar deal was put to the nearby Bankstown Golf Club the executive rejected the offer unanimously. Naturally we would all prefer 100 per cent Australian ownership of all our property but our economic circumstances make this impossible. To enforce intractable policy of no foreign ownership would lock out many investors whom we are trying to attract. Yet I believe that any responsible policy must ask the question: what benefit will flow to Australia and at what cost? The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has approved the sale on the basis that the present membership will enjoy continued membership at concessional rates, that increased charges will be reasonable and that the golf course will remain a golf course. These assurances have been a great relief to the club members as has been stated in the local press, but several concerns still exist. </PARA>
<PARA> When the issues of concessional membership and cost per game are raised we ought to remember that the Japanese, a race of enthusiastic golfers, are used to paying rates which are, quite frankly, beyond the reach of most Australians. In an overpopulated country with few world class courses, it is not uncommon to pay the equivalent of $100,000 for a year's membership and $60 a game. A concessional rate of even a third of these amounts will put golfing at East Hills well beyond the reach of the average present member. I would therefore ask the Treasurer to further clarify the terms `reasonable' and `concessional'. They must be made to refer clearly to Australian, not Japanese, standards. Mr Shiyoda's representatives have made it clear that the new owner sees the value of the East Hills course and its potential to draw wealthy Japanese tourists-a praise- worthy goal in itself, but many of my constituents have questioned the true intent of the sale, especially as it has been purchased at four times its value as a golf course. I would ask the Treasurer to report on what measures may be taken to ensure that the golf course will not be rezoned and subdivided. </PARA>
<PARA> Even after a few years, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the developers will see the chance to increase earnings further by having the land rezoned by the State Government and selling it off far more profitably as residential land. After all, the new buyer obviously has the resources to sit back and bide his time waiting for the best business opportunity. In addition, the new owners have already said that they will be closing the course for up to 18 months while renovations are completed which will bring it up to international standard. One can only welcome such investment to increase Australia's attractiveness as a tourist destination, but some of the club members have again questioned the motives of such a move. </PARA>
<PARA> Having been a member of the Public Works Committee for some years now, I know how easy it is for contractors to go over time and over budget. It only takes a few overly rainy weeks to wipe out a season's worth of work and this is especially so when the type of renovation going on is in landscaping. So how many years will the members be paying membership fees-presumably at the increased but `concessional' and `reasonable' rates-before they can actually play a round of golf? How many of the 900 members will leave whilst these renovations are proceeding? Already many members have joined other local clubs. I think it is fair that the Treasurer should ask what interim arrangements apply so that it cannot be said that the new owner has tried to eliminate the Australian membership by inordinate delay and in reopening. I should also like to know what will be done with the present club staff. Some to whom I have spoken have given many years service to the club and these people have no idea what the future holds. Surely, any deal must include adequate protection for the club's workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it should be realised that the East Hills Golf Club has been an important factor in the sporting life of the area. Hundreds of young golfers had their start only through the club's cooperation with six local high schools to encourage newcomers. I would hate to seen young Australian players denied the chance to get a taste for the game because of prohibitive arrangements by the new owner. I would prefer a much more precise report on what changes are about to occur in order to allay the members' and residents' fears. Certainly, I would like my local Liberal opponent to be a little more honest in his views of what he believes should happen. Capitalising on the present dissatisfaction with the announced sale, he has stated that he is concerned that the Government is not combating the problem of Japanese consortiums busily buying up real estate within Australia, including some in the Banks electorate. Members opposite may be a little confused by this stance. After all, during the debate on the Foreign Takeovers Amendment Bill in November of last year the Opposition came out clearly and vocally in favour of continued foreign ownership of Australian residential property. This legislation prohibited non-residents from buying into our already overheated residential property market. We perceived a real danger in allowing absentee landlords to drive up housing values for Australian buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) even suggested that we were racist in excluding Japanese and Hong Kong buyers from our residential market. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) went to some lengths to argue what little influence foreign buyers have on our local residential market. The argument seems to be that we should not stop a few foreigners from owning Australian homes because they do not have an impact on prices. He then turned around and argued that this move, supposedly prejudicial to only a very small group, would cause a large number of investors to think twice about putting money into Australia. Clearly, the Opposition cannot have it both ways. Either foreign ownership of residential property is a big issue with important flowthrough effects to the rest of the economy, or it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that foreign ownership is an important issue and that the Government's stance was the right one. Yet these same people who claim they would stop Japanese consortiums from buying land are also the ones who wanted to allow foreign firms to be able to buy land and houses which are already in big demand from Australian buyers. Our stance on foreign ownership in the past has always been practical, economically sound and well considered. Our opponents, on the other hand, want to argue one way to please the voters in the business sector and the very opposite when they want to grab the votes of normal working people. Although I recognise the need for investment, I do not support the Government's present stance where, in many cases, 100 per cent of foreign ownership is permitted. There is enough community feeling to question also some aspects of foreign ownership. Enough is enough! I call on the Government to restrict any foreign investment to 49 per cent ownership other than where insufficient Australian capital is available for a specific development project. </PARA>
<PARA> The East Hills golf course issue is of local interest, but there is much resentment against some ownership in other sectors. For example, I am aware of Japanese package tourist deals, paid for entirely in Japan, which limit the amount a tourist can spend in Australia. Japanese tourists going to Japanese-owned resorts, restaurants, hotels and tours, will contribute to Australian income only in the form of wages. Some packages, reportedly, do not involve allowing tourists to wander from a consortium's facilities. As far as Australia is concerned, the entire transaction could be taking place in Japan. I am not saying that this is the case for Japanese tourism generally but it is occurring frequently enough to cause concern. Accordingly, I call on the Treasurer and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) to make inquiries about the costs and benefits of foreign ownership of our tourist facilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two issues in the grievance debate today. The first arises from the tabling in the Parliament this morning of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration's report entitled Going for gold-First report of an inquiry into sports funding and administration. As was mentioned in the debate on the report, I was a member of that Committee. I want to make the point-now because of time constraints, I was unable to speak in the earlier debate-that I am disappointed that the Victorian State Government did not make a submission to that major bipartisan sports funding inquiry. In fact, there was not dissent but agreement among Government and Opposition members of the Committee in terms of this bipartisan report. I think this point can be made generally about many parliamentary reports presented in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My specific point is that the Cain Government did not choose to make a submission to this important inquiry. One of the Cain Government's election promises was that it would spend $3m on setting up an Institute of Sport in Victoria. Obviously, the Cain Government does not know what it is doing in relation to the funding of sport in Victoria, because it did not choose or bother to make a submission to this Federal parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Victorian Government is backing and wanting the Olympics for Melbourne and I support that. I think we need a bipartisan approach to doing everything we can to get the Olympics in Melbourne. But I believe that the Cain Government is prejudicing that bid by not knowing what to do about setting up its own Victorian Institute of Sport. Obviously, Melbourne and Victoria will need additional facilities in relation to its bid for the Olympics. One would have thought that this would have been a good opportunity to put in the public domain some of those ideas and thoughts. Obviously, the Cain Government's preoccu- pation with the Victorian Economic Development Corporation scandal is interfering with its capacity to govern, to support Melbourne's bid for the Games and to make a submission on sport to this inquiry. This evidence indicates that the Cain Government has lost its way. Additionally, the Cain Government has stopped funding wrestling in Victoria because of some irregularities in its own funding. So much for that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue that I wish to mention concerns the failed policies of the Government in relation to Aboriginal affairs. I wish to raise the question of the proposed so-called treaty between Aboriginal Australians and other Australians that the Government is contemplating entering into and the issue of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation. We know that there is a total failure of Government policy in the area of Aboriginal affairs. In fact, it is a tragedy and a shambles for Australia that this occurred in Australia's bicentenary year. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer specifically to a decision by the Aboriginal Development Commission to provide $377,000 to a Sydney Aboriginal organisation known as Tranby College, to be spent on negotiations relating to this so-called treaty between Aboriginal and other Australians. I need to have some answers from the Government and the Minister. I want to know whether Tranby College has in fact sent students to Cuba and Nicaragua for advice, training and inspiration. The Aboriginal Development Commission, undoubtedly under instructions from the Government, provided this $377,000 to be spent on the negotiations relating to the so-called treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently one of the ideas that Tranby College had was to send people overseas to review different treaty negotiations and situations in other countries and also to bring in people from overseas and talk to them about the experiences they have had with treaties in their own countries. At the time that this grant was being made and discussions about it were occurring, apparently Tranby College was negotiating with Cuba and Nicaragua to send students to those countries to study their indigenous affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the House would agree that a number of important questions need to be answered by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). What negotiations took place between Tranby College, Cuba and Nicaragua at the time the grant of $377,000 was made? Can the Minister assure the House that no part of the $377,000 that was provided to Tranby has been used to enable persons associated with the College to travel to, or negotiate with, countries such as Cuba and Nicaragua and their left wing regimes? I believe that these important questions need to be answered by the Government and the Minister at this time of total failure of administration and shambles in the actual administration of Aboriginal affairs policies. The contemplation of visits to Cuba and Nicaragua to see how treaties should be negotiated is only adding to the areas of great uncertainty that exist. I understand that the Auditor-General, as part of his inquiry, is investigating Tranby College. I hope that the matters I have raised today will be taken aboard by the Auditor-General and reported on. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, apparently some students associated with Tranby College have applied to the Government for some assistance in their work experience programs that are administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Again they want to go overseas to those places of `great learning'-Cuba and Nicaragua with their left wing regimes. I think the people of Australia need to know the current position. We need to know whether in fact students have been funded under the Department of Employment, Education and Training's program; we need to know what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is doing; and we need to know what Tranby College was doing with the money that was allocated to it to be spent on negotiations relating to the so-called treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is tragic that we have to raise these issues which show the fiddling that is going on. It is tragic that these issues should be central to the debate. What we should have is stability and certainty and a bipartisan approach to the administration of Aboriginal affairs. Bipartisanship in Aboriginal affairs matters was abandoned by this Government. I think Government's proposals are ill-considered. I have referred to the failures of policy and administration. It is tragic that all of this is occurring when the real health, welfare and education needs and the general advancement and well being of Aboriginal people all over Australia are being neglected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a lot to answer for. I believe that by abandoning the bipartisan approach, it has set back the cause of Aboriginal people years, if not decades. Firstly, if the Government promised uniform national land rights; it cynically exploited the Aboriginal people for its own purpose; it got the Aboriginal vote and then dumped Aboriginal land rights. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) keeps mentioning and proposing this treaty idea whenever he goes out into the sun. In addition to that, the Minister's proposed legislation has just been subject to a very comprehensive Senate report which found that it needs further amendment. I am totally opposed to that legislation because I think it does nothing for the cause of Aboriginal people and advances them nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has a lot of questions to answer in relation to Government funding of Tranby College to be used to promote the so-called treaty between Aboriginals and other Australians. We need to know whether Government money has been used to fund trips to and from Nicaragua. I ask the Minister to answer those questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise again the matter of a widespread illness known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome. When I mentioned this matter in the Parliament on the 13 October last year I was overwhelmed by the response from people all over Australia. Indeed, when I returned to my office in Parliament House that day, I found two women waiting to see me who had heard the speech and who wanted to discuss this disease. One of the women was firmly convinced that failure by the medical community and the community at large to acknowledge this disease and treat it seriously has in fact caused an increase in suicide amongst suffers. I do not know whether I would go so far as to say that, but certainly the depression associated with the illness is extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Western Australia, in particular, there seemed to be a dearth of information about the disease and a great need for up-to-date advice on the subject. Like so many other outer suburban areas, my own electorate of Cowan is a microcosm of Australian society and, accordingly, contains a large number of sufferers and their families. The types of problems that have been brought to my attention are many and varied. They range from acute depression, exacerbated by social isolation, loss of employment and ineligibility for pension entitlements as a consequence of the low recognition of the disease among medical practitioners in the past and, unfortunately, into the present as well. This lack of recognition results in incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate medication and treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also received much information about the illness itself from a variety of sources and about the willingness and capacity of doctors practising conventional medicine to treat it. It is encouraging to note that sufferers appear to find relief in many ways, although with varying degrees of success. Some respond to carefully controlled diet, others to injections of specific vitamins or intravenous gamma globulin. The conjecture surrounding the cause of this disease continues but sufferers cannot wait for the cause to be identified. They have to seek relief, and hopefully cure, wherever they think they can find it. Their desperation has yielded results. Their speculation on the nature of the disease has spurned medical orthodoxy, which in itself has often been unsympathetic to their plight. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the victims of this ailment require extensive support and understanding from their families, friends and physicians. They also need the support and understanding of the wider community in order to dispel the unfounded view that they are all hysterical hypochondriacs. Nothing could be further from the truth. They endeavour with all their might to cure themselves, aware that the very effort of doing so is likely to induce a relapse and render them even more ill than before. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that I am proposing to establish a support group for sufferers and their families in Western Australia. It will also be a source of advice and provide information on the disease to interested people in the community. A number of sufferers and non-sufferers with varying experience have indicated their willingness to be involved in such a group on a voluntary basis. I do not believe that such a support group can close its mind to areas of alternative medicine which have been shown to provide relief. Acupuncturists and naturopaths who have succeeded in assisting ME patients deserve as much credit for their endeavours as do mainstream doctors who take the time to discuss the ailment with the patient and establish a regime of treatment which suits that individual. </PARA>
<PARA> Medical and community acceptance of the disease is crucial if sufferers are to have the confidence to pursue all types of treatment. Further scientific research is also essential, but it must investigate all reasonable possibilities. For instance, there exists a growing body of opinion that chronic fatigue syndrome is the result of environmental influences which overload the body's immune system. The most commonly referred to environmental influences are agricultural chemicals. This theory tends to explain the high proportion of sufferers in small rural communities. It often is associated with the view that the initial overload of the body's immune system is followed by extreme substance sensitivity and a propensity to allergies. </PARA>
<PARA> My attention was recently drawn to an article in the Lismore Northern Star of Monday, 23 January, which said that a spokesman for a north coast ME support group wanted to contact as many sufferers and suspected sufferers as possible. The aim of the survey was to improve the group's information network on the disorder and to improve chances of recognising and treating it. The north coast has apparently been recognised by medical authorities as having an unusually high incidence of ME sufferers and research has suggested a link between the disease and the spraying of agricultural chemicals such as 2,4D. Other people have also successfully treated ME on the presumption that it is yeast based. Both these concepts have considerable support among sufferers, as does the suggestion that the illness is caused by a virus to which the body's immune system has become accustomed and consequently refuses to fight. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I have contacted many people already, I would be pleased to hear from any Australian ME support groups who wish to convey information about their organisations so that the proposed Western Australian group may benefit from their experience. The chronic fatigue syndrome is a widespread and severely debilitating illness which costs the nation unknown thousands of dollars in sickness benefit and other social security payments. More importantly, it affects people who were previously active, productive members of the community-almost always high achievers-whose contribution to society has now been curtailed. ME must be taken seriously by doctors, scientists, governments and the community at large. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I welcome the improved job situation which now exists in Australia, it is important that people such as those who have been unemployed for long periods and have lost confidence, or those who need skills training or retraining, do not miss out. They should be aware that new and varied practical Federal Government programs do exist to assist them to secure that elusive job. One such scheme is Jobtrain, which tailors short term training at tertiary and further education or private colleges to meet the actual needs of the local job market. A formal training allowance is paid to trainees and 5,500 Queenslanders will be helped by Jobtrain this year at a cost to Government of $14m. Results in the first three months of Jobtraining have been very encouraging, with about 60 per cent of graduates obtaining permanent work at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new enterprise incentive scheme-the NEIS scheme-also assists certain unemployed people to set up their own business. The jobs, education and training or JET scheme, to start in Queensland in June, is designed to meet the special job and job seeking needs of sole parents, while the Australian traineeship system and the government-employer-union managed skills training program provide additional alternatives to trade apprenticeships.

<PARA> Accordingly, I share the views of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid in asking that the 1989-90 Budget commit at least 0.4 per cent of our gross national product to overseas aid. Currently, the Department of Finance's forward estimates indicate that our foreign aid may not even remain at 0.36 per cent. To maintain that figure we need $40m extra in the next Budget and over $120m will be needed if we are to reach the 0.4 per cent target. But we must make the effort and we must, of course, also eliminate child and other poverty within Australia. But our own economic problems should not lead us to turn our backs on our fellow humans in dire circumstances which very few Australians could even contemplate, let alone experience. We once aimed at one per cent of GDP; now surely we can manage at least 0.4 per cent. </PARA>

Why should petrol be discounted in Melbourne and Sydney? Why should it go down below the wholesale price in these areas when at the same time in areas such as Hobart, for example, it is high? The point that I have been making is that if the oil companies want the Australian people to buy their petrol they should ensure that the price is fair and equitable to all people Why do all Australian taxpayers pay heavy taxes to the Prices Justification Tribunal to look after the wholesale price when the oil companies drop those prices willy-nilly to the disadvantage of the ordinary motorists of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

This decision is a most fitting recognition of the achievements of the Cuban people and comes in a year which marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Cuban revolution.

With a population of 10 million, Cuba has the same number of doctors per head of population as Australia. The massive efforts being directed to solving the housing shortage and the construction of 100 childcare centres in the past two years are just two examples of the fact that the Cuban leadership has every intention of continuing to make further improvements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recent turmoil at radio stations 3EA in Melbourne and 2EA in Sydney, which are part of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), has largely built up over a genuine concern by radio broadcasters that their independence and integrity are gravely threatened. Under the guise of making ethnic radio more professional, management has dismissed or severely restricted the duties of several high profile broadcasters. The most notorious case is that of Kathy Lancucki, a very popular and respected individual formerly with the Polish program in Melbourne. Other journalists who have suffered discriminatory action are Rena Frangiudakis, from the Greek language program, Maria Gabriella, of the Portuguese program, Poni Poselli, of the Italian program, Bob Radulowicz, from the Serbian program, and Clement Kapote, an African journalist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In all cases the reasons for dismissal or other adverse action are artificial or trivial. Mrs Lancucki's case is undoubtedly the most outrageous. With 13 years of radio experience in Polish programs behind her, Mrs Lancucki was failed by SBS in a Polish language test. SBS will not make the assessors' reports available. By all accounts, Mrs Lancucki's dismissal owes more to her failure to meet the test of political acceptability for the Left and is a deplorable departure from the accepted role of SBS in impartially serving the ethnic communities of this nation. </PARA>

At Redland Bay Gardens estate, residents were unable to get phones connected to about 20 houses simply because of a dispute between Telecom and the developer. I think it was the developer's fault, there is no question about that, but nevertheless these people were the meat in the sandwich. Following a number of representations, Telecom and a fellow by the name of Bob Bensley, who is the manager up there, did the right thing-spent the $15,600 that was necessary to put the cabling in and the phones are now about to be connected.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Madam SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) asked me a number of questions regarding the burning of an Australian flag in the forecourt on Tuesday afternoon. I inform the House that the Australian Federal Police were in attendance to enforce the law and they evidently believed that no breach of the law had occurred. I have since received advice from the Attorney-General's Department that there is no specific offence dealing with the burning of Australian flags. It would appear that the only offences available are as follows: offensive behaviour contrary to section 546a of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales in its application to the Australian Capital Territory; behaving in an offensive or disorderly manner contrary to section 12 of the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act; and malicious damage to property by fire under section 128 of the Crimes Act 1900 if it could be established that the flag was burnt without the owner's consent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the context of the above offences, offensive behaviour has been held by the courts to be conduct calculated to wound feelings, or arouse anger, resentment, disgust or outrage in the mind of a reasonable person. While I personally think that the burning of an Australian flag was offensive, the nature of any response in such circumstances must be left to the discretion of the law enforcement officers in attendance, who are always mindful of the need not to provoke confrontation or violence. However, the offences I have just detailed may be of assistance to them if there is a similar occurrence in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> On the wider question of the conduct of public demonstrations, the President and I have approved guidelines to be observed by the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service. A copy of the guidelines will be incorporated in Hansard. The guidelines provide that:</PARA>
<PARA>Demonstrations by persons or groups shall not be permitted within the area of the parliamentary precincts bounded by and including Parliament Drive.</PARA>
<PARA>The President and I will continue to be advised by the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service on any future demonstrations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his much vaunted 7/7 re-election strategy. I ask the Prime Minister: Has his attention been drawn to table No. 2 of the bulletin `Families in Taxation', released today by the independent Australian Institute of Family Studies? Is it a fact that that table conclusively demonstrates that between 1976 and 1984 all categories of household formations on average weekly earnings enjoyed significant real gains in weekly disposable income, whereas for the period 1984 to 1988-89 those same categories have sustained significant real declines in disposable incomes? If the Prime Minister has not acquainted himself with the contents of that table, will he undertake to do so? Will he also undertake to include that table in the explanation of his 7/7 re-election strategy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the fact that the report has been issued. I have not looked at it. I have not seen the table but I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that the fact that it has been issued does not divert me in any way from the comparison that I will continue to make during this year and beyond, not only on this issue but also on every relevant issue of interest to the Australian people. At an appropriate time one will be able to develop, at some considerable length, the elements that were partially involved in what the then Government did, including the giving of a tax cut which the Treasurer knew could not be afforded at that time. This is an element of the calculations to which the honourable gentleman refers. If he wants to have an analysis undertaken, which will be undertaken by us-I can assure him-throughout this year, of the total abdication of economic responsibility which characterised the Opposition's period of office, he will get it. I make the point that to measure living standards by the average earnings of only those who happen to be in employment, which is one of the consistent features that the Leader of the Opposition has followed, is taking much too narrow a view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the real disposable household income under this Government one sees that it has increased by 5 per cent. There are two simple reasons why that has increased by 5 per cent under my Government. First, we have put one and a quarter million people into employment. If honourable members opposite want the comparison, I will remind them of it again. That one and a quarter million compares with only one-quarter of that achievement by the Opposition. As well as having the achievement of an additional one and a quarter million people into employment, we have taken specific measures, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, to assist low income families. A thorough exposition was given yesterday by my colleague the Minister for Social Security. It shows that if one looks at what has been done under this Government to put money into the areas of greatest need and takes that into account with the addition of one and a quarter million people, one will understand why it is the fact that under this Government real disposable income per person has risen by 5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The point I finally make is this: the Opposition parties, in their desperate attempt to retain office and to give tax cuts that were not affordable, blew the economy apart. In their last 12 months in office, another 300,000 Australians were thrown onto the unemployment scrapheap because honourable members opposite were not prepared to undertake responsible economic policies. Of course, that contrasts with the 5 per cent increase in real household disposable income which has been undertaken within the framework of a responsible economic policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has tried to make something of what it sees as a deficiency in our schools systems. In the document that the Prime Minister has entitled `Futile Diversions', the Opposition says that 1988 is not 1948. It says that things in 1988 are not what they used to be in 1948. Indeed, they are not. Forty years ago only eight out of 100 young people were actually finishing secondary school. Ten years ago, when the Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer, we were just beginning a three-year slump in retention rates as kids deserted the school system. So I think we are entitled to be very encouraged about the fact that young people are remaining at school in such large numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the next few days we will be releasing the first ever curriculum map of Australian schools, which will provide the basis for developing a national curriculum framework which will have a distinctive Australian character in order to deal with the problems of our time. Whilst we are proceeding with these constructive measures, those opposite are trying to deceive the population about what is happening in Australian schools.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member for Herbert for his question, and it is an appropriate one in light of the way in which others on the conservative side of politics are attempting to play politics with what is a matter of fundamental importance to the Australian people. The fact is that this Government is concerned about the problem of increasing housing prices and declining housing affordability. It is a matter of very considerable concern. Let me assert that we believe that decent and affordable housing is a basic right of all Australians. As my friend and colleague the Treasurer said earlier this week in this place, an indication of our commitment to that principle is the fact that we have built over 800,000 houses since we have been in office. Having that record, however, is not making this Government complacent. We recognise that housing affordability has deteriorated, mainly because of increases in house prices. Those prices have occurred mainly because of constraints on the supply of resources to the industry, particularly housing land and in the area of skilled labour and building materials.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only constructive way of addressing the price and affordability problem is by tackling problems on the supply side. I can assure you, Madam Speaker, and the House that the Commonwealth is putting forward a number of significant initiatives at the conference tomorrow. We are announcing a major program of Commonwealth land sales for housing development. The Minister for Administrative Services will be releasing details tomorrow. Those details will amount to 27,000 blocks being released from Commonwealth land in the next five years. To give honourable members an indication of the dimension of what 27,000 blocks mean, it is equivalent to around 15 new suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear to the House and, through the House, to the people of Australia that, whatever political posturing may be conducted and engaged in by the other side, as far as the Government is concerned we are not interested in those sorts of exercises, particularly on a matter of such importance to the Australian people as this. What my colleagues and I will be seeking as we go into that meeting tomorrow will be a cooperative approach from the Premiers of this country at all levels of government to help ease the housing problem.</PARA>
<PARA> It is an indication yet again of the miserable, whingeing attitude of the Leader of the Opposition, best typified by his remarks some two or three years ago when we were having the problems of the massive swing in the terms of trade against Australia when he said gloatingly, as Australia was suffering, `The times will suit me', that again today he has come out in this politically craven way, trying to knock a conscientious attempt by this Government-and I believe it will be followed by other governments in this country-to take a constructive approach to a real problem. Real problems and their solutions are not in the domain of concern, interest or competence of the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>

When we had the tax summit in April 1983 we had a whole range of people interested in this area. If people want to use the designation of summit, so be it. I am simply saying that in the life of this Government there have been two summits. There was the April 1983 summit where we had a whole range of people involved. We had the tax summit where the same thing happened. We are now having a special Premiers Conference at which I hope, as I said before, we will receive from the Premiers of this country what I believe they will deliver-that is, a cons- tructive approach.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the capital gains tax were abolished we would see the level of savings we now have in the economy simply taken away from the productive areas of the traded goods sector, which would change our current account, and watch the pipeline of capital pump up the housing sector and make housing even more expensive than it is today as more money chased fewer and fewer homes available for sale. That would simply put home ownership outside the reach of many Australians as this kind of policy upset the neutrality we now enjoy in the Australian tax system. For nearly 30 years we have sought to get a return of strong private investment in the traded goods area of the economy to import compete and to export. That would be disturbed by simply then funnelling all of those funds into the housing sector as it was rewarded by the absence of capital gains taxation. That is what the Leader of the Opposition was arguing today. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We would abolish the capital gains tax. We are advocating a sliding scale, a five-year proposal which would meet legitimate objections.</PARA>
<PARA>I will read what the British Economist had to say recently about Mrs Thatcher's policy on capital gains tax and President Bush's policy. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> One proposal that will feature in the plans President Bush will present to Congress on 9 February is his campaign pledge to cut the top rate of the tax on capital gains from assets held for more than one year.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is a sliding scale. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bush believes the cut would increase, not reduce, revenue by encouraging people to realise gains and by stimulating new investment. The evidence for such a view is thin.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It will be hard for Mr Bush to explain why he wishes to tax capital gains at a diminished rate of 15 per cent, a break whose benefit will overwhelmingly go to the rich. It will also be hard for him to explain why he wants to reopen the Pandora's Box of special loopholes and deductions that his predecessor, Mr Reagan, took great credit for closing in 1986. But the best argument against that capital gains break is strictly free market. The tax system should be as neutral as possible between alternative economic opportunities. If capital gains nets special treatment investors will arrange their affairs so as to have capital gains instead of ordinary income.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In America before 1986 it produced tax shelters and empty office building blocks among other wasteful activities. Britain recently followed America's lead in eliminating the capital gains differential.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mrs Thatcher, who the Opposition looks to, followed our removing of the differential-</PARA>
<PARA> It would be a pity if one of Mr Bush's first acts were to undermine America's fiscal neutrality and so add to its economic inefficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, here is one of the leading European financial magazines arguing in favour of the kind of neutrality Australia now enjoys. But again, always looking for the best change to grab the worst possible policy option from the pack, the Leader of the Opposition, just as when he was Treasurer, is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. We have a decent tax system for the first time ever. We have investment going back into the traded goods sector of the economy. We are battling to turn the current account around and to get that investment. But the Opposition wants to wreck it, take it away and give all the smarties a tax free capital gain. These are all the people the Opposition thinks will run to the polling booths and vote Liberal. The Opposition will give them a tax break and tax the ordinary slaves at the ballot box. But if they are the so-called real people of commerce and if they happen to invest in office blocks or build a couple of shops, if they have really got it together, if they are entrepreneurs and if they throw a couple of shops up or put up an office block, their income is free. And if they hold it for five years they can have it for nothing. That is Liberal Party tax policy. That is what Margaret Thatcher rejected. That is what the Economist attacked Mr Bush for. Before he gets his proposals through we will find a lot of people in corporate America not copying the same policy. I urge the Opposition to start thinking about the neutrality of the tax system here. This Government has done the hard work in putting a capital gains tax into place. All the Opposition has to be is smart enough to leave it there and not dopey enough to wreck the system we have created.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the six intervening years the Government has presided over the building of 830,000 homes in this country-the better part of a million new homes. Needless to say, that was facilitated in part by the deregulation of the banking system in relation to housing lending. Instead of having the phoney position we had for years under those opposite, where people could get a loan at a regulated rate for $20,000 or $30,000, then get a second mortgage for another $30,000 or $40,000 at some much higher interest rate and then a personal loan at 18 or 19 per cent, they can now walk through the door of a bank and get the full mortgage amount at a diminished rate. After deregulated housing rates were at 15 1/2 per cent about 18 months or two years ago, we saw a record number of starts in the housing industry. While they have dropped off and come back somewhat, the main problem in housing is the price of housing. That is why the supply problem has to be sheeted home to where it belongs-the State governments, which will not release enough land, will do nothing about density levels and are quite happy to go on talking about the demand side and interest rates, as members of the Opposition do today, while ignoring the fact that there is just not enough supply at any price. That is why mortgages have gone up. I know what those people taking out mortgages would say if we asked them whether they would rather be paying a slightly higher rate on their housing interest to have their mortgage half as large. And why are mortgages this large now? It is because of the bottlenecks in housing supply in New South Wales, in Sydney in particular, and in some of the other States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If members of the Opposition were into the business of asking intelligent questions rather than trying to score the lousiest and cheapest of points, they would raise the question of housing supply and adopt some policy. But they do not. When we have a housing conference with the Premiers, all they have to say is that it is a stunt. That is their contribution. Look at the three days we have been back. They asked no questions about the economy on the first day, on the second day they were all wide of the mark, and today they cannot ask a question which is even slightly relevant. Those in the industry sectors think the people opposite are an entire joke, whether in relation to housing or the economic sectors. If they keep asking their little miserable political questions they will keep getting replies of the kind I have just given them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House will recall that in 1983 unemployment was a massive problem. The Government has first of all sought to address the income of those people who are excluded from the work force. Madam Speaker, you will know that we have not only concerned ourselves with all of those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed but also paid particular attention to families. As I pointed out yesterday, each year, despite economic circumstances, we have directed additional assistance to the children of families in the social security system, particularly the unemployed. The House will recall also that the Government-and reference has been made to the summit-has given priority to the issue of job creation. We have provided 1 1/4 million jobs. That seems to offend the right honourable member for New England. That record of providing 1 1/4 million jobs is one of the strongest records of any country over that period. Of course, as employment has increased, unemployment has fallen and the number of families, with children, on the unemployment benefit has fallen by a third since this Government came to office. In fact, the number of children in the families of the unemployed has fallen by 20,000 in the last 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the employment growth has brought about a degree of social justice and equity. It has helped tens of thousands of families and hundreds of thousands of people to achieve a better standard of living. While some people have been excluded from the work force, as I said, the Government has sought to ensure that the minimum standard of living has been improved. In our period of government there has been an increase of 8 per cent in the incomes of all unemployed people, as opposed to 2 per cent during the Opposition's period in government, when unemployment was growing so strongly. For one child families, as opposed to a decline of nearly 6 per cent in real disposable income during the period of the previous Government, there has been an 11.5 per cent increase under this Government. For families with two children, the increase in real disposable income has been of the order of 14.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> It is sometimes suggested that the Government in expressing this real concern for the unemployed has made the benefits system so attractive that it has built into that system a disincentive for people to work. This is a point often made by members of the Opposition, by people who take a conservative view. When I was speaking about the family allowance supplement yesterday I referred to poverty and a minimum standard of living. Indeed, the Institute of Family Studies described the supplement as a guaranteed minimum income for children. Of course, the other important thing about the family allowance supplement, as the Economic Planning Advisory Council pointed out in a recent report, is that it widens the gap between the level of income received by a family dependent on benefits and a family moving into the work force. It made the important point that 95 per cent of employed families would lose at least a quarter of their disposable income if their breadwinner was to become unemployed. In other words, a family allowance supplement represents a considerable--</PARA>

The allegation of 3,000 Defence houses lying vacant in New South Wales is total nonsense. The Premier's reported statement that the Commonwealth is guilty of criminal neglect could well apply much more to his policies on public housing that to this Government's. The fact is that Defence has 5,800 houses in New South Wales under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Services). Our best estimate is that about 440 of those are currently vacant. The breakdown of those 440 is that 110 are awaiting occupancy by new Services tenants; 200 are vacant pending the renegotiation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement; and 130 are vacant awaiting essential maintenance-which maintenance, by the way, is the responsibility of the New South Wales Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. First of all, there has been a lot of quite unfounded media speculation about increased difficulties faced by private health funds. So, let me just give the facts on those funds. At 30 June 1987 reserves of health funds totalled $666m. The figure a year later, at 30 June 1988, had increased to $820m-a big increase in the reserves of the private health funds in that period. While the actual operating results of health funds during 1987-88 produced a loss situation, the very substantial investment income of the funds cannot be ignored. The overall performance, if we include investment income, resulted in a surplus for all Australian health funds of $46m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also aware of reports of the financial difficulties faced by particular funds. Let me clearly point out my Department's responsibility here. Under the National Health Act my Department has a responsibility to monitor the financial operations of health funds. That Act requires that health funds shall maintain reserves equal to two months of break-even contribution income. Where a fund cannot comply with this requirement at any time, there is provision for an exemption to be granted. Such exemption is granted only under very controlled conditions and where demonstrable corrective action can be taken. If it cannot be demonstrated that a fund can, within a reasonable time, again achieve minimum reserves and profitability, action may be commenced which may lead to winding up or merger with another health fund. In any event, for this Government and my Department the interests of contributors are paramount; that is, a fund would be wound up before it reached the point of not being able to pay its benefit claim and contributors would be transferred to another fund.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member mentioned in relation to the reinsurance arrangements, the Government has confirmed the community rating principle as the most appropriate basis for health insurance. Also, the Government is finalising the development of alternative bases for the reinsurance arrangements to ensure an equitable sharing by all funds of the liability for heavy drawing contributors, which will address some of the particular problems faced by funds with large numbers of elderly contributors.</PARA>

The Treasurer's area of misrepresentation was that, by selectively quoting from the transcript of the press conference, he totally omitted to mention the central element of the claim I made, which is the fact that the existing capital gains tax does not include the family home.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wills-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Prime Minister)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to report to the House on my recent visit, between 29 January and 13 February, to the Republic of Korea (ROK), Thailand, Pakistan and India. Against the backdrop of the fundamental changes taking place in global relationships, it was fitting that this visit should take me to four countries that are not only important in their own right and important to Australia but also intimately involved in the three key points of tension in our region: the Korean Peninsula, Cambodia and Afghanistan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each of the four leaders I met-President Roh, Prime Minister Chatichai, Prime Minister Bhutto and Prime Minister Gandhi-is working actively for a lessening of regional tensions. All are leaders who have shown a preparedness to take risks in the search for peace. Each of these leaders, too, in different ways, is discharging with skill and with vision the heavy responsibility of democratic government. India is the world's largest democracy; Thailand has witnessed considerable consolidation of its democratic processes over the past decade; in the Republic of Korea, democratic processes are being actively developed; and Pakistan, after years of military rule, has happily now returned to the democratic fold. </PARA>
<PARA> In these vital respects, these four leaders deserve, and I believe receive, the respect and support of all Australians. In particular, I found that listening to Prime Minister Bhutto, her mother, her Ministers and other associates recounting their stories of personal hardship and sacrifice under the previous regime was both an apt reminder of the abuses which inevitably occur under military rule and an inspiring lesson about the capacity of a determined people to win again the dignity and liberty of democratic government. </PARA>
<PARA> My visit thus provided a timely opportunity to advance Australia's interests on a wide range of important political issues-global, regional and bilateral. Equally importantly, I saw this visit as an invaluable means of assisting Australia's commercial interests. Let me briefly explain why I see this as a significant element of my overseas visits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy over the last six years has undergone the historic, essential and overdue process of reconstruction to equip it better for the economic challenges of the world and, not least, of our own dynamic Asia-Pacific region. It is through the greater enmeshment in the region of a diversified, productive, efficient, competitive Australia that the prosperity of individual Australians will be best protected and enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> So when, in my talks with government and business leaders overseas, I have the opportunity of advancing specific commercial projects which genuinely advance this process of enmeshment, I do so. Indeed, I consciously seek to identify such opportunities. The pursuit of Australia's international commercial interests is now a major foreign policy objective. For the same reason, I am pleased to have the active involvement in my talks of senior Australian businessmen-on this visit, in the ROK and India. </PARA>
<PARA> In each of the four countries I visited, I addressed high level business forums-the Korean Business Associations, the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce and the Thai-Australia Business Council, the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the Indian-Australian Joint Business Council-and I presented the facts about the immense two-way commercial opportunities offered by our increasingly competitive Australian economy. At the same time, I placed heavy emphasis in this visit, as I have in previous visits, on protecting and advancing Australia's multilateral trading interests. </PARA>
<PARA> In my address to the Korean Business Associations on 31 January, I proposed a ministerial meeting of regional countries to explore further the possibility of creating a more formal intergovernmental vehicle of regional cooperation. I said that I saw merit in the model provided, in a different context, by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. </PARA>
<PARA> I stressed, and I am at pains to do so again today, that my support for such an institution of regional cooperation must not be interpreted as suggesting, by code words, the creation of a Pacific trading bloc. Indeed, one of the principal tasks of any such institution must be the strengthening of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to inform honourable members that, to date, the reaction of regional governments has been most encouraging. President Roh endorsed the proposal while I was in Seoul. Prime Minister Chatichai undertook to discuss the proposal with his Association of South East Asian Nations colleagues, as will Australia separately. A senior Australian official will be visiting regional countries soon to discuss the matter in more detail. It is my hope that a ministerial level meeting will be held before the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> In my Bangkok business address on 3 February, I addressed the need for a fair and workable outcome to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations-an important goal not only for the maintenance of our own and of global economic growth but also, ultimately, for the continued stability of international relations into the 1990s. It was in Bangkok in 1983 that I launched my Government's regional trade initiative. It was therefore fitting that I should choose Bangkok this time to make a major address on the multilateral trading system. I said that GATT is not dead but, if the current deadlock is not broken, then we will have moved-not to the end of GATT-but quite possibly to the beginning of the end. Responsibility most heavily rests with the European Community and the United States of America to make appropriate adjustments to the positions they so stubbornly stood by at Montreal. </PARA>
<PARA> In each of the four capitals visited, I also pursued the need for effective solutions to environmental problems which transcend national boundaries, such as the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer. I was able to outline the technology and expertise which Australia possesses in limiting the release of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere and the preparedness of Australia's Association of Fluoro-Carbon Consumers and Manufacturers to assist in transferring technologies for recycling CFCs in commercial use. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now report in turn on each of the countries I visited. </PARA>
<PARA>The Republic of Korea</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> My visit to the Republic of Korea took place some three months after President Roh's visit to Australia, thus consolidating a relationship that, in economic terms, is now among our most important. With two-way trade valued at almost $3 billion annually, the Republic of Korea in 1987-88 was Australia's seventh largest trading partner. </PARA>
<PARA> I told President Roh that Australia welcomed his constructive, open and far-sighted approach to developing relations with the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK). I was able to advise President Roh of the movement in Australia's own relations with the DPRK, a development which he encouraged when he visited Australia late last year. I told the President, as we have told Pyongyang, that we are prepared to continue our dialogue with the DPRK, but that any improvement in relations will depend on an improved atmosphere in the ROK-DPRK relationship, the international behaviour of the DPRK and the level of our confidence regarding the scope for a constructive relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> On bilateral issues, President Roh and I agreed on the need to proceed with the Joint Cultural Commission, the first meeting of which should be held in Seoul by mid-year, and an Australia-ROK Forum, to be held in Australia in October-November. Both these initiatives will contribute valuably towards developing people-to-people contacts and thus broaden and strengthen the foundations of the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> My visit provided an excellent opportunity to urge the Republic of Korea to reform further its system of special taxes and import regulations, which continues to restrict healthy and non-discriminatory trade. I welcomed the recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Economic Restructuring for accelerating the process of liberalisation and restructuring in the Republic of Korea. I invited members of the Commission to visit Australia, and, I am pleased to say, it is likely that this invitation will be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> My meeting with senior economic Ministers, which was given added stature with the presence of a number of Australian business leaders, enabled me to discuss, at first hand, the important issues of market access for Australian beef, iron ore, coal, aluminium and other exports. I told Korean Ministers that, while Australia welcomed the recent indications of the progressive reopening of their beef market, we were not happy with the current level of access and had no option but to continue to pursue the issue through the GATT in order to protect our legitimate trade interests. </PARA>
<PARA> While in Seoul I inspected the magnificent facilities built for the Games of the XXIV Olympiad. The challenge is great but I am confident that Australia, through Melbourne, will be able to put together equally impressive facilities and make a very credible bid for the 1996 Games. </PARA>
<PARA>Thailand</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the Republic of Korea, Thailand is not one of Australia's largest trading partners. I strongly believe that it should be. It is a country which is experiencing a period of sustained growth, which could well see it join the ranks of the newly industrialised economies (NIEs) over the next decade. Thailand's energy needs are increasing by over 14 per cent per annum and this, combined with the rapid expansion of its economy as a whole, offers Australia enormous opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> My discussions with Prime Minister Chatichai therefore focused on establishing a new framework for the Australia-Thai economic relationship. We agreed on the desirability of an economic cooperation agreement, a concessional finance agreement and a memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation. I expect all three agreements to be finalised over the next 12 months. It was also agreed that double taxation negotiations would be renewed, the successful conclusion of which would provide an important umbrella for Australian business to expand its involvement in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of my discussions I am confident that we will achieve our goal of a doubling of two-way trade over the next three years to $1.3 billion. The target is ambitious, but, given the 80 per cent increase since 1985, it is certainly achievable. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions with Thailand's senior economic Ministers highlighted the enormous potential for trade and investment opportunities in that country and Thailand's clear wish to see more Australian involvement in its economic future. Australian companies are well placed, for instance, to seek multi-million dollar contracts in relation to Thailand's plans for a hot- and cold-rolled steel mill, its eastern seaboard development encompassing a coal-fired power station and its proposed data processing zone, which could offer a unique opportunity for Australian joint venturers to get in at the outset of high-tech development of the Thai economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, as I said at the beginning of this report, Cambodia was a key topic of discussion in Bangkok. With developments in Sino-Soviet relations, Sino-Vietnam relations and Thai-Vietnam relations, the external environment for a settlement in Cambodia is better than at any time in the recent past. While the outcome of the recent meeting in Jakarta highlights the difficulties which still need to be resolved, it is essential that all parties make continued determined efforts to advance the peace process. This is something to which I know Prime Minister Chatichai is deeply committed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a measure of Australia's standing in the region and of the work of my Government since 1983 that Thailand wants Australia to participate in any international conference that might develop from the current process. I told Prime Minister Chatichai that Australia was prepared to play an active and constructive role in an international conference, if that was the wish of the parties more directly involved in the resolution of the conflict. As I indicated in Bangkok, it is too early yet to be definite about an Australian role in any international control mechanism, as the detail of such a mechanism is still unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will know that Prime Minister Chatichai sought Australian involvement in the design and construction of a bridge across the Mekong River to link Thailand and Laos. Not only because of its benefits for economic development, but also because of its symbolic importance in the Indo-China peace process, and because of its key role in Prime Minister Chatichai's ambition to change Indo-China from a war zone into a peace and trading zone, I agree to the undertaking, subject to the agreement of the Government of Laos and to a further feasibility study confirming the cost parameters. Laos has already reacted positively to the suggestion and our feasibility study will commence over the coming months. I am confident that the undertaking will contribute positively to an easing of tensions in the region and, at the same time, lift substantially Australia's profile in the region as a whole. The cost of the undertaking will be met from within the existing forward estimates of Australia's development assistance program. In other words, no new allocation of moneys is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> While in Thailand, I visited the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery near the River Kwai, where so many brave Australian and Allied prisoners of war were forced to work, and in many cases to die, in the most appalling circumstances. That visit served as a reminder of the lasting debt succeeding generations owe to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in war. </PARA>
<PARA> My visit to the crop substitution project outside Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, which is sponsored by His Majesty the King of Thailand, was especially appropriate, given the vital cooperation between the Australian and Thai governments in combating the drug trade. I told Prime Minister Chatichai, and I am sure this sentiment is shared by all honourable members, that Australia will continue to do everything it can to cooperate in the fight against those parasites in the drug trade who seek to gain from the misery of others. </PARA>
<PARA>Pakistan</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> My visit to Pakistan was the first by an Australian Prime Minister since 1975, when Gough Whitlam was received by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose daughter, Benazair Bhutto, is now Pakistan's newly elected Prime Minister. Her courage, determination and leadership in restoring democratic rule to Pakistan are truly remarkable. I arrived in Islamabad the day that Soviet Union Foreign Minister Shevardnadze departed. Afghanistan was therefore very much on the minds of the Pakistani leadership. I told Ms Bhutto that, in line with the Geneva Accord, Australia was concerned to see the establishment of a viable coalition Government in Kabul encompassing the different political elements, as that appeared to be the best way of minimising the prospect of Afghanistan sliding into anarchy and bloodshed. </PARA>
<PARA> Pakistan's return to democratic rule has provided a firm basis for the re-establishment of a substantive relationship between our two countries. I announced a grant of 25,000 tonnes of wheat to help alleviate an expected food shortage and the establishment of a $15m three-year development assistance program. A team of Australian officials will be visiting Pakistan soon to discuss the details of this program. As part of the mutual effort to add substance to the bilateral relationship, Prime Minister Bhutto and I agreed that we should negotiate a trade agreement and should encourage a group of senior Australian businessmen to visit Pakistan this year. Australia is already a significant exporter of coal, iron ore, wool and wheat to Pakistan and there is scope for significant expansion in areas associated with Pakistan's infrastructure development such as power stations, port facilities, pipelines, telecommunications and the dairy and sugar industries. </PARA>
<PARA>India</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> My visit to India provided an opportunity to give a significant boost to what should be one of Australia's more important bilateral relationships. While having a very solid foundation, Australia's relationship with India has not yet fulfilled its very considerable potential. When he visited here in October 1986, my good friend Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and I pledged ourselves to enhance the relationship. Since then, there have been some significant advances, especially in the development of private sector contacts through the establishment of the Joint Business Council, whose third annual meeting I addressed in New Delhi. With two-way trade at only a little over $700m, it is obvious that there is much spare capacity in the relationship and that there is a need for further efforts by both sides to turn the relationship into something more substantial. I am confident that my visit has gone a long way towards that end. During my discussions with Prime Minister Gandhi, we agreed to establish a Joint Ministerial Commission and to make a determined effort to increase the level of ministerial visits between the two countries. Details of the Joint Ministerial Commission are being discussed between officials and it is my hope that the first meeting will be held later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> While in New Delhi, Prime Minister Gandhi and I witnessed the signing of four memoranda of understanding (MOU) covering telecommunications, railways, monsoon meteorology and concessional finance. These indicate the diversity of opportunities that exist in our relationship. In particular, the MOU on concessional finance will provide a firm basis for Australian firms to pursue with confidence large contract negotiations in India. Likewise, the decision to make a renewed commitment to the negotiation of a double taxation agreement will give confidence to Australian business to seek further involvement in India's economic development.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware of the negotiations which have been in train for some time in connection with the Piparwar project, involving the development of a large scale open cut coal mine. I am very pleased to report that these negotiations are now in their final stages and are expected to be concluded very soon. This project, worth more than $200m, will provide a significant boost to Australia's profile in India and will demonstrate, in the best possible way, our capacity to compete internationally for large scale projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Prime Minister Gandhi welcomed my advice that Australia was embarking on a significant enhancement of its development cooperation program in India-a $35m program over three years beginning in 1990-91. Details of the program are being followed up in discussions between officials. Matching Indian needs and priorities with Australian expertise; this program will undoubtedly contribute significantly to an enhancement of the overall bilateral economic relationship. As with the Mekong River Bridge and the assistance package I announced in Islamabad, this expenditure will be within existing forward estimates and will not involve expenditure outside budget. On international developments, my discussions with Prime Minister Gandhi centred on broader global issues, the Commonwealth and South Africa. I was especially pleased to hear from Mr Gandhi the successful outcome of his recent visit to Beijing. As I commented during our discussions, a stable and improving relationship between China and India will contribute significantly to a lowering of tensions within the wider region. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of Australia's global and regional disarmament interests, perhaps the most significant question I pursued during my visit was that relating to the threat of nuclear proliferation in South Asia. In my discussions with both Prime Minister Bhutto and Prime Minister Gandhi, I welcomed their recent meeting and signing of an agreement not to attack each other's nuclear facilities. I encouraged them to continue the search for further confidence building measures. I took every opportunity, in both my private talks and in my public statements-including most significantly when I delivered the Third Indira Gandhi Memorial Lecture in New Delhi on 10 February-to stress the importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is an issue on which we have a different approach from both India and Pakistan, and I saw no purpose to be served by down-playing or minimising that difference. On the contrary, Australia will always speak clearly and forcefully on this crucial issue. The crux of my message was that it would be a great tragedy if, at the very time that the superpowers are negotiating a reduction in their arsenals, the spectre of nuclear proliferation should be raised menacingly in our own region. </PARA>
<PARA> While in New Delhi, I also discussed with Mr Gandhi the question of India's naval build-up. I told Mr Gandhi that the issue had aroused some interest in Australia and that, while the Australian Government did not see it as a threat, the Government nonetheless would continue to monitor developments and consult with India on them. I said that Australia had a legitimate interest in any increase in power projection capability in the region. Mr Gandhi assured me that he was committed to a lowering of tensions with Pakistan-a sentiment mirrored in Islamabad by Prime Minister Bhutto-and that, consistent with this, it was his wish to reduce defence expenditure as a percentage of gross national product. The development of a more constructive relationship between India and Pakistan would, undoubtedly, contribute significantly to a lowering of tensions in South Asia and the wider region. As a result of my talks in New Delhi and Islamabad, there are to be regular bilateral disarmament talks at senior officials level. It is my hope that the first round of such talks will be held before the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> I also discussed in Islamabad and New Delhi the question of Pakistan's re-entry into the Commonwealth. Mr Gandhi confirmed that India would welcome Pakistan's return and agreed with my suggestion that every effort should be made to complete the process in time for Pakistan to participate fully at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kuala Lumpur. Since my return to Canberra I have spoken by telephone to Commonwealth Secretary-General Ramphal, who is equally keen to see Pakistan's return. It is my sincere hope, and one which I am sure is shared by all honourable members that, come October, Prime Minister Bhutto will be able to take up once again Pakistan's seat at Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record my sincere thanks for the very warm and generous hospitality shown to me and my party in each of the four countries I visited. As is obvious from this report, my visit to the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Pakistan and India was undertaken to advance specific and concrete Australian interests. Measured against that yardstick the visit was an undoubted success and one which demonstrated Australia's continuing high standing in the region. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) concerning his visit to Asia. The Opposition has welcomed the regular practice of the Prime Minister in giving, as soon as possible after undertaking an overseas visit, a detailed report to the Parliament. It is a proper part of the government and parliamentary process and it enables the Opposition to respond to a statement in the proper parliamentary fashion. I shall not draw any analogies with other practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is much in this statement that I support and I know that my colleagues support. I particularly endorse the Prime Minister's welcoming remarks regarding Pakistan rejoining the Commonwealth. The unfortunate events surrounding the Indian subcontinent war between India and Pakistan and the emergence of an independent Bangladesh in 1971 led to Pakistan's withdrawal from the Commonwealth. It has always seemed to me, as I know it has to many on this side of the House, that that was a regrettable development, and I totally share the welcoming words of the Prime Minister towards Pakistan rejoining the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am talking about Pakistan, I also join the Prime Minister in the remarks he made about Ms Bhutto. There is something particularly poignant and appealing, if I can put it that way, when a former head of government of a country is convicted in dubious legal circumstances and then hanged, his daughter and family suffer exile, and his daughter returns and wins a democratic election. Whatever one's politics and whatever one's views about the circumstances surrounding Ali Bhutto's fall from power, Ms Bhutto's rise to the prime ministership of her country is something that I know has struck a particular chord with many millions of people around the world and particularly in the Asia-Pacific area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister was right both during his trip and on his return to Parliament to dwell upon the economic links between Australia and South Korea and Australia and Thailand. No country in the Asian area in recent years has had as impressive a growth rate as Thailand. Thailand is a classic example of how a relatively free market approach to economic development, as opposed to the stagnant, planned economy approaches which have been more beloved on the Indian subcontinent, has proved to be successful. Thailand's economic performance over the past few years is something that most countries in this region could learn a great deal from. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome, as does the Prime Minister, the emergence of a greater sense of parliamentary democracy in South Korea. The coalition welcomes very much the fostering of the democratic process and the reforms that are now under way in the Republic of Korea. South Korea has set an example of prosperity which is undoubtedly the envy of the communist neighbours. In relation to South Korea, the Prime Minister may have referred to the remarks of Admiral Hardisty when he emphasised recently the importance of continued deployment of United States forces in that area. I think it serves us all well in the hype which surrounds the changes in the Soviet leadership to remind ourselves that there has been a steady build-up of Soviet military and strategic presence in our part of the world. The strengthening in strategic importance to the Soviet Union of the naval base at Cam Ranh Bay sits a little uneasily with some of the public relations emanations from the Soviet Union and from those in the West who would spend their time apologising. I do not say that in any way to diminish the importance of Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Soviet Union and the changes that he is undertaking, but simply to put those in a proper perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> There are only two other matters of a general kind to which I want to refer. I do not think any debate about this region of the world and about a visit of this kind by the Prime Minister would be complete without some reference to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan and the enormous human tragedy of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the nine-year war. I regret that the Prime Minister did not have more to say about this in his speech, because three million to four million refugees were thrown upon the hapless Pakistanis and more than one million Afghans were killed. The nature and the brutality of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan has, in my view, gone disgracefully unmarked in too many areas of the Western world. We have been a little too hasty in our embracing of the spirit of perestroika and glasnost and in the process we have overlooked the criminal and inhumane nature of what the Soviet Union did to that poor unfortunate country, Afghanistan. Whilst I, along with everybody else, welcome the fact that that war has finally come to an end and the fact that the Soviet Union has been taught a military lesson I hope she never forgets, I hope that the Western world and those who care about human freedom-and we hear a lot about human freedom from the other side of the Parliament-pause for a moment to reflect on the enormous suffering that was imposed upon the people of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in his visit overseas quite properly emphasised the desirability of developing economic links between Australia and the Pacific Basin area. I join him in saying that our economic future lies heavily but not exclusively with the countries of the Pacific Basin area. Our own Future Directions blueprint, which has attracted so much interest not only on our side of the House but also on the Government side, contains on page 103 a very fulsome reference to the Pacific Basin, our own doorstep. In that document we emphasise the following:</PARA>
<PARA>The strengthening of our ties with the open economies of the Pacific Basin is of great importance to Australia's future. Looked at as a whole (despite the great divergences of history, culture, geographic locations and social and political systems that exist in the developed countries of the Pacific Basin) common interests in international stability, in the economics of the market system, in outlets for their goods and services, and their general although varying support for democratic values and processes provide a foundation for closer economic and political links. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Prime Minister's views are consonant with that statement of principle in Future Directions, then let me say to him very genuinely that he will have our full support in pursuing the expansion of economic and commercial links with the countries of the Pacific Basin area. It is important to our future and we welcome the emphasis that the Prime Minister has placed upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to do one other thing in relation to Thailand; that is, to record the respect and the admiration of the Opposition parties for the enormous burden that Thailand has carried in relation to refugees from Cambodia. Many, including myself, from the Opposition, as I know from the Government, have had the opportunity to visit the border camps on the Thai-Cambodian border. We have observed the extraordinary job done by the United Nations agencies and also the extraordinary burden carried by the Thai people. I can only say to the House, and I am sure I echo everybody's sentiments, that I look forward to the day when a free, independent Cambodia is restored: a free, independent Cambodia not subject to the occupation of the Vietnamese forces; a free, independent Cambodia that can never again fall under the long shadow of the Khmer Rouge; a free, independent Cambodia that can be part of the Asian community. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have been subjected to a little political nostalgia from the other side of the House in recent days, I observe that, as many will recall, one of the first governments in the world to diplomatically embrace communist Cambodia in the 1970s was the government of the party of which the present Prime Minister was then the National President. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish on a general note. I want to express my appreciation of the fact that the Prime Minister's speech included no reference to the issue of Asian immigration. I say that quite deliberately because in the weeks leading up to the Prime Minister's visit there were many references by him to the alleged deleterious impact on our relations with Asia of the so-called immigration debate which I and others, according to him, had allegedly commenced. For example, the Australian of 15 November 1988 quoted the Prime Minister as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The immigration debate started by the Opposition could cost Australia $350m a year in lost business investment, the Prime Minister said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke said this figure represented about 30 per cent of the $1.1 billion brought into Australia annually by Asian business migrants. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The so-called immigration debate has done more damage to Australia's image and influence in Asia than any single event in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the words of the Prime Minister of Australia. They were the words of a man who spent months trying to hang on me and trying to hang on my Party and on the National Party responsibility for allegedly damaging our relations with South East Asia. It was a shameful exercise in political point-scoring of the worst order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister is very good whenever someone agrees with him. He sits there and laps it up like a faithful little puppy. Yet if someone says anything that is critical of him he rears his head and gets very angry. I know the Prime Minister is sensitive. Of course, the reason that the Prime Minister is sensitive about this is that three days after he returned from Asia he was blown out of the water by his own Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray. Senator Robert Ray, speaking in Hong Kong, was reported in the Melbourne Herald as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Nothing major had shown up in official statistics on applications for business immigration six months after the Opposition Leader, Mr Howard, took his controversial stand on Asian immigration. </PARA>
<PARA>Every single Australian concerned genuinely about our relations with Asia and also concerned genuinely with the right of the Australian people, without fear or intimidation, to have an internal debate about the internal policies and the immigration policies of this country ought to listen to this. Significantly, the report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The admission contradicts claims by the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, that the row could cost Australia at least $350m a year in lost investments by rich immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA>There are the words not of John Howard or of anybody else on our side; they are the words of Senator Robert Ray. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Even if there were some drop-off, it is not essential to assume it is to do with some debate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the words of Senator Ray in Hong Kong. He was giving the lie and he was blowing the ground from underneath the Prime Minister in his quite disgraceful attempt to have me and others in my Party hung with the alleged responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it clear again. To borrow a phrase from the then Leader of the Opposition in 1983, let me make it clear beyond all reasonable doubt and even beyond the powers of misrepresentation by the members of the Australian Labor Party that we on this side of the House believe that the Australian people have an unfettered right to debate the internal policies and the immigration policies of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing in the immigration policies of the Liberal and National parties that the people of the Asian-Pacific region will, should or can reasonably find offensive. That is the fact. We have a prouder record than the Labor Party in welcoming refugees from South East Asia. It was the Government of Fraser and others, of which I was a member, that took people from war-torn Indo-China. It was the Government of Whitlam that turned its back on them. It was the then leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions-the man who is now Prime Minister-who, in 1977, sought to take advantage of the natural concern amongst many Australian workers that large numbers of people were arriving in a disorganised, indigestible fashion on to Australian shores. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), as immigration Minister, was trying to grapple with that. He got no help at all from many people in the Labor movement. Let us have none of this hand-wringing moral cant and hypocrisy from the Government on this particular issue. I speak strongly about this; I do not speak hypocritically. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister is the hypocrite on this issue. He was a hypocrite in 1977. He has been prepared to play fast and loose with Australia's interests in South East Asia by deliberately misrepresenting my position and deliberately misrepresenting the impact of things that have been said in Australia. He has been exposed for the hypocrite he is by his own Minister for Immigration. If he wants any authority on the subject-leaving aside whether there is anybody on this side of the House he will accept because he will not as he is so blinded on it-he has his own Minister for Immigration, who has blown him out of the water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take the opportunity of saying in this debate in this House to these four very important countries with which we have relations that the next government of this country, led by me, will have relations with those countries of an economic and political kind which will be deeper, better and, in diplomatic, economic and political terms, more productive of the kind of community in our part of the world that a government of our philosophy will work towards. As I said at the commencement of my speech, there is much in what the Prime Minister has said not only here but also overseas that I agree with. I have always taken the attitude that we ought to have a bit of bipartisanship in international relations. If one looks at my record as Leader of the Opposition, one will see that I have demonstrated that repeatedly. In relation to the Asian immigration issue the Prime Minister played fast and loose with Australia's national interest. If he talks about hypocrisy, he has been revealed as the hypocrite-by none other than the number cruncher from Melbourne, Senator Robert Ray, the Minister responsible for immigration in his own Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before moving on to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), I have to address the comments from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) regarding the immigration debate. It is an incredible situation: he moves into this House and raises this question and then acts like the little boy who lights the fire and runs out of the room only to see the house burn down, and then protests at that occurrence. It was the Opposition, through the Leader of the Opposition, that went down that track. It was Senator Ray in the Senate yesterday who repudiated everything the Leader of the Opposition has just said. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition has not quite caught up with what has been happening. Senator Ray in the Senate yesterday confirmed that there had been a drop in business migration by over 2,000, representing $350m to this country-mostly to do with the immigration debate started and fuelled by the Leader of the Opposition. The more than 2,000 drop-offs can be attributed mainly to the Asian business migration debate that was started and fuelled by the other side of politics. Other factors have come into it, such as competition from New Zealand and Canada. Senator Ray went through a number of reasons, but he stated at the top of the list the Asian immigration debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Prime Minister did not mention it in his speech today, it was a topic he mentioned throughout his trip in speeches in Korea and Thailand. In Seoul and Bangkok the Prime Minister mentioned quite explicitly the immigration debate. He said that Australia was not about to go back down the white Australia policy track under this Government. Who knows what would happen under a Howard government. The Leader of the Opposition is saying that he would have a biased immigration policy aimed directly-no matter how he says it-at excluding Asian people. That is why over the last 12 months we have seen a decline, an expected drop-off, of 2,000 in the number of business migrants for 1988-89. That confirms the predicted loss of some $350m for Australia this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members should not come in here like the little boy who started a fire and who, when the place burnt down, protested heatedly. They started this debate. They have the biased policy on Asian immigration. They are the ones who got all the nuts and the ratbags worked up in the community. Sure, they have always been there-and unfortunately there always will be a few-but both sides of politics should act responsibly to ensure that those extremists, even though they are a minority, do not gain any credence. This debate, as it has been seen around Australia, has not done the Opposition any credit at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us return to the Prime Minister's speech. It is a speech of great importance in the sense that for once a Prime Minister's statement, a foreign relations statement, in this House has centred mainly on economic and trade matters, very important concerns for Australia which, again, those opposite did nothing about in three decades in government. They did nothing about restructuring Australia's economy, about restructuring industry and trade, or about freeing up trade and the economy to make Australia more competitive so that we can operate in a competitive environment instead of bashing our heads against tariff walls not only in Australia but elsewhere. There has been some movement in the trade area in the last few days. The Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy), who has done a marvellous job in that portfolio, announced in the last few days that the Americans appear to be willing to move somewhat in their very restrictive policy on trade, vis-a-vis the European Community. Hopefully this is a sign that the new Administration under President Bush will pursue different policies in the trade area. That will do well for Australia and for the world. The Prime Minister commented at length on economic matters and on Australia's trade relations with the countries he visited. He said in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian economy over the last six years has undergone the historic, essential and overdue process of reconstruction-</PARA>
<PARA>That has been done by this Government, not a Howard government. As the Prime Minister said, it was well overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister also talked about a regional body that may be similar in model to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. I think that is another very good initiative that the Australian Government, through the Prime Minister, has taken, and it has received a very good response. It is not, as some parts of the media have said, a trading bloc. It has nothing to do with that. I find it quite remarkable that the media went down that track when, in announcing the initiative overseas, the Prime Minister made several references to the fact that it was not a trading bloc. Somehow the media in this country chooses to print some things and completely ignores other lines that the Prime Minister clearly stated in his speech. It is not a trading bloc. It is an intergovernmental vehicle of a regional cooperative body. A lot of water has to flow under the bridge and many discussions have to take place between governments and officials. From the reception we have had so far, I am sure that something very positive will come from the Prime Minister's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, trade and business contacts with the countries the Prime Minister visited are very important. Leaving aside Korea for the moment, Australia can do much more to develop trade with Thailand, Pakistan and India. Thailand is growing rapidly. Two-way trade between Australia and Thailand is still relatively small. It amounts to less than $1 billion compared to the trade with Korea, for example, which amounts to $3 billion. Much needs to be done. The Thai-Australia Business Council and the Thai-Australian Chamber of Commerce are two avenues through which Australian businesses can move into Thailand to set up ventures, either singularly or jointly with the Thais, across a range of industries. I hope that will continue. A trip such as the Prime Minister's will assist that area a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition made some very good points regarding the coming to power in Pakistan of Prime Minister Bhutto, the daughter of the former Prime Minister who was hanged some years ago by the then dictator, Zia. It is amazing how events turn around the world. She is a remarkable woman. She has withstood the test of her father's hanging, of exile, of harassment. Yet the circumstances prevailed in which she was able to come back and win a free and democratic election. We wish her well. She has brought Pakistan back to democracy. I am also pleased that hopefully we will see Pakistan return to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth does have much to offer. I know that there are probably varying viewpoints about that in this chamber but I am a great believer in what the Commonwealth has to offer. We wish Prime Minister Bhutto and Pakistan well. In announcing the $15m aid program that Australia will give to Pakistan the Prime Minister also stated that he hoped we would increase business contacts. He hoped that there would be a number of business people visiting Pakistan later this year to look at business ventures that we could assist with in Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA> It is surprising that the two-way trade with India is only $700m. It is relatively small-very small, when we look at the size of India. That underlies the Prime Minister's statement that it really is a relationship that has not fulfilled its total promise yet. There is much water to go under that particular bridge. I met Prime Minister Gandhi a couple of years ago when he was in Australia. He impressed me more than any other leader I have met. He is a very still person with great presence. I wish him well in building India into the economic power that I am sure it will be in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Prime Minister raised the defence issue-the naval build-up. It is of concern to many Australians. As the Prime Minister pointed out, the answers were satisfactory but the legitimate concerns of Australia were put forward. Of course, we will continue to monitor them on behalf of the people here and the people in the region who share similar concerns. It is interesting to note that since we came to government in 1983 there has been an immense amount of political work done by this Government, mainly through the former Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden, in the region with the Kampuchea political issue, his numerous visits to Vietnam, Thailand, the Asian subcontinent generally and the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is as a fallout of that the Prime Minister's remarks are so aptly and very true, especially his final line when he said, `The visit was an undoubted success and one which demonstrated Australia's continuing high standing in the region'. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember standing up in this House in a debate about five years ago after we had a little problem when the Singaporeans decided to have a go at us because we refused to yield on a particular issue at that time. The Opposition thought differently but then again the Opposition has always given in. Whilst there was a little patchy period about five years ago the situation has developed where Australia has gained the respect from the ASEAN countries and the countries in the Asian subcontinent region as a country which has policies and which is willing to stand up and say what it thinks. It is a little like our relationship with the United States of America. To be good friends we also need to speak our minds. A good friend and strong ally should be able to take our comments constructively. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud the Prime Minister's speech. His trip, for a whole range of reasons-economic, trade, general business and foreign relations reasons-was an outstanding success. The countries he visited were targeted quite specifically. I applaud his practice of coming to this House and reporting to the Parliament, as I believe all Prime Ministers should do after such important events. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in welcoming the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the opportunity to speak to that statement and the Prime Minister's newly acquired interest in important countries in our region. It is better to have acquired that interest recently than not at all. I will confine myself to what the Prime Minister had to say because, after the comments of the last speaker, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles), I can only say that that honourable member has no credit in this House. He has no support from his own Party; he will be leaving this House and will be missed by no-one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all I wish to say one or two things about the four countries the Prime Minister visited-India, Pakistan, Thailand and the Republic of Korea. Of India the Prime Minister says that it is one of Australia's most important bilateral relationships. That is a statement of the obvious. India is the most populous democracy in the world. It is well on its way to being the most populous country of the twenty-first century. It is a member of the Commonwealth. We have a long and close relationship with that country. Unfortunately, our relations with this important country, which is going to be a major power in the twenty-first century and which is the major littoral sea power in the Indian Ocean, have been marked until recent times by conspicuous neglect. I remind the House that the previous Foreign Minister held his tenure for 5 1/2 years. That flying dutchman of Foreign Ministers managed to spend some 500 days travelling the world. Yet India scored only one official visit from him and that was in May 1985. To make Australia's lack of interest in India unmistakable, during Mr Hayden's tenure there was only one other official Hawke Government Minister to visit India. That was Mr Dawkins in 1985, the only other one in 5 1/2 years since the Prime Minister's visit in 1983 which was undertaken so that the Prime Minister could attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. We are glad to see this interest in India, late though it is, even though our treatment of India has been marked by conspicuous neglect, even though we have done such things as withdraw our defence attache from India and cease funding India's military participation in the joint services staff college and, incidentally, cut aid to India. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech the Prime Minister made a very important point concerning the $35m development program that Australia is undertaking. I remind the House that official development aid to India declined during the Hayden years. It was $3.4m in 1984-85 and dropped to $2.72m in 1987-88. The increase of $35m provokes the thought that aid allocations are determined by the Prime Minister's travel plans but whether they are or not it is good that we are showing this increased interest in India. We warmly welcome the Prime Minister's trip to India. </PARA>
<PARA> Pakistan is an ex-Commonwealth country. I too hope that Pakistan rejoins the Commonwealth. We welcome the improvement of relations between Pakistan and India of recent times. It would be an historic occasion if India were to move for Pakistan to rejoin the Commonwealth. We should remember, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, that Pakistan has borne the brunt of the refugee problem that was occasioned by the 10-year war, the war brought about by the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. Thailand, of course, is a growing economic power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member points out, it is a dynamic country. It now has a rate of growth of 9 to 10 per cent per annum. It has also borne the brunt of another refugee problem-the refugees who have fled from Cambodia to take refuge from the Khmer Rouge, and who have fled from Cambodia to take refuge from the Vietnamese occupying power. This has caused a massive border problem for Thailand and is one that we need to understand, untouched as we are by such problems. South Korea is a country whose pace of development we can only envy. We can hope that Australia might be able to achieve the kind of reconstruction and success that South Korea has achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That having been said, let me touch on a few issues that the Prime Minister has hardly addressed-issues which I believe are central to our region. I refer first to Cambodia. The Prime Minister spoke of the meeting which has just taken place in Jakarta and said that Australia was, as it were, willing to play its part. He spoke of the international control mechanism foreshadowed for the purpose of bringing about a peaceful reconstruction of civilian representative government in that country, but he said the details are still unknown. Let me remind the House that there has just been a meeting in Jakarta of the various Cambodian factions. This has brought about no resolution of the Cambodian issue. There is a meeting scheduled for June, yet reportedly as the result of international pressure and the parlous state of its own economy the Vietnamese forces are to move out by September of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The question which the Prime Minister and this Government have not addressed is how the Khmer Rouge is to be kept from plunging Cambodia into civil war. How is it to be kept from regaining power by force? There are up to 40,000 well-armed, highly disciplined and well-organised troops in the Khmer Rouge ranks. It amounts to the most formidable fighting force outside of the occupying power, Vietnam itself. Yet we have not addressed this central issue: How do we achieve a peaceful transition back to democratic representative government and save the Cambodian people and the region from the tragedy of a resurgent Khmer Rouge?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy is plain. We believe that the priorities in this area are: securing complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia; preventing the seizure of power by the Khmer Rouge and excluding it from a future role in Cambodia's government; democracy and self-determination for the Khmer people; and a program of economic reconstruction for Cambodia once satisfactory change is under way. I welcome the Prime Minister's expression of concern, but generalities are no answer. The specific issue has to be addressed: How is the Khmer Rouge to be caged?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me move on to a separate issue, Afghanistan. We know of the suffering that the Afghan people have endured: one million or more dead; five million or more refugees. Reconstruction is an immense project. We must help construct a democratic base and help the formation of a truly representative government in Afghanistan which can then address the immense problems that afflict that country-for one, the resettlement of refugees from Pakistan and from Iran. That is an immense project in itself. Let us remember that the Soviet Union departed Afghanistan because of the resistance of the Afghan people, because they were willing to die in scores, hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands to secure freedom in their country and get rid of the Soviet troops-and because, incidentally, some Western countries had the courage to support them and to provide for them the means to resist the Soviet Union. That was an exercise in which we did not involve ourselves because under this Government, no doubt, we would consider that to be far too impure and something which was wrong. Wrong? If that kind of help had not come from the West, if some countries had not stood strongly for the people in Afghanistan-something this Government notably failed to do-where would the people of Afghanistan be now? Where would the Soviet troops be? They would still be there. </PARA>
<PARA> The next general issue I want to speak about and which the Prime Minister did not touch on is the subject of debt. It is a fitting irony that the Prime Minister went to the Republic of Korea. That country is a major international creditor with vast reserves. Under the tenure of the Hawke Government Australia has become a major international debtor. In June 1983, a few months into the Hawke Government's tenure, our gross overseas debt stood at $35.5 billion. It is now $120 billion and we are adding to it at a rate of $1 billion to $1 1/2 billion a month. This is not simply an accounting figure; it represents the reality of our diminished economic sovereignty. We have no choice but to accept foreign capital; no choice but to accept inflows on almost any terms because under the policies of this Government we have pawned our economic sovereignty. The Prime Minister, having been overseas, comes back and reports to this House that an historic, essential and overdue process of reconstruction has been undertaken by this Government. Effectively he is telling us that everything is all right. We do not need another such reconstruction, because if we had such a reconstruction again our economy would be utterly destroyed. As it is, a prime objective of commercial, foreign and economic policy must be to move this country out of the pawn shop that it now finds itself in. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I would like to say a few words on the appalling and very human problem of refugees. The Liberal and National parties, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, have a proud record in welcoming refugees to this country, and we will continue to do so. We have made that plain again and again. This applies to refugees from Cambodia, refugees on the border in Thailand, and boat people who have crossed the water to find a haven. The estimate is that about half the people having undertaken that kind of a trip have been killed, have died or have drowned. We have also the refugees from Afghanistan and the refugees from Vietnam. These people, millions of them, are a human problem, and how we address that issue tells us a great deal about the sort of people we are. There must be certain rules that guide our approach. We should hope that they will be able to return to their countries once peaceful governments have been restored. We would help that process of resettlement but we would never agree to the notion of forced repatriation under the guise of resettlement. Refugees are not simply an international problem; they are a regional problem. As a country in the region, it is our duty to give a lead on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that most thinking people in Australia-that would exclude some journalists on the Australian Financial Review-regard the Federal Government's housing summit to be held tomorrow as nothing more than an empty political stunt-the sort of political stunt to which we have become so used over the last six or so years of the Hawke Government. First of all, it introduces a whole lot of policies. The policies create chaos. The chaos creates a political problem for the Government, and the political problem is always solved by the introduction of a political stunt. Here we have precisely that situation with the housing crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, there is a housing crisis. That is something that it has taken months and months for the Government to recognise. I expect it is only its opinion polling that has eventually drawn it to its attention. The Government ought to know by now that home affordability in Australia is at its lowest level since records were kept. Even if one goes right back to 1900, to just before Sir Edmund Barton became the first Prime Minister of Australia, one will see that throughout that period home ownership has been more affordable than it is today. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes income as a percentage of the amount one needs to purchase a home, today one needs to use about 30.8 per cent of household income to purchase a home compared with 19.2 per cent when the Hawke Government first came to power. If one looks at the effect of interest rates, which is something the Government wishes to deny has an effect, one can see that the two percentage point increase in interest rates over the last nine or so months has excluded about 180,000 young Australians from home ownership-home ownership which would otherwise have been available to them had it not been for that two percentage point increase in home loan interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has regarded all of this as something of a joke. It has denied for months that it is a political problem. Towards the end of last year, when we on this side of the House were drawing the attention of the community to the housing crisis, Senator Walsh, who so often reveals so much to the Australian community about the thinking of the Government, went around saying that it was `just a beat-up by real estate agents'. Senator Walsh and Senator Button were running around the country claiming that the cost of buying a home was no more expensive than it had been at any time in the past. In other words, they were utterly determined to do absolutely nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> When it came to the issue of whether there should be a housing summit, which was raised soon after these particular and offensive comments by Senator Walsh and Senator Button, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was denying that there was a housing crisis. On 19 January he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There was no purpose in holding a housing summit. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of those so many quotes that just keep coming back to haunt the Prime Minister. He says one thing and a few weeks later he does another thing, or something else happens. What happened here was that the consumer price index figures came out. We all know that those figures were utterly appalling. They even shocked the Treasurer (Mr Keating). They were the worst figures for a very long time. What happened then was that the Treasurer got onto the telephone that very morning and rang the Prime Minister, who at the time was in, I think, South Korea, and said, `We have a terrible political problem here. Suddenly we have decided that there is a housing crisis because it is pushing up inflation. How about having a summit?'. I expect the Prime Minister turned around and said, `But, look; on 19 January I said there was no purpose in holding a summit'. One can imagine the Treasurer saying, `Please, Bob, let's have a summit. We have to divert the political flak. We are being crucified out there in the suburbs'. The Prime Minister would have said, `All right, Paul. I have told plenty of porkies before. This one will not particularly matter. Everybody will forget about it'. </PARA>
<PARA> So, having said that a summit was not needed, they decided to hold this summit. But they decided-this was quite cute really-that the only subjects to be discussed on the agenda of the summit would be those relating to land supply. Of course, as we all know, it is the State governments which are responsible overwhelmingly for land supply. So the Federal Government could say, `You see, the housing crisis is not our fault; it is all the fault of the States'. Of course, that argument is manifestly false. If one looks at the graph of the effects of various factors on home affordability, one sees that one of the most substantial impacts has come from interest rates. Yet the issue of home loan interest rates is excluded from the agenda of the summit. It is one of the most important factors, but it is excluded from the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor is the capital gains tax. We have been arguing for years, since 1985, that the capital gains tax would force up housing prices. Of course, incredibly, the Government denies this. In any case, the capital gains tax is excluded altogether from the agenda of the summit; so is the issue of the reason for the low level of savings. All those things are excluded from the agenda of the summit. That does not please the Premiers-I mean all the Premiers; not just the coalition Premiers-because the Premiers know the truth. They know that interest rates, the capital gains tax, the low level of savings and the Government's housing policies, as well as the land supply issues, are very much responsible for the housing crisis. They have called for the agenda of the summit to be broadened. Who has called for it? Mr Greiner has, and so has Premier Gray from Tasmania. But so has the President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Bannon, the Premier of South Australia. He told the Prime Minister that it was `unreal' for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to believe they could ignore at next Friday's housing summit the question of home loan interest rate relief. </PARA>
<PARA> So even Mr Bannon knows that what the Government is doing by just laying all the blame on land supply is simply playing politics; it is ignoring the real issues at stake here. The Prime Minister tacitly admits that. In the last few days he wrote a letter to the Premier of New South Wales. The Premier had written to the Prime Minister saying, `How about broadening the agenda to include a few issues of importance to the housing crisis-not just land supply?'. In his reply the Prime Minister said, `The matters you have raised are important and will need to receive the attention of Commonwealth and State governments'. That is just hidden there in the letter in the hope that not many people will find out that this is what the Prime Minister's true thinking is. These issues which are important are not to be discussed even though they have enormous implications for the States. The reason they are not being discussed is that the summit is a political stunt designed solely to blame the States or anyone else for the housing crisis and to deflect blame from the Labor Government here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) agrees with the argument that the cause of the housing crisis is not just land supply. He told the AM program on 7 February, when asked whether planning and land supply was the only reason why the poor person is being cut out of the market:</PARA>
<PARA> Well no, of course it is not . . . </PARA>
<PARA>How right he is; of course it is not. But it proves again that the summit is a stunt because none of those other issues are going to be included at the summit. Interestingly, the Minister for Social Security also concedes the point that we on this side of the House have been making that the housing prices caused by the Government's housing policy are creating two Australias: one Australia for those who are lucky enough to have bought houses before the Hawke Government came to power and the other Australia for the younger people who have come to maturity only since this Government has been in power and who have been excluded from home ownership almost totally-the rental society which has been born and bred by the Hawke Labor Government. The Minister for Social Security said in an interview on AM on 7 February 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, I think that we're going to have created much greater inequality than we've perhaps had in Australian cities before. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Hawke's Government's record he is talking about. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> I think that that's really what's occurring . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So there it is: the Minister for Social Security in a moment of candour tells us precisely what is going on-that this Government's housing policies and attitudes to housing are creating those two very divided Australias. But guess who has got a great excuse? None other than the Treasurer, the absolute master of excuses and blame. It is never his fault. Everything he does is perfect. He is never responsible for anything. And guess who he is blaming now for the housing crisis? Is it his Government? Is it the State Premiers? It is none of those people; it is the home owner. It is the home owner who has caused the housing crisis. The Treasurer was reported in the Age newspaper of 2 February as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the person ``in a house with a block of land, with the backyard swimming pool, the rotary hoist, the ground in front . . . They're the people who are driving up the house prices . . . not governments . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the Treasurer thinks home owners are the cause of the housing crisis. The point should always be made in the context of the Treasurer that vacant housing is a problem in Sydney. There is a vacant house in Roslyn Gardens in Elizabeth Bay, and perhaps that house ought to be occupied at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is grossly responsible for the housing crisis and it is grossly irresponsible in refusing to discuss with the Premiers a number of broader issues beyond those which have been put down on the agenda. Interest rates are a major cause of the housing crisis, and they are likely to rise further. The capital gains tax is a major cause of the housing crisis. That is why the investment at the moment in alterations and additions to houses is the highest that it has been since those statistics have been kept. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout all of this, through rising prices and rising home loan interest rates, the Government has cut back support for low income people trying to buy their first homes. The Government has cut it back by $37m this year and is going to cut it back by $43m next year. Why is it doing that? The Government told us in last year's May economic statement. After talking rather grandly about the first home owners scheme, saying that it was designed to continue to target assistance to low income families seeking to purchase their first homes, the Government went on to say that the improved affordability of housing loans due to falling mortgage interest rates over the last 12 months and the current buoyant state of the housing industry meant that it could cut out substantial parts of this scheme. The Government claims more home affordability when the statistics prove the reverse. It says that interest rates are coming down. Interest rates are going up; anybody can see that. It is only the Government's polling which has finally reminded it of this crisis which it has created. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is really keen to argue its seven-seven case, that its seven years-it has actually had six years-are going to be so much better than the seven years of the Fraser Government. I wish to make a few quick points about that because when the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) stands up he will say, `We did better than you. Look how I can prove that'. I will show that this Government did not do better. The figure for home affordability was 19.2 per cent when the Labor Party came to power, and it has gone to 30.8 per cent. That is the proportion of people's income that now has to be spent on a new home. That figure is a pretty telling indictment of the record of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government always tells us-the Treasurer does it-that housing starts are at a great new record. Comparing housing starts now, the peak for the Hawke Government, with the peak during the Fraser Government years shows that there were more housing starts then as a percentage of the population-and the population has grown since-than there are now. Housing starts, according to documents to be submitted to the summit, are going to decline by 20 per cent next year. Capital expenditure on dwellings as a percentage of gross domestic product was 5.7 per cent during the Fraser Government years and is 4.9 per cent now. The Government has failed. Its record is worse than the record of the Fraser Government. We will continue to remind the Government of that. We will take it on in a seven-seven debate, because we stand for home ownership. Home ownership is fundamental to the coalition parties and we will fight for home ownership as the traditional Australian way of life. The Government does not want home ownership. It stands for the rental society-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow's special Premiers Conference has been supported by industry, by local government, by State governments and by the Australian public. Only one group has poured scorn on it after the shadow Minister for housing, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), called for it, and that is the Opposition. It is the only group in this country which is addressing the housing problems by knocking any solution that is put forward, and that is typical of the Opposition. Knock, knock. Who is there? The honourable member for Mayo. Knock, knock-that is all he does. The Opposition cannot provide a solution. It has no solutions. It has put forward a policy for dealing with the housing crisis: just six simple steps, and everything will be all right; everyone will be on easy street. `Just add water' is the solution of the honourable member for Mayo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at his six commandments. First of all, he says, `We have repeatedly said we would substantially change macro-economic policies to reduce spending'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo says that once the Opposition changes macro-economic policy-it will not say how-everything will be all right. He says, `We will substantially increase funding for the first home owners scheme to help low income people get off the public housing list and get their own homes'. He does not understand or he has not told the Australian public what the problem is. The problem is what the Premiers Conference will be addressing tomorrow. There is a distinct supply problem in this country. At a time when there is already demand and pressure on prices, the Opposition is going to add to that price pressure by, as the honourable member says, doubling the first home owners scheme. All that would do is just add to prices. Some people may think they are going to get the benefit of the honourable member's largess, but the reality is that the money would go straight into the hands of property speculators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member said the Opposition would eliminate the deposit gap for many low income people by funding the cost of mortgage insurance. What he does not tell people is that he expects them to go out and get a 100 per cent mortgage at a time when they cannot save up a deposit to go into housing. But he would eliminate the deposit gap by giving mortgage protection to people who provide the money-not to the people who are taking the mortgage out but to the people who own the mortgage. So what could he be doing? He would only be giving $30m, he says, to the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo goes on about sale of public housing to tenants at discounted prices. At the same time he would cut public housing expenditure by $178m to fund his so-called gift to the people under the Opposition's first home owners scheme, most of which goes into the pockets of property speculators. It is really a bit hard to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> It is even more difficult to understand when he says that the coalition believes that a national land supply conference involving the Commonwealth and responsible State Ministers should be established to enable an assessment to take place of the whole land supply situation for housing throughout Australia so as to ease supply and, therefore, ease pressure on prices. The whole emphasis of what he has been saying here is that that would be useless. He has been saying here for the last 15 minutes that it would be useless, yet that is one of the things he said should be done, and it is being done. The problem has to be addressed from the ground up. There is a land issue here. As the honourable member for Mayo pointed out, it is primarily the responsibility of State and local governments. However, they did not have to come to Canberra to fix that problem; they could have done that back in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia or South Australia. They want to come to Canberra. This Government has taken a national coordinating responsibility. We have also made offers and will be making offers tomorrow to the States to show the bona fides of this Government by assisting the States and the people of Australia in the supply issue by the release of Commonwealth land equivalent to 15 new suburbs. That is the dilemma we are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, not only does the honourable member for Mayo knock things and continually contradict himself, but when he makes other statements he makes a bit of a mess of that. He made a statement the other day about 20 per cent of people being behind in their mortgage loan repayments. </PARA>

The National Australia Bank's general manager in retail banking, Mr Lloyd Smith, said that the statement was `certainly very far from the truth'. Mr Lloyd Smith also said that he would be absolutely staggered if such a huge percentage of home loans were in arrears. The RESI-Statewide Building Society said that the Opposition's figures were inaccurate in that its group had 10.46 per cent of its overall loans in arrears, but 6.88 per cent were between one month and two months overdue, and that 0.24 per cent of loans were three to four months in arrears and 0.23 per cent were four months-plus overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is the same calculator. I think he had better check his figures or get his maths lesson from someone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He then says that there are about 600,000 people, one in eight, who are homeless or in insecure housing in this country. Come on, get serious about it; do your sums properly. If that is actually the case, there are a lot of people living in caravans. If they are living in caravans, why is the honourable member for Mayo not out there calling for changes in New South Wales tenancy law to give those people some security? He will not make those changes or pressure his mates up in New South Wales and other places to change tenancy laws. He is not serious about it. Like the banks, we have got no idea where his figures come from. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement he made a couple of months ago about the Australian Bureau of Statistics, when the figures came out on home ownership, was that people who bought homes during Fraser years spent only 17 per cent of their incomes on housing while under the Hawke Government they were paying 23 per cent. He nods wisely, but, what people were not told was that, under the credit foncier system under which most home loans were taken out, a person's repayment falls effectively as time goes on because his income rises. One of the reasons why he did not get much of a run on that one was that the Press Gallery found out how absurd his position was and sent him back to check his calculator. </PARA>

Only about 43 per cent of people thought you had anything good to say. Fifty-seven per cent rejected your assertions and instant solutions.

Quaint references to Sir Robert Menzies 46 years ago will not do you any good. You are right out. The editorial describes it as a policy on housing suffering from an acute case of rising damp.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right, Mr Deputy Speaker. The industry bodies reject the policies of the Opposition because they know that they will not solve any of the real problems. This Government treats housing very seriously. It is a complicated and difficult problem in every advanced economy, especially in an advanced economy that is redeveloping itself at the rate this one is. As the Housing Industry Association said this week, there are no quick solutions to this problem. This Government acknowledges that they are very serious problems, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I would be the last to tell people that they are not facing some difficult times. That is why the Government has got this special Premiers Conference to try to help the States to organise both their land supply problems and zoning problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Opposition failed to recognise in its `Futile Diversions' document, with its little picket fence and Rover the dog bounding around the front, is that Australian society is changing very rapidly. Its composition is changing very rapidly. We are not going to get any solutions to the problems that we face by continuing to build our cities and houses in the same way we did before. We have got an ageing population. Despite the stereotype that the Opposition would like to present to us, we have a growing number of single-parent families and families of smaller size. Our lifestyles are changing rapidly, and our housing needs are changing rapidly. We have problems, restrictions and bottlenecks in the way in which land is made available, the types of houses we build, and the regulations surrounding how we can build and where we can build those houses. We have to develop new ideas in housing in Australia. As this conference is literally tackling the problem from the ground up, basically from land issues and industry issues, we are in a situation now to begin to develop in Australia a housing strategy that will take Australia into the 1990s and, indeed, solve a lot of the problems we face today. </PARA>
<PARA> The negative, groaning, moaning attacks of the Opposition are not really what one would expect from those who pretend to be an alternative government if that is the best they can do. They are going to have to do a lot better than that. The Opposition puts out little booklets with a whole lot of flowery words. There is nothing in it except a whole lot of nostalgic stuff about Robert Menzies, milo, and all the rest of it. The Opposition is going to have to do better than that. People want more than just a lot of words. People can watch television at seven o'clock at night if they want a bit of anaesthesia like that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is working to improve access and affordability for Australian home buyers. This Government is proud of the fact that it has built 840,000 houses and that it has helped 1.3 million Australians into home ownership. The honourable member for Mayo and his colleagues think that this Government and I are opposed to home ownership. Nothing could be further from the truth. We introduced the first home owners scheme. Through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement 70,000 home loans have been made available for low income people, compared to 50,000 when the previous Government was in office. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo does not understand the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. With the cooperation of the private sector-in New South Wales and Victoria in particular-we have been able to increase the number of home loans. Our achievements are on the public record. There is ample concrete evidence of that commitment to housing Australians. The figure of 1.3 million Australians that I mentioned is equivalent to the total population of the home State of the honourable member for Mayo. This Government is committed to home ownership. I believe that the conference to be held tomorrow will assist many more Australians into home ownership in the very near future and in the years to come. </PARA>

In spite of the overwhelming evidence of the home ownership crisis, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) remain utterly indifferent to the suffering of so many Australians. The Government is led by a Treasurer who will not take this issue seriously. To him, it is a political issue, solvable only by a political approach. This allows him to employ all of his political weaponry in an attempt to deflect responsibility. The Treasurer's tactic is to deny that there is a problem in the first place or, to the extent that a problem exists, to state that it is somebody else's problem; it is certainly not his problem. One has only to look at a transcript of an interview he held on John Laws's radio program on 1 February 1989 to see these two themes. The Treasurer, in answer to a question, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Well you see John, the problem when you see someone in Sydney is on the house with a block of land, a backyard swimming pool, the rotary hoist, the ground in the front . . . They're the people who are driving up the house prices for the person you've just spoken of, not the Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>His contempt for the ordinary Australian who aspires to own a home and some material comforts is obvious. The arrogance of the Treasurer drips from those words. That is the first theme: the creation of the crisis is not of the Government's making. The second theme is revealed a little further in the same interview with John Laws. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I said this to Nick Greiner when I saw him not long after he became the Premier. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Your problem is that you've got a housing crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>You've got to face your problem . . . It's a problem of the New South Wales Government, and there's nothing much we can do about it. </PARA>
<PARA>So that is the second theme: where a problem exists, it is not the Commonwealth Government's problem. The great Australian dream has been replaced by the great Australian lie-that home ownership is not the responsibility of a Commonwealth government. Why then did the Treasurer and the Prime Minister during Question Time today spout forth the figure of 800,000 home starts in their six years in office? According to them, when things go bad, it is not a Commonwealth government responsibility, but, when things are good, of course they want to take the credit. It is utterly and inherently inconsistent and, indeed, it is outright dishonesty. By the way, did honourable members notice that by the end of Question Time that figure of 800,000 had become one million, according to the Treasurer? The Government cannot have it both ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw and continue, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me make this very clear: the truth is that if the Prime Minister wants to set out a new strategy-a supposed seven-seven strategy-in which he compares the seven years of his rule, as he goes to an election, to the seven years of the Fraser Government's strategy, let us have the facts on the record. We should bear in mind that the figure of 800,000 supposed home starts since he came to office is not as significant a figure, as a percentage of the Australian population, as that which occurred during the Fraser years. During the Fraser years there were far more housing starts if one looks at the figure as a percentage of the Australian population. Will we hear about that from the Prime Minister when he compares figures? Will we also hear that during the Fraser years housing expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product was far greater? Indeed, it was 5.7 per cent during the Fraser years while during the Hawke years it has been 4.9 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government's approach will not wash. It cannot fool people who have lost houses under mortgagee auctions. Ten to 20 per cent of mortgagees are in default, according to banks. It cannot fool people who have no earthly hope of obtaining a home of their own. It cannot fool people who are clinging to their houses by their fingertips, while at the same time they see their disposable income fall dramatically and, accordingly, their standard of living suffer. The reality is that this is the most economically sophisticated electorate in history. It demands answers, not just the tired old political games being engaged in by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, by treating home ownership only as a political issue, doctors press conference transcripts and holds phoney summits. Or is it a conference now? During Question Time the Prime Minister ran away at a hundred miles an hour from the term `summit'. He deliberately built up expectations but, on the eve of this farce, which is certain to result in failure because of the narrowness of its agenda, he seeks to downplay its importance. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) called it a conference, the Prime Minister called it a meeting of Premiers, and the Treasurer called it merely a meeting. The truth is that the Prime Minister used the word `summit' when it suited him and when he thought that he would gain some political mileage out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the Government that home ownership is now cemented as a major election issue. The Opposition will pursue it every day in every forum available to us, both inside and outside the Parliament. These are the facts that every Australian knows: firstly, home loan interest rates have increased by 2 per cent in the last few months, from 13 1/2 per cent to 15 1/2 per cent; secondly, home ownership is now out of the reach of 180,000 families because of this increase. If interest rates had stayed at 13 1/2 per cent, a further 180,000 families would own their own homes instead of renting, as they are at present. The New South Wales Department of Housing estimates that a further one per cent increase in home loan interest rates would exclude another 31,000 families in New South Wales from home ownership. That figure applies just to home ownership in New South Wales. The figure for the whole of Australia is obviously much higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to this supposed summit, conference or meeting. There is no doubt that the disposal of surplus Commonwealth land in capital cities will have a significant effect on land supply, but it is neither the major nor the only issue, as the Government would have us believe. The level of interest rates is the greatest single determinant of home ownership in this country. The effect of the capital gains tax is another determinant. Neither is listed for debate.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is going to worsen. According to the authoritative Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry, housing starts will decline by 20 per cent in the 1989-90 financial year. This means there will be only 140,000 housing starts, yet the demand, according to the Council, is for 153,000. After the slump of the financial year 1989-90 there will be a price boom and the cost of homes will rise dramatically. Everybody in this House and in the community knows that Australians are looking for leadership from this Government. They are not getting it. It is an arrogant, uncaring and utterly out of touch Government led by megalomaniacs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now we can get back to the issues. The major issue at the moment is the importance of bringing governments together to tackle the problems in housing. What is needed more than anything else at the moment is a cooperative approach at all levels of government, and that is the reason for the importance of this conference. It is being held to bring governments together. The resolution of the problems in housing is not possible at one level of government alone, and that is why this conference is being held. We have a determination to tackle the problems; the Opposition cares only about political games. People are interested in answers; they are not interested in political games. Think of all the fuss in Question Time about the title of this conference-whether it is called a summit, a special Premiers Conference or a meeting. That is just a political game.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I keep saying, everyone in the community cares about the issues, and we are determined to do something about them. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), made allegations about the importance of who will be at the meeting and who will not, and alleged that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) is not needed at the meeting. Do honourable members opposite not understand that this conference is specifically directed to supply issues? Do they not understand the administrative arrangements of government? Do they not understand that the responsibilities of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care are for the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA) and the first home owners scheme, but that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has responsibility for industry and supply at the Commonwealth level? That is why Senator Button will be at the conference and that is why it is not appropriate for the Minister for Housing and Aged Care to be at the conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The people listening out there-if anyone still is after the rubbish that we have heard-care about the issues and about solutions; they do not care about political games. The women listening are sick of politicians politicking. They care about people who want to face up to the issues. We will face up to the issues at this conference; we will not run away from them. We do not ignore the issues. In housing, the issues go across governments. We are already making a start by bringing governments together at this conference and, what is more, putting the focus where it belongs-on the States. An article in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald by Pat Troy from the Urban Research Unit at the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University states:</PARA>
<PARA> But the disastrous housing market situation for most is the result of State Government incompetence and neglect. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government's initiative in calling a special conference and releasing Commonwealth land-</PARA>
<PARA>we heard the announcement today about the release of Commonwealth land-</PARA>
<PARA>springs from a concern for the impact of inflation on housing and economic performance. But it will only make sense if it forces State Governments to accept their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The States should be left in no doubt that the Commonwealth expects them to reinvigorate and use the planning and development bodies set up to deal with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA>And to fulfil the responsibilities that they, as States, have. The first thing to understand about housing is that in this issue all sectors of housing are involved, whether it is in home ownership, private rental accommodation or public housing. A pressure in one area exerts pressure in another area. Each has an effect on the other. The Commonwealth Government has done more in all of these areas than any other Commonwealth government in history. Those opposite should not belittle these achievements. Do they think people are interested in the achievements of our Government being laughed at when it was delivered to the community? Let me tell them that when we deliver, so often despite the opposition of those opposite, the measures we introduce are often wrecked or face being wrecked at State or local government level under Liberal governments. Take the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. We have put more into public housing than any previous government. We have directed the emphasis to public housing in a way not done before. If it were not for what we have done under the CSHA there would be an extra 34,000 families on the waiting list for public housing. Imagine the increased pressures on home ownership if those 34,000 families were still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, all sectors in the housing area are involved. Home ownership, private rental and public housing all interact with one another. The failure of the State governments has been extraordinary in all these areas, particularly in New South Wales. They are failures in tenancy law, they have failed to act on rent control and they are failures in public housing. I have been on a task force going around the country. No matter how we want to direct attention to Federal issues, universally across New South Wales we get complaints about what has been happening to tenancy in public housing since Greiner got in in New South Wales. Rents are being forced up. No matter how much we try to help with rent assistance, the State Government puts the rents straight up. That is the record of the Liberals in the State area. The Federal Liberals will, of course, cut money to public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not tell me in Phillip that we are reacting to the housing problem just because polls have been taken. Do honourable members opposite think I do not understand what the cost of housing and other accommodation is in the eastern suburbs of Sydney? We in the eastern suburbs of Sydney have another reason to understand the situation. We had the Liberals in local government. In their term of office in the Waverley Council they destroyed all the housing programs set in place by the previous Labor Council and now, of course, adopted federally in the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement as a model for the whole of Australia. The Libs in local government destroyed one program after the other because the Liberals are not interested in solutions at any level of government. They are interested only in political game playing. One of the things that the Liberal Waverley Council did was to send back the Federal money that we had offered for low income housing. That is typical of the Liberals at all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, our achievements, which the Opposition belittles, are extensive. Our housing policies over the last five years have been better targeted and housing assistance has been distributed more equitably among private and public rental accommodation and home ownership. Commonwealth assistance for public housing has more than doubled in real terms under this Government. An additional 70,000 rental dwellings have been provided, compared to 40,000 over the previous five years. In 1982-83 under the previous coalition Government, dwelling commencements collapsed to only 105,000, whereas in 1987-88, under our Government, commencements reached almost 136,000-and the Opposition belittles those achieve- ments. </PARA>
<PARA> The major point to make in this debate is that this Government introduced the first home owners scheme, which of course the Opposition also belittles. Since 1983 over 318,000 households have been assisted. Neither of the Opposition's schemes was well targeted. Many people who received assistance did not need it. Our schemes are well targeted and effective. The Commonwealth will play its part. The main problem, of course, is the price of housing. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) does not ignore the problem. In Question Time today he referred to the problem being the price of housing. He referred to the bottlenecks in supply in Sydney and Melbourne. Like the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), he referred to the constraints affecting housing prices-the constraints on resources, the constraints on the supply of land and the constraints on the availability of building materials and skilled labour. The Federal Government will help. It will not ignore its responsibilities. As the Prime Minister said, 27,000 blocks of Commonwealth land-the equivalent of 15 new suburbs-will be released over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor in the prices debate which I am made well aware of in the eastern suburbs of Sydney is the fact that real estate agents are pushing prices up. I commend to all honourable members a magnificent article in the Sydney Morning Herald `Good Weekend' of 15 October 1988. I have a copy. It is all about the devices to push the prices up. When is some government going to exercise some control over real estate agents before they come in and complain about the problem in housing, particularly in Sydney?</PARA>
<PARA> In Question Time the other day the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) gave a wonderful example of cooperation between States and the Federal Government in the demonstration estates, which clearly show that we can have cost effective land practices which do not lower living standards. Pat Troy has also said that all governments foster home ownership but conservative governments never face up to the fact that the pursuit of home ownership, orderly development and the efficient provision of infrastructure services creates pressures in the marketplace which can only be resolved by government intervention-not, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland, probably thinks, by building more hotels. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985 to revise the maximum rates of charge for certain commodities and to remove commodities for which quantity charge is no longer necessary. The Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act 1985 is one of three Acts introduced by the Government to give as much flexibility as possible in determining appropriate export inspection charging arrangements for different sectors of the agricultural commodity export industry. The other Acts are the Export Inspection (Service Charge) Act 1985 and the Export Inspection (Establishment Registration Charge) Act 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act was introduced, it specified, for a number of commodities in respect of which it was thought convenient and efficient to charge by reference to quantity, the maximum allowable rates of charge. Those rates are set by regulation. Notwithstanding the introduction of more cost efficient arrangements in a number of areas, due to movements in the consumer price index and the Government's decision of last year to raise contribution by industry from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, some of the rates of charge under the regulations have reached or are approaching the maximum rate of charge specified in the Act. Consequently, to enable cost recovery at the correct level for inspection services for these commodities to continue, it has become necessary to increase the maximum allowable rates of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's objective to provide the most efficient inspection service while at the same time ensuring that industry plays its part by self-regulation to the maximum extent possible, the Government, in consultation with industry, has been actively pursuing introduction of the user pays fee for service concept. As a result of this, certain commodity items-eight in number-will be removed from the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Act, as for some time there has been no charge in the regulations under that Act for those commodity items. Inspection service costs for the majority of those items are being collected by way of fee for service under the Export Control (Fees) Orders or under the Export Inspection (Service Charge) Act 1985. In determining the revised maximum rates for quantity charge specified in the Act, it has been necessary to set rates of charge at a level which will allow scope for any future response to inflation or appropriate changes in policy, without resort to frequent amendment of the Act over the next few years, while being at a level which is reasonable and not excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will have some impact, when the necessary regulations are made, on the inspection costs of containerised grain shipments. The immediate overall cost impact on industry and on recovery of costs to the Commonwealth will be minimal. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Unless the Parliament provides otherwise, section 66 of the Constitution prescribes a maximum annual sum for the payment of salaries of Ministers. Amendments to the Ministers of State Act which sets this sum are thus required from time to time to cover changes to ministerial salaries. Since its establishment in 1973, the Remuneration Tribunal, as an independent body required to review and report on the remuneration, allowances and entitlements of members of Parliament amongst others, has consistently maintained that parliamentary salaries are too low. </PARA>
<PARA> In its submission to the Tribunal in connection with its 1987 review, the Government proposed that the Tribunal hold a conference similar to the anomalies conference convened in that year by the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Tribunal agreed that a conference be held to consider whether special and extraordinary circumstances existed, as provided for under the then current wage principles, which would justify consideration of an anomaly under the pre-existing principles. The parties to the conference, being the Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Labor Party Caucus, the Liberal Party and the Australian Democrats, agreed that an anomaly had existed for a considerable time in respect of all politicians' salaries which should be adjusted by two amounts, the last being the 2.2 per cent increase effective from 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Also following from the anomalies conference it was agreed that the tribunal would conduct a review of parliamentary salaries prior to its reporting again. It is as a result of that review that the latest increases have been recommended. In its 1988 review, the Remuneration Tribunal recommended that ministerial salaries be increased by 7 per cent with effect from 1 January 1989. The proposed increase accords with national wage case increases awarded to the work force under the second tier increase granted by the national wage case decision of march 1987, and the 3 per cent increase granted by the August 1988 national wage decision. It is therefore necessary to raise the upper limit on the amount appropriated for ministerial salaries to accommodate both increases. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Ministers of State Act to increase the maximum annual sum from $745,000 to $820,000. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is twofold. It aims firstly to streamline reporting arrangements for higher education institutions under the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986, and secondly to adjust the Act to reflect the circumstances of institutions planning or undergoing amalgamations in accordance with this Government's policy on higher education.</PARA>
<PARA> The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 covers higher education institutions and all private sector organisations which employ 100 or more people. The Act requires employers to introduce an affirmative action program to eliminate discrimination in employment against women, and to ensure equality of opportunity in employment for women. Employers are also required to report annually to the Director of Affirmative Action on the progress of their programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act became effective for higher education institutions on 1 October 1986. Coverage of the private sector was phased in over a period of three years, with employers of 1,000 or more persons covered from 1 February 1987, employers of 500 or more people from 1 February 1988 and employers of 100 or more people from 1 February this year. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an excellent response of Australian employers to the legislation in the first year of the Act's operation. One hundred per cent of higher education institutions, and 99 per cent of the largest private sector organisations met their reporting obligations under the Act. This excellent level of compliance reflects the high degree of support for the Act and its objectives across all sectors of Australian industry. It also reflects the professional manner in which the Affirmative Action Agency has carried out its responsibilities and the cooperative relationship it has established with industry. This Government has held to its commitment, in turn, to ensure that administrative tasks associated with the requirement to report under the Act are minimised. A range of initiatives has been taken to standardise reporting and to inform employers in clear terms of their obligations. This Bill builds further on this commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Higher education institutions in New South Wales and Western Australia are currently covered by both State and Federal legislation requiring the development of programs designed to provide equal employment opportunity. The Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 relates to women, and the State legislation in both States to Aboriginals, people of ethnic background and the physically disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently the reporting periods specified in these Acts are different. The object of this Bill in its first aspect is to move towards a common reporting date of 1 January for institutions in respect of both their Federal and State reporting obligations. Under the proposed amendment, institutions would report for the period 1 January to 31 December on 1 January in the following year. Relevant authorities in New South Wales and Western Australia have agreed in turn to bring their statutory reporting date into line with the 1 January reporting date proposed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice of a calendar year reporting period of 1 January to 31 December reflects better the administrative arrangements of the institutions themselves. It would bring the processes of program development and reporting closer in line with the normal cycle of the institution. The proposed Bill would therefore greatly assist institutions in meeting their obligations under the Federal and State legislation. The Bill further provides for transitional arrangements to preserve the reporting arrangements of institutions on the changeover to the proposed 1 January reporting date. </PARA>
<PARA> The higher education sector, like other industries throughout Australia, is undergoing significant restructuring. As part of this restructuring many institutions are considering or planning amalgamations. The creation of fewer larger institutions reflects the Government's commitment to the consolidation of institutions as set out in the July 1988 White Paper titled Higher Education : A Policy Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill in its second aspect seeks to adjust to the changing circumstances created through amalgamations. It would ensure that institutions that amalgamate will not be regarded as new employers under the Act following the amalgamation. Under the Affirmative Action Act, there is a hiatus between when an institution is created and when it is covered by the legislation. This hiatus is especially problematic when that new institution is created as a result of the amalgamation of existing institutions covered by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The interruption to the affirmative action program caused by this gap in coverage is not in the interests of the program and its objectives. Further, it needlessly complicates the requirements on employers by presenting changed circumstances with which they must deal. The Bill in this aspect therefore, seeks to ensure continuity of the program and to preserve reporting requirements. The proposed amendments offer certainty to institutions of their obligations under the Act at a time of major upheaval. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the Act will facilitate the implementation of the Act in the higher education sector by streamlining reporting requirements, and by ensuring continuity of coverage for institutions going through amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments have negligible financial impact. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced in the 1988-89 Budget that the Government had decided that an annual supervisory fee be levied, commencing in 1988-89, on general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurers. This measure is intended to recover the ongoing costs of supervision of such bodies under the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945 by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and the associated Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 and Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 will give effect to this announcement by imposing and authorising collection of a levy on authorised general insurers, Lloyd's and registered life insurers. This Bill should be read as one with the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989, and is to come into operation on the same day the collection Bill commences. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions for imposing supervisory charges were contained in the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 which was passed by this House in November last year. However, the Bill was withdrawn prior to being debated in the Senate, to enable its provisions to be reassessed in the light of the High Court's decision in the Air Caledonie case concerning the immigration fee matter. The reason for this course of action was to ensure that the provisions imposing these charges were sound constitutionally. </PARA>
<PARA> The General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 and its two associated Bills re-introduce the proposal to impose supervisory levies and deal exclusively with the imposition of the levies and the collection of those levies. The remaining matters from the now defunct 1988 amendment Bill are included in a fourth piece of companion legislation, namely, the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Under present arrangements the cost of supervising the general and life insurance industries is borne by taxpayers in general. The proposed annual supervisory levies on general and life insurance companies is based on the application of the user pays principle. This principle is not a new one; it already applies in a number of areas of government activity. For instance, registration fees are imposed by the Commonwealth in respect of insurance brokers. There is also a supervisory fee applicable to occupational superannuation funds and approved deposit funds that wish to take advantage of relevant concessions available under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed levies reflect the Government's view that, generally, where a service is designed to benefit a particular group, the cost should be borne by that immediate group of beneficiaries of the service rather than by taxpayers in general. The supervisory levies will be payable into Consolidated Revenue. Their imposition will not affect the existing arrangements under which the financial resources made available to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission are subject to the same scrutiny processes as are applicable to Commonwealth departments generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Bills, firstly, the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 imposes a levy on authorised general insurers and Lloyd's that are required to lodge accounts under the Insurance Act 1973; secondly, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 imposes a levy on registered life insurers that are required to lodge accounts under the Life Insurance Act 1945; and, thirdly, the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 provides the machinery for collection of the levies. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to address the provisions of the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 in detail. The Bill imposes a levy on authorised general insurers and Lloyd's in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989, and sets out the mechanism for calculating the amount of levy that is payable. In accordance with the 1988-89 Budget announcement, the initial annual rate of the levy for general insurers and Lloyd's has been set at $11,000, producing savings of $1.9m in a full year. The amount of the annual rate of levy will be capable of variation by regulation, but not before 1 July 1990, and any variation must be within the provisions relating to the statutory upper limit. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill and its associated Bills also contain provisions which allow for exemptions from the levy or for remissions of the levy, as appropriate, to be made by regulations. In pursuance of these provisions the Government proposes, following passage of the Bills, to seek the making of a regulation to remit part of the annual levy for the small number of general insurers which are authorised to carry on insurance business under section 37 of the Insurance Act 1973. It is proposed that these insurers pay an annual rate of levy of $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 37 of the Insurance Act provides that insurers whose activities are confined to conducting insurance business with limited classes of persons-generally only members or employees of the company or the particular trade, industry or profession-and whose premium income does not exceed $500,000 per annum may be exempted from certain provisions of the Act. Such exemptions are principally concerned with a reduced statutory reporting requirement and consequently there is a significantly reduced supervisory responsibility in respect of these companies on the part of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, as against insurers with unrestricted authorisations. In these circumstances it is considered appropriate that the relevant insurers pay a reduced amount of levy. The amount of the annual rate of the levy in respect of authorised general insurers and Lloyd's may not exceed the specified statutory upper limit which for 1988-89 and 1989-90 has been set at $11,000. The amount of the statutory upper limit is indexed annually, from 1 July 1990, to changes in the all groups consumer price index number for the previous March-on-March year. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence this means that the annual rate of levy may only be increased within the limits of any indexation increase in the statutory upper limit. The Government does not expect to automatically seek annual adjustments to the annual rate of the levy within the statutory upper limit, but where the costs of supervision of general insurers and Lloyd's by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission increase in a financial year, there is scope for an increase in the levy to be sought to recover those increased costs. Of course, if the indexation factor results in a reduction in the statutory upper limit, the actual annual rate of levy will have to remain within the reduced statutory upper limit. Where the annual rate of levy is varied during an insurer's financial year the amount of levy payable will be applied on a pro rata basis according to the annual rate of levy applicable to that part of the insurer's financial year occurring before the variation, and the new annual rate of levy applying after the variation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that this Bill and its associated Bills seek to do no more than recover the costs of supervision of the insurance industries by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I commend the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 to honourable members= and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides the machinery necessary for collecting the levies imposed by the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989 and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill 1989. This Bill should be read as one with those two Bills, and is to come into operation on the day on which it receives royal assent. The Bill specifies the liability of authorised general insurers, Lloyd's and registered life insurers to pay the levy, sets out the time period within which the levy is payable, provides penalties for non-payment of the levy, and provides appropriate powers of enforcement and for review of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the 1988-89 Budget, the proposed annual levy will be $11,000 for general insurers and Lloyd's and $19,000 for life insurers, producing savings of $2.9m in a full year. The proposed levies will be payable on and from 24 August 1988-that is, from the day after announcement in the 1988-89 Budget-and will involve no retrospective element. The initial amount of levy payable will accordingly be a pro rata amount calculated on the basis of a daily component of the annual levy for the period from 24 August 1988 to and including the last day of the insurer's then current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the levy will be payable in respect of each period for which general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurers are required to lodge accounts under the relevant Act. Where the period concerned is other than 12 months, or the annual rate of the levy has been altered during the period, the levy which is payable will be adjusted on a pro rata basis. The levy payable for a particular period is due and payable by the day on which general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurers are respectively required to lodge accounts under the relevant Act for that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Transitional arrangements have been provided for insurers whose financial year ends after 23 August 1988 and whose date for lodgment of accounts in respect of that= financial year will have occurred prior to or within 28 days of the Bill becoming operative. In these cases insurers will have a minimum of 28 days from the commencement of this Bill to pay the initial amount of the levy. Where the liability of a person to pay the levy is not discharged at or before the time the levy is due and payable, the person is liable to pay a penalty of 20 per cent per annum of the levy. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner may remit the whole or part of an amount imposed as a penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions of the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 provide:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) for the recovery by the Commonwealth of outstanding levies and amounts of any penalties;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) for the delegation by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of the Commissioner's powers under the Bill;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) scope for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal regarding decisions made by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner concerning any penalties for failure to pay the levy by the due date; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) for the making of regulations by the Governor-General under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill 1989 to honourable members and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is concerned with amendments to insurance industry supervisory legislation. In terms of its substance, it is virtually identical to the one passed by this House in November last year save the provisions concerning introduction of supervisory levies to be paid by general insurers, Lloyd's and life insurers. These provisions are now the subject of separate Bills. As I indicated earlier when I introduced the three Bills concerned with imposition and collection of the insurance supervisory levies, the Government withdrew the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 prior to it being debated in the Senate, to enable its provisions to be reassessed in the light of the High Court of Australia's decision in the Air Caledonie case concerning the immigration fee matter. In the intervening period the Government has identified some minor additional matters requiring amendment which have been included in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 incorporates measures to provide for the registration under the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 of insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers. It will also effect a number of amendments to the Life Insurance Act 1945 to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the existing supervisory arrangements, all of which will increase the level of protection available to the insuring public. The Bill is structured into six parts. Part I includes the commencement provisions and provides for specified provisions to come into operation on the twenty-eighth day after the day on which the Bill receives the royal assent, and for all other provisions to come into operation on a day or days to be fixed by proclamation, save that all provisions must commence within six months. Part II amends the Insurance Act 1973 by replacing the definition of the term `debenture' with a new one which accords more closely with the definition in the Companies Code. It also repeals section 113, which deals with unauthorised foreign insurers, in order to remove legislative overlaps with section 34 of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III amends the Insurance Amendment Act 1983 by omitting the now redundant and unproclaimed paragraph (c) of section 3. Part IV amends the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 to include new provisions requiring the registration of all insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers, and the collection of statistics regarding premiums remitted overseas. Part V amends the Life Insurance Amendment Act 1977 by repealing five redundant and unproclaimed sections. Part VI amends the Life Insurance Act 1945 in four ways:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) to introduce the concept of `appointed actuary' for the purpose of performing certain functions required under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to repeal certain redundant provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) to change the period for furnishing to Parliament the annual report on the workings of the Act. The proposed period is to be within three months of the year ending on 30 June, which corresponds to the reporting period provided in the other Acts administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) to effect a number of other changes intended to clarify and enhance the existing supervisory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>I would now like to address the more significant provisions of the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. The proposed amendments to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 and the Life Insurance Act 1945-that is, the proposed changes covered by parts IV and VI of the Bill have been the subject of consultations with representatives of industry bodies including, where relevant, the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, the Insurance Council of Australia, the= Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the National Insurance Brokers Association of Australia. In addition, some of the other amendments provided for in the Bill have emerged as a result of suggestions put forward by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently, the Insurance Act 1973 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 do not provide as much protection to consumers dealing with agents of unauthorised foreign insurers as to those dealing with either agents of authorised insurers or brokers. In the case of agents of authorised insurers there is more scope to enforce the statutory requirement that an insurer must accept liability for the conduct of his agent. Brokers must in general hold professional indemnity insurance. The Government is of the view that those insured should be allowed access to overseas insurance markets where they wish to seek it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Government believes that insurance consumers should be reminded of the importance of considering the possible implications of entering into insurance contracts with offshore insurers who are not supervised under Australian insurance law. Against this background the Bill will provide increased protection for those insured by including certain additional provisions in the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> A key additional requirement will be that all insurance intermediaries who arrange insurance contracts with unauthorised foreign insurers will be required to be registered under the Act unless they are already registered as an insurance broker. In addition, these intermediaries, as well as registered insurance brokers who arrange insurance contracts with unauthorised foreign insurers, will be required to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) provide to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission a copy of any agency agreements they have with an unauthorised foreign insurer, the agreements to be available for public inspection;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) obtain written acknowledgment from the insured that cover may be provided in whole or in part by an unauthorised foreign insurer; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) provide an annual return to the Commission on their activities in this area. This annual return will enable the Commission to monitor the volume of business placed with unauthorised foreign insurers through insurance intermediaries. </PARA>
<PARA>There will also be scope to make regulations to impose a requirement on intermediaries operating under these provisions to take out professional indemnity insurance cover in respect of their operations in this area. The Government proposes to seek the making of a regulation to impose a registration fee on insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers, consistent with that applicable to registered insurance brokers, to recover the additional supervisory costs for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission that would be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the proposed amendments concerning the Life Insurance Act 1945. These amendments are considered necessary to enhance the effectiveness of the Act, particularly in relation to the functions required to be performed by actuaries, and to clarify a number of the existing supervisory arrangements. The most important of these amendments will introduce a new provision to require each life insurance company to identify an actuary as the appointed actuary to the company. In the last decade or so, there has been a substantial increase in the variety of life insurance products marketed by life insurance companies. Consequently, life insurance business has become much more complicated than ever before. Against this background, it has become increasingly important that actuaries of companies performing certain statutory functions under the Life Insurance Act carry out those functions in an objective and professional manner notwithstanding the fact that they may be receiving remuneration from the companies concerned. Creating the position of an appointed actuary will assist in achieving this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions in the Bill will require each life insurance company to appoint an actuary as the appointed actuary, within a certain period of time, for the purpose of performing the actuarial functions specified under a number of provisions of the Act. Small life insurance companies will not be precluded from appointing a consulting actuary as appointed actuary. The position of appointed actuary will assist the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in identifying the particular actuary for each company who is responsible for discharging the key actuarial functions laid down by the Life Insurance Act. As a minimum level of experience, an appointed actuary must be a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia of not less than five years' standing. This qualification is regarded as necessary in view of the importance of the functions to be performed by the appointed actuary. The requirement for an appointed actuary is supported by the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes provisions to increase the threshold for publication in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of life insurance unclaimed moneys from $20 to $200. Publication annually of all unclaimed moneys of not less than $20 is a time consuming and costly procedure. This proposed change will apply to statements of unclaimed moneys as at 31 December 1988 and later, and should result in significant administrative savings as it has been estimated that in excess of 50 per cent of all amounts of unclaimed moneys are below $200. The application of this change to statements of unclaimed moneys as at 31 December 1988 should not cause any problems to life insurance companies as the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has been in touch with them concerning the proposed changes in this area since November 1988 when the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 was introduced into the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal will not affect a person's right to make a claim in respect of unclaimed moneys, including amounts less than $200, where satisfactory proof of claim can be made. To increase public awareness of unclaimed moneys, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be making available the statements of all new unclaimed moneys from 31 December 1988. These lists will be available for public inspection in the Commission's Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra offices. The unclaimed moneys provision in the Life Insurance Act is also being amended to give to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner power to authorise payment of unclaimed moneys. This is appropriate given the arrangements put in place following passage of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other changes proposed in this Bill is an amendment to alter the timing for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to submit a report to the Treasurer on the workings of the Act. This time will be changed from five months after 31 December to three months after 30 June each year. The Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has overall responsibility for preparation of annual reports in respect of not only the Life Insurance Act 1945, but also the Insurance Act 1973, the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. This proposal will allow the Commissioner to more effectively carry out his responsibilities under those Acts by producing a single consolidated annual report within three months of 30 June each year. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposed amendment involves repeal of section 13 which permits the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to arbitrate in a dispute between a life insurance company and a policy owner in relation to a policy. This provision has been used only once in more than 40 years of operation of the Act. It is considered that the Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is not equipped to provide arbitration services and it is therefore more appropriate that such disputes be settled by recourse to commercial, legal or other channels. At the same time, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission is examining, in conjunction with other government agencies and industry bodies, possible additional arrangements for resolving disputes between insurers and policy owners. </PARA>
<PARA> Other proposed amendments include:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Repeal of five redundant and unproclaimed sections of the Life Insurance Amendment Act 1977. These sections relate to the conduct of non-insurance business by registered life insurers without the approval in writing of the Commissioner, the registration of companies, investment of statutory funds, accounts and balance sheets, and inspection of documents;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) improvements to certain definitions within the Life Insurance Act 1945;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) enhanced requirements for the provision of information in applications for registration under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) clarification of a number of existing provisions to remedy uncertainties in their administration;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) a reduction in the period of notice required to be given by life insurers before issuing a special policy to replace a policy that has been lost or destroyed; and</PARA>
<PARA> (6) enhancements to the review provisions in the Act to take account of introduction of the appointed actuary. </PARA>
<PARA> The various measures which I have outlined will provide worthwhile increased protection for the insuring public and, consistent with the Government's broad approach to regulation, will not impose undue burdens on the industries involved. I commend the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 to honourable members and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

This reflects the Government's decision to abolish the binary system of funding higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will repeal the requirement that departmental assessors under the Act, referred to as `authorised persons', be ministerially appointed. This requirement gives unnecessary administrative complexity to the appointment of over 300 officers, very few of whom are at senior level. The Bill proposes instead that authorised persons be identified as officers whose departmental duties include making decisions on Austudy or postgraduate awards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to modify the appeal procedures under the Student Assistance Act. It will remove restrictions on students authorising someone else to act on their behalf in seeking a review of a departmental decision. It will also permit students to expedite their appeals to the Student Assistance Review Tribunal by waiving their right to receive background papers at least 14 days before the hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will extend the Act's recovery and waiver write-off provisions to apply to charges incurred because of delays in repaying student assistance overpayments. This would mean that such amounts are treated in the same way as the overpayment that led to the charge being incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will make some drafting changes to the provisions of the Act relating to Austudy. These changes will enable the regulations made under the Act to be redrafted in a simpler manner. The Government appreciates the concern that has been expressed on occasions about the complexity of the Austudy rules. We are looking at ways of simplifying the regulations to make them more accessible to students, student counsellors and the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Bill's financial impact, the proposed amendments have no financial implications other than some minor administrative savings. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Audit Act 1901. The principal amendments are intended to improve the administrative procedures followed by departments, make arrangements for signing audit reports, enhance the Auditor-General's powers to undertake audits and to indemnify the Auditor-General and his or her staff.</PARA>
<PARA> Administrative procedures will be streamlined by amendments to sections 31 and 34 which will remove the requirement for the reimbursement of a drawing account from the Commonwealth public account to be certified and authorised under the provisions of section 34. The Commonwealth public account is the Commonwealth's main centralised bank account. Drawing accounts are the bank accounts maintained by paymasters from which cheques and similar payments are drawn to pay claims. Drawing accounts are reimbursed daily from the Commonwealth public account for the value of the cheques and payments drawn. The current requirements under section 34 mean that, technically, both the original payment from the drawing account and the subsequent daily reimbursement of that account need to be certified and authorised. Since the latter certification and authorisation constitutes a duplication of the action taken when the payment is originally made from the drawing account it serves no purpose and can be dispensed with. </PARA>
<PARA> Further improvement in administrative procedures will be brought about by an amendment to section 35a of the Act. This will enable moneys from one parliamentary department to be transferred to another upon the approval of the Minister for Finance whenever there is a transfer of functions between the departments concerned. The power to approve such transfers of funds currently exists only in relation to transfers between departments of state. Another amendment to section 35a will enable the Minister for Finance to reduce amounts previously transferred between departments and to give directions on amounts to be transferred retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes that the regulations made under the Act may authorise a Minister to give guidelines to officers concerning policy matters which have a service-wide financial application and for which that Minister is responsible. Any such guidelines may not of course be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, the regulations or the directions given under the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in the amendments concerning the Auditor-General's responsibilities are provisions to provide for the Auditor-General to authorise offices to sign reports on his or her behalf for departmental financial statements and for the reports required of companies where the Auditor-General is their auditor. This is an extension of the current authorisation in respect of audit reports on authorities. The Auditor-General's personal workload will be increased significantly with the introduction of departmental financial statements by the Audit Amendment Act 1988 and with the increase over the past few years in the number of Commonwealth owned and controlled companies. This Bill will alleviate the personal workload of the Auditor-General. However, it is emphasised that for all such audit reports the final responsibility will remain with the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment concerning the Auditor-General will put beyond doubt his or her power to conduct project performance audits when it is not cost effective to invoke the more formal efficiency audit provisions of division 2 of part VI of the Act. The meaning of a performance audit and its scope has been detailed in publications of the United Nations Affiliated International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), of which the vast majority of the world's Auditors-General or equivalent officials are members. The Auditor-General for Australia is presently Chairman of the Organisation. Briefly, a performance audit is concerned with efficiency and economy in the use of resources as is the case with an efficiency audit, except that a project performance audit is one done on a smaller scale than a formal efficiency audit. The Australian Audit Office auditing standards published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S200 of 7 August 1987 gives a more comprehensive discourse on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment is designed to make it mandatory for the Auditor-General to audit and report to relevant Ministers on the financial statements and on the audit and inspection of the accounts and records of subsidiary companies. The proposed amendment will apply where the Auditor-General has been appointed as auditor of the authority or other body to which the company is a subsidiary. A dual appointment under the companies legislation will also be possible. It is anticipated that unless there are exceptional circumstances the Auditor-General will carry out both the Audit Act and companies legislation requirements concurrently. That is, under normal circumstances it is not expected that an auditor other than the Auditor-General would be appointed to report under the companies legislation. The proposed new section will also provide that the Auditor-General may decide not to do an audit on the grounds that to do so would not be cost effective. The proposed amendment is intended to apply to subsidiaries acquired after the commencement of the section and to existing subsidiaries which currently have the Auditor-General as sole auditor. This is so as not to disturb any present arrangements for audit and report on existing subsidiaries which do not have the Auditor-General as sole auditor. </PARA>
<PARA> The final principal amendment directly affecting the Auditor-General is the introduction of an indemnity provision. The Auditor-General and his or her staff will be covered against liabilities incurred for any act done or omitted to be done in the performance of their duty, other than acts or omissions in bad faith. The provision mirrors the indemnity insurance which a company auditor would obtain. It will remove the necessity for the Auditor-General to rely on the largess of the Government of the day for providing compensation against actions arising in carrying out his or her duties. To date there have never been any actions taken for damages against the Auditor-General but there have been some actions against his counterparts in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes to make it mandatory for all newly established authorities to be automatically subject to the provisions of division 2 of part XI, unless the legislation establishing the authority provides otherwise. Division 2 contains standard financial provisions on accounts, audit and reporting which are applicable to an authority which should keep its accounts in accordance with commercial practice. The amendments will, in the future, ensure that the standard provisions are applied across the board and that any modifications to those standard provisions are highlighted in the legislation establishing each body. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments of a minor nature will make the Australian Secret Intelligence Service a department for the purposes of the Act, make it clear that bank accounts are opened under section 21 and not 20, update certain provisions relating to the audit of the Australian Audit Office, substitute the Minister for Finance for Governor-General in section 62 and permit regulations to be made concerning the commitment of moneys and estimates of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Contingent costs could arise from the proposal to give the Auditor-General and staff an indemnity and it is possible that additional cost could result from the increased complexity of the audit of the Australian Audit Office. The other changes are not expected to have any significant financial impact on Commonwealth revenue or expenditure. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 so as to enable Australia to ratify protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions. Protocol I is concerned with the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. When Australia ratifies protocol I it will, at the same time, ratify protocol II, which is concerned with the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. However, protocol II does not require legislative action to enable its ratification. Protocol II applies to situations of non-international armed conflicts between the armed forces of a party and organised armed groups exercising some territorial control over territory of that party. It does not apply to internal tensions or disturbances such as riots or sporadic acts of violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of humanitarian principles to international conflicts is, of course, an immensely difficult problem, especially where, as under the protocols, distinctions are sought to be made between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives. Although it is true that such distinctions can become blurred and indistinct, and ultimately may even cease to exist in conditions of total war, the reality remains that, in the period of 43 years during which total war has been avoided, there have been many limited wars with grave humanitarian consequences. Sadly, further such wars can be expected to occur. It is in relation to conflicts such as these that the protocols are especially capable of having an important and beneficial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> While, for its part, Australia will continue to work tirelessly to achieve world peace, it must accept that limited wars are likely to continue and take appropriate action, such as is involved in the ratification of the protocols, to promote international adherence to the humanitarian principles embodied in the Geneva conventions and in these protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> If limited armed conflicts cannot be avoided, it is to be hoped that they will at least be conducted with some regard for the rights of civilians, and that belligerent nations will treat prisoners of war and wounded in accordance with internationally agreed principles. I note in this regard the important protections provided by the protocols for particular categories of persons such as the wounded, sick and shipwrecked and civilian medical and religious personnel. It must be remembered that the protocols were developed after exacting work by many bodies, in particular the International Committee of the Red Cross, over an extended period from the early 1950s. Finally, a diplomatic conference convened by the Swiss Federal Council held four sessions in Geneva from 1974 to 1977 to negotiate the final texts. The Australian delegation to these conferences, which played a major and demanding role in the debates at the conferences, was led by Mr Frank Mahony, OBE, then Deputy Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The length and arduous nature of the process of development of the protocols reflects the great difficulties encountered in striking a balance between competing interests while maintaining the principle of absolute and unconditional respect for persons outside the conflict. The frequent involvement of irregular forces in recent conflicts has made the process of obtaining support of some nations for the two protocols more difficult. Nevertheless, some 73 nations have now ratified protocol I and 66 have ratified protocol II. The full ramifications of Australia becoming party to the protocols for the Australian Defence Force and for our civil defence arrangements have been exhaustively examined by the relevant authorities. That examination has revealed no reason for Australia not to proceed to ratification. Indeed, there is every reason to ratify and to encourage other nations to do likewise. I have already mentioned the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the development of the protocols. I should also like to take this opportunity to make special mention of the valuable contribution of the Australian Red Cross Society in this regard. A joint Government and Australian Red Cross Society Committee has been formed to discharge our obligations under the Geneva conventions to disseminate information. The Committee will provide a vehicle for carrying out similar activities in relation to the protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House amends the Geneva Conventions Act 1957, the principal Act, to give effect to Australia's obligations under protocol I. I turn to a brief examination of those clauses of the Bill dealing directly with individual articles of protocol I. Firstly, clause 5 of the Bill incorporates into the principal Act the `grave breaches' which, under the protocol, are required to be punished. These `grave breaches' are to be found in article 11 and in paragraphs (2) and (3) and (4) of article 85 of the protocol. They include such acts as physical mutilations and medical experimentation involving prisoners of war or refugees and indiscriminate attacks involving excessive loss of life in the civilian population. Clause 6 provides for a certificate under the hand of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade certifying as to any relevant matter to be taken as prima facie evidence of that matter in any prosecution for a `grave breach'. This restates the existing status of such a certificate. Clause 7 vests jurisdiction in State Supreme Courts to hear an application from a person who claims to be a prisoner of war for a declaration of his or her status. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to stress again the importance the Government places on Australia's ratification of these instruments. Despite their limitations, they do provide some measure of humanitarian protection for the victims of armed conflicts. Whatever can be done in this context should, I believe, receive general support. I commend the Bill to the House. I table the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-(6.04)-All I want to do at the second reading stage now is to make some reference to the contributions that were made by honourable members on both sides of the House and to express my appreciation for the contributions that were made. Those members who participated in the debate would appreciate that the Deputy Speakers who occupied the chair on that occasion exercised a great deal of tolerance and showed a great deal of indulgence and made it possible for them, within the wording of the Bill, to range fairly widely over a great variety of issues which were related to transport. I think it is valuable on occasions for a Bill of this kind to come before the chamber in order to give members that opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were a number of questions that were raised, though, and I would like to respond to them. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) sought an assurance from the Government that it would not take advantage of these amendments so as to prejudice in any way the opportunity that would be available under the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 to large passenger ferries. Of course, everyone realises that the chief concern is with the large ferries that are operating across Bass Strait. I would just like to draw the attention of the honourable member for Richmond and the House to the part in my second reading speech where, although I said that the focus of the Act was substantial cargo carrying ships-that is, ships over 60 metres in length-I also said that the amended Act would still enable a large ferry operation to qualify for a grant, provided that ferry operation carried a significant amount of cargo in addition to its passengers. </PARA>
<PARA> That question was pursued subsequently by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), who wanted further clarification as to exactly what was meant by `a significant amount of cargo'. What we have done there is to include that provision not to exclude ships that would otherwise qualify but to make sure that some ships that should clearly qualify could be included. That specifically refers to the large ferries that operate across Bass Strait. The words `a significant amount of cargo' are deliberately vague to the extent that it makes it possible for those ferries to be included for the capital grants simply because they take passengers' motor cars as well. That will be sufficient cargo for the purpose of the operation of that particular Bill and for the provision of those capital grants. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a question raised by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who, as a result of a trip he made to Antarctica, expressed concern about the amount of pollution that might take place down there. I would like to reassure the honourable member that annexe V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships-MARPOL-will apply to voyages to the Antarctic when that annexe comes into force, and of course it will be implemented by Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those were the most important individual questions which were raised by honourable members. Again, I want to express my thanks for the contributions that were made. In closing, I want to make this comment. Although the particular Bill dealt with amendments to a number of Acts, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), the honourable member for Throsby and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) in their contributions emphasised the importance of the legislation to the third term agenda of the Hawke Government. Of course, that is concerned with the whole question of restructuring. I know we all appreciate and understand the importance of transport development and the integration and the development of an efficient coordinated transport system. So I thank those honourable members for their contributions. I also want to express my appreciation to the honourable member for Richmond, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for their contributions to the debate as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the opportunity to have a full debate on this very important area of aged care and disabled persons which is provided by the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. The speakers list certainly indicates that that full debate will occur. We were denied that opportunity in 1988 when the guillotine was applied to similar legislation. On that occasion we had only about three-quarters of an hour to debate what was a very important topic. I said at the time that that indicated the priority that this Government gives aged care and disabled persons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The explanatory memorandum to this Bill quite adequately explains its intention. It is part of a staged development of altered care in this area. Basically, the Bill sets out to proceed to needs based planning with regard to applications for additional hostel care. It proposes to turn away from the submission model of previous years. This concept has been in vogue for the last 18 months. In fact, very recently we were able to look at the new procedure with regard to the establishment of an aged persons hostel in Sarina. Approval has just been given for that hostel under the new guidelines that are incorporated in this Bill. I am very happy to say that it has proceeded very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> Another Government proposal that will now be cemented is to provide 60 hostel places for every 1,000 frail aged persons. At the same time, nursing bed availability will be reduced from the present figure of about 70,000 beds to about 45,000 by the time the program is completed. Forty such nursing home beds will be available for every 1,000 frail aged persons. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to indicate what a substantial reduction in nursing home beds will occur as a result of this measure. As at 30 June 1988, there were 1,176,195 persons over the age of 70. On that basis, 70,560 hostel accommodation units would be required. Only 43,004 of those units were available at the end of June, thus leaving a deficiency of 27,556 units. There will be a substantial reduction in the number of existing nursing home beds. Currently, 72,016 such beds are provided. The number required under the formula of 40 beds per 1,000 aged persons is 47,004, thus leaving a surplus to be reduced of 25,072. The Bill also provides for approval-in-principle arrangements. This makes a lot of sense, as owners and potential operators can arrange sufficient capital and recurrent funding to construct hostels. It will also improve financial management. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a loosening of the definition of an `eligible person'. The Bill provides for individual entitlement to respite care services of 63 days in any one hostel. It removes the more severe obligation that was in place in the past. Owners will be allowed to have funds borrowed against a project taken into account when calculating the amount of capital grant in relation to a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> This is part of a 10-year plan that the Government implemented in 1986. The 10-year plan has eight stages. Basically, we are now looking at the fifth stage of that plan. The Opposition approved the direction taken by the Government in the amendments to the original legislation. In the 1986-87 Budget the Government made a commitment to begin the process of redistributing resources for the care of aged people from nursing homes to alternative, less institutional forms of residential care and community care services. The formula that I mentioned previously means that 900 out of every 1,000 frail aged persons will be accommodated in their own home environment. We agree with that approach. The 1986-87 commitment was that there would be an improvement of approximately $24m in 1986-87 expenditure; $80m in 1987-88; and $150m in 1988-89. Those figures look good, but we must realise that they are not indexed for inflation. The amounts cited are not in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the program that is envisaged and also at the number of aged person's expressed as a percentage of the population, by the year 2020, one sees that there will be a substantial increase in the percentage of frail aged in the community. We believe that the Government is not looking sufficiently far down the path to cater for that need. In connection with the additional expenditure, regulation and cost factors that will have to be borne by some of these homes, we say that the whole package does not take into consideration the likely breakdown of the system because of many service providers being pushed to the wall due to unnecessary regulation by and confrontation with the Government. We have found that to be a major concern within the industry. The major change has been to move away from deficit funding to specific subsidies. This procedure is on course. We have no argument with that philosophy. We will indicate during the course of this debate that we have major problems with the method of change. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the concern within the community in regard to many matters. As the shadow Minister for community services and aged care my time seems to be taken up with answering these concerns. I have with me examples of some of the concerns that are expressed in the community. As recently as 20 February I received quite a lot of correspondence from a home in Tasmania. The comments made-obviously, it is an attempt to acquaint me with its problem-are that it is basically a nursing home for dementia patients. It sees numerous nursing hours being stripped from it by this legislation, to the extent that it cannot give the same quality of care to the patients at the cost that they are used to because the refunds are not sufficient. This is a problem within the industry. No consideration is being given by the Government to what will happen to a dementia patient who is categorised as being in need of a low nursing hour-care ratio, having regard to the very high amount of supervision that is required. The nursing home states:</PARA>
<PARA>The only way a smaller number of staff-</PARA>
<PARA>which will be necessary under the arrangements-</PARA>
<PARA>can manage 48 dementia patients would be to have them heavily sedated or restrained. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members: Is that improving the quality of care of our aged persons? Is it improving their quality of life? Of course, the answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern relates to disabled persons. Again, I stress that while this Bill directly concerns nursing homes and hostels, there is a major concern in the constituency about disabled persons. I note that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), whose electorate is in Queensland, will follow me in this debate. I understand that he has been approached by the Endeavour Foundation and that he has given that organisation a sympathetic hearing. There seems to be no real understanding on the part of the Government, the bureaucrats or departmental officers as to the tremendous range of intellectually handicapped persons who are fostered by the Endeavour Foundation and the Challenge Foundation. It is of major concern to such voluntary organisations that have provided that care in the past that they are being asked, in a confrontationist manner, to move away from providing the services they have offered in the past and to make way for other, more recent state of the art types of treatment. It is also of major concern to parents. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to know where the pressure comes from in this regard. These organisations are being asked to deprive themselves of financial reserves and buffers, which makes them mainly dependent on government payments. I have just received a letter from an organisation that does not mind being named. The North Queensland Society for Crippled Children found last Friday that its advance subsidy payment for the next month had not arrived. It had to go into overdraft last Friday to pay its wages bill of $36,000. This is not the first time this has happened. This organisation has written to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seeking to obtain a guarantee that in the future moneys will be paid as arranged at the appropriate time. It is not good enough for people who have a major concern in this area, who are trying to maintain that quality of care that I was talking about, to be frustrated in their endeavours by having to arrange gap finance to provide for their ongoing commitments, for which an advance should have been received from the Government. This is happening not only in this case but in many others. I understand that that payment will probably be made by tomorrow, one week after it was meant to be made. This is a repeat occurrence. I think the honourable member who is to follow me will indicate that this is causing concern in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also received information from various church groups throughout Australia which are concerned about being asked to comply with the more recent general provisions implemented by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) in connection with originally non-government funded hostels. In spite of their contractual arrangements, they are now being forced to accept a 20 per cent quota of financially disadvantaged persons. On the surface this seems to be a Government philosophy with which we do not disagree, but where contractual arrangements exist it is impossible to ask those hostels to break those arrangements under some trusting agreement that the Government will look after them in the long run. If I have time, I will address myself to that matter later. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern within the community. I can only stress that this concern relates to the diminishing quality of life and the quality care of the people who will be placed into these residences and nursing homes in the future. Part of the stress and concern comes back onto the nursing staff and the directors of nursing. All those people who have in the past been driven by dedication and a desire to help the frail aged are, because of reduced nursing hours, being put under tremendous stress, causing a big turnover in staff. </PARA>
<PARA> In one of the letters I have received is a poem about what a nurse sees in one of the frail aged. I will not read it all but it makes rather interesting and sentimental reading. A nursing home resident asked a nurse, `What do you see in me at my age?' I will read a few appropriate words from her reply:</PARA>
<PARA>What do we see you ask, what do we see?</PARA>
<PARA>Yes we are thinking when looking at thee!</PARA>
<PARA>We seem to be hard when we hurry and fuss,</PARA>
<PARA>But there's many of you, and too few of us. </PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We would like for more time to sit by you and talk. </PARA>
<PARA>To bathe and feed you and help you walk. </PARA>
<PARA>To hear of your lives and the things you have done,</PARA>
<PARA>Your childhood, your husband, your daughters, your son. </PARA>
<PARA>But time is against us, there's too much to do . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The concern within the nursing fraternity at the moment and within the constituency that this Bill addresses could not be explained any more vividly than that. We do get complaints, and the main one-I am sorry that the Minister is not at the table-concerns the inability of people in nursing homes and people with disabilities to get time to speak directly to the Minister. There are too many minders between the Minister, the providers, and the residents. There is great frustration and concern. Everything seems to be done within a changing bureaucracy. I say it is a changing bureaucracy because no person seems to be in the same place on consecutive occasions to answer the same type of query. The people going into these arrangements are taking their lives into their hands. When they have discussions with departmental officers and get some agreement, lo and behold, a week later all that is frustrated by a departmental letter indicating disagreement with the arrangements and they are back where they started. I emphasise that this is how the Endeavour Foundation, the Challenge Foundation and the intellectually handicapped are viewing the situation. Their inability to get to the Minister is a great problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is the impracticality of the guidelines issued by the Government in the instrumentation of legislation that we as the Opposition agreed to. These guidelines are very difficult to follow. For instance, there is a guideline that says there should be only one service per centre in the disabilities area. That raises a lot of problems. If the severely intellectually handicapped are exposed to the work face that will cause problems, yet that is suggested in one of the guidelines. Another guideline says that these people should be pushed further into the community. Some of the residents would not want to be pushed any further into the community as they are more than happy to associate with their own kind in the homes currently provided for them. The Challenge Foundation in New South Wales calculated that a change from the present system, under which Challenge quite adequately caters for these people, to put them into the community on a smaller grouping basis that would need more care and supervision, could cost up to four times more than the present cost. The Government is saying that in the disabilities area it will provide twice the present amount over a period of years, yet in this one instance the fulfilment of the Government's requirements will cost four times as much. </PARA>

<PARA> I have said that what was state of the art four years ago is no longer state of the art. This in itself is rather expensive. We are concerned now that the present state of the art may contain mistakes-I am not saying there are-which will have a lasting impact not only on the clients and their quality of care, but also on the providers and the community. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) asked who will pay the costs. It is the community and the clients themselves who will pay the costs. There is a consistent theme of no appreciation by the Government that the services required within this field require a coordinated and cooperative effort, as funding is only part of the requirement for the service delivery. I think we agree that 10 per cent of the services should be delivered by the Government. The people who provide the services are merely those in the field who provide the facilities and make sure that the establishments work. I think the Government has to realise that, if morale in that sector is not lifted, the quality of care and quality of life that I mentioned before will diminish. I think everybody in this chamber would agree that a tremendous contribution is being made by the volunteers and the charitable and religious organisations, quite apart from the funding that is being provided by the community and by the Government. The Government has to realise that it cannot, by partly funding arrangements for a service which it should deliver, regulate and control the whole industry as it is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> One other consistent theme is that the private sector, the capital sector, is not welcome in this area as it might have been under the Fraser Government. We see Government measures to assume control as a problem. There is also a lack of ministerial consultation and some politicians, including Ministers, lack face-to-face experience. They cannot get a real appreciation of the concern of the industry and what the industry is about. In some quarters this is causing more than apprehension. We might call it a crisis situation. There is a feeling of despair about what is being done. I reiterate that the Minister should get out and have a good look at what is happening in the area he is expected to control and to work in. There is probably no greater example of this than the manner in which the Minister is determined to stay indoors and send his people out to deliver the program. I refer to the recent publication by Chris Ronalds entitled I'm Still an Individual. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I'm Still an Individual by Chris Ronalds is one that the industry still feels very deeply about. There are many reasons for this. It is more than apparent that the Minister, in moving to stage 5, was looking at user rights. The Act said that he would be. If one were to commission somebody to give a very predictable report one would choose somebody with the qualifications of this particular author. Not that we question her qualifications or the position that she holds, but we question the fact that it was a sole authorship, not a multiple or a joint authorship, which it should have been. If one wanted someone who gave a predictable answer one would choose somebody who was a leading Sydney human rights lawyer with a close involvement in the development of anti-discrimination laws. One would choose someone who had worked for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in writing a report on consumer redress and being an author of many publications, including the green paper on affirmative action for women and equal opportunities for women. She also advised the Prime Minister on sex discrimination. The Government did not have the benefit of some balance between the public sector and the private sector. User rights will now be implemented in such a fashion-because of the extra cost and pressure on the establishment and the fact that she has failed to reveal the means of future funding to correct some of the anomalies mentioned in the report-that the quality of life of the residents will be further infringed upon. Further regulation will put more pressure on the providers for end costs to provide the services. We have seen a contrived plan to arrive at an already established result. The further implementation of the recommendations will hinder and hold back user rights; not further them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention one of the comments made in that report. Chris Ronalds indicated that a person leaving a normal family home and going into a hostel had taken a canary that shed feathers because of the stress involved. I cannot understand how a canary's stress has anything to do with user rights and the particular attitudes that were being mentioned. That was one of the aspects that she took up with great gusto. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to address is the funding limits which the Government is putting on nursing homes but more particularly on the private sector. There is a hidden agenda in this legislation, both in the disabilities area and also in the aged persons area, to get rid of the private sector-the capitalists. We must appreciate that in the provision of this care there are many people-such as church bodies, religious bodies and charitable bodies-providing those services who are not capitalists and who are being put under pressure. One of the pressures is the limit set under the care aggregate module (CAM) and the standard aggregate module (SAM) funding. Some people suggest that CAM really means caring attitude is missing by this Government. Nursing hours have been diminished in order to fit within the limits of what they are expected to do. Therefore the cost will go up and the level of care will come down. There is a big disparity between States in the actual cost of providing these services and what the providers get back. This is particularly noticeable in Victoria and New South Wales. They have to adhere to higher State standards of nursing. They are therefore obliged to provide the nursing hours whereby the particular categories of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 do not allow that recovery to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> SAM's relationship to its value per daily subsidy is $29.07. Areas within the private sector estimate that, with a 30-bed capacity, the cost of supplying those SAM ingredients is $37.16. With a 60-bed nursing home it is $31.94. That is nearly $3 short, at the very best, of the recovery amount. The difficulty with SAM is that the Minister and the Government will not indicate what it is meant to cover. It will not measure a nursing home's profit. It is stated that SAM is an average taken over Australia of the component of maintaining the administrative costs within an establishment. The fact that there is a lot of voluntary work done was not taken into account in that calculation. Many years ago I was the honorary auditor of a nursing home. Those costs would not be included. Voluntary hours that many people put into care that will now have to be paid for has established a SAM component far too low for the actual costs within the establishments. Yet they have not been able to address it. </PARA>
<PARA> In connection with the setting up of CAM, I have been told that in categories 1, 2 and 3 there is such a pressure on nursing homes to maintain these categories at the higher rates of recovery in order to break even that 4's and 5's will have to be catered for in hostels. I understand that this is the Government's intention. It is all very well to say that the hostels will cope. I will give an example of what this means. If a category 4 person is put into a nursing home in Queensland, the recovery on a daily basis would be $24.50 for CAM and $29.07 for SAM, a total of about $53. If they are then treated in a hostel, the best recovery they can make is $14.35 for personal care and a hostel subsidy of $2.25, totalling $16.60. This is about $34 less than, or one-third of, the cost of recovery in the place in which they should be established. Yet, the pressure on funding means that those assessed under categories 4 and 5 will go into hostels. Frankly, the hostels are not established to cater for dementia patients-the person who is wandering-unless, as I mentioned earlier in the speech, they are in Hobart or Launceston and are sedated and drugged so that they do not wander and require supervision. All in all, there is great pressure on nursing homes in this and other regards. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of the geriatric assessment teams depends on the composition of the assessment team as it goes from one region to another. The Government's mix of 60/40/900 for every 1,000 frail aged indicates that if it has these sums wrong-even on the mixture of hostels and nursing homes-in a period of 10 years it will phase out nursing homes at a time when it might be found that it should have been encouraging the establishment or at least the retention of those nursing homes. The Government might find it lacked vision as to the crisis facing the ageing population. If the Government has made a mistake on that, things will be difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> In the committee stage I wish to address some remarks, particularly to section 10fa. At this stage, I move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House-</PARA>
<PARA>(1) notes the concerns of service-providers in adhering to the changed arrangements, at the lack of funding, and at the lack of flexibility in the arrangements which are diminishing the quality of care to our aged; and</PARA>
<PARA>(2) expresses its concern at the diminishing morale of the providers of services to the aged because of various Government initiatives, particularly the commissioning of the report I'm Still an Individual'. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a hidden agenda. The morale of the people providing the services is at an all-time low. If we look into the future, particularly down the road to the year 2020, when the frail aged will make up a much larger proportion of our population, we can see the potential for disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and, although there were certain aspects of his speech with which I certainly agreed, I cannot countenance the conspiracy theories which the Opposition always seem apt to grasp at about hidden agendas being the motive for legislation. There is no hidden agenda in the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill or in the whole scheme of the Government's policies on the aged or the disabled. The straight forward agenda is putting in place a system which will serve Australia into the next century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, Australia is facing a very serious change, that is, the ageing of the population. Through a combination of longer life spans and lower birth rates, Australia is steadily ageing. While our immigration program, to a limited extent, helps lower the nation's median age, the trend will continue so that by the year 2040 at least 20 per cent of Australia's population will be aged 65 or over. </PARA>
<PARA> Growing with the sheer number of our elderly is a community expectation about the lifestyle the retired should be able to enjoy. This expectation is rising. People expect, through better health services, to be more active in their later years. They are keen to contribute to society, to their community. They wish to engage in recreation. Generally, they want a full and complete life. Life does not end when one leaves the work force or meets retirement age. The average person, having reached retirement, can look forward to at least another 15 to 20 years after leaving the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> This change in Australian society poses an enormous challenge for government. The challenge is to provide financial security to enable the elderly to have an independent and self-determining life style. In response to these very major challenges, the Hawke Government has introduced a number of fundamental reforms which have set Australia firmly down the path of meeting the demands of at least the next 20 years. Firstly, the Government has conducted an extensive review of the existing aged care framework to judge whether it is adequate and cost effective and, most importantly, whether it provides the user, the elderly themselves, with what they actually want. This review revealed that Australia was well serviced in nursing homes but that this sector, valuable as it is, cannot cater for the vast majority of the population. It is simply a question of fact that Australia had a situation in which the vast bulk of government funding was going into the nursing home sector, yet the number involved in that sector was something like 7 per cent. So the bulk of the money was going to service 7 per cent of the elderly population, with the other 93 per cent largely missing out on direct government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> This review also revealed a few other fundamental facts, the most important being that the elderly themselves wish to remain in their homes as long as possible, or at least within their own community. Most, of course, would not have any contact in the normal course of events with a nursing home. Therefore, the Government has quite rightly and correctly moved to broaden the choices open to people, to make remaining in the family home a viable option, and to provide a massive boost to the hostel sector, which provides security and independence but allows people to stay within their own communities. In following through on these reforms, the Government introduced the extremely important home and community care (HACC) program. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bowman acknowledges, it is a top program. I know he has strongly supported many projects in his own electorate under the HACC program. It is a significant and innovative reform in aged and disabled care. Within my electorate there is a wide range of services which are funded under this program. They include frail aged and younger disabled day care centres on Bribie Island and Petrie within the Pine Rivers Shire; blue nursing services at Caboolture, Kilcoy and Crows Nest; home care services at Montville; support of the Queensland Government's community nurse for the Pine Rivers and Caboolture shires; and extensive help to meals on wheels at Bribie Island, Pine Rivers, Woodford, Yarraman, Caboolture, Deception Bay, Beerwah, Kilcoy and Maleny. All these services, which are common throughout Australia-every honourable member could outline similar services that exist in his or her electorate-provide a valuable adjunct to, and are a valuable part of, the Government's entire approach to aged care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fundamental to the support services which enable people to stay within their own communities and within their own homes is the question of financial security. While I will not detail those measures, they are important to note as they fit into the context in which this Bill is being debated. For instance, the level of the basic pension has increased from 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1983 to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings now. There has been a massive increase in the access to superannuation amongst the wider work force through the accord and national wage decisions. This will provide a much greater secured retirement income for a large part of the population. That did not exist prior to the election of this Government. We have reformed the superannuation tax system so that superannuation will remain a viable option in the future to provide retirement incomes. Currently, the Government is considering its approach to the Cass Review of Social Security as a means of providing pensioners generally, but especially the elderly, with an adequate standard of living. The current policies being decided upon will put into place the framework to provide financial security for the vast majority of the elderly who have no income other than the age pension. It is within this overall context of reform of care for the aged that this legislation has to be viewed. Within that context the legislation is relatively mechanical, but it is still important in that it implements part of the Government's strategy for hostels and nursing homes, which in turn has its genesis in the recommendations of the nursing homes and hostels review. </PARA>
<PARA> The main features of the Bill include the regularisation of the approval process for hostels by allowing the relevant Minister to prescribe a maximum number of places for approval in each State and each region within each State. It moves to ensure that eligible persons, as defined in the legislation, are entitled to the hostel places for which funding is supplied. It is important to ensure that the money will serve those in need. It is another hallmark of this Government to ensure that government funding goes first to those in need. In terms of nursing homes, the legislation allows money which was borrowed from either State or Commonwealth government sources to be taken into account when calculating the amount of capital grant in relation to a nursing home. As the honourable member for Dawson pointed out, the allocation of hostel and nursing home places is determined on the basis of the objective of 100 residential care places for every 1,000 people aged 70 or over, divided into 60 places in hostel care and 40 nursing home beds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the allocation of hostel and nursing home places specified by clause 9 of the Bill on which I wish to concentrate the rest of my speech. The approval process, as spelt out in clause 9, goes something like this: the Minister will set the upper limits for each region within the State. In a State such as Queensland there are some 13 separate regions which are considered and looked at in terms of the adequacy of hostel and nursing home care. In determining these upper limits the Minister will take particular regard of the advice of the aged care advisory committees which operate in each of the States. These committees are composed of a group of industry representatives as well as representatives from the State government and the relevant Commonwealth department. These committees in turn, naturally enough, will take their advice from the Department of Community Services and Health in determining their assessments on the needs of each of the regions. This advice, which the Department relies on, is based on a community and regional profile developed by departmental officers. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate the two regions basically involved are called Moreton North and Moreton West. I will explain the situation as far as Moreton North is concerned. Moreton North comprises the local authority areas of Caboolture, Pine Rivers, Redcliffe, Kilcoy, Caloundra, Maroochy and Noosa. Of this, Redcliffe and Noosa are not involved in the Fisher electorate but all or part of the other local authorities do fall within Fisher. The client population of Moreton North is almost 20,000 persons aged 70 or over and over 25,000 people aged between 60 and 69. These figures represent 6.9 per cent of the total population in the region being over 70 and 8.7 per cent being in the 60 to 69 group. Both these percentages are above the Queensland average as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, the growth rate in this entire region is very much higher than that experienced throughout Queensland and the rest of Australia. In terms of the ratio, as I described it earlier, there are some 54 nursing home beds per thousand and some 52.5 hostel places per thousand. Hence, like Queensland and Australia as a whole the number of nursing home beds exceeds the ideal situation while there are insufficient hostel places. </PARA>
<PARA> Within Moreton North, as I specified, there is the Shire of Caboolture. There are some concerns in relation to the allocation of hostel and nursing home beds touched upon by this Bill which are clearly demonstrated in the Caboolture Shire. It should be explained that local authority areas are used to decide whether a particular area has sufficient beds or hostel places to determine allocations and how easy it is to get access to these places. Local authorities are used as a measure as they are deemed to have some logical community of interest. I suppose that makes a fair bit of sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I have a certain amount of disquiet about the practice of the Department using local authority areas. For instance, in Queensland the boundaries that it relied on were drawn up by a royal commission in the 1880s. They have never really been substantially changed. That is as a result of the Queensland Government's failure to modernise local government in the State but we are now replicating the same failure by relying on these same boundaries for the Commonwealth in determining its allocations under this particular legislation. I think there has to be a bit of flexibility and not simply a reliance on the local government boundaries. Development unfortunately does not recognise these boundaries. It crosses boundaries and developments within local authority areas will greatly vary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Caboolture Shire has an over 70 population of 2,770 and a 60 to 69 years of age population of 4,350. This puts the percentage figures at 5.7 per cent for the over 70s group and 8.9 per cent for the 60 to 69 group. The first figure is lower than the region and State average while the second is slightly higher than the region average and reasonably higher than the State average. In terms of the ratio the Shire is overbedded for nursing homes but about right for hostels. However, there are problems. The Caboolture local authority area, because of its size, has been broken down into two areas. The first is called Caboolture A which comprises Caboolture itself and areas like Deception Bay, Burpengary and Morayfield. Caboolture B comprises Bribie Island, Beachmere and Donnybrook. Due to the different types of histories and developments within the Caboolture Shire, the township of Caboolture A is a much younger area than Caboolture B which has been a traditional retirement area. Hence, some 8.5 per cent of the Caboolture B population is over 70 while something like 14 per cent is in the 60 to 69 group. Both these figures are significantly above the regional and State averages. However, through a trick of history the vast bulk of the nursing home and hostel care is in the other area. </PARA>
<PARA> To compound the problem there are some 55 nursing home beds and 116 hostel places in the Caboolture Shire which are under the control of the Returned Services League in the RSL War Veterans Home. The home is one of two such homes in Queensland. They are designed to, and indeed very much do, serve the needs of veterans. This is very much to be applauded. But unfortunately for the elderly and disabled of the Caboolture Shire the veterans are drawn not only from all of Queensland but from throughout Australia. The end result is that while some shire residents gain access to the home, its reason for existence is to serve the aged veteran community of Queensland and not as such the elderly of the Caboolture Shire or even the Moreton North region. If the home were discounted when determining the ratio the situation for the shire would drastically change. It would be shown to be very much underserviced. For instance, there would be only 52 hostel places for 2,770 people over 70 years of age and roughly only 90 nursing home places. In the past the Department, despite my best efforts, has resisted moves to discount the presence of the war veterans home. However, I am now pleased to report that the recent indication in drawing up the profile for the area is that the war veterans facility will not be counted in the particular shire or region. This is important because since the home serves veterans throughout the State of Queensland and not just the region it really is cloaking a very much underserviced community. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope as a result of these changes that there is sufficient flexibility in this legislation and the Minister can recognise the problems so that the Caboolture B area, particularly Bribie Island, will be understood to be underserviced, to have poor access to services in other areas and will receive some sympathetic consideration in the next funding round. I must in fairness say that in the last funding round the Pine Rivers Shire, which was very much underserviced, received an incredible boost. There was a 40-bed nursing home approved for the Lawnton home, a 47 bed nursing home for the Petrie-Kallangur area and some two hostels supplying 90 places again in the Petrie and Kallangur areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, what we have is a Bill which, while it appears to do little, is important because it puts into place and formalises the approval process for hostel places and puts that in line with the same procedure for nursing homes. That is a significant part of the Government's path in moving towards an overall aged care policy. There are some outstanding issues to be resolved concerning the issue of aged care. I do not think the Government pretends to have solved them all. Some of the admittedly localised problems which I have raised tonight represent the overall problem in determining where actual hostels and nursing homes should go, what criteria should be used in deciding where they go and what areas should be used as a basic unit. However, the Bill is significant evidence of the Government's comprehensive approach to aged care issues and should be applauded and supported by the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill concerns itself with Federal Government planning arrangements in the area of nursing home and hostel accommodation and respite care. It is part of a process of increased subsidy targeting and significantly shifting the balance of funding from nursing home beds to hostel beds. It also concerns itself with the financial planning and management parameters for accommodation and care providers. As the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), indicated earlier, the coalition will not be opposing the Bill although it does have some basic concerns about the policy approach to aged accommodation being adopted by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ageing of the population of Australia is now a truism for welfare politics in this country. As the outstanding retirement policy document prepared by my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) notes, by the year 2010 the number of Australians over 45 years of age will be between 8.5 and 8.7 million, or about 40 per cent of the population. That represents a growth in that age group of 70 per cent over that period. As we can see in this Bill, the Government is about restructuring the funding of aged care and accommodation to ensure sensible and equitable targeting of assistance and to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public funding in this area. Of course, the coalition supports any objective along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the coalition has two main concerns. Firstly, we are concerned that the Government's policy and its approach as reflected in this Bill show that it is getting it only half right. It has no clear cut strategy; indeed, I believe it is antipathetic towards the involvement of the private sector in providing these services. The coalition's second concern is the insensitivity of the Government and of the Canberra bureaucracy which so often controls the Government. There is a lack of concern for aged citizens, and aged citizens in homes and hostels in particular. The very factor that forces the Government to address efficiency, effectiveness and targeting-the limited funds available to government and competing and equally worthy social and political programs-should also make it clear to objective and prudent policy makers that the private sector must play the significant role in meeting future accommodation and care needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the greatest respect for the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) but it should come as no surprise-and I make this point without malice-that a Minister who declares himself a socialist, and who is served by a junior Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) who is even further to the left ideologically, should have a blind spot when it comes to the private sector provision of services. When a government's resource base is restricted and when a service can be provided at the same quality level, and often at a higher quality level, with less of a cost burden on the public purse and the taxpayer, it is simply counterproductive and a betrayal of the interests of the aged persons involved not to develop legislation and funding policies which utilise and encourage the private sector. The legislative opportunity to address that issue has not been taken; nor has the opportunity been taken to deal with the frustrating bureaucracy associated with a centralised public sector biased community service department. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting not just that this Government is ignoring the private sector; I cannot help getting the impression that it is quite hostile towards it. I refer honourable members to this legislation and the impact of the intended shift in priorities from nursing homes to hostels. Estimates by the coalition suggest that to reach the Government's objective of a hostel to nursing home bed ratio of 60 : 40, the private sector is to be forced to make up the bulk of the 25,000 bed cost on the nursing home side of the equation. The Bill also excludes private hostels from future capital funding. One has only to consider school funding policy to realise that eliminating capital funding to private sector service providers is cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. Capital funding support for private schools allows for facility and schooling provision at lower costs to the taxpayer than full public sector projects cost. The same applies to hostels. Of course one is aware of the criminal exploitation and neglect of clients by a few private sector operators, but that issue raises the question not of a continued role for the private sector but of the adequacy of regulatory checks of service provision and standards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are there but are not being policed well enough. That is the real problem. The issue of the 60 : 40 nursing home to hostel bed ratio objective also raises the question of speed of change. I understand the private sector service providers see a 50 : 50 ratio as a medium term traditional objective. The point is that the impact of such a pace of change is not just on the private owners and operators but unavoidably on their clients, who experience insecurity and service reduction to the extent that the squeeze is put on their home and hostel operators. It is at this point that we come to the question of the Government's and Canberra's sensitivity to the need for stability and security to be provided for our senior citizens. One of the objectives of the retirement policy prepared by the honourable member for Bradfield is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A stable and simple legislative and administrative environment in which people can plan their retirement income with confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>In passing I refer honourable members and those listening to this debate to that retirement policy. It is a very prudent, innovative and worthwhile policy. It should go without saying that the legislative and administrative environment affecting aged and frail people should be stable and simple. It must be restated as a policy objective, however, because of the distrust and cynicism within the community arising from this Government's ad hoc and insensitive management of changes affecting the aged, their carers and their relatives over the last few years. There is grave concern. Is it any wonder that we have this distrust and cynicism because there have been so many changes? Every member in this place will recall occasions over the last couple of years when distressed senior citizens or their children have rung to try to get advice or assistance concerning fee increases ahead of subsidy catch-ups. This is one of the biggest problems confronting people in these situations, and a very worrying one indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Those increases, together with the cuts to pharmaceutical benefits for many aged persons, have destroyed the confidence that senior citizens once had in government and in the community. This is a very serious situation that is being added to in some way-though not necessarily a major way-by this Bill. </PARA>

They have contributed to the national welfare fund and general revenue and now seek basic income and care maintenance from those funds. They see it as a matter of honour, giving the senior citizen his or her due before less basic, voter oriented social expenditure is authorised. That is plain commonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are the perceptions-the legitimate perceptions-which have generated the support for protest movements such as Grey Power. It goes without saying that Grey Power is a false hope, and in some areas a fraud. I say that advisedly. It is a false hope because senior citizens have visions for their country which include concerns for defence, education, infrastructure maintenance, health and welfare for their children and grandchildren, the land and our environment. Such visions can be approximated only by governments with comprehensive and integrated programs. Single issue parties cannot form such governments. Of course, they can totally destabilise all government. In some areas, Grey Power is a fraud because it is yet one more organisational outlet for the subverters of trust and democracy such as the League of Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to understand the development of resentment and distrust which has found its expression in Grey Power, we need only look at the inadequacies, the incompetence and the insensitivity of Government policy as it affects our senior citizens and their families. I have suggested that this piece of legislation is a continuation of such Government policy. It is so, more because it needs policy and legislative supplementation than because of inherent defects. As a consequence, the shadow Minister has moved an amendment. Therefore, this should be taken by the Government as an opportunity to review its policies for the aged comprehensively and beyond its socialist ideologies which have been so damaging. It needs to do this not with a view to winning voters but because that is what our senior citizens have as their right and proper due. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to contribute to this debate on the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. The Bill provides another step in this Government's ongoing process of reform in this area of aged care, and in particular reform of the nursing home and hostel system which operates in this country. The Bill is part of the Government's new deal for aged people which I know the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) has worked on tirelessly since taking on that ministry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am discussing the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, I will make just a few remarks on the contribution from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). He criticised the Minister quite unfairly when he said that he believes that there has been some discrimination against the private sector providers. I do not believe that to be the case. If the private sector providers believe that, I am sure that the Minister took that into consideration and is less worried about the needs and aspirations of the private sector providers than about those of our aged community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a good point, as the honourable member for Fisher says. He knows all about the elderly because he has a lot of them in his electorate, as I do. The honourable member for Macquarie talked about the retirement policy of the coalition. I for one am not really concerned with the retirement policy of the coalition because I think it will be a very long time before it has the opportunity to implement it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reject the accusation that this Government in some way is not concerned about the elderly in our community. It would be fair to say that there is some confusion amongst the elderly community because of some changes that have been made over the last couple of years in this area. That is fair enough; that confusion is there. Certainly, as people get older, they do not want to be worried about changes. But, whether it be on the question of the economy or of aged care, this Government has gone about restructuring so that we can look to the future. It is quite true that the population is ageing. It is quite true that it will become a bigger and bigger problem for this country and for whatever government of whatever persuasion. But, if we do not start doing something about it now, nothing will happen. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is one of the measures that are being adopted by this Government to try to do something about it. As emphasised by my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), this Government is very cognisant of the needs of our elderly community. I have a very deep interest in the care and the general well-being of our elderly community-or our senior citizens, as I like to call them. Perhaps it goes back to my ethnic origin. As I proudly stated in my first speech in this House, people of Italian background are treated almost with reverence as they grow old. Indeed, we keep them in the home. We do that because they believe that they then have more dignity and more independence. Of course, some of them cannot be kept in the home and eventually they have to go into nursing homes. What this Government is trying to do is to give that sort of dignity, that sort of independence, to members of our elderly community by making it easier for them to go into hostel accommodation, which is the next best thing to staying at home with their children or whoever else is prepared to look after them. </PARA>
<PARA> As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, having been on the task force also, I had the benefit of being one of the 11 members of the task force set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to look into retirement incomes. As a result, I have been running around the country-while, I suppose, a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the House have been on holidays-speaking to thousands of elderly citizens and getting their views on what needs to be done to improve generally their lot. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has just walked in. He was also on the Prime Minister's task force and he knows full well what the position is because we went out and listened to those people. That is how much we do not care about them! We have gone out and listened to them-not just talked about them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe. Since 1986, in particular when the nursing homes and hostels review was released, the Government has been developing a total and integrated aged care policy. This Government has recognised the vital importance of this sector of the community and is responding to the need that exists to reform the living conditions and quality of life of aged and disabled persons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I wish to speak specifically on the Bill but also to draw on examples from within my Federal electorate of Bowman of just how the Government's policy is working to provide additional resources in areas of need and to improve the conditions of those in this kind of accommodation. There is no doubt that there is significant growth in the number of people seeking nursing home and, in particular, hostel accommodation. Last year the Minister for Housing and Aged Care announced that the Government planned to approve 4,244 new places in 1988-89, 4,723 in 1989-90 and 4,738 in 1990-91. This adds up to a massive 13,705 new places overall, with the overwhelming majority being hostel style accommodation. This is a remarkable plan, particularly considering the economic constraints which this Government has faced and the pressures on it to cut its expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, calls always come from the Opposition to cut expenditure. As I have stated previously in a number of speeches in this House-I think I remember my colleague the honourable member for Dobell saying the same thing yesterday-members of the Opposition are always saying, `Let's cut expenditure here'. They want to give more funds for roads and are prepared to promise anything. But they never tell us where they will cut expenditure. I dare say that it would be from this sort of program. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6J4">Mr SCIACCA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very typical of them. Frankly, I am sick of listening to them when they carry on like that. The Government is also committed to broadening the base of aged care to meet individual needs by expanding the range of care options. Not everyone wants to live in a nursing home, yet not everyone is physically able to live in a hostel. The Government is very much on the right track in encouraging all those who are able to maintain their independence by living in a hostel to do so. As I previously stated, there is a great deal to be said for allowing our elderly, when they get to that situation, to go into a hostel where they can have the dignity and independence that a lot of them need. I will speak later about the report by the Sydney barrister relating to that. I think it was called `I am an Individual'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In December last year those plans began coming to fruition with the announcement of a massive boost in the number of places available for aged people. Grants under the Aged and Disabled Persons Homes Act, which this legislation Bill amends and improves, totalling $102m were announced. That particular round of funding announcements created 2,614 new hostel places, 200 new nursing home places and renovated some 668 places in hostels and nursing homes. In the State of Queensland alone the grant created 578 new hostel places and 67 new nursing home places and will renovate some 288 places. This represented the biggest package of grants for residential aged care ever made by the Commonwealth Government. My electorate benefited, I am very happy to say, from this package and I am certain that it will benefit in the future as a result of these announcements of aged people's accom- modation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in this Bill enable the Commonwealth to ensure that additional places which are created by increased funding such as that announced in December are located where the need exists. Obviously there will be some problems associated with those regions. One was mentioned by the honourable member for Fisher when he talked about the war veterans' home in his electorate. I have received a number of requests from people who are just outside the Moreton region in my electorate, which seems to be the one that is going to get all the places because of its growth. Sometimes these problems occur. I believe they will be looked at by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care if a request is made by local members, and I hope that there can be some flexibility in those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also enables the Government to plan for the recurrent expenditure resulting from subsidies to these newly created places. In this respect the Bill is in line with the Government's policy to target subsidised care service to those aged people who require these services. The area of aged care is one which is expanding rapidly. As our population ages, it is one that will demand increasing resources from the Commonwealth. This Government is committed to improving the lot of aged people, and the level of funding which it has committed itself to and delivered reflects the high level of concern of that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> My Brisbane bayside electorate boasts many quality aged care facilities. The bay environment provides an ideal location for retirement, and this has increased the demand for hostel accommodation in particular beyond that which one would expect from any other area with a similar population. Indeed, there are many people-I am not sure of the exact number, but something like 6,000 or 7,000 alone-in receipt of old age pensions in my electorate. That is a very large percentage of the population. As such, not only do I make sure I look after them, but I know that anyone in his right mind would make sure that they were looked after. That is exactly what we are doing, not for cynical reasons, but because they form a very important part of our community and thus deserve-perhaps not special treatment-to have their needs and concerns looked at very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Minister for Housing and Aged Care visited a number of aged care facilities in my electorate. It was a shame he could not have spent several days visiting all the hostels and nursing homes in the area, but we were very pleased he could spend the time that he did with us. People in those facilities we did go to were very happy too. One of the facilities which he toured with me on that day was Nazareth House in Wynnum. Nazareth House is very much a part of the bayside community and provides care and nursing home facilities as well as hostel accommodation to very many residents. The main administrator in Nazareth House is Sister Frances Ledwich, who runs a very tight ship. The administration facilities are of a very high standard and the organisation fills a very real need in the local community and does an excellent job. </PARA>
<PARA> Within Nazareth House exists a hostel wing known as St Joseph's which at the time of the Minister's visit was in need of considerable extension and redevelopment to bring it up to a standard acceptable under the departmental guidelines. Naturally I supported an application made by Sister Ledwich on behalf of Nazareth House which was in the spirit of the Government's policy on aged care. On 20 December last year the announcement was made by the Minister that he had approved a grant to Nazareth House of over $1.3m to upgrade St Joseph's. The grant will mean that 41 hostel places will be completely upgraded. I can assure the honourable member for Macquarie that people that go to St Joseph's and Nazareth House do not think that this Government is doing nothing to help them in their predicaments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who would the honourable member think? I raise this particular case as an example of the Government's commitment to improving facilities for the aged in our community. Nazareth House and Sister Ledwich recognise the need to improve the facilities to bring them up to the Commonwealth's recommended standards. The Government has put its money where its mouth is and provided the money to upgrade the facilities to the standard which it has set. The original application did not meet those standards and they did not get the money first up; it was their efforts which got them the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to the upgrading of St Joseph's hostel, the electorate of Bowman benefited by the announced construction of a 50-bed hostel in the suburb of Alexandra Hills following submissions from the Churches of Christ. I had the pleasure at the time of the announcement of meeting with a representative from the church, Dr Stewart, at the site of the proposed hostel to discuss the plans with him. The church will receive almost $1.5m to help with the construction. The Government was keen to establish a new service provider in the area, and again it has put its money where its mouth is. </PARA>
<PARA> The $2.8m announced last December for the electorate of Bowman comes on top of substantial grant allocations in the middle of last year. That funding round saw another $81m allocated nationally, $9.6m of which flowed to Queensland for the creation of 314 new hostel places and 70 new nursing home places. In addition to the creation of new places, 30 hostel places were upgraded in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wynnum Blue Nursing Service facility known as Pleasantville in Lindum received $888,000, which will be used to partially fund the replacement of 30 beds in that hostel.

Prior to the announcement I was approached by the architect for the project, Mr John Marsson, who was at that time president of the Cleveland Rotary Club in my electorate, to support the application, which I very happily did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. I know that the honourable member has been doing the same thing in his electorate. One hundred and fourteen new hostel places have been created and 71 upgraded in my area, a remarkable achievement for the Government in just over 20 months. It is the sort of achievement which I know has been repeated in a number of electorates throughout the country. The Government has recognised in the bayside suburbs of Brisbane, as it has throughout the whole of Australia, the very great need for secure, affordable and high quality accommodation for the older members of our community. There continues to be a strong demand in my area for hostel accommodation. Many of the other excellent care providers in the area were disappointed, I know, not to receive grants in the last round of funding. Organisations like Lake Sherrin Homes at Thornlands and the Adventist Retirement Village will continue to receive my strong support in their future funding applications to expand their premises to provide more places for elderly people. Unfortunately, they missed out on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has put much emphasis on the quality of life in aged care facilities. This Bill seeks to better target funding to areas of need, but also to ensure that once an organisation secures funding it will continue to meet the conditions laid down by the Commonwealth about living standards. This is particularly important in the area of nursing homes where residents need ongoing care and attention. It is not unreasonable for the Government to demand that nursing homes and hostels be safe and comfortable. I am pleased that the Commonwealth has devoted significant resources to departmental staff visits to nursing homes to ensure that they are providing good care for their residents. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of aged persons hostels, I congratulate the Minister on his announcement at the end of last year that the Commonwealth would provide a `new deal' for residents and operators of 1,000 aged persons hostels throughout Australia. For the people living in this form of accommodation, their need is not at the level of those living in nursing homes, but ensuring that their quality of life is maintained is nevertheless most important. The new deal entails a doubling of Commonwealth Government capital grants to provide more hostel places and improve access to hostel services for people with low incomes and special needs. The capital funding increase is a particularly remarkable achievement considering the economic difficulties faced by our nation at this time. The improvement of access for lower income earners fits in with the Government's overall strategy of shielding those most in need from the effects of the economic hardship presently facing this country. The new deal will mean ceilings on residents' fees in all hostels funded by the Commonwealth, which will stop the practice of some proprietors charging fees greater than the income of their residents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is on a most important Bill. It is important for one very particular reason, that is, that we are talking about the future well-being and care of so many elderly Australians. We are talking about the well-being and care of our mothers and fathers and grandparents and, ultimately, if we are lucky, we are talking about ourselves, should we live so long. It is an area which touches every sector of our society. It is not a question of `them' and `us'. The elderly are `us' and we are or will be the elderly. Therefore, as I say, this particular legislation is vitally important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a number of excellent nursing homes and hostels in my electorate of Cowper, and I am very pleased to be able to say, without any fear of contradiction, that they are second to none in the service and loving care that they provide for the elderly people who live in them. It is equally true to say that those associated with the management and administration of those hostels and nursing homes are, by and large, very concerned indeed about this new legislation and the agreements on hostel recurrent funding. Of course, it is another story for nursing homes, and there is a great deal of concern there too. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to concentrate initially in the time available to me on the situation regarding the agreements associated with hostel recurrent funding. A careful perusal of the contract and its impact on hostels finds that the agreement is lacking in many respects. There are a number of concerns and issues of great importance to people running hostels. Although enabling legislation was passed in 1987 and the industry has had the opportunity of consultations with departmental officers, individual hostel facilities did not have the opportunity of more than about four weeks to examine the document and determine its impact on their operations before they had to agree to it. The time provided denied them the opportunity to adequately consider the documents and the effect they would have on the hostels and their residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Although some organisations have never charged entry fees, only board and lodging fees as approved, in cases where it has been necessary to impose those entry fees, the controls which the Government is imposing on funding from residents by way of retentions on entry contributions would severely curtail the ability of such organisations to appropriately and adequately refurbish hostel units, provide for repairs and maintenance of the physical structures, replace buildings at the end of their effective economic life and, consequently, provide a high level of care to residents. In short, the new agreement is short-sighted in terms of providing care in the longer term and could certainly impose a cash flow crisis on many managements of hostels. Of course, unfortunately, the people ultimately disadvantaged will be the residents. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 3 (3) (i) (h-j) refers to personal care assessment criteria and, in particular, to a person who has a severe impediment which is not helped by an appropriate aid. Many hostel boards and committees are concerned that practically every impediment can be assisted to some extent by an aid, and thus this criteria will be very difficult to satisfy. It is a truism to say that the staffing hours allocated are inadequate. The resident population of many hostels is becoming increasingly aged and frail aged, and the care that is required means that the prescribed hours are certainly inadequate. Many residents require ongoing reassurance, and the time spent to ensure that these residents are looked after properly and in a compassionate and caring way certainly exceeds the prescribed hours significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> The frailty issue also impacts on the need for night staff, be this on call or on duty. The financial burden of having staff on night shift impacts heavily on hostel budgets. In many facilities the provision of proper cover has not been adequately addressed because of inadequate funds. </PARA>

I would like to suggest that an appropriate transition period should be made available so that hostels could attempt to reach the suggested level in a reasonable time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some hostels are allocated in relatively affluent areas where it is not possible to achieve the level of financially disadvantaged persons prescribed except by attracting residents from outside the community. This can be done, but it is contrary to the Department's desire that residents should be housed in a hostel within their community of interest. That is one desire of the Department that I totally endorse and agree with. One only has to look around my electorate and, I am sure, probably every electorate in Australia, to find a situation where people who are in need of either hostel or nursing home accommodation are being forced to move out of their communities to get it. In Cowper particularly there is an inadequate number of beds available. So instead of being able to stay in a hostel or nursing home within their own environment, within the proximity of their friends and relatives and the situation that they know so well, they are being uprooted and being sent away 50 kilometres or 100 kilometres. This most definitely is not in the best interests of the elderly persons concerned. </PARA>

Of course, if we were really concerned, we would do a lot more than just fiddle around the edges and impose rules and regulations; we would provide more facilities. That is not what we are doing. This Government appears to be dedicated to providing over-regulation. If one speaks to anybody in the aged care industry, whether it be private or public, one will find a very definite response to the proposition that there is too much regulation and not enough time being actually spent on people. As the honourable member for Dawson said, people, particularly in small hostels, are being turned into paper shufflers. This must have an adverse effect on the residents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some older hostels do not meet the Australian architectural standard 1428-1/1988. It is totally unacceptable for hostels to be committed to upgrade their facilities to comply with a standard, even in 15 or 20 years time, without a corresponding guarantee of access to funds to carry out these works. The action of the Commonwealth in controlling retentions for entry contributions is really intolerable when this money is being used to provide better quality accommodation for the residents. That is what it is all about-providing better quality accommodation for the people who are going to live there. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement that boards must produce information in a form determined by the Department is unduly onerous. Many hostels are quite small and cannot afford to employ highly qualified specialist clerical staff. Their efforts are dedicated to caring for frail aged people, not to producing statistical information. Condition 8 (1) is morally indefensible. They cannot and should not have to provide written advice on-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the legal nature of a resident's right to live at the hostel, payment of entry contributions, including administrative fees, respite care booking fees, ongoing fees and entry contribution refund arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a professional responsibility of the legal profession. To make such advice the responsibility of the hostels leaves such organisations not only vulnerable to possible charges of negligence or misrepresentation but also possibly open to litigation if they are in breach of the legal practitioners Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does confuse the residents. It is difficult for many of these elderly people to cope with the day to day stress of life without having this other regulation thrust upon them. Surely, it is appropriate and proper for an intending resident to obtain advice from his or her legal adviser, having first sought appropriate information from the hostel organisation. The hostel should not be forced to provide legal advice. I believe that is totally wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Condition 13 (1) is far too uncertain. It refers to records, but it does not say what records must be kept. It is very difficult for any hostel organisation to agree to that condition when there is no appropriate definition of records as such. Condition 13 (2) concerns many hostels, particularly with regard to the privacy of their residents. They do not wish to comply with the departmental requirements and find themselves in conflict because of the invasion of the residents' privacy. Condition 13 (5) is very embracing. How can a hostel organisation indemnify the Commonwealth to such an extent, solely because the Commonwealth has seen fit to provide some financial assistance towards the conduct of the operation? It is not appropriate that individual hostels of any size be called upon to indemnify the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Hostels have been founded for the specific purpose of caring for the aged and frail aged in our community. While hostel boards are cognisant of the benefit of Commonwealth moneys in assisting with the provision of care for their residents, they are increasingly concerned that the Commonwealth seems determined to turn them into paper shufflers rather than deliverers of care. Their philosophy and modus operandi is such that their residents come first in all their decisions and actions. They find the new agreement onerous and suggestive that they need policing and monitoring of the work they do, when many have operated very successfully for 10 or 20 years. In fact, the President of the Voluntary Care Association of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Mr N. A. Howard, has written to the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) about the Association's concerns in the hostel sector. He has indicated to him that the Government's action has been pursued, despite the warnings of approaching dangers, particularly with regard to the non-profit section. The sector has demonstrated its genuine concern for the well-being of residents within its care, and it has done so over decades. I know that, given a fair go and the opportunity to proceed without over-regulation, it will continue to do so for a very long time. But the present Government's restrictions and limitations are making it exceedingly difficult for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer fairly briefly to a publication called Hostel Design Guidelines, which is issued by the Department of Community Services and Health. In its introduction it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is committed to a significant increase in the provision of hostel places in the next decade. ``Hostel Design Guidelines'' is a useful addition to the ideas for designing and building these new facilities to help ensure they meet the needs and wishes of those aged people who live in them. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not had the opportunity to read every word of the publication, but I have been fascinated by some of the language used in it and some of the things that are said in it. For instance, on page 53, dealing with interior facilities, the publication states:</PARA>
<PARA> The front door and front entry are important elements in order to establish the feeling of home and welcome. The entry is the point of arrival and departure. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that if I had not read that statement I may have had great difficulty in knowing that the entry was the point of arrival and departure. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Visitors will also come in through the front entry. </PARA>
<PARA>I am delighted to read that piece of information as well. Page 55 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The entry hall area should allow for hanging space for hats, coats and umbrellas. In a house it is common to have these items in the entrance hall and placement of these facilities near the outside door may encourage the residents to venture outside. </PARA>
<PARA> A view to outside will assist in reality orientation, provide views to the outside world and enable residents to assess the weather before going outdoors. </PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that `a view to outside' means a window and the reference to `reality orientation' means that people will be able to look out of the window and see what is outside. I am quite perturbed. I do not know how much the Commonwealth has spent on producing these so-called Hostel Design Guidelines. I find it very disappointing. I imagine that quite a lot of money has gone into its preparation and printing. </PARA>

In order to gauge the extent of the problem of dementia in Australia, Jorm and Henderson (1986) carried out a study which predicted that the Australian population will increase by 24% over the next two decades, while our aged population will increase by 44%. The number of people with dementia will increase by 69-77% which means that approximately 19% of elderly people will have dementia. </PARA>

As about 50% of moderately to severely demented people are currently in residential care and as such a high proportion of the aged population will have some form of dementia, the demand for residential accommodation and care for this group of aged people will increase significantly. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a Government report that I am quoting from-those are not my words-but Blind Freddy can see that demand will increase significantly. We have this ridiculous situation where the tying of the ratio of hostel and nursing beds at 60 : 40 is not working. That is the reality. Talk with anyone in the industry around Australia and the reasonable rationale that comes through is that the ratio should be at least 50 : 50. </PARA>
<PARA> The private sector is being squeezed at both ends, particularly in the case of nursing homes. It seems to me that this Government is dedicated to trying to phase out the private sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like firstly, after congratulating the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) on most of his remarks, to respond to some of his concluding remarks. I think he made his remarks in a positive atmosphere while seeking to suggest ways in which the administration of nursing homes and hostels can be improved, and I commend him for that. But I totally disagree with his comments expressing opposition to the Government's plan to place a ceiling on the charges which nursing homes can levy in 1991. As the honourable member suggested, the Government has announced that in that year nursing homes will not be able to charge more than 87.5 per cent of the base rate of the pension, and that is something which I applaud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have expected that the honourable member, like me, would have had people who are in very difficult circumstances come to him, as people are being charged per week not 87.5 per cent of their pension, not 100 per cent, but figures greatly in excess of that to remain in nursing homes. In one terrible case the sister of a pensioner who came to see me was in a nursing home. That pensioner was having to provide part of his pension to help support his sister because the nursing home was charging his sister more than 100 per cent of her pension. Given that there are about 76,000 people in nursing home beds in Australia tonight, there are probably a large number of people in that position. I commend the Government for putting a ceiling on the charges which can be levied on people in nursing homes. I admit that that will probably create some difficulties for the private entrepreneurs in the nursing home industry, but I believe we have to look at what is in the interests of the greater majority of people involved in that industry. That means that we should put the interests of the residents of the nursing homes first, before the interests of the providers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the support from the honourable member for Cowper on that point, and I commend him for his positive suggestions. I was interested in his quotation from the guidelines on the design of nursing homes and his suggestion, I think from the booklet, that people should put as many windows as possible in nursing homes to maximise the reality orientation. Perhaps, given the number of windows in this building, we could do with a bit more reality orientation in this place on some occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In previous generations, not only in Australia but also in other Western countries, it was a tradition that, as people got older and perhaps more frail and their health deteriorated, their sons and daughters would take them into the family home and look after them. But these days, because people are living longer, because more people are reaching a very old age, more people are suffering from dementia. During the 1960s and 1970s there was a large increase, and rightly so, in the number of nursing home beds in Australia. The situation in Australia was a little unusual. We concentrated on nursing home beds and provided a very high level of service to the residents of nursing homes. Qualified nurses were provided 24 hours a day to ensure that those residents were provided with the care that they needed. In other Western countries there was a greater emphasis on hostels, hostels not having that intense provision of services provided in nursing homes. In many ways that meant a big gap in the services which Australia was providing for its elderly people. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the significant achievements under Don Grimes in his period as Minister for Community Services was the rethink of Australia's attitude to the provision of nursing home beds. Under Don Grimes the Australian Government decided that it had to provide more emphasis on hostel beds, hostels providing an intermediate step between a nursing home and a person's home, where that person could perhaps look after himself. As people get older, as they are perhaps not able to cook for themselves and Meals on Wheels may supply the only meal provided to them-not that there is anything wrong with its services-it can create problems for some of them, especially at weekends. Somewhere between a person's home and the nursing home there was a gap in Australia at the end of the 1970s. I commend the Hawke Labor Government for rapidly expanding the number of hostel beds in Australia. It has really brought about a revolution in the way we are providing for elderly people, and I congratulate the Government for its achievements in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said that its target is to provide 100 nursing home or hostel beds by 1991 for every 1,000 people over the age of 70. This year the Australian Government is providing a lot of money for nursing homes and hostels. Many Australians are not aware of how much the taxpayers are contributing to provide for the care of our elderly people in these areas. According to the 1988-89 Budget statements, more than $1,500m is being provided by this Government to ensure that our aged people have proper accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past we had a system of deficit funding of nursing home beds. That meant that after a nursing home had charged its particular fee it would add up its costs for the provision of meals and nursing care and all the other associated costs and simply ask the Federal Government to pick up the difference between the fees that it charged and its costs. Any private entrepreneur would love a system under which he could always be guaranteed that the Government would pick up the bill for any difference between costs and income. That meant that there was no incentive at all for some of these people to look at the costs associated with providing care and assistance for our elderly. It meant that a number of massive differences in the bed subsidy grew up between States over the years. It meant that, for example, someone in a nursing home bed in Victoria was receiving a much greater subsidy from the Government than a person in a nursing home bed in Queensland or New South Wales. That was simply due to the cost structure in those States. This Government, with the introduction of the care aggregate module and standard aggregate module, has sought to put the system throughout Australia on a national basis. There has been a period of transition to give people time to adjust to the new system. I hope it will be a success. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) in his contribution said that he believed that this Government was seeking to phase out private entrepreneurs' involvement in the hostel and nursing home sector. He used the argument that because the Government believes that it is necessary to provide capital funding for private schools-to save the Government money by building fewer government schools-the Government should also provide capital funding for private hostels. I make the simple response that there are not that many schools that are run to make a profit, whereas there are examples in this sector of people investing capital and expecting a return on that capital. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe and hope that over the years we will see more of the charitable institutions running our hostels and nursing homes. They have a great contribution to make. Too often these days volunteers are being replaced by paid social workers or trained university graduates. I do not deny that often they do a good job in the positions to which they are appointed, but often the work that volunteer organisations do is undermined by the simple appointment of a paid employee who sees it as his or her job to organise and take over the particular voluntary institution. I hope that in this decade and in the 1990s we will seek to ensure that more of these voluntary organisations are involved in the administration of hostels and nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales central coast there is a great need for nursing home and hostel places, as the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, knows because he used to represent a third of my electorate. The electorate of Dobell has more age pensioners, veterans and war widows than any other electorate in Australia. There is still a great need for them in my area. An improvement which has been made in recent days in the allocation of beds is that the Department of Community Services and Health now looks at the number of beds in each local government area. Certainly, that happens in my area. In the past we were grouped together and the statistics were analysed for the whole of the northern metropolitan area, which created problems for my area. In the North Shore of Sydney there are large numbers of nursing home beds. In the 1960s and 1970s many nursing homes were built in the North Shore area. In the past calculations were done on the number of nursing home beds per 1,000 people over 70 years in the entire northern metropolitan area and my area looked like it was served reasonably well. But when one considers the fact that most of these beds were in the area near Sydney Harbour and there were very few beds on the central coast one can see that it created great problems. The Department now looks at the number of beds in the Gosford City Council area or in the Wyong Shire Council area. This means that under this Government we are getting a much better deal. I commend the Department for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Saturday I was able to speak at the opening of a new hostel in Norah Head in my electorate. That hostel has been built by Brisbane Water Legacy-a great organisation that does an excellent job in looking after the interests of the war widows and dependants of Australian ex-service men and women living on the central coast. The President of Brisbane Water Legacy, Arthur Rofe, spoke very kindly about the work that my colleague Harry Moore, the State member for Wyong, and I did in helping to push Brisbane Water Legacy's proposal along. Harry Moore, through his friends at the Crown Lands Office at Maitland, ensured that the Brisbane Water Legacy hostel was built on crown land on a beautiful site at Norah Head. I know that the 40 residents who are now living at the Norah Head hostel are certainly very happy with that $2m hostel. As an aside, I mentioned that this Parliament provided $828,000 to the cost of that hostel. This meant that Brisbane Water Legacy still had to raise a massive amount of money-over $1m. I commend people such as Stan Brown, the past President of Brisbane Water Legacy, for the great job they did in not only raising those funds but also negotiating with the various bureaucracies to make sure that it was a success. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other hostel in my electorate that would be known to the Minister at the table; that is, Bethshan Holiness Mission nursing home and hostel at Wyee. Wyee is a very small town which would not be known to many honourable members, but I know that the Minister is well aware of it. Late last year I was asked by Reverend Mitchell, the administrator of that nursing home and hostel, to visit it. Bethshan, like a considerable number of the smaller nursing homes, is having difficulties in adjusting to the new systems. We have to make sure that the Government understands that the smaller nursing homes in the non-metropolitan areas provide a very essential service for their local communities. I remind the House of the suggestion of the honourable member for Cowper that there should perhaps be a longer transition period so as to allow these smaller nursing homes and hostels to adjust to the new regime. I endorse that. Again, as the honourable member for Cowper said, it is very important that these people stay near their families and friends. For example, in Wyee it is often the case that the husbands and wives of the residents or the people that they have spent many years with through their work or various religious communities live near them. It is very important that they be able to stay in that area. I would support any proposal to give them a proper transition period. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other point which I wish to address. It is a suggestion to the Government. It concerns the current limit of 28 days of social and hospital leave which is allowed to the residents of nursing homes. At the moment, if a resident of a nursing home has to be admitted to hospital for some form of serious treatment because his or her health deteriorates, the Government continues to pay the bed subsidy-about $60 a day-at that nursing home for up to 28 days in any year. I had one case when someone suffered from a serious chest condition and had to be admitted to hospital for a week at a time. During a 12-month period that person was away from the nursing home for more than 28 days. The family of that resident then faces a problem as the nursing home proprietor then says to the family, `Look, unless you're prepared to pay us that $60 per day subsidy now that the 28 days are up, we can't guarantee that that bed will still be available when your relative is discharged from hospital'. I am not talking about cases of social leave where people leave the nursing home to visit relatives, while that is important. I am talking about a situation where people are forced, due to a health condition, to leave the nursing home and enter hospital. We have to have a bit more flexibility and allow more than 28 days when someone has a serious medical condition. I believe that the Government's argument is that the nursing home proprietor should carry the burden in that case, especially given that in some cases the nursing home proprietor reallocates that spare bed. It may not remain empty; the bed might be used by another person for the period that a person is in hospital. However, I think that this rule creates some hardships in particular cases, and I suggest to the Government that perhaps a bit more leniency in this area would be of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, despite those small criticisms and suggestions, I commend the Government and the Minister for continuing their reforms in this area. As I said earlier, it is a real revelation to see the increase in the number of hostel beds provided to people. I commend the Government for that. I am sure that under the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) these reforms will continue to benefit the elderly people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to excite you too, Mr Deputy Speaker; I can see that. I have taken the opportunity to try to come to grips with some of the questions that have been raised about this legislation because of concerns that have been expressed to me by constituents in relation to some of the significant reforms that the Government believes it is putting in place. I wish to express in a helpful way, if I can, the concerns I have. If the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) is able to take them into account-assuming that he is taking responsibility for this legislation-and can clarify the matters that are of concern to me in an unambiguous way, I certainly would be very grateful because finding one's way through the legislation does not necessarily clarify the sorts of questions that occur to people like myself. We are told from the outline in the explanatory memorandum that this Bill amends the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954. Point one of the outline states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to introduce new hostel planning arrangements which will allow the Minister to determine the maximum number of hostel places to be funded on a recurrent basis for each State and Territory at a time in a particular financial year, and to enable the Minister to specify the distribution of these hostel places among planning regions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it will enable the Minister to undertake some proper planning as to where the Government's resources will go in placing hostels. Provided that does not affect those places that are presently operating, those places that have been funded before, and those that have been built by people relying on the schemes that have been previously put in place by governments, I have no objection to governments planning the way in which future resources ought to be used. In fact, I think that is a proper and responsible way for the Government to operate. Point two states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to introduce an approval-in-principle arrangement for the provision of capital and recurrent funding or recurrent funding alone in respect of the acquisition or erection, the demolition and construction, the alteration or extension, or the transfer of a hostel . .</PARA>
<PARA>If that is dealing primarily with the provision of capital where changes are being made-and that is what it seems to speak of-again I perhaps would not have any problems. Point three is one I highlighted. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to enable all Commonwealth funded hostels, existing and future ones, to be approved for a fixed number of hostel places (including respite care places) for recurrent funding purposes thereby enabling improved financial management and planning in the hostel sector . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is there that I set upon my quest to try to understand what this legislation is all about, because that particular section set all sorts of alarm bells ringing in my mind-as I am sure it does in the Minister's mind-as to what is meant by the Commonwealth looking at existing hostels and their approval for recurrent funding being made on the basis of certain changes in financial management and planning. The outline talks about Commonwealth funded hostels. It is not clear to me whether that means those which have received recurrent funding in the past-that is, funding for their management-or whether the outline was speaking about their capital funding, which may have in fact been met not by the Commonwealth but by individuals out of their own resources.</PARA>
<PARA> I went on reading the legislation, endeavouring to understand the nature of the transitional provisions that operate in relation to this legislation, to understand the new funding arrangements whereby recurrent subsidies were to be paid only on the basis that people were going to enter into agreements subject to certain general conditions which are to be formulated and which are not contained in the legislation and agreements between the Minister and the organisation, the terms of which do not appear in this legislation. It seemed that this legislation related to certain agreements of which I was being made aware and which people were being told they had to sign under threat and that recurrent funding that would have been available to that organisation under the existing arrangements would no longer be made available under the new arrangements unless certain new residents were brought into occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was somewhat troubled by this because I was aware that there were numbers of organisations-one facility in my electorate was built by the Uniting Church-which were funded by residents, by people borrowing money and committing themselves to repay the capital, very often involving their own church, thus relieving the Government of the responsibility of paying the capital moneys to build the facility. As I understood it, these organisations went out and raised money through residents, through people borrowing to enable themselves to get into these places, on the understanding that recurrent funding would be available for the operation of that facility. This was supposed to be a good deal for the Commonwealth, one whereby the Commonwealth was relieved of the responsibility of finding the capital funds which it did not have. So the facilities were being built and people were being provided with accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I sat down with these people and endeavoured to discuss with them the problem and to come to grips with the problems, to understand it within the framework of the law with which we deal, it became quite apparent to me that we were seeing some pretty shabby dealing. These were not their terms; they were my terms used about the arrangements as they were put to me as I find them in the context of this legislation-correspondence which I have seen from the Minister and these agreements about which I have spoken. They are shabby arrangements because they are retrospectively altering the arrangements that are in place between individuals who have put up their own capital, who have borrowed money to go into these places, and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an expectation-and I do not think it was an unreasonable expectation-that recurrent funding would continue to be available where people had met the capital cost out of their own resources. In fact, they thought they were doing more for the Commonwealth than those who occupied premises that were built totally by the Commonwealth, where the Commonwealth was providing the capital funds. We ought to have been thanking them for relieving the Commonwealth of this responsibility. These arrangements were not for wealthy people; we are not talking about wealthy people when we talk about these arrangements. Hostels that were built under this resident funded arrangement essentially were for the near poor. They were not for the totally poor, because they were people who were perhaps selling their houses, liquidating whatever capital they could, to be able to get themselves into a place where they would be able to provide for themselves in the frailty of their old age. The ones who were comfortable, who could sell their houses and have money left over, were not interested in these types of hostel arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I can point out where the new residences are around the North Shore, the near North Shore and the northern districts which are totally resident funded and where the Government makes no commitment to recurrent funding. These are not the premises for those sorts of people. These were the premises sponsored by churches that wanted to provide for people in near necessitous circumstances and set about to do that. A number of churches did it. The Uniting Church did it in a big way. Other churches did it in a much smaller way. </PARA>
<PARA> As I look at these new arrangements I see that we have in place circumstances where the Government is involved in a Robin Hood exercise. It wants to provide more money in this area of hostel accommodation. It is about robbing the near poor to provide more hostel accommodation for people in a disadvantaged group. As I understand it from the explanations that have been made available to me, some of the conditions that these organisations are being asked to sign require the organisations to take into their hostels 20 per cent of people who are described as being disadvantaged. That means that those people come in without making any contribution to the capital to which the existing residents have been making a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation in which indirectly the Government is saying to those people who have been involved in these arrangements, `You have a responsibility to take up the obligation of the disadvantaged person because you are the ones who are responsible for meeting the ongoing debt that the total organisation has incurred. Those who are disadvantaged will have no obligation in relation to that'. The existing residents or those who take over the debt responsibility and who are not in a disadvantaged class assume a greater and much heavier responsibility as a result of the framework that is being developed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the principal church that has been involved in this matter, the Uniting Church in Australia operating in New South Wales, has sought to see the Minister and put to him a detailed submission on the matter that I am addressing now. It is regrettable to me that at this point in time it has not yet been able to put that submission to the Minister. I would hope that before this legislation is finalised in another place the Minister will take the opportunity of ensuring that he is aware of all of the concerns that the Uniting Church has about this legislation, that he understands all of the nuances that are involved and that unlike his second reading speech, which I have read, he will be able to clarify for the Parliament the way in which the transitional arrangements will work to ensure that no person will be disadvantaged by these new arrangements that are being put in place. In other words, there will be no retrospective rewriting of the arrangements that people agree to before occupying these premises. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to see the people in the New South Wales Synod, to have lengthy discussions with them and to ensure that he understands that the Church itself is one that had, in its own arrangements, sought to take into its premises, as it could, financially disadvantaged persons. The resident funding arrangement, as it has been explained to me, has meant, in the Uniting Church's case, that in some places it has been in a position-as the facility is being built for some time and where the debt has been significantly reduced from the payments that are being made to those who are brought in as residents-to contemplate the admission of a number of financially disadvantaged persons. Very often it is only one or two but never the much larger number of 20 per cent that the Minister seems to think these organisations might be able to take into occupation now. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the Uniting Church, in its desire to put this matter in writing before the Minister while the legislation was in discussion, put forward these points and a number of others in relation to the general framework of legislation. It had a response from the Minister, who wrote on 4 November, in relation to this matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am also conscious of the concerns of a number of existing hostels about the accommodation of a specific percentage of financially disadvantaged persons; in particularly those concerns of the New South Wales Uniting Church in relation to its hostels which are receiving recurrent subsidy from the Commonwealth, but have not received capital subsidy.

If the honourable member fails to lack the ability to comprehend the points that are being made, then I suggest he take the opportunity of informing himself. If it is a matter of finding his way through the mire of this legislation, and if he wants to give me a lesson, by all means I wait with a great deal of interest to hear what he has to say. I make the point that the Church was looking at ways of coming to some accommodation in relation to this question. A specific suggestion was put in relation to this larger organisation which had a number of hostels, some cross-subsidisation in a sense. The Minister was asked to comment on that. He did so in his letter. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have agreed to allow organisations to aggregate their numbers of financially disadvantaged persons across their existing hostels in order to achieve an overall average of 20 per cent for the organisation, in line with the national average for disadvantaged persons. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Where hostels have previously received Commonwealth capital subsidies three conditions apply . . . Where the hostel in question has not previously received Commonwealth capital subsidy, I have agreed to allow greater flexibility so that for such hostels only, the organisation is required to average, over a financial year, at least 20 per cent of its places for financially disadvantaged people across all its hostels. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I have read that letter is that I understand in later discussions it was by no means clear whether these agreements which were being signed under duress had given effect to honouring that undertaking which the Minister has given in his letter. I would be surprised, in view of the nature of the letter and the terms in which it is expressed, if the intention of the Minister was not to be given effect. I am surprised that people are being asked to sign agreements-I understand all of the organisations have signed-before the legislation is operative. I am surprised that the agreements cannot be such as to comprehend all of the proposals that the Minister had in mind. In fact, I find it intrinsically objectionable that people are asked to sign agreements in relation to legislation that is merely before the Parliament and has not seen successful passage through the Parliament. This is a matter of very considerable concern. It is one about which I have no doubt the Minister will hear a great deal more if it is not clarified and clarified quickly. This is a case where-the Opposition will address this later in greater detail-an unambiguous amendment should be moved to ensure that this legislation in no way has the retrospective effect of rewriting the arrangements and understandings upon which these donor funded operations, or resident funded operations, were built. In other words, in my view the agreements of previous Governments ought to be honoured, and I am disappointed that the legislation before us suggests that they should not be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has a proud record on aged and disabled care, and I am happy to contribute to this debate on the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill. Briefly, as outlined in the second reading speech, the major purpose of the Bill is to introduce new arrangements to enable improved planning and financial management in the hostel sector. In addition, the Bill proposes measures that will ensure better targeting of subsidised hostel services to those aged people in need of such care, and introduces provisions to assist people seeking to avail themselves of respite care services in a hostel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I comment on this Government's concern for the aged of our society, I want to remind honourable members that the greatest contributors to aged care are senior citizens. In every community in Australia there are veritable saints-that is not too strong a word-who, though aged themselves, work up to 14 or 16 hours a day bringing comfort and joy to other elderly people who have withstood less well the ravages of the years. I pay tribute to those aged who work for others who are aged. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to give a loud `hoorah!' for the very sensible officers in the Newcastle taxation office who displayed remarkable initiative and a very caring attitude in piloting a scheme whereby alert senior citizens were trained to assist less alert citizens plough through the complexities of the modern taxation return. If this Hunter Valley initiative is not allowed to spread nation-wide, we are all in need of a kick in the pants. It is not much fun having to complete a tax return when one is 91, 92 or 103. I do not know whether honourable members understand the scheme which has been introduced in the Newcastle taxation area, but it certainly has been of tremendous benefit to the aged members of the communities covered by that regional taxation office. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of a fairer funding basis for hostels marks an important step in the Government's planned restructuring of aged care services, and the arrangements will benefit both residents and service providers. Under the new arrangements, hostel places will be made more easily available to aged people who have limited financial resources, and more services will be available in needy areas. In addition, there will be better protection of residents with the introduction of new guidelines for refunds when a resident leaves or does not take up a place. For instance, hostels can claim an incoming contribution from residents but they can keep only $1,000 for every six months that a person is in a nursing home to a maximum of $10,000 over five years, and the balance must be returned when the person leaves the hostel or nursing home. This Government is determined not to create another financially disadvantaged group out of a group that previously was not disadvantaged. Some residents have lost over $10,000 in less than one year on top of their weekly fees. Limits on fee levels for residents will mean that affordable care is a reality. No person should have to contribute more than 85 per cent of his or her pension towards hostel fees. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone would agree that the new funding arrangements are certainly fairer. They include significantly increased Government subsidies of up to $45,000 a place for financially disadvantaged people and for respite care, and easier access for hostels to borrowed funds. The nursing home and hostel industry generally has welcomed the Government's strategy for a total aged care policy. There is no doubt that our frail aged and elderly citizens are benefiting from this strategy and now have a range of options and services available to them. In my Maitland office towards the end of last year I was able to arrange a screening of an excellent video For Today, For Tomorrow-New Choices for Elderly Australians. The audience was made up of pensioners and family members as well as a number of workers in the nursing home and hostel industry and providers of services under the home and community care program. The video was very well received and the general comment from pensioners was that they now had a clearer idea of the choices available to them and knew what to expect if they entered a nursing home or hostel and what support services were available if they opted to stay in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> The independent report commissioned by the Federal Government entitled I'm Still an Individual identified that one of the significant areas of concern for older people and the community in general is the quality of life and quality of care for people who live in residential facilities such as nursing homes and hostels. While only a small proportion of the aged population live in nursing homes and hostels, residents of these facilities are among the most vulnerable group in society. This is due to a range of factors such as frailty, loss of independence and isolation from the wider community. Aged care in my electorate of Hunter is as good as any that can be found in Australia but many nursing homes and hostels fall far short of the ideal. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remember that every aged person has a right to be treated as we ourselves would like to be treated and aged people must be given improved opportunities to control their own lives and participate in decisions that affect them. We lose our own dignity if we allow our aged to suffer a loss of theirs. The Hawke Government recognises the great contribution made to Australia by older people. It recognises too that retirement and age should not be automatic barriers to an active and enjoyable life. Older people have particular and valuable skills, experiences and insights to offer. This Government has already introduced national standards of care and it is now working on the consumer rights issue as part of its comprehensive eight-stage reform program of aged care services. Under the current stage 5, user rights, we are looking at improving quality of life for nursing home and hostel residents by setting out national guidelines on what older people should expect from residential care. </PARA>
<PARA> Residents have expressed concern about the sort of information they receive in terms of both the availability of services which would enable them to remain in their community and what to expect when they enter their nursing home or hostel. Residents were worried about the lack of control many experienced over who made the decision for them to move into residential care. While many residents had positive things to say about their nursing home or hostel, a number of residents across Australia raised concerns about the serious limits to their ability to continue many of the aspects of the lives they had led before they went into the nursing home or hostel. Naturally they were concerned about their loss of independence, about the security of tenure they would have and about their security from abuse or harassment. Privacy is also high on the list, as is the quality and type of food provided in facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1986, when the Government embarked on the carefully planned series of long range changes to the aged care program, the general expectation was that our elderly citizens would enter a nursing home. Consequently, many people were unnecessarily confined to nursing homes. Today, unless there is a requirement for constant 24 hours a day nursing care, in which case the nursing home environment is obviously more suitable, aged people have the choice of hostel accommodation or, as many prefer, staying in their own home with a range of support services available to them under the home and community care program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken positive steps to correct the imbalance that has existed between nursing home and hostel care. I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Housing and Aged Cared (Mr Staples) that 4,244 new places have been approved for 1988-89. Another 4,723 places will be approved in 1989-90 and 4,738 places in 1990-91. That is a total of 13,705 additional places overall, of which 12,296 will be for hostels and 1,409 for nursing homes. That is probably not enough. But I think any reasonable person would recognise that giant strides forward are being made and that, within the limitations imposed upon the Government, not much more can be done at this stage. Certainly, it will not solve all the problems, and I do not think this Government would contend that it will. But it is certainly a great leap forward. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Hunter the three main centres are Maitland, Singleton and Cessnock. At each of these centres, and in smaller towns such as Denman, there are excellent nursing homes, hostels or retirement village facilities for our frail and elderly citizens and for the disabled. I could go through each city or town and name every establishment, but I will refer to only one or two. I am particularly pleased with the success of Green Hills Churches of Christ nursing home, hostel and retirement village in Maitland. The Hawke Government certainly made a magnificent contribution to this, and I had the pleasure and pride of being at the opening of one of the stages of the Maitland Green Hills nursing home and hostel and retirement village complex. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Fire Commissioners has caused a lot of problems as far as hostels and nursing homes are concerned. I will not castigate the Board of Fire Commissioners because it has a job to do to ensure that people do not lose their lives through fire. But, as we know, some of these hostels and nursing homes are very ancient and, with the passage of years, they become fire hazards. When the Board of Fire Commissioners places restrictions on the various establishments, it can create a huge demand for additional funding. I was very concerned when Benhome Home for the Aged, a Maitland nursing home run by the Maitland Benevolent Society and which has a 71-bed hostel for aged citizens, looked as though it would have to close. The residents there would have been virtually kicked out onto the street. But a former Minister in this Government, former Senator Don Grimes, came along, saw the need and immediately provided a solution. His response was remarkably swift and some $700,000 was given towards the refurbishment and renovation of Benhome, so that Benevolent Society home is now stronger than ever. In Maitland we also have the Challenge Foundation of New South Wales which, through Mai-Well, caters for approximately 20 disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA> In Cessnock we have a problem. We have the Allandale Geriatric Hospital, which has a 414 nursing home bed capability. It produces distortions in the Hunter figures of beds available because it must be remembered that Allandale is such a giant complex that it caters for people from well outside the region of the Hunter Valley. The number of beds in that establishment distorts the figures for the Hunter. Bureaucrats look at Allandale and say, `The Hunter is all right. Look at the number of beds it has'. But they do not comprehend that it is a state-wide institution and that there is still a serious shortage of nursing home beds and hostel accommodation in the Hunter Valley. The Sainsbury report and the Olsen report, and a whole series of other reports, have been misled by the distortions resulting from the figures of Allandale hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted at the success of the Cessnock Retirement Village Hostel which was established by the Freemasons Benevolent Society in Cessnock. One could speak at great length about the marvellous work done by people who are senior citizens but who are working for their fellow aged colleagues. I refer to fellows such as Frank Jeffree, Alec Bell, Bert Healy, Harold Walpole, Bill Charlton and a host of others. Recently, as evidence of the fine job that this Government is doing in providing additional hostel accommodation, I was very proud to represent the Minister for Housing and Aged Care in Wellington in the electorate of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). </PARA>

We are very proud to help the aged, and we would not care even if they are in the electorate of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). We help the aged irrespective of any political considerations. All elderly people are our concern. I had a delightful day there representing the Minister. I am delighted that approval has been given for an extra 30-bed hostel in Cessnock. We are also seeking approval for an additional 30 beds in the Hunter electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I am particularly worried-I will be seeing the Minister about this-that in today's Newcastle Morning Herald I read an announcement, of which the Minister would not as yet be aware, that the State Government has made a decision to take 30 beds for the aged from my electorate and transfer them elsewhere. The New South Wales Government will get no support from me in its efforts to take those beds from my electorate. We have problems in Singleton. Once again, a nursing home and hostel, which received no capital grants from the Commonwealth but was built with money from the citizens of that town, has become rather decrepit and a fire hazard, with all sorts of other problems. However, I am very appreciative of this Minister's genuine concern for the aged and of the willingness that he displays whenever any problems crop up in any electorate throughout our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> My time is running out, so I will conclude by saying that honourable members opposite must recognise that the problems of the aged are very severe indeed. Yet this Government has had remarkable successes and has made finance available to cater for the well-deserved needs of our senior citizens and the ageing members of our society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time allowed I will attempt to cover as many points as I can. It is a pleasure to rise to speak on this Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill. I commend honourable members from both sides who have spoken: the honourable members for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), Bowman (Mr Sciacca), Cowper (Mr Nehl), Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and Dobell (Mr Lee). The honourable member for Dundas highlighted a quite intrinsic clause in the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill. It was his reference to the third paragraph on page 2 that caused a deal of concern to the excellent aged care and hospital and hostel accommodation centres in my electorate. I am pleased that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), the junior to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), has graced us with his presence to listen to some of this debate. I am sure that access to Hansard will allow him and his staff to take in some of the concerns that have been put forward in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concerns of the aged population in Australia have been highlighted by honourable members of both sides. I was fortunate to march with 5,000 people in Adelaide on a very hot day this week. Aged people have some genuine concerns in the twilight of their lives about superannuation, pensions, a higher tax free threshold and perhaps law and order. They want to look forward to some dignity in their later years. Obviously a lot of them are still in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Twenty per cent of people in my electorate are over the age of 60, and that is reflective of statistics all around the country. There is a growing concern. It has been suggested that we have been putting forward some hidden agendas. That is not true. The crisis, whether it be a cash flow crisis or a problem of staff morale, is affecting the hairdressers, the physiotherapists and the volunteers who take on walks people using walking frames or people in wheelchairs. It is having an impact upon a vast group of concerned people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the Opposition will be suggesting and considering further amendments, including some from South Australia. South Australia and Victoria were the benchmarks for our aged care policies. In my electorate of Adelaide we have the excellent Helping Hand Centre in North Adelaide, the Walkerville Nursing Home, the Barton Vale Retirement Village and Church of Christ Southern Cross nursing home, to name several in a long line of excellent hostel, hospice and nursing home accommodation and care facilities for the frail aged run by compassionate people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They certainly are. This Bill seeks to introduce a number of changes to an industry which provides essential care and support for the aged and disabled in society. The proposed changes cover a broad spectrum. Indeed, the Government deserves congratulation on a number of alternatives it has put forward. I have no doubt that the Government is driven by a genuine desire to see a better deal for all in the future in institutional care for the aged and disabled, but this must be balanced by the best policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new hostel planning arrangements, which allow the Minister to determine the maximum number of hostel places to be funded on a recurrent basis, are reasonable and have been in place for the last 18 months. This needs based system of planning will enable the Minister to specify the distribution of hostel places over planning regions to gain optimum benefit from available funds. If properly applied, the proposal will enable the most efficient distribution of available resources. We concede that and applaud it. </PARA>
<PARA> Chris Ronalds's report, `I'm still an Individual', has been mentioned this evening. It concerns the rights of the elderly in nursing homes and hostels, and is alarming, to say the least. Ms Ronalds's revelations that residents in one home were put in front of the television and were `actually sitting there watching the test pattern' stirs the emotions of all of us who honour our parents and aged people. These things are terrible, but perhaps the author could have been more careful to ensure she did not give the impression that the majority of service providers were guilty of such outrageous actions. I can qualify that by saying that letters to the editor in Adelaide newspapers dispelled any such belief. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of pooled clothing, with residents dressed in communal clothes, allocated by staff, including underwear, is undesirable, to say the least. It is the practice in some homes to have birthday parties one day a month regardless of individuals' actual date of birth. Ms Ronalds hit the nail on the head when she said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are talking about one of the most vulnerable groups in Australian society. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That group of people, the Seniors Lobby and Greypower, is rising in a force to sheet home its point of view. People in that group are concerned about the care, the future and the dignity of the aged. It is incumbent on us to take care of that situation. I am sure that, amongst the thousands of nursing homes and hostels throughout Australia, there are some unscrupulous operators--</PARA>

It is to that end that this legislation is before the House this evening. I have little quarrel with what is laid down, but it is what is not laid down that gives cause for concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Government often omits important matters from its legislation. Representatives of the nursing homes and hostels in my electorate of Adelaide are deeply concerned about an apparent phasing out of the private sector, a sector of the market which serves a very useful purpose. I was pleased when the honourable member for Dobell got close to the volunteer workers. He spoke about volunteers versus paid social workers, referring to the bed subsidy of $60. We cannot deny the entrepreneurial skills which those great church and compassionate groups have brought to bear in giving aged people access to facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Representatives of nursing homes and hostels in my electorate of Adelaide, as I said, are deeply concerned. I suggest those on the Government benches pay attention to the message which I have to pass on from people actually working in the industry in my electorate, unless they wish to assume total responsibility for the comfort, dignity and welfare of all nursing home and hostel patients. I am not taking a cheap shot. I do not treat this as another opportunity to clip the Government on the ear-not this time. I am genuinely concerned we may be going down a wrong path; that we may pass this legislation into law and find we have ignored the nub of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The director of one institution in my electorate tells me the Hawke Government, to use his words, is `being politically dishonest'. It is being politically dishonest in saying that by 1990 no-one will be required to pay more than 87.5 per cent of the pension and supplementary assistance for accommodation in nursing homes. On the face of it, this sounds like a pretty fine idea. However, when we look a little deeper we find the proposal is fraught with problems. This new 87.5 per cent ceiling means that those who can afford it cannot pay more for the service offered by a nursing home. Consequently in one fell swoop the Hawke Government has effectively abolished the top end of the market. This aspect of the Bill smacks of the blunt socialist approach of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> For years old folk who have provided well for their old age have been paying their way in nursing homes, effectively subsidising those less able to pay but often needing a greater level of service. Nursing homes are being squeezed at both ends in being prevented from taking more than 87.5 per cent of pensions from patients, irrespective of whether the patients can afford more or not. At the other end of the spectrum, private nursing homes do not have their capital expenditure refunded by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this 87.5 per cent ceiling will undoubtedly be to heap a massive amount of pressure on the industry, if we can call it that. This will necessarily see a decrease in the available level of patient care. As the Executive Director of the Australian Nursing Homes Association, Mr John Gillroy, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth can't expect us to provide luxury facilities at a bargain-basement price. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very salient point. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> If we start having a whole range of special services for people, you have less time to do basic care. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that providing residents with more flexible meal times means incurring penalty rates for staff. He is dead right. Since the Government has refused to check this problem, it wants to leave it to the providers to solve. An acceptable level of service costs a certain amount of money. If we start limiting the amount of money these institutions can charge, they are going to find it impossible to deliver that level of service. It is simple logic. It is obvious and easy to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that the 87.5 per cent ceiling will see a shake-out in the industry, with private nursing homes concentrating on patients in categories 1, 2 and 3, those who are in need of the highest levels of care and therefore attract the highest subsidies; and patients in categories 4 and 5 having only voluntary organisations to look to. This creates another problem in the area of dementia patients. These people are deemed to need the lowest level of care, but they can keep staff flat out with feeding, toileting and problems of incontinence. </PARA>

I take this opportunity to once again record in this place that historic, albeit black, event. On that fateful night we saw a mixture of fear, disregard for personal safety, mutual trust of ship mates, bravery, and personal sacrifice.

<PARA> I wish to draw the attention of this House to the case of one survivor-Mr Bernard Verwayen of Buderim on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. Late last year Mr Verwayen gained approval of the Victorian Full Court to sue the Commonwealth for damages resulting from the Voyager disaster. Many in the legal profession were confident that the decision would provide a precedent for other survivors to follow. In 1985 the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) admitted the Government's liability and said that it would not rely on the statute of limitations as a bar to litigation. However, after two survivors were awarded nearly $500,000, the Hawke Government did a backflip and relied on the statute of limitations to stop Mr Verwayen from seeking justice in the courts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it broke its commitment. Madam Speaker, I refer honourable member to the Hansard record of this place on 9 December 1987 in which the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) defended the Government's change of mind, in the process imputing ulterior motives of those involved-an imputation I strongly reject generally on behalf of the people concerned and specifically on behalf of Mr Verwayen. In handing down the decision, Mr Justice Kaye and Mr Justice Marks said, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The facts of the case disclose effectively a promise by the respondent not to seek to have Mr Verwayen's claim barred under the Victorian Limitation of Actions Act. There can be little doubt that the promise . . . was made deliberately and with the knowledge and intention that Mr Verwayen pursue his claim and have his damages assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that the Hawke Government is now seeking leave to appeal to the High Court against that judgment of the Victorian Full Court, a move I deplore. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to assure Mr Verwayen and the Voyager families that the next coalition government will not hide behind the statute of limitations as the Hawke Government has chosen to do. We will allow those damages claims to proceed in the courts and provide the long-overdue justice for those concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken a number of times in this place about the abysmally low morale in the Australian Defence Force, 25 per cent of which have left in the past two years. It is, therefore, not simply an opportunistic perception on the part of this Opposition. The commendably bipartisan Cross report on manpower losses in the Defence Force says it all. The treatment Voyager survivors have received from the Hawke Government is another one of many examples of the root cause of the problem. It is high time that the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General got together on Voyager and faced their responsibilities. If the Government chooses to continue its tawdry, head-in-the-sand approach-I repeat: tawdry, head-in-the-sand approach-in defence personnel matters, it will pay the electoral consequences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt), in the adjournment debate on Tuesday, focused attention, and quite rightly too, on the needs of pensioners in Australia. But then, remarkably, his care and concern for pensioners suddenly disappeared. He slammed the Australian Democrats for handing out a pamphlet at the seniors rally in Adelaide last Tuesday, which I understand the organisers did not want. That is fair enough. He conveniently forgot to tell the House that the Liberals were also handing out pamphlets against the wishes of the organisers. The Australian Labor Party at least respected the organisers' wishes. He failed to acknowledge that since this Hawke Labor Government was elected in 1983 the pension has increased in real terms by 8.3 per cent. He failed to acknowledged that the Fraser-Howard Government reduced pensions in real terms by 2.5 per cent. He failed to acknowledge that under this Government the standard pension is now 24.9 per cent of the average weekly earnings compared with 22.7 per cent when Labor came into office. But at least the honourable member for Adelaide recognised something that was right. He made mention that Premier Bannon warned that the Grey Power lobby in South Australia would be hijacked by political parties. And who would know more about that then the honourable member for Adelaide? His own electorate secretary, Mr Andrew Markwell, was the chairperson of the Adelaide town hall meeting of the Senior Citizens Group of Australia, Grey Power in South Australia, on 17 January--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3J4">Mr SAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wrote it on Tuesday night. As I understand it, he is a publicity officer for the group. He was formerly an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberal Party. Also on the stage-surprise, surprise!-was Ms Sue Crew, the former Liberal campaign director for Port Adelaide and now the campaign director for Kingston. Who else was on stage? Surprise again! None other than Mrs Jessie Taylor, a former National Party Senate candidate and now a member of the Liberal Party. These claims were made to me the day after the meeting by senior citizens from my own electorate of Port Adelaide. They were later confirmed by the Adelaide Sunday Mail journalist, Randall Ashbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The senior citizens of Port Adelaide are not fooled by these events. Representatives of all senior citizens groups in my electorate were invited to meet with the task force on retirement incomes, set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in Port Adelaide on 1 February. They welcomed the Prime Minister's initiative and participated positively and constructively in the meeting, putting recommendations which were carried unanimously. The senior citizens of Port Adelaide know only too well the abysmal record of the coalition in assisting people in real need. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the honourable member for Adelaide reflected the stance of the Opposition: no ideas; no philosophical stance; no process; no substantive means to implement any specific goals; no definition of the problem or, indeed, knowledge of the task to be achieved-nothing but words, empty words. The honourable member for Adelaide will convince no-one in this House, nor in his own electorate, with his descriptions without any exposition whatsoever. Certainly the citizens of Port Adelaide reject his propositions. </PARA>
<PARA> The most disadvantaged people in Australia today are the disabled aged living alone in private rental accommodation. There was no mention of that group by the honourable member for Adelaide. There was also no mention of single pensioners with children in private rental accommodation. If the honourable member is serious, and I hope that he is, he should start at the beginning with the people in greatest need. Pensioners do deserve a good deal. This Government recognises that. Single pensioners will have maximum rental assistance increased by 33.3 per cent by June 1990. Pensioners with three or more children will have their rent assistance increased by up to 100 per cent, from the existing rate of $15 a week to $30 a week, by June 1990. There are some specifics and details. </PARA>
<PARA> It is admirable that the honourable member for Adelaide wants to help pensioners in need. But exactly how does he expect to do this? He is going to abolish the assets test. He is going to abolish the capital gains tax. He is going to abolish the tax on lump sum superannuation. He went in to bat and he made a duck. He has got the idea right. How about making a few runs? How about getting some substance, the meat, the means to implement the ideas of assisting pensioners in need? What is his policy? That is what we would like to know. Who knows-he will be the first member of the Opposition I have heard in this House in eleven months to actually state a policy on helping pensioners in need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a plea to those authorities in the States and Territories around Australia that do not permit rabbit farming. I understand that some already do, such as Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, but the other States largely ban the raising of rabbits on a commercial basis. I find it especially ridiculous that Angora rabbit farming is banned when some farmers could be raising them and making handsome profits from the exercise. A good Angora rabbit will produce 1.25 to 1.50 kilograms of fibre per year, which is worth $70 per kilogram or more. In fact, if sold in 300 gram lots to customers at $30 per lot, which is enough to knit a large, long sleeved jumper, a rabbit can easily return over $100 a year before costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much of the fibre is very fine, in the 7 to 12 micron range, producing lustrous gossamer threads and making it one of the world's elite fashion fibres. The garments made from this fibre are quite exclusive and in great demand. With a cost of only about $12.50 a year to feed each rabbit, potential profits from this industry are truly enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a few points about the fibre of angora rabbits. It is a fibre, rather than a wool or a fur, and is not to be confused with the product from angora goats, which is mohair. As with wool from sheep, the most common angora fibre produced is white and can be dyed to any required colour. The angora rabbit produces two distinct types of fibre; an outer coat of guard hairs, which prevent the fibre from `felting-up' or matting, and a soft undercoat. A ratio of two guard hairs to five of undercoat is the sought-after ideal in commercial breeding. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the fibre grows continuously, the rabbits moult three or four times a year and develop a natural break in the fibre. It is therefore best to shear them every three months, a process that, including skirting, can comfortably be carried out in less than five minutes. Unlike wool, which contains 20 to 30 per cent grease, angora fibre is grease-free. This, and the fact that the fibre has anti-static properties that repel dirt, means the fibre is so clean it has no smell and can be spun without any processing. However, the lack of scales on the outside of the fibre makes it more difficult to spin than wool, as the fibres do not grip and cling. To give angora yarn the desired strength and elasticity necessary in garments, it is best mixed with fine merino wool in a ratio of about 30 per cent angora to 70 per cent wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The medullated angora fibre, with its light, soft, silky feel, has excellent heat retention properties. These rabbits originated in the town of Angora in Turkey but over the centuries have been bred up to the present day yielding very high strains. The best of these are probably the German commercial angoras, which weigh about 4.5 kilograms as adults. These can now be imported for about $300 each. French and English angoras are smaller in size, at 3 to 3.6 kilograms. With the average doe producing six to 12 kits per litter, after a gestation period of around only 30 days, the potential to rapidly increase numbers is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> World production of angora fibre is only about 2,500 tonnes per year, of which China is presently the main producer. However, other countries such as New Zealand have now recognised the demand for this fibre and are rapidly increasing their production. It will be a ridiculous and blatant travesty if large parts of Australia are prevented by outdated laws from participating in this profitable enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to glean rational reasons from the authorities for these bans. Some fear that one or more rabbits could escape and breed with the wild rabbit population to produce some sort of superior breed that would be harder to eradicate. There are serious doubts about the genetic rationale of this concern even with meat rabbits, since the present wild rabbit population is well-adapted to its environment. However, there is certainly no worry about angora rabbits escaping and breeding with wild rabbits, since angora rabbits are very delicate animals and could not survive in the wild for more than a very short period, probably only one or two days in many instances. They would die from exposure, predators, tangling their long fibres, and even from becoming fly-blown. </PARA>
<PARA> Another worry is that rabbit farmers would vaccinate against myxomatosis, using a virus related to that particular myxoma virus. Some argue that if mosquitoes were to bite these vaccinated rabbits, the immunity they would have could then be transferred via the mosquitoes to the wild rabbit population, so giving them a transferred immunity to myxomatosis. However, scientists have been unable to demonstrate this sequence of events to establish its scientific validity. In fact, if it could occur, it would already have done so, since vaccination has apparently been going on for some years, anyhow. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, no dire consequence need be feared from legalising the farming of these gorgeous and potentially lucrative animals. The governments concerned should remove their restrictions and allow angora rabbit farming in all of the Australian States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 4 February in Western Australia we found ourselves once again working in the polling booths. Of course, the result of the election on that date was that the Western Australian Government was returned to office. The Government, of course, received a sharp rebuke. There was understandable concern in the community in Western Australia about issues relating to the Rothwells rescue. Yet, in the end, the people had to make a choice between a Dowding-led Australian Labor Party (ALP), which was chastened by criticism but still united, very competent and extremely hard working, and the Opposition, which presented a leaderless rabble, wracked with disunity and without the discipline or vision that was necessary to win the election. Indeed, it embarked on a very negative campaign, which has become its hallmark in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to have its referendum proposals passed in September may have encouraged the Opposition to undertake such an approach. It was a great disappointment to me in September that the Opposition's fear tactics were successful in convincing people that they should vote no to the question, `Should there be fair compensation for property which is compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth', and to vote no to this question: `Should there be one vote one value?'. It was a terrible shame that that occurred. The irony is that the Liberals would probably be in government in Western Australia if they had embraced the proposal that there be one vote one value. Many of the country seats in which we were successful in the election may well have been lost to the Labor Party, had the Liberal Party wanted a democratic system in which we had one vote one value. It thought that it was in its puny political interests not to embrace that view. Indeed, the ALP put the proposal of one vote one value before it on four occasions. On each occasion, the upper House, controlled by the coalition, defeated it. It was not until the National Party supported a proposal put forward by the ALP that the new redistribution was brought into effect. I suppose that the Liberal Party now has four years in which to consider the folly of its decision at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> It was particularly gratifying for me that the four State seats whose boundaries are within my electorate, which we held prior to the election, were maintained by the ALP. Indeed, the great triumph of the election from my point of view was that we held the seat of Dianella. It is the result which gave me the most satisfaction. In the redistribution Dianella became very marginal. Part of Dianella includes the old seat of Nollamara, which was held by the State Minister for Health, Keith Wilson. Keith Wilson was a very respected member of parliament. He had held the seat since 1977. Keith Wilson had two choices. He could have taken the new seat of Nollamara, which had a projected margin of 17 per cent, and had a very comfortable sinecure for the rest of his life. But Keith Wilson chose to stand in Dianella, which offered a 5 per cent margin. Indeed, the result was clearly going to be finely balanced. </PARA>
<PARA> In some ways, that indicates to us the differences between the calibre and integrity of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, because Keith Wilson, an established Minister in the Dowding Government, took the chance. He took up the challenge. We believed he was the only person who could win the seat. He backed himself; he worked tirelessly in Dianella, and, in the midst of swings against Labor of 7 per cent, 8 per cent and 9 per cent, in Dianella there was a swing of 3 per cent; so he held that seat. On Saturday night, of course, for some time it was the linchpin which held the Government in a winning position. Keith Wilson could have been well established and very comfortable, but he took his chance and put the Party first. Indeed, within my electorate there were one or two other positions of similar note for members of the Opposition, and they took the alternative view. </PARA>
<PARA> After the election, we find that there has been no change. There are the same old faces sitting on the Opposition benches. Charlie Court is walking around bewildered at the result. Senator Chaney is crying unfair and the Liberals and Nationals are brawling, as they have done for some time. They do not seem to realise that times have changed. We see only two women on the West Australian Opposition benches, whereas in contrast, the Labor Government has four women Ministers. It is an indication of the movement in social policy in the ALP. There were many heroes on 4 February. I refer to Peter Dowding's leadership and the very astute and competent leadership of the State Secretary, Steven Smith. But from my perspective the man who stood tallest was the Minister who stood in a marginal seat. He backed himself, he worked diligently, and he won against the odds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the issue of the financial plight of Victoria's health funds. The simple fact is that today five of Victoria's health funds, covering nearly 700,000 people, are on the verge of insolvency. This matter was raised in Question Time today and the reply of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) was that there had been a lot of unfounded media speculation. Well, I shall give the media some foundation for its speculation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been passed figures that I have every reason to believe are yet to be released from the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health. These figures relate to the solvency of five of Victoria's largest health funds. According to these figures, three of the funds are now below the Federal Government's limits of reserves to meet two calendar months of operating expenses. In short, they are broke. Two further funds are sitting just on the Government's solvency level. Curiously, one has been there for 3 1/2 years. Today I spoke with a former officer of the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health, who claimed this uncanny ability to stay just above the Government's solvency ratio was a result of arbitrarily allocating health fund management costs to other non-health fund areas of operation. In other words, such funds are fiddling the books. He stated that they had been encouraged to do so by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the real situation in Victoria, at operating funds, we see the following sad situation: In 1984-85 Victorian health funds made an $18m surplus; in 1985-86 it was a $2m surplus; in 1986-87 a $20m loss; and the projected figures for 1987-88 indicate a $30m loss. If we look at the overall performance of Victorian funds-that is, including other investments-we see there has been a steady decrease from a $24m surplus overall only in 1986-87 to an estimated $12m loss last year. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister was asked about this in Question Time today he totally evaded the issue. First he claimed that reserves had increased from $666m to $820m. That is quite true, but what he omitted to say was that that increase occurred simply as a result of the revaluation of property, a practice that I do not think accountants would particularly approve of. The Health Insurance Commission's own report at page 25 stated that Medibank Private's reserves increased by $41m, but its property revaluation increased its reserves by $49m. So without the revaluation the reserves would have gone down. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Minister claims that Australia-wide the health funds are in reasonably good shape. The vast majority of health funds in Victoria exist only in that State and cannot shuffle money around between other States, so the situation Australia-wide cannot be confused with what is happening in Victoria. Thirdly, the Minister said that his Department had responsibility for monitoring the financial operations of funds. I have mentioned what I believe the Government's monitoring shows. The Minister has these figures and he has not released them. </PARA>
<PARA> This drastic situation has the potential to affect adversely many hundreds of thousands of Victorians, many of them elderly, and is a direct result of the Government ripping $430m from the health insurance industry through such measures as abolishing the reinsurance pool and abolishing the bed-day subsidy. It is now reaping the result of this incompetence and neglect with the crisis situation of the Victorian private health funds. It is simply all the Minister's own work and he is not prepared to face up to what is happening. This was reported in two Victorian newspapers yesterday and the day before. What was the Minister's response? In the Melbourne Herald a spokesman for the Minister was reported as having described the claims as `paranoia'. He was reported as having been a bit more eloquent in the Melbourne Age, which stated, `A spokesman for Dr Blewett said the claims were ``pure paranoia''.' I am simply not prepared to stand by while this Government destroys private medicine in my home State. The Government knows the true situation and is hiding it from the Victorian public. I call on the Minister to come clean, to release his Department's figures, not last year's figures but the current ones, and to tell Victorians the true extent of the damage caused by his Government's policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk tonight about words, but before I do I want to commend the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) for the excellent and well-considered speech which he made tonight on the rabbit farming potential of Australia. It does have enormous potential. I think the honourable member got his figures for total angora production a little confused with goat hair production, but there is no doubt that Australia would have real advantages if it were to develop the angora rabbit and mix the fur with merino wool to produce a textile which would could become world-renowned. This is the sort of value-adding that Australia should be looking at. Some States have recognised this. It is non- sense for the States to maintain their attitude towards the domestication of rabbits. It is quite absurd, because Australia is, after all, an island, and what occurs in one part will inevitably happen in another. We cannot isolate any diseases or problems that arise. Western Australia has investigated this matter very thoroughly and views it in a much more enlightened way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to talk about words, as we all use words all the time. At times various words take on a dark, sinister meaning. Words such as `Darwin' and `Tasmania' have sinister overtones. Then there are magic words such as `abracadabra', `praise the Lord' and `superconductors'. `Superconductors' is the one that worries me, because it seems to be one of the latest magic words in Australia. It concerns me because I fear Australia may be going down a very dangerous road. It is arrant nonsense to suggest that Australia can be at the forefront of superconductors or even at the fringes, given the rapid advances that are being made. No-one knows to this day what the best ceramic is going to be, and it will undoubtedly be surpassed year by year. I recently talked to one of the most enlightened chemical companies in the world, the large French company Rhone-Poulenc. It told me quite openly that it sees involvement in superconductors as being beyond its capacity and that it will sit back and watch for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is an area that Australia can get involved in, and that is technology. Australia has a particular advantage in ceramic technologies. What we should be looking at is a process for the application of superconducting material. The rest of the world is looking for this. In the development of a product we could roughly say that one per cent represents invention, 10 per cent development, and the remainder production. It is probably not quite in that ratio but certainly it is the production that is important. If we were to develop a means of applying superconducting material, we would then not be dependent on having the best superconductor. As new superconductors come on we could simply adapt them and apply them. This is an area in which we have the natural advantage and the expertise, and we are probably the world leaders. This is the area to which we should be directing our resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea that Australia should be spreading its net widely and keeping up with research world-wide is nonsense. It is dangerous folly, and those people who are advocating this I think do Australia's industry potential an enormous disservice. </PARA>

<PARA> by his wartime activities he had `assisted in the persecution of individuals based on race, religion, national origin or political opinion' and was deportable under Section 241 (a) (19) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act 1952 as amended.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kalejs has appealed against the deportation order and it could be a long time before the appeal process is finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Kalejs arrived in Australia on 27 October 1950.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) 12 August 1957.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) If the allegations about Mr Kalejs wartime activities are correct it is possible that Mr Kalejs gave false information both when seeking to migrate to Australia and when applying for Australian citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Section 21 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 (hereafter called `the Act') says that the Minister may deprive a person of his or her Australian citizenship where the person:</PARA>
<PARA> has been convicted under Section 50 of the Act for having made a statement false or misleading in a material particular when applying for citizenship [Section 21 (1) (a) (i)]; or</PARA>
<PARA> has at any time after lodging an application for citizenship, been convicted of an offence which was committed in any country prior to the grant of a certificate of Australian citizenship and for which a sentence of death or imprisonment for a period of not less than twelve months has been imposed [Section 21 (1) (a) (ii)].</PARA>
<PARA> However, prosecution under Section 50 of the Act must be commenced within ten years of commission of the offence; and deprivation under Section 21(10 (a) (ii) of the Act applies only to people who lodge their applications for the grant of Australian citizenship after the commencing day of the Australian Citizenship Amendment Act (No. 129) of 1984 i.e. from 22 November 1984. Thus neither of these provisions applies to Mr Kalejs.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) (a) Section 16 of the Migration Act 1958 (hereafter called `the Act' provides, among other things, that a person is deemed to be a prohibited non-citizen if, when applying for a visa (eg. applying to migrate) the person makes or made, or causes or caused to be made to the Minister or an officer in respect of the grant of the visa a statement that is false or misleading in a material particular. This applies to persons who hold either temporary or permanent entry permits. Section 16 also applies to persons who, at the time of their entry into Australia, have been convicted of certain crimes.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 18 of the Act gives the Minister power to deport persons who are prohibited non-citizens.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Section 12 of the Act gives the Minister power to deport a permanent resident convicted of an offence and sentenced to death or to imprisonment for life or for a period of not less than one year. The section only applies to persons who have been present in Australia as permanent residents for less than ten years, or for periods which, in the aggregate, do not amount to ten years.</PARA>
<PARA> These deportation provisions apply only to immigrants who either have not yet been granted Australian citizenship or who have been deprived of their Australian citizenship. Mr Kalejs ceased being an immigrant for the purposes of the Act when he was granted Australian citizenship in 1957 and hence he falls outside its deportation provisions. Also as indicated in my reply to part (5) above there is no provision within the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to deprive him of his citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) If Mr Kalejs is still an Australian citizen the Government cannot, and would not, take any action to prevent his return. As an Australian citizen, Mr Kalejs would have a legal right to return to Australia.</PARA>
