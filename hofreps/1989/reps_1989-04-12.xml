<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the history books about the period of the Hawke Government are written, there will be quite a deal written about its commitment to social justice. It is my firm view that this Government's commitment to the concept of social justice and its implementation will ensure that it is firmly recorded that this has been and will continue to be a government of vision. A cornerstone of the Government's philosophy is the achievement of a fair and just society. I remind the House that that is based on concepts of equity in the distribution of economic resources, equality of civil, legal and industrial rights, fair and equal access to essential services such as housing, health and education and the opportunity for participation by all in personal development, community life and decision-making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Budget passed last year the Government set about building on its already substantial social justice achievements by continuing to ensure a sustained fast pace of job creation, now at record levels-over 1.3 million jobs have been created by the Hawke Government-and by improving, through further increases in the family allowance supplement or rent assistance, the position of working families to meet the Government's commitment that no child need live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's concern about child poverty that I wish to emphasise today. At the last Federal election the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was clear and explicit in his policy speech. He pledged that our Government would give top priority to ending the financial poverty of Australian families with children. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> By 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty. And to this end, my Government will establish a new program of family help-a program designed to lift more than one million Australian children into security and to help the more than half a million Australian families in greatest need, the hardest pushed, the most disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's new family allowance supplement will be paid to mothers on the basis of family income and family size. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the commitment this Government made. This Government set itself benchmarks, measures of adequacy against which it could be judged. We said that families with children under the age of 13 would get 15 per cent of the married rate pension per child. We said that families with children aged 13, 14 and 15 would get 20 per cent of married rate pension per child. That commitment was historic. For the first time ever a Federal government set a standard of financial support for all our children below which we will not go. We will reach that standard and we will maintain it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made great progress towards achieving that pledge. In the seven years of the Howard-Fraser regime payments for children in low income families were increased once, I repeat once. In 1980 the payment was increased from $7.50 per week to $10-the only increase for low income families in seven years; an abysmal performance. On the other hand, the economic policy of the Opposition when it was on the treasury bench deliberately threw families out of work. The result was devastating. By 1983 one in five Australian children lived in poverty-a scandalous situation. In 1976, 370,000 children were in low income families; by 1983 this figure had grown to 830,000-a period when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer. The response of the Hawke Government in six years is clear and stands in stark contrast to the abysmal position of the Opposition when in Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have increased pension and benefit rates in every year of our term: in 1983 from $10 to $12; in 1984 from $12 to $14; in 1985 from $14 to $16; in 1986 from $16 to $17; in 1987 from $17 to $22 for younger children and $28 for older children; and in 1988 from $22 to $24 for younger children and from $28 to $31 for older children. The progress is there to see. Under the Fraser-Howard Government in seven years there was one increase from $7.50 to $10. In real terms payments to families fell by an abysmal 35 per cent, which represents a dramatic reduction in living standards for Australian families. Under Labor, payments for younger children have increased in real terms by 61 per cent. What a comparison! A real increase so far by this Government of 61 per cent; a real decrease in the Fraser-Howard years of 35 per cent. This Government has increased payments for teenagers by 108 per cent to $31. </PARA>
<PARA> The story does not end there. The Prime Minister set benchmarks for child payments. We have set those benchmarks and we will reach them this year. We will lock in the real value of payments. The Prime Minister went on to say in his policy speech that the Government was not just on about getting all families out of poverty by getting their incomes up. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is just impossible, with any credibility, to proclaim concern for families and then proceed to smash every part of the social infrastructure that determines the welfare of Australian families. Yet that is the measure of our opponents' hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it is. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>For us, the family means jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It means child care. It means education. It means health care that every Australian family can afford. </PARA>
<PARA>How true his words were. This Government has maintained its extraordinary rate of employment growth. As I have said, it has created 1.3 million jobs. We have maintained our commitment to public housing and home purchase assistance. We have expanded rent assistance to low income working families. We have expanded child-care places at an unprecedented rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Retention rates in schools have exploded, from 36 per cent when we came to power in 1983 to the current 59 per cent, and tertiary places are increasing. These are the opportunities that this Government has set about giving Australian people-educational opportunities to ensure that they can find fulfilment in the work force. This Government has provided the fairest and most comprehensive health care system in the nation's history. Medicare grows stronger and stronger and the people who benefit most from this are Australia's working families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has gone further. Half of all children in poverty in 1983 were in sole parent families. We have introduced the child support scheme to deliver regular secure child support for them each month. We have introduced the jobs, education and training scheme to help sole parents to overcome the disabilities they face in the labour market, to give their families the opportunity to live like the bulk of other families in Australia. We have increased the mothers' or guardians' allowance in real terms. We have introduced the Newstart program to overcome the scarring of long term unemployment, to deliver to ordinary Australian working families shut out of the mainstream a new chance to share the full benefits of economic recovery-something foreign to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate about child poverty is a debate about standards, again a subject which is foreign to the Opposition. Because the concept of poverty is so ridden with value judgments, this Government set some objective standards. Each younger child should attract a minimum of 15 per cent of married rate pension. Each teenager should attract a minimum of 20 per cent of that rate. The Government did that following detailed work on the issue by Bettina Cass. The approach that Howard adopted in government was the exact opposite. To pass the hat around at the end of the Budget was his Cabinet approach. That approach resulted in one nominal increase in seven years and a massive reduction in real terms of 35 per cent. On the other hand, the nation has seen a dramatic increase in real terms under the Hawke Labor Government. The Leader of the Opposition now says that he does not even want to do that. He will reverse policies designed to protect low income families from the drop in national income. His personal document Future Directions says so at page 53. That is the measure of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> If we contrast that with the performance of this Government we will see that the measures taken to assist families and children in poverty truly have as their basis the concept of meeting standards of social justice. When the history books are written, this Government will be seen as one of vision for what it has done in the area of social justice and for what it has done for Australian families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak about the state of the health industry in Australia. In doing so I also want to talk about the Government's often repeated claim that two million Australians were disenfranchised under the previous Government and to speak briefly about the situation of people travelling overseas with Medicare benefit coverage. I have sat in this House for almost two years now and at least a dozen times I have heard from the Government that over two million Australians were disenfranchised from health care insurance prior to the Labor Government being elected. The last time I heard it was when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) mentioned it in Question Time last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I tried to verify those facts I found a March 1983 document from the Australian Bureau of Statistics entitled `Health Insurance Survey', which was the last health insurance survey undertaken by the Bureau. Table 14 in the document looks at the number of Australians without health insurance. Rather than the two million figure that I have heard talked about so often, the figure in the table is actually 1,031,500. But if one looks closer one sees that 391,000 of those lived in Queensland and had access to free hospital treatment; a further 140,000 had pensioner health benefit cards or access to medicine under repatriation benefits; and another 123,000 said that they did not need health insurance because they were healthy enough and they chose not to have it. That leaves 376,500 people, which is a far cry from the two million people that I have heard about so often. Irrespective of whether Medicare was introduced to help two million or 376,000 people, one must ask what the effect will be in my home State and your home State, Madam Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> Two days ago the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health released its December quarter figures on health insurance coverage around Australia and these figures have set a new low mark. They showed that 46.2 per cent of Australians now have private health insurance-for nine successive quarters there has been a drop and that is yet another record low since health insurance statistics were first taken over 15 years ago. What is happening because of this? The financial viability of the health funds is threatened; there is an increased burden on our public hospital system; and there is an adverse effect on the elderly. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than the Prime Minister waxing lyrical, as he did last Tuesday, about what has happened in the health industry, he should look at the industry. He will find that it is having a very difficult time, for a number of reasons. The first reason is reinsurance. This is a measure first proposed by the then Government in 1979 to pay the costs of nursing home-type patients who were in private hospitals. It was a commitment by the then Government to the elderly of Australia. Initially the amount was set at $50m but it was increased to $115m in 1982-83. It is now sitting at $1m and the funds have had to pick up the difference. The second reason for the difficulty is the introduction of Medibank Private. That health insurance fund has had the ability to transfer profits from Victoria around Australia, thereby underpining its national operations. Other funds have not been able to do that. Other funds have not been able to share joint costs and appropriate them to the health fund in a beneficial way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has specifically prevented funds from accumulating special reserves for long term hospital patients; then it complains when the funds have difficulty in meeting those obligations. The Government has added a burden of $500m to Australia's private health insurance in the last five years. Specifically, it has abolished the bed day subsidy, at a cost of $140m a year; it has reduced benefits for medical services in hospitals from 85 to 75 per cent; and it has lifted the $20 cap. That has added a $105m burden to the health funds. The Government has required health funds to pay for prostheses and it has determined that patients going to public hospitals are deemed to be private. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria there is a chronic nursing home shortage. Per head of elderly population, Victoria has the lowest number of nursing home beds of any State in Australia. What that means is that in country hospitals where there is not the access to nursing homes, privately insured patients go into a hospital even though they should be in a nursing home and the health insurance funds have to pay their costs. The average cost is $52,800 a year. With the current premium rates it would take 142 years for the health funds to recover those costs; yet they are having to pay them right now. That leads us to the present situation where health funds in Victoria are making a combined $30m loss in the financial year, on top of a $20m financial loss last year. That cannot continue if the funds are to keep operating. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking through the history of health insurance in Australia I came across the summarised findings of the Nimmo commission in 1969. It found in looking at private health insurance that the operation of the scheme was unnecessarily complex-beyond the comprehension of many; that benefits received by contributors are frequently much less than the cost of hospital and medical treatment; that contributions had increased to such an extent that they were beyond the capacity of some members of the community and involved considerable hardships for others; that an unduly high proportion of contributions received by some organisations were absorbed in operating expenses; that the cost of illness may include, in addition to hospital accommodation, treatment and medical service, a wide range of other services which had never been covered by the health insurance scheme; and that there was a high level of reserves held by some organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> That was 20 years ago. For all the great rhetoric that we hear about how much things have changed, they have not changed at all in 20 years. All that has changed is that from a high level of reserves we now have health funds which in some cases in my State are below the statutory two calendar months requirement. While that is an artificial figure-I concede two months may not mean anything if health funds are making a profit-if health funds in my State are making a $30m loss, the two calendar months requirement becomes very significant. </PARA>
<PARA> What will this mean? It all impinges very severely on the elderly in the population. The Government has recognised the need for reinsurance. Indeed, we are expecting legislation on that in this place in the next couple of weeks. A particular problem with older people is that if they are nursing home-type patients, the health fund has to pay. If they are older persons-over 65 years-they will take $3 out of the funds for every $1 they put in. I understand that the response of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) will be to share the costs between all the funds. I also understand that the Government will remove its obligation to the reinsurance pool. That reinsurance pool, which was set up in 1979, recognised the Commonwealth's direct responsibility for care of older people. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the 1950s the Commonwealth had actually paid directly the bills of nursing home-type patients and chronic patients. The reinsurance fund was set up as a more efficient way of dealing with these payments. From being $100m in 1981, this contribution to the care of elderly Australians has now dwindled to $1m a year. While the Government concedes the need for reinsurance, it will remove its own obligation to look after elderly Australians-an obligation government has conceded since the late 1950s. It says, `We have to have reinsurance but we don't want to have anything to do with it'. It is a very short term fix. It will cause the level of health insurance to decrease significantly below what is already a record low level. It is very hard to see how the funds in my State and yours, Madam Speaker, can survive, given that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The final thing I mention is a situation raised with me by a constituent; that is, Medicare benefits for people travelling overseas. The situation was changed on 1 January by the Government. The Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) in the other place-I quote from the Senate Hansard of 20 December 1988-said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . not all of those who travel overseas get sick-so why should those Australians who do not have the privilege of travelling overseas subsidise those who do?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to ask why people in those special circumstances should not protect themselves merely by taking out comprehensive travel insurance and not be a burden on the others. There is a particular problem with this argument and that is the situation if one has a chronic illness. I do not know whether it has happened to you, Madam Speaker, but if one has a chronic illness and one attempts to get comprehensive travel insurance one will not be covered. We have a situation where any Australians with, perhaps, diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis who attempt to get travel insurance overseas find they do not have Medicare benefits covering them and they cannot get covered by health insurance. This is of particular concern to such people. It appears that it has not been recognised in that legislation and it is of great concern to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to speak about a matter of great concern not only to the people of my electorate of Bowman but also to many others on Brisbane's southside who are experiencing severe noise pollution problems as a result of the opening of the new Brisbane Airport last year. I raise this matter in this debate because it is an example of the huge capital investment being made by the Federal Government in a project which, because of bad planning, particularly in the late 1970s prior to this Government attaining office, is now causing misery to many thousands of people who happen to be unfortunate enough to live under the flight paths of the new Brisbane Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The source of their anger lies not so much in the fact that they have the noise-although obviously that concerns them, as I will tell honourable members later-but in the fact that they have never suffered this noise before. With the opening of the new Brisbane Airport the noise shifted from one area of Brisbane-in other words, an area where it had always been-to a completely new area. What is angering people the most is the fact that they purchased properties in areas where there was no noise pollution and, all of a sudden, they find themselves underneath flight paths, with the resultant loss of their peaceful use and enjoyment of their properties and the loss of property values. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who had the foresight to investigate the potential difficulties at the time the new airport was proposed were assured that all planes landing at and departing from Brisbane's new airport would do so over Moreton Bay. The people of Hemmant and Tingalpa and other areas that are not in my electorate, such as Morningside, Camp Hill, Belmont-parts of which are in my electorate-Cannon Hill and a number of other southern suburbs now have a discomfort which at times becomes absolutely unbearable. I remind honourable members that no curfew exists at the new Brisbane Airport. The noise is something that residents have to contend with 24 hours a day. In fact, yesterday the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) asked the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) why 11 aircraft were allowed to break the curfew hours at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport because of the air traffic controllers' disruptions. I remember that the answer to the question was that special dispensation had been given because of exceptional circumstances. I accept that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the difference between the thousands of people who live around Brisbane Airport, particularly those who have never been subjected to this sort of noise before, and the residents of Sydney? I am all for the curfew at Sydney Airport but I just wonder what differentiation is made between residents around Sydney Airport and those around Brisbane Airport. They are no different. It seems fairly obvious to me-and I will discuss this later-that whatever the reasons were for the curfew being lifted at the Brisbane Airport those reasons no longer exist and the curfew should be reimposed. I hasten to add at this point that neither this Government nor any previous Labor government instigated the planning for and the construction of the new Brisbane Airport. Decisions on the location of the new airport and the construction of its runways were made long before the present Government came to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say one thing which I am sure those who suffer the noise problems would want me to say on their behalf. Frankly, I am sick and tired of the doubting Thomases, those who continually berate and ridicule the noise affected residents and those who berate and ridicule even people like me because I always make it an issue and because I always stand up for what I believe in. I believe that these people should enjoy what everybody else in areas that do not have airport flight paths enjoy-that is, the peaceful use and enjoyment of their properties. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the comments that I often hear are: `It is not that bad', `Surely you can get used to it', `Obviously, you are exaggerating', `The aircraft have to go somewhere'. It is easy to say, but I wonder how those people would feel if aircraft were going over their houses. I challenge any of these doubting Thomases in the media, in surrounding areas and even amongst colleagues on both sides of this House to come and live in areas that are affected by noise pollution, or at least spend a day and a night there and see what it is all about. Unfortunately, the attitude of a lot of people is the attitude that sometimes permeates throughout the community-that is, `I am all right Jack. It does not matter because it does not affect me'. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell the House that two people, Warren and Jean Bowden, are very actively involved in the noise protest action groups in the Brisbane southern suburbs. I have had cause to call them on a number of occasions. Only the other day I spoke to the Bowdens on the phone and twice during that three minute conversation Warren had to say, `Stop, I cannot hear you because there are planes going over our house'. I was on the other end of the phone and I could not hear him speak. I could actually hear in Canberra the extremely bad noise they were suffering in Morningside which is not in my electorate; nevertheless, they are people who are affected. In addition to that I have received a letter from one of my constituents. This is only an example of some 600 letters that I have received. Some of them are in more serious terms than this. This letter is from a Mrs Major, a lady who is in her advanced years and who resides at Morningside. Amongst other things she states:</PARA>
<PARA>I got my house washed down on the 18th December '88 as it was a disgrace with black fallout, no doubt due to the planes overhead. It cost me $80 . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I was away ten days over Easter and when I came back and saw my house I could have cried very easily after paying to get it washed down three months ago as well as to preserve the paint which was done 2 years ago this coming May. With the rain we have had the house is almost as bad as it was before I got it washed down. </PARA>
<PARA> It is senseless on the Aviation Department's view denying fallout. At times you can smell it no lie and that is why myself and many others are suffering with sinus and other respiratory complaints. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I not only can't hear T.V. but sometimes they seem as though they are coming in my back window. Why should we have to suffer this after living in a suburb for 60 years paying rates, insurance, etc and have to put up with this in our late years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am willing to let anyone come and look at the outside of my house to see the fallout which comes down worse in wet weather. </PARA>
<PARA>She goes on to talk about those sorts of problems. I have at least 600 of these letters that contain examples much worse than Mrs Major has given. I sympathise with what she has to say because I can relate to exactly what she is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the planning for the new airport it was widely stated in official publications and documents that Brisbane's new airport would mean relief from noise problems for many neighbouring suburbs. In fact, a document which I have in my possession states:</PARA>
<PARA>New runway alignments will mean take-offs and landings will generally be over Moreton Bay, reducing the number of homes adversely affected by noise from 3500 with current airport operations to fewer than 20. By the time aircraft leaving the new airport pass over residential areas, they will be high enough not to create a noise nuisance, giving Brisbane an airport capable of operating 24 hours a day. </PARA>
<PARA>As the residents of Brisbane southern suburbs know all too well, this statement is clearly false and the thing which angers local residents is that many professional people and other individuals made public submissions at the time the planning was being carried out to the effect that the new airport would do nothing to improve noise conditions over Brisbane and would, if anything, exacerbate these problems. The Federal Joint Committee on Public Works and the Brisbane Airport Advisory Committee were two groups which were looking at submissions from professional and public bodies around the time of the planning of the new airport. Indeed, the honourable member for Griffith, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), and the State member for Lytton, Mr Burns, both warned of the consequences should the airport be built in the area as planned. In a submission to those committees, the air traffic controllers said:</PARA>
<PARA>It will not reduce noise pollution, but merely move the noise sensitive area to a new group of suburbs. Imagine the shock and bitter disappointment which will pervade the citizens of Brisbane when operations commence from the new runway. </PARA>
<PARA>The air pilots' submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We were told what the Department was doing but we had hoped all along that people would sensibly see the error of their ways . . . unless we can point out to you the total disaster this area is going to be without a cross runway, I think we have failed. </PARA>
<PARA>We may well ask why these committees did not heed the warnings given to them by professional and community groups. It is now recognised that the reason for the siting of the new Brisbane Airport at its current location and the alignment of the runway was purely political. The Federal seat of Lilley at that time was held by Mr Kevin Cairns who was under extreme pressure from his constituents to do something about Brisbane noise problems. I know how he felt. It is widely acknowledged now that the decision on Brisbane Airport was largely influenced by a desire to hold the seat of Lilley for the Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the bitterness or finger-pointing which we politicians sometimes indulge in will solve this problem. The reality is that we now have this airport and it is operational. It will achieve nothing to blame previous governments, and I do not intend to do that. But I do want to make it quite clear that whilst it is a problem that we have inherited as a government, it is a problem that was foisted upon us by a previous Liberal government. Therefore, the issue is not political. I hope that those who live in the vicinity of Sydney Airport, who will suffer further noise pollution as a result of the third runway, will not blame the Labor Party and its members. If they were to do the silly thing and elect Liberal candidates, the Liberals would be quite happy to put five or six parallel runways there. There would be a fourth runway, a fifth runway and a sixth runway. </PARA>
<PARA> The configuration of Brisbane Airport is as follows: The main runway, known as O19, is the one causing all the problems. In addition to that runway, there is a smaller runway, known as 14/32, which is perpendicular. We call it the cross-runway. This smaller runway is not suitable for larger aircraft but is aligned in such a way that the overwhelming majority of take-offs and landings would be over Brisbane's Moreton Bay. The cost of expanding this cross-runway is something which this Government will seriously have to consider in the near future. The alternative to extending this cross-runway is to build a runway parallel to the existing runway. This is the worst fear of local residents, as it would mean a doubling of the noise problems which they are already expected to endure. The Joint Standing Committee on Public Works concluded in 1981 that the 14/32 cross-runway is best to meet the demands of forecast traffic in terms of safety and noise pollution and that it should be extended for these reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> People in my area are extremely wary of the recent decision to build a third runway at Sydney Airport. They quite correctly liken it to building a parallel runway at Brisbane Airport, which would compound the aircraft noise pollution, health and safety problems currently being experienced. It is expected that Brisbane will become Australia's second largest airport in the next decade or so. We have the opportunity now to avoid the situation which is faced in Sydney. We now have the opportunity to stop all plans for a parallel runway and start investing in the extension of the cross-runway, 14/32. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which has made my electors quite angry is the fact that the curfew on Brisbane's old airport was lifted on quite false pretences. At the time of the planning for the new airport, it was stated that it would be curfew-free but it was stated that this was possible only because the new airport would supposedly not provide any aircraft noise problems. In fact, the glossy brochure put out by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation said, `There will be fewer than 20 houses affected'. That was an absolute lie. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a fraud. The reality is that some thousands of houses have been affected. So much for the credibility of the civil aviation authorities from the 1970s until the present. Frankly, I think the Civil Aviation Authority has a lot to answer for when it comes to the question of the use and enjoyment of people's properties, whether it be in relation to the Sydney Airport or Brisbane Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A survey of 78 homes at the end of last year by one of the noise protest groups which exist to lobby on this issue revealed that 84 per cent of householders living in the vicinity of airports live in fear of low flying aeroplanes and the dangers of a crash. The survey also pointed out that a number of very serious health problems are associated with people living near airports. In my electorate and in the southern suburbs of Brisbane two voluntary social workers have had to be employed virtually on a full time basis to counsel these people who are being driven mad and who, as I say, are having respiratory problems and other associated problems. There are so many of these people. </PARA>
<PARA> My electors and the electors of the south side are getting tired of this problem. They expect someone to try to help them. I pay special tribute to the previous Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), who took some notice of my problem, of the problem of the southside residents. He visited the electorate. He spoke with the protesters. He was all but ready to announce a package of measures which I believe would have helped the situation. Unfortunately, he resigned from the Ministry. He must be commended for what he did because it shows the sincerity of his wishes regarding the use and enjoyment of properties by his residents. He made the ultimate sacrifice; he sacrificed a ministry, which we all aspire to in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The airline companies, as well as the Civil Aviation Authority, have a responsibility to the public they supposedly serve to ensure that noise pollution is not continued in residential areas. I have written to both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines Ltd asking them to do something about the problem. Ansett at least wrote back. That arrogant company, Australian Airlines Ltd, did not even bother to acknowledge receipt of my letter. It stands condemned for that. I call on the new Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) to revitalise the package, to come to my electorate-which I am sure she will do, as I have already made an appointment to see her-and do what the residents want. They want an extension of the cross-runway so that all planes will go over the bay; they want the introduction of a curfew or at least restrictions before any international terminal is built; and they want airline companies to reschedule their noisier aircraft out of Brisbane Airport so that residents do not have to cop all that noise. They do not want a parallel runway to be built at any time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legitimate concerns of the people on the south side of Brisbane. I assure them that I will continue my fight to help them as much as I possibly can. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) may be concerned about aircraft noise, but Australians are concerned at present about whether aeroplanes will fly at all. It would be good to see the Government taking some strong action in regard to the current difficulties being experienced by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) with air traffic controllers. If this country is to continue to have small unions holding vital transport services to ransom, it will suffer a great loss to its economy and to its developing tourist trade. Perhaps the honourable member could turn his mind to those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During debate on the Appropriation Bills one may talk about a whole range of financial matters. I wish to talk about some of those issues today. Tonight we will hear an economic statement which will impact upon all of us, regardless of where we live in this country. Some areas in Australia have particular concerns. I refer to regional Australia-farmers, people who live in provincial cities and those who live in the smaller States. Not all Australians live in large cities although, admittedly, the vast majority do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in determining the range of activity of its financial programs, needs on all occasions to take into account the needs of regional areas in this country. Families in regional Australia have been suffering for a considerable time and continue to suffer. All of us know that inflation levels, as high as they are, and interest rates-the blunt instrument of economic control being employed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-impact on all of us. But when one takes those issues which impact on family incomes and puts them together with some other policy directions taken by government which affect people in regional Australia, one sees that they are suffering a double whammy. I think this Government is ignoring some of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> I represent a seat in Tasmania. We have taken consistently disproportionately larger cuts from this Government during its period in office. The editorial in the Examiner in Launceston on Tuesday, 11 April, stated that further cuts in government spending are indeed necessary, as all of us would recognise, to address the economic imperatives we, as a nation, must face. Quite simply Australia cannot afford to have tonight a statement which is an election-based, economic package. If there is an avoidance by the Government of making tough decisions, we will all be the sufferers. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point is this: When the Government determines spending programs and future policy options, each area of Australia deserves to be treated fairly. It is quite clear that Tasmania-and I am sure people from South Australia and perhaps from other States will have similar views-has been treated particularly unfairly in recent years. Indeed, only last week on 7 April the Hobart Mercury ran a headline titled `Fairness essential in federal spending'. The editorial went on at some length to castigate the Federal Government for its system which militates against Tasmania getting its fair proportion of Federal Government spending, especially in the capital works area. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures that were released by the Federal Government confirm that Tasmania has been missing out badly on money for capital works. They show that total government spending on capital works in Tasmania in this and the next few years will amount to only $38.62 per head. This compares with $198.96 per head in New South Wales and $157.44 per head in Victoria. The figures are contained in the document `The Commonwealth Construction Programme 1988-89' published last month. Those details show that Tasmania is at the bottom of the scale in terms of expenditure per capita. Tasmanians of both political persuasions are upset and outraged at the treatment they have received. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania gets next to nothing in the way of defence projects. It has been the practice in this place by those on the other side to criticise the former Prime Minister, but from Tasmania's point of view Malcolm Fraser was concerned about Tasmania. He recognised the importance of regional Australia and was prepared to govern for all Australians. With the Hawke-Keating duo, we are starting to see a selective approach in terms of expenditure of Commonwealth finance to buttress areas where they think they will maximise votes. That is an abrogation of the responsibility that is reposed in them as the leaders of this country to treat every Australian as far as possible in a fair and equitable way. As I said, the people in my State of both political persuasions have not been treated fairly. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Government to reconsider all that it is doing with regard to Tasmania. The Government knows that the loss of the Wesley Vale pulp mill was an economic blow not just to Tasmania, but to Australia. Admittedly, there needs to be a balancing between environmental and economic concerns and all of us in this place search for that, but we need to put in place proper mechanisms, proper consultative arrangements, and guidelines that are published well in advance so that everyone knows where he or she is going. If we do not do that, we will end up with the difficulty that we have just experienced and the debacle that occurred during that Wesley Vale program. </PARA>

<PARA> Another major event that has taken place on the Opposition side of the chamber has been the establishment of the Waste Watch Committee. This Committee has been very successful in identifying waste in government. It was formerly chaired by the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). The Committee is now chaired by me and has on it the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) from Western Australia and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) from New South Wales respectively. It is quite clear that our economy is under seige and it is more important than ever to improve productivity and efficiency and to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely. The Waste Watch Committee's early successes in identifying and stopping extravagances such as the $200m Commonwealth employment program excesses and identifying the silly grants such as the $11,000 for the Wild Women Surfboard are well known to many of us. Others that received less publicity were far in excess of those examples. </PARA>
<PARA> Waste Watch will be looking at those types of areas and at new areas. We want to look at defence procurement and at ministerial consultants. The use of ministerial consultants is an industry that has been growing quietly in the background. We want to identify whether those consultants are actually doing work or whether it is a case of money being paid to mates by Ministers. That would be totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to look at the statistics gathering arrangements in this country. The Australian Bureau of Statistics needs to gather statistics, but the time it takes small business people to fill out returns that are required from the Bureau needs to be questioned in a little more detail than ever before because in business time is money. We need to have a good database, but we do not want to overdo it. I suspect that we may well be overdoing it. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look at a myriad of other Federal Government spending areas, but we aim to identify constructively waste and low productivity areas in the Federal administration. At a time like this in Australia's history when we are suffering extreme economic pressures that are not being managed with the proper response, we can criticise the Treasurer for charting an economic path that is taking him down a road to nowhere. He is using that blunt instrument of interest rates; he will send the economy into a recession; and his response tonight will be nothing more than a political posturing exercise to try to offend as few as possible, but to create that window of opportunity so that he can go for an early election as soon as possible, perhaps even before the next Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that management of the economy that will be the test in this chamber of who will form the next government. I have every confidence that it will be the people on this side of the House who are now charting a new course in the face of the reality of what is happening to the economy and where it is going. The future government, composed of members from this side of the House, will treat regional Australia fairly. It will take account of the fact that it should not just buy votes in capital cities, that it has a responsibility to look after all Australians. Tonight will be a very interesting test. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to some more recent examples of government waste, as identified by the Waste Watch Committee. Yesterday in this chamber there was great debate about the future role and administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. We have had detailed debate on that issue. It was interesting to see that the Auditor-General's report on the Department of Aboriginal Affairs confirmed what our spokesman had been saying for a long period; that is, that there had been maladministration of that Department. The previous Minister bears a great responsibility in this area, but seems to be escaping scrutiny. The current Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) stonewalls every question, but he knows that the administration of the Department is in a complete mess. </PARA>
<PARA> An example that was revealed in the Auditor-General's report showed that $5,000 was expended in only four months on replenishing the nine bar fridges belonging to the Secretary, deputy secretaries and regional directors. Another example was the $3,500 spent outside the Secretary's guidelines and Finance direction on hospitality for meals. It was a common occurrence, apparently, for officers of the Department, while in receipt of travel allowance, to claim for meals when meals were already provided as part of hospitality. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of activity is not acceptable. It has been identified by the Auditor-General and ought not to be happening in other departments. Those in other departments ought to be aware that people on this side of the House take a particularly dim view of that sort of activity. It is the responsibility of Ministers administering departments to ensure that that sort of activity does not take place. They ought to be personally involved in much closer scrutiny of the administration of their departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Abuses have been revealed by the Auditor-General at the highest levels of the Aboriginal Affairs Department. Admittedly, the sums are small but, as all of us know, problems begin when we start to think that sums are small. Each dollar is important to every Australian. Every Australian wants to know that each dollar he spends in tax is spent wisely. He wants to know that it is not wasted and that he is getting value for money. He knows that if we in this place make the dollars go further he will have to contribute less in the way of taxation and he will be left with more in his pocket to pursue his personal priorities, whether holidays, education for his children, or whatever. It is far better for each Australian to determine his spending patterns than for us in government to take more and more and spend it and, more importantly, spend it unwisely. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting area the Waste Watch Committee has identified has been that of the prices network. The honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) runs around the country talking about how we need to look at prices and pursue the issue of prices. He says that it is terrible that the prices are going up and in the same breath says it has nothing to do with the Government, that it is all the fault of big business. Government does have a responsibility. I suspect-and have made the allegation-that the Government, with its prices network system, is creating a political front, a political blind. It is appealing to people's base prejudices. None of us likes high prices, but the Government is trying to divert attention from its failure to address the fundamentals that need to be addressed to ensure that businesses can put products on shelves at prices that people can afford. </PARA>
<PARA> How is it doing this? Perhaps you, Mr Deputy Speaker, should know, as you are a member of this Government. I understand that the Government has a Caucus secretariat from which it employs additional staff. These additional staff are allocated to Labor Party members, one of whom is the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), to assist in creating and developing prices network information which is put together in press releases right around the country. These press releases claim the Government is doing all it can and the problems are all the fault of business or supermarkets; they are nothing to do with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have discovered that since 1 July, 12 staff have been employed part time in various offices. They are paid at the rate of $13.64 an hour. All the senators and members connected with the prices network have been provided with fax machines. For example, $46,000 is provided annually by the Federal Government to employ part time staff in the office of the coordinator of the Caucus committee secretariat for this specific purpose. Why is that particular grant made directly to the Caucus committee secretariat? Another $87,000 has been provided to five Federal Labor members of parliament for additional hardware and software in their offices to gather information on this prices network. Grants in aid totalling $66,000 have been paid to the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and the Australian Pensioners Federation to try to encourage them to be supportive, not critical, of anything that the Labor Party does. That type of direction of funding is not in the best interests of Australians. If those funds were directed towards developing more realistic policy options, allied to what the Treasurer could be saying tonight, the question of supermarket prices and other issues would be more readily addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly-and we have said this consistently-price watching is not in itself inherently bad. It does have some advantages. But we maintain that in its price watching the Government is trying to captivate genuine price watching, convert it to political ends to support its own needs and divert the attention of people away from the fundamental issues that are causing problems. These fundamental issues include an inflation rate which is three times that of our major trading partners, trade deficits and the level of imports and the lack of policies that support import substitution. Those are the things on which this Government should be concentrating; it should not be spending money on getting Labor backbenchers to run around the country making good fellows of themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example that I should quote, given that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) is in the House, is the recent example of the advertising campaign on the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme with the generic drug initiative. There was some frivolity in the marketing strategy used and that is indicative of the gimmickry that has been part of the approach of this Government in trying to get its message across. We have had the Priority One: Young Australia situation and we have had other instances where a lot of funds have been spent in just trying to get the message across in a gimmicky sort of way. But this giant pill exercise in recent times takes the prize. Pharmacists received a plastic capsule, 10 inches in length, containing information on the changes that had already been sent out to them three times before. The information contained nothing new. The capsule is a great big container that cost three times as much as a standard letter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to what happens to the containers. The total cost has yet to be revealed by the Government but I think it ought to be. There may well have been consultants involved in this strategy and they charge a great deal of money. Between $40,000 and $50,000 may well have been spent to send out information that pharmacists and doctors already had. That information was sent out to some 30,000 doctors and 5,000 pharmacists around the country. Members of the Government might say it was a good idea. But what do the pharmacists and doctors think about it? They pay tax. They know they have a responsibility to deal professionally with changes in drug arrangements and they will do that. But let the Government ask them what they think about it. We have had these little red and white containers dropped off at our offices around the country and I would not be surprised if there were members on that side of the House who have returned these containers suggesting that this marketing strategy is over the top; that it is a waste of money. That is an example of the types of excesses of government that Australia cannot afford any more. We want efficient government. We want government that takes account of every dollar that it spends, taking the view that a dollar saved is a dollar less that we have to take out of the pockets of ordinary average Australians who are suffering greatly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will be my role as Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee, together with my colleagues both in the Senate and in this place, to identify and bring to the attention of Ministers, some of whom do not seem to take a close enough interest in the administration of their portfolios, ways in which money can be constructively saved. That is the important thing. All of us in this place want to be constructive. We want to save money and taxes. In that way families get a better go and we get a better Australia. That is something which we should all be pursuing with real diligence in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin let me say that honourable members probably will not like this speech because it is about a new tax, not removing tax. I would like to begin by quoting C. S. Lewis, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of 60 minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is. </PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the Australian people are aware of the nuclear winter, the greenhouse effect, ozone holes, et cetera, and the general destruction of our precious environment. I would like to approach the environment question from another perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time scientists have been trying to contact other civilisations in distant worlds and there has been no sign as yet that there is anyone else out there. It appears that we on Earth are alone. When we think about this it is obvious that we are custodians of life for this whole universe. We have an awesome responsibility. We have to survive and we have to make certain that future generations survive so that they may explore and expand into other worlds. This may appear a very fanciful dream to some, but I can assure honourable members that before the year 2100 humans will be living on a number of planets within our own solar system. </PARA>
<PARA> Our environment on this planet is deteriorating extremely quickly as our ever-increasing population rushes to use the resources with which the earth is blessed. Every person has the right to a decent standard of living. If the world's millions had the same standard of living as that enjoyed by the majority of the Australian population, the planet's resources would be consumed and devastated in a very short time and pollution would wreak havoc on our environment. Some time ago I proposed in this House that a levy be placed on polluters and pollutants to fund research into the greenhouse effect. As yet nothing has happened in respect of that proposal. However, I am very pleased to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) have announced that approximately $8m has been allocated by this Labor Government for research into the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go further than that and propose that a pollution tax be introduced immediately. This proposition has been looked at by a certain Wallace Oates, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland in the United States of America. Some of his arguments for a pollution tax are very compelling. Taxes on pollution not only offer an effective policy approach to the protection of the environment but also provide a very appealing addition to the revenue system-I am sure Senator Walsh would be very pleased with this proposal. Whilst most taxes have a harmful side effect on the economy by distorting economic choices, taxes on pollution have a socially beneficial side effect in that they cost society less than the revenue they produce. I am certain also that this sort of tax would be electorally acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic case for pollution taxes is really just a straightforward corollary of the logic underlying a market system. The proper functioning of a system of free markets depends on the emergence of a set of prices that accurately reflect the cost to society of the resources used in the production of goods and services. Prices are the basic signals in a market system that direct the flow of resources to their most productive use. For most goods and services, the market forces of supply and demand generate the proper price. </PARA>
<PARA> Under certain circumstances, however, such prices may not reflect true social cost-and pollution is a classic case of such a circumstance. The basic point is straightforward: the absence of an appropriate price for certain of our scarce environmental resources, such as clean air and water, has led to their overuse, resulting in what the textbooks call a case of market failure. A producer, for example, whose factory spews smoke on a neighbouring residential area is using up a scarce resource-clean air. Put slightly differently, the producer is imposing real costs on those who must live with the dirty air. But the firm need not bear this cost in the same way that it pays for other resources-labour and raw materials-that it employs. </PARA>
<PARA> While the price of labour and materials encourages the firm to economise on their use, there is no such incentive for the firm to control its smoke emissions. Whenever a scarce resource is made available free of charge, as is the case where individuals have free access to our limited stocks of clean air and water, it is bound to be used to excess. Producers and consumers alike must be made to bear the costs that their activities impose on others if they are to be expected to adjust these activities in light of costs. </PARA>
<PARA> From this perspective, the basic cause of excessive environmental degradation is the absence of an appropriate price for scarce environmental resources. Once accepted, this proposition has a direct policy implication: the need for government to intervene and, in the absence of the interplay of supply and demand, to impose an artificial price, a tax or effluent fee, on damaging waste emissions. It is easy to show in terms of micro-economic analysis that if this tax is set equal to the value of the damages from an additional unit of emissions, sources will have the proper incentive for controlling their discharges of pollutants. </PARA>
<PARA> Pollution taxes provide a powerful set of incentives that encourage both the selection of the proper control technology among existing options and the search for new and more effective abatement procedures. Such activities would be directly profitable to polluters since they would reduce costs. For example, a firm that discovers a less expensive way to control its waste discharges could employ this new technique to reduce its discharges yet further. It would realise savings both on its control activities and on its tax bill as a result of lowering the level of waste emissions. Society benefits from the cleaner environment that results in turn. A system of pollution taxes would effectively harness the powerful market force of competition on behalf of environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA> Some concern has naturally been expressed over the potential inflationary impact of taxes on pollution. However, these concerns have, I think, been greatly exaggerated. Pollution taxes would constitute only a tiny fraction of the costs of most polluting industries so that their effect on the prices of final outputs is likely to be small. Moreover, a system of pollution taxes will set in motion a process of innovation in abatement technology that over time should lead to significant cost savings that would largely offset or, perhaps, more than offset any inflationary effects. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that today-the day that the April statement is about to be brought down-is a very appropriate day for me to raise the question of a new tax, a tax that I have said before would be acceptable to the majority of the Australian community. This very day we read that once again the oil companies are pressuring the Government to lower their taxes and Senator Cook has announced a review of the oil excise regime and the total tax structure for the industry. The oil industry is one of the world's greatest polluters, if not the greatest. I feel that it should be the first to pay a pollution tax. It is responsible for car emissions and oil spills. The latter have been graphically demonstrated by what happened in Alaska. The oil industry is responsible for all of those things. That industry has made billions of dollars from the resources of this planet. Now is the time for it to give a little back, to repair some of the damage it has done. </PARA>
<PARA> A pollution tax that is spent on returning our environment to a healthy and safe place to live in I am certain would be worthwhile. We are running out of time and I believe that we should act immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Twelve months ago on a Supply Bill in the old Parliament House I had the opportunity to present a maiden speech, joining three other contemporaries who had recently joined Parliament-the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). As the member for Adelaide I am pleased to have taken my place in this Parliament and to speak on behalf of my constituents scores of times on a lot of issues affecting retirees, pensioners and veterans and on issues such as the Government's mishandling of the availability of X-rated and pornographic videos and drugs in schools. Today is the very significant day that the April economic statement is to be brought down. There are two teams promoting the cause of their champions and there is a lot of heady debate. When the people of Australia dissect what is going on, I guess they still see the democratic principle of parliament working in a true cause. I guess they will see further examples as the jokes go around Australia from the comedy cafe. The latest one doing the rounds is, `If the answer is Paul Keating it must have been a very silly question'!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today the people of Australia will be treated to another bout of pre-election conning by the Hawke-Keating Government. In exchange for the much touted tax cuts they will be asked to forget or put aside the six years of mismanagement and hardship experienced under this Government. The people are somehow expected to forget the serious decline in living standards since 1983, the chaos which characterises the nation's health system, the ballooning trade deficit and, in particular, the spiralling home interest rates which are quickly crushing the Australian dream of home ownership. The people of Australia will be asked to forget all these things in exchange for a fistful of dollars. What contempt this Government shows for the people of this country that it should expect them to forget so readily this record of disaster for the sake of a few extra dollars in the pay packet-dollars which, on the evidence of the last six years, will disappear quickly enough as living standards continue to drop further and further. </PARA>
<PARA> Living standards have dropped in any of a dozen areas. One can point to any number of Government decisions which have prejudiced the position of ordinary Australians. The examples I would like to mention in this debate are recent ones, but every year of the Hawke Government is replete with similar examples. Last year the Government announced changes to health reinsurance arrangements which will have far reaching and potentially disastrous effects on the health insurance industry and on its capacity to provide affordable health insurance to all Australians. This announcement was the culmination of a series of changes this Government has effected to the private health insurance industry since coming to office, none of which have helped the affordability of adequate health insurance for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> The reinsurance pool established by the Fraser Liberal Government in 1976 was designed to subsidise the high claim rates of the sick and elderly and spread the burden of such claims between health funds. All funds had access to the pool to which the government of the day also contributed. Underpinning the establishment of the pool was the principle of community rating, which demands that every contributor to a health fund pay the same amount, regardless of age or state of health. However, since 1983 the Federal Government has progressively retreated from support of the concept the reinsurance pool embodies. In 1981 the Federal Government contributed $125m to the pool. Today that figure is just $1m. That drop amounts to a massive withdrawal of government support for the aged and chronically ill in our community, since the inevitable effect of this decline in funding has been greater upward pressure on the contribution rates of private health funds, particularly as they affect pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to find a few examples of where the Government has lopped $124m from a single program to realise that tax cuts of the order we will no doubt see tonight are close to meaningless. What the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gives with one hand, he will quite surely take back with the other. Moreover, the Government is supremely out of touch if it believes Australians do not notice what is going on. I have received many letters from constituents in my seat of Adelaide expressing concern at the proposed changes announced by the Government to the reinsurance scheme, in particular from the contributors to the South Australian Police Employees Health Fund. The Secretary of that health fund, Mr G. Mackinnon, has provided me with a copy of his submission to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) urging the abandonment of the Government's reinsurance proposals. I also wrote to the Minister in March supporting the points raised by Mr Mackinnon. As yet, several weeks later and despite the urgency of the matter, I have not had the courtesy of an acknowledgment from the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Police Employees Health Fund was established more than 50 years ago. Like many employee-based funds, its operating costs have been kept to a minimum-3 per cent compared with 17 per cent in the case of some other funds-and maximum benefits have been made available to members. The letters from members of the fund support the Secretary's claim that the fund is managed efficiently, is viable and provides an effective personal service in health insurance to employees of the South Australian police department. The Government's reinsurance proposals will undoubtedly increase the premiums payable to funds such as the South Australian Police Employees Health Fund. Significantly, many of these are from retirees who have maintained their private health insurance in their senior years. The suggestion that the Government's changes are designed to benefit the older members of the community is clearly not supported by those retired members of that force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's reinsurance proposal should not be seen as an isolated step. It is very clearly part of a structured, progressive campaign against the very concept of private health services. The Government has not flinched, from its first day in office, from the path of centralising and socialising medicine and health care in this country. Medicare the institution has outgrown what it was designed to achieve. The patterns whereby the Government has pursued this goal are unmistakable. Medicare has been only part of the process. The burden which the Government has sought to place on private health funds has mounted from year to year. The burden has included abolishing the Commonwealth bed day subsidy to private hospitals; increasing the benefits funds have to pay to psychiatric and rehabilitation patients; preventing funds from accumulating special reserves to cover long term patients; and shifting the cost of prosthetic implants from the States to the funds. Of course, with each additional burden imposed on the funds, their attractiveness and competitiveness diminishes. That is the Government's intention and it is succeeding. </PARA>
<PARA> Membership of health funds has declined for the last nine quarters in succession. Today the proportion of people with private insurance has slumped to just 50 per cent of the population. Today the House was given the latest figure, which is 46 per cent, by a conservative member. The saddest figure of the Government's whole strategy is that the health funds could, if the Government permitted them to do so, play an important part in reducing the blow-out in Medicare expenditure which we have experienced. That would be good news indeed for the 100,000 Australians awaiting elective surgery. Yet the inescapable fact is that the hikes in health insurance costs which Hawke, Keating, Blewett and co. have made inevitable will force more and more people, especially senior citizens, out of private funds. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PI4">Mr PRATT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As if that was not enough, the Government is mounting a vicious assault on the ageing in other ways. They are penalised for thrift and made increasingly dependent on government handouts. Those who manage to retain some financial independence are confused by continuous and complex changes to the tax law. What a disgraceful way to treat our elderly!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In mentioning another area where the Government's decisions have had a disastrous impact on the ordinary Australian, I refer to the recent changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). The Government has delisted from 1 April some 21 brand drugs from this scheme. But that is by no means the only change it has initiated. Concern in local pharmacies up and down the country is at an unprecedented level. The fact is that many are set to go to the wall, and the Government is almost entirely to blame. I have had some correspondence on this issue but none so articulate as one letter from a pharmacist in Adelaide, whom, I suppose, I cannot name for ethical reasons. He shows convincingly in his letter that the costs he will have to bear as a result of changes to government policy will push his business to the limits of profitability. He says that as a consequence of the Government reducing wholesaler margins from 15 to 10 per cent, he will lose about $275 a week. The decision to increase the maximum quantities of over 100 PBS drugs will cost him $470 a month in additional outlays, reduced dispensing fees and extra labour and container-purchase costs. The fee he can charge to dispense drugs is reduced by another government decision by 10c per script. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the elderly are major losers in this little package of horrors. As pharmacies are forced to close-and that is inevitable-the older members of the community will have further to travel to obtain medication. In addition, the Government has failed to take into account the valuable role the local pharmacist plays in diagnosing and treating minor ailments. Reduced frequency of visits, and indeed fewer pharmacies, will put a heavier burden back on the already overburdened Medicare system. It can ill afford that. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another area where the Government's record is none too proud. In recent years we have seen unprecedented attacks on the standard of living of veterans and war widows. Just what do those people have to show for six years of Labor Government? I will examine briefly the last four years. In 1985 the travel allowance payable to veterans was reduced by half to a flat 11.6c per kilometre. Since then there has been only a small increase to offset that cut. The big losers are country veterans who have to travel long distances. At the same time, subsistence allowances to veterans, including meal and accommodation allowances, have been substantially reduced, saving the Government $500,000 but costing veterans and war widows dearly. Under the dental scheme four categories of treatment have been limited to a maximum $300 annual limit with no consumer price index (CPI) adjustment. Totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pension criteria have been tightened up. In fact, veterans in the retirement phase of their lives are no longer eligible for TPI. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government made provision for termination of the dependant allowance by commutation, albeit on a voluntary basis, and there was to be no further increase in the dependant allowance. War widows and their dependants, as well as service pensioners with their fringe benefits-what is left of them-no longer have access to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. War widows who also received an age pension have had their social security component frozen at a maximum level of $60, once again with no CPI adjustment. In 1986 a 2 per cent cut in Defence Force retirement benefits pensions was imposed, along with a six-week deferment from early November 1986 of the CPI related increases for veterans' pensions. From 1 January 1988 a $5,000 statutory patient contribution was imposed on veterans in nursing homes for war related conditions. On top of all this there has been a series of cutbacks in the list of drugs available under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, along with an increase in the number of drugs requiring prior authority and adding greatly to the administrative burden. What a shameful litany of betrayals to the people who fought for our country, people to whom we should give thanks for the democratic freedoms we enjoy today. </PARA>
<PARA> And so with this kind of record in all these areas, who could really trust the Government, expect this Government, somehow to restore with a few paltry tax cuts the devastation it has wreaked on this land during its term? It would require cuts on a truly massive scale to make up for this sorry record. In any case, are tax cuts really the issue? Are they really what the Australian people most want the Government to deliver? I suspect not. I believe that the issue most close to Australians today is interest rates. I would like to address several matters of concern in this area. In today's Australian, the headline says it all-`Rates, not tax, voters' real fear'. There is no doubt that Australia deserves a pay increase and a tax cut. It is not the housing starts people are concerned about but rather how they will fund them, how they will handle the interest rates, the overdraft, the mortgage repayments, the consumer debt. My bank manager tells me that he is worried about my overdraft. I tell him, `It is no good both of us worrying about it-that is what he is employed for'. But we still have to service the consumer debt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that this Government has lost touch with the majority of Australians, the workers it purports to represent. Honourable members opposite have conveniently forgotten what it is like to be a wage earner, a person on a fixed income who gets a gut-wrenching feeling when the bills strip him bare. It is about time they remembered. They have forgotten the economic woes that the Government brings to Australians. Certainly, the rhetoric that is applied to competition, productivity, manufacturing and imports and what we will hear both today and tonight smacks of some sort of hypocrisy. Even in this excellent Parliament House, which is in our national capital of Canberra and which is the centre of learning and government, we find that the stainless steel containers we use for tea, milk, sugar and condiments come from China; the clocks, with their intricate bell-warning mechanisms, are imported from England; the radios are made by Mitsubishi under contract from China; and the desk blotting pads come from Denmark. I would have thought that our manufacturing industries could have supported some of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, tied in with the contributions by some honourable members to the debate on the economic woes, the litany of broken promises, the high interest rates and their spiralling upwards that concerns a lot of constituents, is the very sensitive foreign investment policy. We are faced with two conditions: either we have to borrow or we have to sell. Australians are genuinely concerned about selling off the farm. I echo those sentiments. I also support companies in South Australia which have offices around Australia such as Kumagai Gumi Co. Ltd, with its joint ventures, and Mitsubishi Motors Aust. Ltd, the giant car component manufacturing company which probably saved several thousand jobs in the failing Chrysler car plant in Adelaide. It is a most important area. It is something that must be addressed in the future. The government that holds the key to that will have to address the problem most seriously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one needs reminding these days of the problems Australia-and Sydney, in particular-is facing from the pollution of its harbours, rivers and beaches. For almost the whole of this last summer, courtesy of some excellent investigative reporting by journalists of the Sydney Morning Herald, the full horror of the disgraceful state of the waterways in and around Sydney has been brought home to the residents of Australia and one of the world's most beautiful cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from the obvious damage to the health of those people who choose to swim in the areas worst affected, the pollution caused largely by sewage outfall is having a devastating impact on the New South Wales fishing industry and is starting to impact on the No. 1 growth industry in Australia-tourism. I might add that most of people's fear of the fish is unnecessary, as only a minute proportion of the fish available for consumption is caught in the polluted areas. Nevertheless, the fear is real enough and the impact on the fishing industry has been quite devastating. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to spend the time of the House going over the reasons why this present shambles has occurred. However, it is worthwhile quoting the article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 4 March, which said:</PARA>
<PARA> The conspiracy of silence between these two bureaucracies-</PARA>
<PARA>the Water Board and the State Pollution Control Commission (SPCC)-</PARA>
<PARA>has been under way almost from the day the SPCC began operations in 1971. Long before this, the seeds were sown for the scandal which is only now starting to surface. Two key elements were the abrogation by politicians of a direct interest in the board's work and the emergence within the board of an engineering elite. </PARA>
<PARA> A cosy relationship between the Sydney Water Board and the State Pollution Control Commission has been instrumental in making the city's beaches unfit for swimming and contaminating the marine food chain. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship means that one government body monitors another, with political realities dictating that it is in no-one's interests to blow the whistle. </PARA>
<PARA> Herald investigations into the environmental scandal of the beaches leave the two bureaucracies, either singly or in concert, accused of having:</PARA>
<PARA>fixed pollution standards at levels which the SPCC knew to be unjustifiable but which suited the board. </PARA>
<PARA>consistently understated the health risks of swimming at our beaches and used measurement criteria which both knew to be hopelessly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>secretly dumped thousands of tonnes of highly-toxic sewage sludge into Sydney's waters despite warnings of abnormalities in marine life. </PARA>
<PARA>tried to shift the blame for what has happened on to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Vital decisions have been made regularly behind the closed doors of the board and the commission. They were made despite a steady stream of evidence that the decisions were wrong or, at best, questionable. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the shambles, the two organisations have condemned all opposition. They have kept from the public not only internal reports which seriously questioned their policies but also alarming scientific research. </PARA>
<PARA> The roots of what is happening on the beaches today stretch back more than 100 years to the formation of the Water Board as a power unto itself. One of the oldest statutory bodies in New South Wales, it officially came into being in 1888 to cope with the demands of a growing metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the domestic sewage and much of the industrial waste from that vast area-as much as 1,000 million litres daily-is dumped into the ocean through three main outfalls at Malabar, North Head and Bondi. This waste has undergone only basic treatment to clean it up. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not the time to start apportioning blame. All the governments in New South Wales, both Labor and non-Labor, must share the blame. About the only one so far that cannot be held responsible is the present Greiner Government, although its immediate predecessor in the non-Labor chain-if honourable members will excuse the pun-the Askin Government, is part of the history of neglect and ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal governments, with one rare exception-the Whitlam Government-have taken little interest in the problem, taking the traditional view that sewage was Sydney's own business-again, if honourable members will excuse the pun. When the Whitlam Government came to office in 1972 more than three-quarters of Sydney's residents were without sewerage. As the Sydney Morning Herald team went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The politicians remained happy for the board to run itself and solve the city's problems as it saw fit. Pipes and drains were rarely `sexy' election topics, although former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, took some mileage from the subject. Mr Whitlam likened himself to the Emperor Augustus, who had found Rome a city of brick and left it a city of marble. Mr Whitlam said he had found Sydney unsewered and left it fully flushed. </PARA>
<PARA>Our present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is known as `the Great Communicator', whilst his predecessor, Gough, will go down in history as `the Great Flusher'. `It's a shitty job', he once said, `but someone's got to do it'. It was Gough, of course, who referred to Australia as `the effluent society'. </PARA>
<PARA> The important point now is not to look back in anger at what we should have done but to concentrate on what can be done in the future. In all the discussion that has taken place in recent months, the most depressing feature has been the pessimistic outlook about cleaning up the mess. Mr Tim Moore, the present New South Wales Minister for the Environment, who seems to have taken to his new position with enthusiasm and relish and who does not appear to be frightened of talking to the big industrial polluters, has forecast that it will take up to 10 years to clean up the mess. That seems to me to be not a very attractive prediction. </PARA>
<PARA> What I wish to raise today is the fact that one major Australian company of high standing in the community claims not only that it could, if it started tomorrow, clean the sewage outfall problem within two to three years but also that it could do it at reasonable cost. When I first heard this claim, my first reaction was one of total disbelief. Who were these people who claimed they could solve one of Australia's worst pollution problems and do it quickly and reasonably? As soon as I could, I arranged to meet them to find out whether they were for real. A lot of questions came to mind. Were they a bunch of shysters who were jumping on the bandwagon? Were they a group of dreamers who had an unrealistic faith in their ability to solve these mammoth problems? I arranged to meet with the executives on a couple of occasions to satisfy myself about their bona fides. The more that I have talked to them, the more that I have read of what they have done and can do, the more I am convinced that governments, both State and Federal, should be talking to them and examining what they have to offer. If their claims are exaggerated they can be quickly tested. If their claims are right we have a very exciting solution to what seems an intractable problem. </PARA>
<PARA> First, let me give a few facts about the company, Memtec Ltd, which is located at Windsor in New South Wales. This company was first listed on the stock exchange in March 1984. It has assets of over $200m and in the half year to December posted a profit of $5.585m. It employs 700 people world wide and has offices in the United States of America, Japan, Europe and, of course, Australia. Its chairman is Mr Dennis Hanley. I think that establishes that we are not talking about some backyard operation with a bunch of nutters running the show. What is exciting about the company is neither its personnel nor its profit or asset backing but the fact that it is now one of the largest filtration groups in the world. It has developed a filtration membrane that is the most advanced in the world. It claims that it is at least six years ahead of the rest of the world. Put simply, its filtration membrane can filter all extraneous matter out of waste water. Let me repeat that it claims that it can filter all extraneous matter out of waste water-not 90 per cent, not 99 per cent, not 99.999 per cent, but the whole lot. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to be aware that this claim is not some wild fantasy. Already Memtec's technology is being utilised in a variety of areas. The wine and food industry is utilising it; our Federal Government, through the Department of Defence, is utilising it-the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White), as an ex-hero, would be familiar with what I am talking about-and the Royal Australian Navy is using the technology in its submarines. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NF4">Mr COHEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite should pay attention. This frivolity does not become any of them. Memtec filtration units are used to desalinate water, thus enabling submarines to stay submerged for much longer periods. The Australian Army is using the technology in mobile field units so that scarce water resources can by recycled for washing and drinking. Gone are the days of the old bush shower. Memtec is winning contracts with some of the top companies and government instrumentalities in the world. Current customers include Revlon (Australia) Pty Ltd, Atomic Energy Canada Ltd, L'Oreal, the United States Army and Navy, Schweppes Pty Ltd, Nestles Australia Ltd, Coca-Cola Australia, and Baxter Japan. So we are not talking about a little backyard operation. More to the point, Memtec is now working with major water authorities in the United Kingdom, Japan and the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Memtec's work is not entirely unknown to Australian authorities in the sewage treatment area. At a plant in Dural over the last 12 months Memtec, in conjunction with the Sydney Water Board, has been testing a highly advanced self-cleaning membrane filter system which can change secondary sewage into pure water. The new process requires no chemicals and produces water free of both bacteria and viruses. Memtec has proven conclusively that this process is effective for the finer treatment of sewage and it is now focusing its technical attention on the scaling up of its manufacturing process and the reduction of cost in its equipment for large scale installations. It has also been involved in water treatment programs where its technology was used to produce 100 per cent pure water. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on recounting the successes of this very innovative and exciting technology. What staggers me is that in all the brouhaha in recent months about Australia's polluted rivers, harbours and beaches I have not heard any mention of the company or its technology. </PARA>

<PARA> In my discussions with the executives of the company I have been surprised at only one thing: governments in Australia, both State and Federal, do not seem to be fully aware of what this company can offer the nation. As I understand it, by the use of its tertiary treatment system adapted to existing outfall systems into rivers, harbours and beaches, it can gradually ensure that what is going into the system is 100 per cent pure. Much that is filtered out can then be utilised as nutrients for use in agriculture. So even the muck that is cleaned out is not wasted; it is put to good use. What continues on its way is pure water. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the question of cost is very important. But when I talk to these executives it is very difficult for them to say, `We can do it at so much', because the problem is enormous. But they are saying that they can do it at a reasonable cost; certainly at a lesser cost than anyone else can do it, but they can do it properly. In all our discussions so far other people have said, `It will take us 10 years and, at the end of 10 years, we are not really sure whether it will work and we will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do it'. The executives of Memtec say that if they can get the cooperation of governments, they can do it soon, they can do it in two to three years, they can do it 100 per cent and they can do it at a reasonable cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not here as a publicist for this company. I am saying that it seems to be the only company that claims that it can do it. We have this problem that has been headline news in our papers month after month. Once upon a time people surfing off Sydney's beaches used to be worried about the Noahs. Now they are worried about the Henrys. I understand that it is not a very pleasant experience swimming off Sydney's beaches these days. I hope that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson), the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and the State Ministers listen to what these people have to say, give them a chance to put their case and, hopefully, if they are right, we can solve the problem quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1988-89 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1988-89, which are money Bills. Usually money dictates capacities and I wish to talk about the capacity of Australia and our defence forces to protect Australian interests. I note in the Bills that some $47m has been budgeted for and allocated for Australian defence industries soon to come into operation. That is something that the Opposition supports. I note also that some $7.3m has been allocated to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group serving in Namibia. Of course, we have always supported and will continue to support our involvement in that peacekeeping operation. We wish those troops, the main body of whom will be deployed this week, the very best in their deployment. It will be a difficult operation however much we might like to think otherwise. Some people have already been deployed and they are experiencing the difficulties of a peacekeeping operation in a country such as Namibia which has been at war in one form or another for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of overseas deployment, it would appear that the Government will also be faced with some commitment to a peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. Again, in principle, that is something the Opposition supports. As we have said before, we would also support reasonable requests that may come from Papua New Guinea, which is experiencing considerable internal problems. The Australian Government has said that it will be responsive to any requests and we would certainly support an approach. It is not good enough for Australia not to assist a country with which we have had a long historical and very close relationship which is now experiencing increasing domestic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The main criticism that the Opposition has of the present Government's defence policies are these: firstly, defence has never been funded to the level on which the policies were based-that is, the 1987 White Paper; secondly, over the last six years there has been a continual decline of our defence capabilities; thirdly, there has been a lack of any meaningful or extensive regional involvement; and fourthly, over a number of years there has been quite a shameful and deliberate neglect of our Defence Force personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the question of funding. The 1987 White Paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government recognises that considerable waste and inefficiency in defence planning is inevitable when unrealistic guidance is given as a planning basis for defence spending. The Government is committed to more realistic financial guidance for defence spending . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government then went on to say that this White Paper was based on a real annual increase of 3 per cent. The White Paper continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If we are to achieve the levels of defence capability and the priorities reflected in this Paper, there is a need, over the life of the program, for an allocation of resources generally within the order of 2.6 per cent to 3.0 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>Since that White Paper has been produced-it was three years ago now-funding has never approached that level. This year the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated to the defence budget has fallen to 2.4 per cent, which is the lowest proportion of GDP since 1950. The White Paper claims that the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . believes that this level of resources will enable the strategy outlined in the Defence Policy Information Paper to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>Every time there has been a cut in defence funding-and that has been three times so far-the Government says that the White Paper is still on track. There is a limit to the credibility of such statements. The Government says that it is going to cut back the money but that everything is all right. After a while the integrity of the White Paper is destroyed, as it has been. What has happened? As the funding has been cut back the big equipment programs have been left in place and the operating budget and the personnel programs have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take a brief look at what has happened in the last few years on the question of capabilities. Firstly, there have been severe cuts in regular Defence Force personnel-some 3,000 in the last three years. All units are feeling the pinch, and all units are expected to do more with less. In the long term this means that when these units are deployed to the field they simply do not have the manpower to sustain themselves in field conditions over a long period. In some units we have the problem of low morale and the will to serve. For many personnel the feeling that one is doing a useful, important job has been destroyed. With dedicated personnel it is possible to achieve anything, but if the people in the Services do not believe they are doing a worthwhile job and that the Government is looking after them and needs them, then their pride and their profession of arms will be destroyed. Unfortunately in too many cases that is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> A few day ago I was talking to three young Army majors all of whom are leaving the Army. I said, `Why are you leaving at such a time when you have your whole life and professional career ahead of you?' Three of them independently said, `We are leaving because we believe the Government no longer cares about Defence Force personnel'. These men who have served for 10 years and are about to start putting their experience back into the Defence Force are leaving. Unfortunately that story of the three young majors is typical of the reasons that so many people give when they leave the forces. Because so many have left we have this dramatic decline in experience levels in all out units. </PARA>
<PARA> A week or so ago I was at Tindal for the opening of the important new air base outside Katherine. No. 75 FA18 squadron has been posted to Tindal, comprising 600-odd people, I think 12 planes, and eight pilots. Of the eight pilots, the commanding officer of the squadron and the second in command could be described as having a reasonable level of experience. The remainder were almost totally without any experience whatsoever. They are good men and good pilots, but we cannot run an operational squadron if we do not have people with the experience not only to look after their colleagues but also to pass it on to those who follow. This dramatic drop in experience levels has been caused by wastage rates which have reached unprecedented record levels and the shameful neglect of personnel: 50,000 have left the Australian Defence Force in the last six years out of a total of some 72,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the other capabilities. Continual cuts in the operating budget have meant that exercises and flying hours have been reduced. Army training last year was cut by 10 per cent, and there is more to come. Kangaroo 89 is the biggest exercise we have seen in this country for years. It will take most of this year's and next year's operating budget resources and facilities. In the White Paper, the Government stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's defence planning will continue to provide for modest annual real increases in operating costs, recognising that it generally costs more to operate modern and more capable equipment than it did to operate older designs of equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, this is a hollow promise because operating costs since that date have continually reduced. Let us look at some of the other capabilities that have also been reduced in the last few years. We have lost the aircraft-carrier and the fixed wing component of the Fleet Air Arm has gone. We are now leasing back from New Zealand, under some arrangement which is not yet clear, the Skyhawks which a few years ago we sold to it for a song. It is totally unacceptable to the Opposition to have that arrangement in place because it is dependent on the whim of the Lange Government. The Lange Government's record in matters of defence and regional security is so abysmal that we cannot trust that arrangement for any length of time. The amphibious squadron has been disbanded and the landing craft have been scattered. We still have no ship that can carry the Black Hawk helicopters. Elements in the Army artillery have been mothballed. The pilots for fighter squadrons have been reduced from 18 to 12. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) staff college has been closed because there are not enough officers in the RAAF to attend as they are required for other duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Right now on the desk of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) we have options which he is considering for further cuts. Cuts in RAAF flying hours, further cuts in Army exercises, further reductions in manpower, the First Brigade of the First Division is being looked at to see whether it should be retained or whether some of the units in that Brigade should be disbanded, including the First Armoured Regiment. One option is to get rid of the F111 squadrons at Amberley, our most effective and visible deterrent. Another option is to get rid of, disband or mothball an FA18 squadron and it certainly looks as though the Chinook heavy lift squadron at Amberley will go. The decision has already been made to disband that squadron. That decision is being looked at again. I hope that people will realise that it is not only an effective military asset, but also a national asset in view of the work that it has done in the recent floods. </PARA>
<PARA> If we get rid of the Chinook heavy lift squadron, what are we going to do for the tactical movements of fuel and equipment around the battlefield? Are we going to use the Black Hawks? If we use the Black Hawks, they certainly cannot do the same job and this means that they are being used for tasks for which they were never designed. For the Government to say that it is not considering that option is nonsense. The personnel in that squadron have been asked to fill out posting preferences already. Now they have been put on hold and they do not know what they are going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Exercise planners for Kangaroo 89 are not sure whether the Chinooks will be there, so they have taken the only sensible option and decided to plan the exercise without them. It is an absolute shambles. The White Paper contains policies basically for the defence of mainland Australia. Paragraph 217 of the White Paper states:</PARA>
<PARA>In general Australia's environment, our strategic environment around us, is favourable. </PARA>
<PARA>The authors of that paper may have thought that at the end of 1986 and the beginning of 1987, but I invite people to look at what has happened in our region in the last two years. We had the problems of the coups in Fiji. There have been ongoing problems in Vanuatu and New Caledonia, and closer to home and much more important are the ongoing problems in Papua New Guinea. It is clearly time to abandon a policy which relies on a defensive and relatively isolationist approach to our defence. It is time for a positive policy of regional involvement. If we are going to live in this area in peace we have to be able to contribute to the peace of the region in which we live. That will take some effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Our present defence cooperation program for the region, for example, comes to $60m, roughly the same amount that we give to the Australia Council. Important as that august body might be, I doubt whether we could put the Australia Council in the same league as a program which is designed to secure Australia's security and defence. </PARA>

We give to Papua New Guinea, for example, some $24m under the defence cooperation program. It is simply not enough, considering the problems that are being experienced in that country. Australia's security is tied to the stability of the region. The present defence policy of sitting at home, relatively isolated, saying to anyone who may be tempted, `Come and get us if you can', is plainly stupid. We have to develop a sensible program of training, exchanges, exercises and military assistance for those countries which seek that assistance in the region in which we live.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have mentioned the problems of personnel many times in this House. Unfortunately, the problems do not seem to be going away. One would have thought that after six years in office the Government would recognise the enormous damage it has caused in the Defence Force which, by any conservative reckoning, will take 15 years to put back together in terms of getting experienced people back into some of the units. This year the Army will be some 350 officers short. The following signal went out to all units last week:</PARA>
<PARA>Anticipated officer vacancies for 1989 are expected to be in the order of 350, mainly in the lieutenant to major category. Apart from posting action already under way, the Military Secretary can do little to redress this shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA>We have a report in today's newspapers that the position in the Royal Australian Air Force is so desperate that one of the options the Government is looking at again is to recruit RAAF pilots from allied countries around the world. That we have to do that after all these years of relative peace is a tragedy and an indictment of any current defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Government should do: Firstly, it should acknowledge that the White Paper has become largely irrelevant. It should acknowledge that the deficiencies which have characterised this policy over recent years have damaged it, stop pretending that all the policies and programs are still in place and be realistic in the assessment of the damage that has been done. The Government should re-emphasise the importance of deterrence in seeking peace, give some aerial refuelling to the F111s, which are probably our single most visible deterrent asset; and acquire some airborne warning and control aircraft. We must look, as a matter of priority, at developing an offshore capability as a deterrent against adventures to Australia's territories or mainland and as a deterrent against anyone who may be tempted to undertake military adventures against our regional friends and allies. We must emphasise as a matter of urgency the regional involvement of our defence policies and put them back in place so that we are once again regarded as a country with some influence and some clout able to help our friends and allies in this area if they get into trouble. At home we must re-order the priorities within the Budget and put back a proper balance into equipment, operations and the personnel programs which are now completely out of kilter and which are doing so much damage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was partly responsible. A total of 1.3 million jobs have been created in the time that we have been in government. But what do these figures mean in real terms to real people and their lives? They mean that literally thousands of Australian families are materially much better off than they were before because they now have a working breadwinner. Alternatively, they mean that a family which was seeking a second income has been able to obtain one, thus improving markedly its standard of living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most Australians are fully aware that the strong growth in our economy is nothing to weep and moan about. They know only too well the difference between the conditions of relative boom presently being experienced and the recession conditions of yesteryear. They understand that the main feature of recession is high unemployment, no expansion and no jobs, no money and no opportunities for change or growth-no opportunities for anything. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australians realise that because the economy is growing the demand for money and resources is unusually high. They understand also that high demand for scarce commodities usually results in higher prices. They know that they are paying through the nose in some areas of industry, such as construction, because the strong demand has brought about a shortage of materials, land and labour. They know that they are paying higher interest rates than is comfortable, because there is such a call on money for building, buying and investing. However, they also know that there are jobs to be had, for them, their sons and their daughters. It is against this backdrop that they view their relative economic well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition in its policy document, Future Directions, seems to want to hark back to earlier times. It seems to want to wallow in sentimentality and nostalgia, in the hope that people will think the past can be revisited. However, older Australians cannot be so easily fooled, and younger Australians are even less easily fooled. Older Australians are astute enough to understand the difference between fantasy and reality. Indeed, few of them had the benefit of the idyllic 1950s lifestyle which the Opposition would have them hark back to. On the contrary, theirs is the generation which remembers the dark days of the Depression and which understands that some of the so-called economic problems of today are, by comparison, not problems at all. Even though members of the younger generation were not actually part of the Depression, they certainly have had very strong stories conveyed to them by their parents about the Depression and what those days mean to their parents' families. </PARA>
<PARA> Older Australians do notice, however, that thrift and savings are words which have been virtually missing from the national vocabulary for some years, although, at the present time, that is probably changing. They also seldom have been comfortable with the use of credit, with the possible exception of a home loan. Even then considerable personal equity was a prerequisite for taking out a bank loan and modest housing was all that was sought. </PARA>
<PARA> How then do older Australians feel about the never-ending drive for material possessions which has characterised recent generations in Australia? How do they feel about the reliance on credit, be it hire purchase, Bankcard, or personal loan? They firmly believe that the expectations of today's young people are unrealistic and that they have no concept of the end cost of it all. They believe that young people should be learning to settle for slightly less than the best at the beginning of their married lives. In short, they would be happier to see expectations moderated and savings accumulated for less immediate and more long term family and personal needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether these perceptions are right or wrong is not important. However, a moderation in new housing demand would certainly remove some pressures on the home construction market, which would result in an immediate cost reduction of materials and land, if not labour. An increase in savings likewise would remove some pressure on the demand for money in the form of credit, permitting a reduction in interest rates in the longer term</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that young Australians recognise these realities and are beginning to moderate their demands accordingly. However, all Australians, whatever their age, have a role to play in maintaining the economic health and wealth of our country. In particular, we can all make a positive contribution to the reduction of import demands. That issue has been taken up at least twice in the debate to date. If we all bought Australian products, and took that ethos far more seriously in our personal and commercial purchases, we would help to reduce the impact on the current account deficit while, at the same time, supporting the employment of other Australians. That is a matter which is taken very seriously by older Australians, because they are very aware that to buy Australian is to protect the job of another Australian and possibly one's own job. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's record on wages has been consistent, although restrained. We understand that most workers have tightened their belts in the interests of the economy. Generally, they have not complained. But the time has come for an improvement in their position. That fact is undoubted. Previously, workers were asked to minimise wage increases in order not to fuel inflation. More recently, legitimate productivity increases have begun to be rewarded, but there are still many ordinary working people who require an increase in their incomes to accommodate increases in the cost of living. Award restructuring will provide the vehicle over the next few years for this type of increase and will expand opportunities for people within their own employment fields. The Government's commitment to tax cuts for low and middle income earners will also improve the situation of those people and reduce the inflationary impact of that benefit. The extent of the tax cuts will be detailed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) this evening. Once again the Hawke Government will have honoured its commitment to reduce taxes, which is no easy task. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us contrast this achievement with the impotence-I do not mean personal or sexual impotence; I mean economic and political impotence-of the Opposition. The Opposition criticises the Government's policies without putting forward alternative policies of its own. The Opposition has no credibility on wages policy or tax cuts. Its members weep crocodile tears across the table about the difficulties confronting Australian families; yet they oppose the very measures by which those difficulties could be ameliorated. The Opposition's stand on wage increases is boringly predictable. It mirrors the opinion of the Confederation of Australian Industry in that it does not want wage increases. It does not want to see Australian workers rewarded for their restraint in recent years or for the productivity gains which they have made through altered work practices and progressive restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> What would the Opposition do if given the chance? It will not tell us; so we will probably have to make an educated guess. Would it lower wages?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has said it will do it. I thank the Minister. It certainly would not support any wage rises for ordinary workers. In that area, at least, it has been consistent for years and will continue to be so. Would the Opposition cut spending? Yes, it would. The only trouble is that it is too afraid to tell the people of Australia where it would make the cuts-in education, perhaps; employment creation; pensions; family assistance. These are the big ticket items in the Budget. These are the costly areas on which the greedy eyes of the Opposition hatchet men would settle if ever they got the opportunity to put their cost cutting ideas into practice. Heaven then help the poor, the halt and the lame. There would be no mercy for students, the unemployed, the elderly and the families of working Australians. If the Opposition ever got back into government, we would surely see a return to the bad old days of hesitation, procrastination and confrontation. Do honourable members remember those days? I certainly do, as do many other people who were unable to get a job, get into university, afford health care, or find child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By contrast, the initiatives of this Government have assisted thousands of Australians across the social spectrum to find work, to enter education, to take up training; in short, to improve their lives. Women have been major beneficiaries of the changes the Government has made to employment practices, the workplace environment and employer expectations. Not only have we tackled the hard question of affirmative action in a sensible and sensitive way, but we have freed up more positions to which women can aspire and we have provided child care as an essential support structure for those with pre-school aged children. </PARA>
<PARA> The new start program provides long term unemployed people with the chance to obtain training or reskilling in their field of endeavour. The jobs, education and training program assists sole parents to access jobs, education, or training as required. The skill share program has greatly expanded the opportunities for such disadvantaged unemployed people to acquire training in the local community environment. Most importantly, the family allowance supplement has provided low income working families with much needed additional cash to bring their earnings to a reasonable level. </PARA>
<PARA> In the areas of education, we have sought to restructure and redefine the requirements of the system to permit the most efficient and effective use of educational resources. Our emphasis on increasing school retention rates is indicative of the concern with which the Government views the maxim of equality of opportunity. It should be pointed out, at this juncture, that retention rates in middle class and higher income areas are very good. Retention rates are crucially needed to be raised, however, in the working class and the poorer areas of our nation. In rural areas also, retention rates are lower because students do not have the same opportunities to attend a high school. While concerns about the higher education contribution scheme are still being expressed, more students now realise that the scheme has enabled a significant increase in the number of places available in higher education. The Government has proved its commitment to the working people of Australia and evidenced its determination to improve the economic well-being of poorer people in our community, including those who are in low paid jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also taken steps to improve substantively occupational health and safety practices and compensation arrangements for workers on the job. As a government, we have consistently sought to provide the means for improvement of the position of working people in our society, although that has not always been recognised. In the current debate many members on the Government side have alluded to these improvements, as I have. No doubt the economic statement tonight will further that ambition and prove that commitment once again. </PARA>

I will provide some facts and figures on the tax burdens facing Australian families, as they are very relevant to the debate, especially in view of the statement to be made tonight.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ4">Mr WEBSTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Institute made some salient points in its most recent report, entitled Families and Tax in 1989. The report indicates that average tax rates increased substantially for taxpayers on or around average weekly earnings between 1983-84 and 1987-88. Family allowances, which were introduced by the Fraser Government, have been allowed to fall in value by 43 per cent. It needs to be repeated that family allowances, which were introduced by a conservative government under the Fraser leadership, have been allowed to fall by 43 per cent. This information was given in an independent report. The Government cannot say it has been trumped up by the Opposition; that is just not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report gives the further information that the dependent spouse rebate for couples with children has fallen in value by 22 per cent since it was upgraded in 1982 by the Fraser Government. That is another point worth repeating. Tax rates, by percentage points and dollars per week, for families rose between 1976-77 and 1988-89 as follows: a one-income couple with two children on average weekly earnings, up 6.2 per cent or $30.80 a week; a one-income couple with two children on 1.5 times average weekly earnings, up 4.7 per cent or $35.02 per week. In contrast-this needs to be listened to very carefully-and to the shame of the Government, which pretends to favour the average Australian, a one-income couple with two children on four times the average weekly earnings have had a drop of 3.7 per cent or $73.53 per week in tax. It does not matter how we look at that; it cannot be argued that in any way, shape or form it can be considered a fair deal. Finally, families have done worse than single persons and the extent of their losses rises with the number of children. Can you believe that, Mr Deputy Speaker? I am sure you can. Those are the factors which should be put, dealt with and determined tonight, but unfortunately they will not be. The tax cuts tonight will be only partial repayments for the tax take since 1983. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ4">Mr WEBSTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is even more than that. The tax cuts will fail to come to grips with the current bias against families with children, especially when one parent wants to stay home in the formative years of their children's lives. This is one area of Government policy that never ceases to amaze me. The bulk of research around the world clearly shows how important it is that in the formative years of a child's life the mother, if at all possible, be present in the home and available for children five years old and under. Government policies should be varied to make that possible. Yet, we find today that, as policy after policy affecting the family comes out, this very commonsense piece of understanding and knowledge is ignored, to the great detriment of the country and its future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government will also try to come to grips with micro-economic reforms, that is, reforms to eliminate Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) enforced work practices and awards which make Australia uncompetitive in a dog eat dog international economy, which we have heard a lot about in recent months. To get an idea of the nature of the problem and to understand the unfairness as much as the inefficiency of current work practices and awards in some sectors, I draw on a recent National Farmers Federation document. The example involves a shipment of cottonseed from Queensland. The cost of loading and transporting the cottonseed some hundreds of kilometres from central Queensland to a position on the wharf beside the ship was $56 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of people might say that seems to be an exorbitant rate, but it pales into insignificance when it is compared with the remainder of the Federation's comments. Using a crane which lifted eight tonnes each lift-that is, eight one-tonne bags-the waterside workers succeeded in lifting an average of six bags per person per eight-hour shift. The total cost of lifting the cottonseed over the side of the ship was $62 per tonne-absolutely shameful! The purchasers said that the cottonseed was very good but that in future they would go elsewhere because of the exorbitant waterfront costs. It is not arguable that that kind of situation should be allowed to continue in this country. There is absolutely no case for the Government, or anybody else, arguing that such a situation should be allowed to continue, yet unfortunately it is. </PARA>
<PARA> As the National Farmers Federation points out, while farmers, who generate nearly 50 per cent of the country's export wealth, struggle to earn, on average, $20,000 a year pre-tax, unskilled waterside workers receive an average of $31,000 per year. It is extraordinary! Yet the dreadful situation which currently exists on our waterfront and which has been revealed very patently in a recent report is seemingly being totally ignored by the Government. For this, referring to the waterside workers who average $31,000 per year--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ4">Mr WEBSTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. But they commonly work a mere 25 hours a week. There can hardly be a farmer who does not work almost three times as long, often seven days a week, and the National Farmers Federation quite rightly points this out. I can assure honourable members that the farmers in the Hawkesbury and Oberon areas of my electorate are among those who work long hours, particularly in these latter months. With three major floods in the past 12 months, the total income of the Hawkesbury farmers for the 1987-88 and 1988-89 years will be far less than $20,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main factor in the micro-economic reform equation is the very one the Government will ignore tonight. That is the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the power of the unions. As with tax relief for families, we can expect only disappointment tonight on productivity initiatives from a government which is led by a former ACTU President and which expects to have as its next leader the current ACTU President. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to wages policy-the greatest confidence trick in tonight's package and in this Government's policy approach. Again because of the power of the ACTU, real gains in terms of the largest possible tax cut will be forfeited tonight because of the decision to provide wage rises. The Government knows that wage rises are illusory measures when it comes to increasing living standards and that can be illustrated very simply by looking at the $10 per week wage rise to the average person. That person will lose about $4 in tax and the providers of the salary or wage-the producers, the manufacturers-will increase their prices by $10 to $12 to recover that proposed rise in the cost of living. That will leave the average worker only $6 to cope with the $10 increase in the cost of living. It is quite ludicrous to talk about giving wage increases unless we have produced a bigger cake. If we produce a bigger cake then it is very much in order to talk about giving legitimate wage increases. Wage rises will be taxed and they will push up inflation and interest rates which will further neutralise the wage gains. In other words, the wage earner gets poorer and the Government gets richer. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to interest rates. Evidence from the most recent quarterly home affordability figures from the Real Estate Institute of Australia reveals that housing costs have reduced the income of the average household by $82 a week since 1983. That is in addition to tax increases and inflation-related family budget problems with food, clothing, transport, health care, education and so on. What should be happening tonight is that a determined approach to expenditure cuts should be used to lower interest rates. Tonight, the ACTU should be removed from power. Tonight the tax burden on families should be lifted. These things will not occur. The Government and the ACTU are as one. Their economic policies are in shambles. These things will only occur under a different government, a government committed to new directions for the future of families and the nation, committed to commonsense more than anything else. These things will not be announced tonight. We will have to wait until after the election of a Howard coalition government. </PARA>

Why does he not come with me to Port Kembla and talk to the waterside workers, just as farmers from the far west have done? They have discussed the problems that the rural producers have and they have seen the conditions under which the waterside workers work. The honourable member talked about low income earners. He does not want those people to get a rise. Oh no! Do we ever hear honourable members from the Opposition benches talking about executive salaries? We can rest assured that they will not complain about the massive executive salaries or company profits that are being made in this country today. All they are prepared to say is `No, no, no' to low paid workers. The lowly paid must stay that way and not get any increases. But these people will receive increases under this Hawke Government-something they have never got and will never get under governments from the conservative side of politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All Australians will welcome last week's announcement by the Government of the expenditure of almost $8m on a national program to respond to the global threat posed by the greenhouse effect. The bulk of the funding will be directed to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Bureau of Meteorology. I appeal to the National Greenhouse Advisory Committee to ensure that part of this research money is spent on rebuilding the meteorological stations at Mawson and Davis in the Antarctic. Much of the important work regarding any changed climatic conditions must be carried out in Antarctica, yet conditions in the meteorological buildings on both stations are totally inadequate. They are worse than that; they are a disgrace and would not be tolerated anywhere in Australia. It is only the dedication of the staff at these meteorological stations over many years that has permitted important work in relation to weather to be carried out. The same applies to the upper atmospheric laboratories. Vital work is being carried out in totally unsuitable and inadequate buildings. We now have a chance to rectify some of the failings of the past and, as a start, I urge that new meteorological stations be built at both bases. </PARA>
<PARA> While looking at the meteorological stations and the upper atmospheric laboratories, perhaps we should take the opportunity to look at our rebuilding program in Antarctica. Have we got our priorities right? Are we, as some suggest, aggressively imposing our presence in Antarctica? Is the sophistication of some of our centres such that a high degree of expertise is required? For example, why do we have three heated fire stations, but no fire tenders to go into them? The cost of the doors to these buildings alone would have gone a long way to building new meteorological stations. I believe that the accommodation and facilities should be the best available for the people who have to spend winter there but I do want them to be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add while I am talking on Antarctica that I am totally opposed to the signing of the Antarctic mining convention. I know that there are arguments on both sides, but let us keep mining out of Antarctica. Surely the mining companies, the multinationals, have enough areas of the world to spoil. Is it too much to ask that one area remain undisturbed and unspoilt? If prospecting were permitted there it would generate many impacts, including airports, ports, tracks, accidents, oil leaks, disposal of waste and surplus equipment, housing, noise, atmospheric pollution and degradation of wilderness and aesthetic values. I understand from discussions I have had that there are not many minerals there, especially in our area. I believe that in the Prince Charles Mountain area there is some coal, but the last thing we really want is more coal than is being mined in Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The real test would come if oil were discovered either onshore or offshore. We have seen the tragedy of the oil spill off Alaska. Such an occurrence would be worse in Antarctica. I believe the Alaskan oil spill serves as a graphic example of the inevitable consequence of exploiting fragile environments such as Antarctica. Such major disasters will occur, regardless of all assurances and untried technology. If the Americans were unable to contain the oil spill in Alaska, what chance would we have in Antarctica, which is so remote from industrial and population centres? I very much support Australia's presence in the Antarctic, and especially our research work, but I wonder how serious we are about our claim to the territory. We claim the largest part of the Antarctic-some 42 or 43 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many Russian bases are on it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yet currently we have to hire a German and a Canadian ship to get us there. Even the new ship being built at Newcastle will be leased. There is no naval vessel in Australia capable of going south of Macquarie Island. If, as has happened in the past, Australia's ships become stuck in the ice, we have to rely on the Soviets or the Japanese to come with their ice breakers and get us out. Although I am not critical of the research being carried out in Antarctica, I wonder whether there has been an over- emphasis on geology in recent years. When I was there recently it seemed that every second person I spoke to was a PhD student in geology. There are other important aspects of this country's work there, such as the research into weather, the glaciology and the krill. Australia is leading the world in krill research and the important part that it plays in the world food chain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cooperation that exists between the Antarctic Treaty nations is interesting. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) mentioned the Soviets. There are some Soviet bases there, including one on territory claimed by Australia, and there is a Chinese base. Interestingly, the Chinese have achieved in five weeks what it has taken Australia something like five years to achieve. In recent weeks much has been said about the environment, and particularly the Antarctic environment. I believe that Australia's record in this respect is excellent. A recent Four Corners program on this topic was very misleading. It concentrated on the Argentinean and Chilean bases. The rubbish that is generated in Antarctica is returned to Australia and great care is taken with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism is an aspect that comes up for discussion. I suppose people might say I am selfish because I have been there and I do not want other people to go there. I would like more people to share the pristine beauty of Antarctica, but I believe that any tourism must be ship based and not land based. Recently I read a rather silly article in the Australian Financial Review of 21 March, written by David Clark, which illustrated to me that he did not understand anything about Antarctica and the threats that would be posed there, especially by land-based tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I pay tribute to the staff of the Antarctic Division. I believe they have been unfairly criticised in recent times. I found among them great dedication and a commitment to Australia's role in Antarctica. I pay a tribute also to the expeditioners whose initiative and enthusiasm have contributed so much to our understanding and scientific knowledge of a rare and vitally important environment. In conclusion, I appeal to those responsible for the allocation of the funding that work be commenced on rebuilding our meteorological buildings and I emphasise my total opposition to any mining in Antarctica. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank all honourable members who participated in the debate. I wish only to respond to two points that were raised by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) on Monday evening. The honourable member continues in his attempt to disrupt the smooth operation of the household expenditure survey. He claimed that the survey did not have the backing of law because it was not tabled in the Parliament prior to being conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member interjecting knows that is wrong. The honourable member for Moreton knows it is wrong. The 1988-89 survey was not new. It did not need to be tabled. It was sent off to the Attorney-General for his advice on that matter, and the ruling on the validity of the survey from the Attorney-General's Department showed that the course followed was the right course to follow, but those who raised the matter did not like the verdict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should read all of the Ombudsman's letter, not the selected bits that he has been reading while traipsing around the country. He should read the whole seven pages of the letter, not the paragraph that he plucked out in isolation. He should read the lot of it. It is a great cop-out, belting public servants around the ears. That is all it is-a nice coward's castle job by a few members of this place, purporting to have an interest in the public. The household expenditure survey is absolutely fundamental to government planning, to industry planning, to the construction of the consumer price index, to the establishment of the levels of pension, to the CPI adjustment for veterans-to all these things. It is essential that the Government has an accurate CPI so that the adjustments are accurate. While members of the Opposition go round belting public servants, it is a cheap cop-out. They cannot come in here and respond to criticism from the Opposition as I am doing now. Those opposite should be a bit more constructive about it. They should go to the people who use the information required from the household expenditure survey. They are the people honourable members opposite are attacking. All of that is known. I will not go further in the time that is available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter that was raised was the tax file number. The facts of that matter are as follows: the Australian Taxation Office undertook a mail-out of tax file advices earlier this year to assist taxpayers to prepare for the upgraded tax file number system. In the course of the advice mail-out a number of advices were sent to incorrect addresses. This has been acknowledged and addressed by the Tax Office. This occurred when through computer program error advices were produced that included taxpayers who had lodged returns in past years and not, as was intended, only those who had lodged last year. It was readily admitted that an error was made. Even the Opposition makes errors. It would be better if it had not happened, but it did, and it was acknowledged. It meant, as I said, that some advices were sent out to people who have since changed their addresses without informing the Tax Office. In other situations advices were addressed to people who, unbeknown to the Tax Office, were deceased. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tax Office did not commit any breach of the privacy provisions built into the tax law. The tax file numbers were mailed in sealed envelopes, personally addressed to the taxpayer. The fact that personally addressed envelopes were opened by third parties does not constitute a breach on the part of the Tax Office. As I said, it would be better if it had not happened. An error was made. It is acknowledged and it has been attended to. I thank all honourable members who participated in the debate. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of press reports with respect to conflicts of interest within the Joint Coal Board. The Chairman of that organisation, Mr Wilcox, informed me personally as soon as the Board was aware of the situation. I am a bit concerned that Mr Greiner and his Minister, Mr Pickard, have been inaccurate in a number of matters surrounding this issue. Only one person was forced to resign from the Board, with the other avoiding a conflict of interest by having resigned from a position where a conflict could have arisen. I am impressed with the speed with which the Board acted. It advised the New South Wales and Commonwealth Ministers and also took the necessary and appropriate action and then provided a complete and final report to both Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The role of the New South Wales Government in trying to take credit for the Board's action and, at the same time, distance itself from the Board is very hard to fathom. One understands that it is the policy of the New South Wales and Federal sections of the Liberal Party to wipe out the Joint Coal Board. Mr Greiner, of course, is very sensitive to conflict of interest, given his experiences with his own Liberal-National Party coalition Ministers. Mr Pickard is set on destroying the Joint Coal Board. I guess I have to say quite plainly that the Commonwealth sees that the Joint Coal Board has a role to play in the New South Wales coal industry and it would like the Board to continue. I also have to recognise the Pickard fervour in pursuing the Joint Coal Board. I would not be doing my job if I did not project what role the Joint Coal Board might play if New South Wales takes unilateral action and revokes its legislation. I simply say to the honourable member that I will be supporting the Joint Coal Board and will ensure that its legitimate roles continue to be carried out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. As the Treasurer has ruled out any fall in interest rates, is the Prime Minister's prediction and promise before the Western Australian election that interest rates would fall now inoperative?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1435" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say something on this question of interest rates, seeing that in the three questions that have been asked today the Opposition seems to be showing some interest in this issue. It seems to be implying in its questions-certainly in the question before this one-that there was some alternative to the policy that the Government is pursuing. Let us make it quite clear that, as far as the conduct of economic policy in this country is concerned, there are basically three instruments which are available to the Government to regulate the level of economic activity. They are, of course, fiscal budgetary policy, wages policy, and monetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to be implied, at least in what the Opposition has been saying not only in Question Time today but also around the place in the last few weeks, that it would not have monetary policy as tight as it is, although one can find in statements from various spokesmen earlier this year positions which would contradict that position. However, on the assumption that that is the Opposition's current position, that it says that interest rates are too high, it necessarily means that the Opposition would have a tighter fiscal policy or a tighter wages policy. We know that it is not prepared to spell out the implications of these positions. If it is the case that the Opposition would have a tighter fiscal policy, what is it that the Opposition is saying? Is it saying that the performance of the Government in this area is inadequate? I remind the House, in particular members of the Opposition, of what the performance has been in this area. We have transformed an inherited $9 1/2 billion deficit-</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Oh!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again the giggleometer goes, but the fact is that we have reduced the inherited deficit of $9 1/2 billion to a surplus of $5 1/2 billion. Last year we produced a surplus for the first time in 35 years. This year we will produce a surplus of $5 1/2 billion. In most of the previous 35 years when that had not been done, the responsibility for macro-economic policy was in the Opposition's hands. It was consistently incapable of producing a surplus in this country. In the course of producing that surplus we have had three successive years of negative growth in Commonwealth outlays and reduced the public sector borrowing requirement to zero. None of those things have been achieved or were capable of being achieved by the Opposition. So it is a nonsense for members of the Opposition to assert or imply that they would be able to have a tighter fiscal policy than this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings us to the area of wages. I would have thought that members of the Opposition would not want any more on the area of wages after the bath they were given earlier this week by my friend the Treasurer. But, just in case the lessons that were relayed by the Treasurer have not sunk into their inadequate intellects, let me confirm what the Treasurer had to say, because what he said was right. He said, `I ask you to remember your own performance in the area of wages policy. It was the most disastrous performance that has ever been seen in this country'. At the time the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) sought to cooperate with the previous Government. It rejected that cooperation. The former Prime Minister flounced off to the royal wedding in London and left a 17 per cent explosion in wages. The previous Government's lax wages policy and its total inability to have any effective and constructive cooperation with the trade unions caused that massive wages blow-out.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer rightly said yesterday, its performance exceeded any expectations. Anyone could make a slight mess of an economy but, as he said, it took a very special talent to do what the previous Government did-that is, to have for the first time in this country simultaneous double digit unemployment and inflation. No-one has ever been able to do that before. But the previous Government, out of the depths of its ignorance and incapacity, produced what no-one else had ever done. So this Opposition is obviously incapable in the area of wages policy to produce anything that is relevant.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's whole approach on the question of interest rates is revealed as a hopeless stupidity and charade because it would not be able, in the area of the other two instruments of policy-that is, fiscal budgetary policy and wages policy-to have a tighter, more effective situation. The Opposition would have to resort to a monetary policy which would be even tougher than that which is applied by this Government. As I have said before, no politician is a masochist and wants to have monetary policy tighter for one day longer than is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members opposite think that we on this side of the House have interest rates where they are because we get some joy out of it? No. Interest rates are high for the simple reason that the economic interests of this country require it. If honourable members opposite think that we have high interest rate policies because we on this side of the House get some perverse pleasure out of it, they are wrong. Interest rates are at that level because it is not sensible to have tighter fiscal policy than we have now.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to have a tighter wages policy. Honourable members opposite would know that at the moment the ACTU is stopping wage increases. Employers around this country are going to the ACTU and pleading with it to agree to higher wage increases. The ACTU is saying no because that would be deleterious to the economic interests of this country. That is what the ACTU is doing and credit should be given to it by people on the other side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA> So we cannot get tighter wages policy and we cannot get tighter fiscal policy and, within that context, interest rates are necessarily where they are. We make no apology for it. But, as a result of the policies which we are pursuing and which will be further announced by the Treasurer tonight, the prospect is that interest rates will come down. If people opposite ever had the responsibility for macro-economic policy in this country again it is as certain as night follows day that we would have a return to the economic chaos of 1981. That would be no accident; it would happen because the Opposition has no wages policy, it has an inadequate stomach for the hard task of fiscal policy; and, therefore, it would be thrust into even higher interest rate levels than this Government has at the moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, concerns higher education funding in Queensland. Has the Minister seen recent reports concerning Commonwealth funding of higher education in Queensland and difficulties caused by recent unilateral decisions by the Queensland Government in relation to the designation of three colleges of advanced education (CAEs) as universities? Can he comment on these reports and on the approach taken by State governments elsewhere in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1436" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of higher education is something which obviously involves the Commonwealth as the major funding government. It also involves the States as they are responsible for the statutes which establish them. We have sought to adopt a cooperative approach to the future of higher education in this country. As an example, I instance the establishment of joint planning committees with each of the States so that State and Commonwealth Ministers are getting advice from the same source in relation to the planning of higher education in each of the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regrettably, the process of cooperation has not proceeded very far in Queensland. The Queensland Government has made what is essentially a unilateral decision to redesignate three colleges-Darling Downs, Capricornia and Brisbane CAEs-as universities by some time in the 1990s. This has been done without any consultation with us. In doing that the Queensland Government is saying that these institutions are not universities now. It wants them to become universities; therefore, they must change. The change will be expensive. The Queensland Government wants us to pay for that cost, yet it will not talk to us about the process by which those colleges might become universities or the timetable according to which they might make those changes.</PARA>
<PARA> These are important issues because, with the end of the binary system, we always said that there were legitimate expectations on the part of colleges to become universities or to amalgamate with other universities. Therefore, we have anticipated this kind of development. Let me just quote briefly from the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland. He says that there will be a `bid for university status by a significant number of colleges, some of which do not have the staff qualifications, academic quality or research strength normally associated with Australian universities'. In other words, some colleges would need to expand their profile, increase their graduate programs, improve their research infrastructure and so on. These are issues which we are happy to discuss with the institutions and with the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government had assessors go to these three institutions and reports were produced. The Queensland Government will not provide those reports to us. They remain secret despite our repeated requests to see them. I have asked the Queensland Minister to come to Canberra and meet me and talk about it. He has not done so-at least not yet.</PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that these institutions have legitimate expectations to become universities and we are prepared to support them in their ambitions. But it will not happen by magic. Indeed, if it were to, it would be a deception of the students, the staff and the communities involved. If we want them to be more than universities just in name, these changes have to be dealt with and funded. Let me quote from the Rockhampton Bulletin because the Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education is one of the institutions in case. The Rockhampton Bulletin of 14 March states:</PARA>
<PARA> The announcement may have been yet another of the National Party's notorious phantom projects.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be presumptuous to say the least for a State Government to promote a CAE to university status without detailed consultation with the appropriate Federal Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Littleproud-</PARA>
<PARA>the Queensland Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>and his Government would be far more prudent to seek urgent talks in Canberra to resolve the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>I endorse the sentiments of the Rockhampton Bulletin, as I always do. I am an avid reader of the Rockhampton Bulletin. It always has very laudatory things to say about the honourable member for Capricornia and at least in that context I always endorse it.</PARA>
<PARA> But these are complex issues which will not be dealt with by unilateral declarations by the Queensland Government. I repeat that we are prepared to support the idea of these institutions becoming universities but we wish to see an orderly process and a plan which we and the rest of the higher education community can support.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should just relax for one minute. I want to refer briefly to what is happening in Victoria. The Victorian Government has taken an absolutely different approach, a consultative approach, not only with us but also with the institutions involved. The honourable member for Ballarat has drawn to my attention a press release from the shadow Minister involving the future of the Ballarat CAE. First of all, in relation to the Ballarat CAE, it is the Victorian Government's proposal that there should be an amalgamation between the Ballarat, Deakin and Warrnambool colleges. That is not a proposal which has come from me; it is not one that I originated; it is not one which I have proposed. Nevertheless, it is one which I am prepared to support if the parties involved agree. But the honourable member for Deakin makes the outrageous suggestion that we have been involved in withholding funds, with threatening funding cuts and, indeed, delaying the announcement of capital funds for these institutions. We have made no threats-indeed, quite the contrary. What we have said is that we are prepared to provide additional support to these institutions involved in amalgamations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the question is no. The fact is that procedures are in place to ensure that there is a swift resolution of this dispute. Yesterday, as I mentioned in the House, action was being taken to achieve stand-down orders. Those stand-down orders were achieved yesterday afternoon. Action was then taken by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) last night against one air traffic controller who refused extended duty when another air traffic controller reported in sick. There seems to have been quite a lot of sickness in that area lately. As a result of that he was stood down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that this morning another three air traffic controllers have been stood down. I understand that further stand-downs are likely to occur this afternoon. The Government and the CAA agree that the process of continuing the stand-downs is not appropriately the only step that should be taken to bring this matter to a resolution. Accordingly, if industrial action continues, this afternoon the CAA will be approaching the Industrial Relations Commission to seek a bans clause in the air traffic controllers award. The result of an imposition of a bans clause will be that if there is continuance of bans and limitations upon the work by air traffic controllers both the union and the individual air traffic controllers can be subject to fines of up to $500 a day. The Government believes that the seriousness of this dispute warrants that kind of action and the air traffic controllers should be aware that the Government and the CAA are quite serious about taking that step.</PARA>

We regard that as a very considerable achievement. It is also an achievement for the division of fisheries down in the electorate of the honourable member for Denison because Graham Harris's team will be using data from EOS to study the relationship between climate, ocean circulation, biological processes and renewable marine resources in the Australasian region. Scientists from both the division of fisheries and the division of oceanography will be part of the investigating team.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. During the past 12 months a relatively small quantity of Victorian packaged milk has been sold in New South Wales through a particular retail chain. The Sandhurst dairies which are owned by Coles have recently begun supplying its own stores with around 300,000 litres of milk per week. The Victorian processors, by selling milk in the Sydney market, are obviously seeking to take advantage of the higher price structure that is established by the New South Wales milk marketing arrangements. The New South Wales industry is understandably concerned by this development but it is hoped that commonsense will prevail and that this incident or this action will not jeopardise the whole dairy marketing arrangements. I think dairy farmers on both sides of the border are well aware of the situation with respect to the market milk premiums.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am heartened because, unlike the situation some two years ago, there seems to be a lot more commonsense prevailing this time round. The New South Wales industry has begun to accept the reality of Victorian competition and the need to meet that competition in the marketplace and not by government regulation. On the other hand, New South Wales industry leaders are aware of their higher cost structures and, following Victoria's lead, are working to rationalise the industry's manufacturing and distribution infrastructure. It is only such rationalisation that will keep New South Wales competitive with Victoria and contain Victorian sales. It is my hope, and all the evidence points that way, that this more mature approach will result in an early and rational resolution of this matter.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1440" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple answer to the honourable member's question is no, the economic statement will not be the result of such direction. What it will reflect to a considerable extent is the detailed discussions and negotiations that have been openly conducted by this Government with the ACTU. I point out that those discussions have not been the only discussions we have had. My colleagues have had discussions with representatives of the business community, which community is totally cognisant of the fact that we have held discussions with the ACTU. There is nothing sinister or covert about this. We have been totally open, as well we should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why should we be open? It is because in our six years of government, through the process of discussion with the ACTU, we have been able to implement an effective wages policy, which wages policy, as the honourable gentleman may know, has been commented upon favourably by many international commentators. I remind the honourable member that last year the Director of the International Monetary Fund, Monsieur Jean-Michel Camdessus, was in this country and said openly that what had been done in Australia by the Government in having consultations with the trade union movement and producing an effective wages policy was a model for the rest of the world. Madam Speaker, you may want to discount what I say; you may want to discount what the Treasurer said, but I think you will find it fairly difficult to repudiate the considered judgment of the Director of the International Monetary Fund.</PARA>
<PARA> The function of the International Monetary Fund is to monitor, to watch, the economic performance of the 130-odd members of the International Monetary Fund. It analyses the conduct of economic policy in all the economies of the world. The considered judgment of the Director of the International Monetary Fund was that the conduct of policy by this Government in the area of consultation with the trade union movement provided a model for the rest of the world. That is a sensible judgment, because it reflects the fact that in this country employment growth has been more than twice as fast as in the rest of the world. I do not know whether that upsets honourable members on the other side of the House. No doubt it does. The only time there is glee on the face of the Leader of the Opposition is when there is bad economic news. Honourable members will remember his never to be forgotten statement a couple of years ago when we were in the depths of the reverse in the terms of trade position. He said, `The times will suit me'. When times were tough for Australia he thought that it was good for him politically.</PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the people of Australia take pride in the fact that, as a result of the policies pursued by this Government, we have a rate of employment growth twice as fast as in the rest of the world. There is one simple reason why we create jobs twice as fast as the rest of the world, and that is the cooperation between this Government and the trade union movement. Every employer in this country knows-if honourable members doubt it they can go and ask them-that if it were not for these policies of cooperation between the Government and the trade union movement they would be paying significantly higher wage rates. Employers know that; they are seeking to do it.</PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement is accepting lower nominal wage outcomes because of the way in which this Government is operating in the area of the social wage. That is something about which the honourable member should not complain. He should take great pride in the fact that he is a member of a country which is creating jobs more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. If he has the beginning of any understanding of economic policy he will know that the reason why we are creating jobs twice as fast as the rest of the world is that we are in a position where, sensibly, this Government has the capacity to sit down and negotiate constructively with the ACTU. I assure the honourable member that tonight he will see the further fruits of that sensible, constructive approach.</PARA>
<PARA> What is the alternative? The alternative is what the Opposition followed when it was in government in the period between 1975 and 1983, when confrontation, not cooperation and constructive dialogue, was the order of the day. Under the previous Government we had a work force which was non-cooperative with government, which went out into the workplace to try to get as much by way of nominal wage increases as it possibly could. In that situation, brought about by the attitude of the previous Government, as I said earlier today, we had something that never existed before in this country-simultaneous double-digit inflation and double-digit employment, the worst recession for 50 years, and an addition of some 350,000 unemployed in a period of less than two years. That is what honourable members opposite got from the policy of confrontation.</PARA>
<PARA> What we have got from the policy of constructive dialogue and cooperation is a rate of employment growth, as I say, more than twice as fast as in the rest of the world. If honourable members opposite think that the people want to return to the sort of nonsense the previous Government inflicted upon them as against our policies, they will have their chance to test that within about a year or so and they will get the answer that they got on the last three occasions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and I recognise his strong and continuing interest in this area and the issues involved. The interim committee of the IMF noted that over the last year output and investment in the industrial countries have expanded strongly, that employment gains have been significant and more widespread than in earlier periods and that the large external imbalances have narrowed, especially in real terms. The rapid expansion of world trade has helped to ease the debt position of a number of developing countries. The interim committee also noted that there have been developments, however, that require close attention and action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the industrial world the pace of external adjustment recently has slowed. There are signs of intensifying inflationary pressures in some countries. Interest rates have risen sharply in some countries and in many heavily indebted countries growth has slackened, debt-servicing burdens have worsened and inflation has accelerated.</PARA>
<PARA> The interim committee agreed that it was essential to deal promptly and effectively with emerging price pressures to ensure the sustainability of the current expansion. It noted that action in this direction had been taken in many industrial countries. The committee also agreed that, in the deficit countries, measures to increase national saving are urgently needed. In particular, early action to reduce the United States Federal Budget deficit is essential as well as steps to improve the external position of the United States without pushing up interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA> Germany and Japan should pursue macro-economic and structural policies that will sustain non-inflationary growth of domestic demand and facilitate external adjustment. Other surplus countries, including some of the newly industrialising economies of Asia, could enhance their standard of living and contribute further to the process of international adjustment through stepped-up domestic deregulation, external liberalisation and exchange rates which reflect fundamentals.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to debt, both the interim and the development committees focused on possible ways of strengthening the debt strategy. New proposals made by several countries, including the United States of America, France and Japan, were welcomed by the committee. These proposals build on the basic principles of the collaborate debt strategy as it has evolved over the past few years, on the validity of the case by case approach and the central importance of the sustained implementation of growth oriented policy reforms and improvement of investor climate in debtor countries. Those views were reaffirmed by the committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The committee agreed that, as part of critical assistance the World Bank and IMF can offer for adjustment programs, the two institutions should provide support for voluntary market based debt reduction transactions. It was agreed that the bank and the fund should set aside a portion of members' policy based financing to support debt reduction operations. In addition, the bank and the fund will examine the possibility of limited interest support for transactions involving significant debt or debt service reductions. I am very much aware of the honourable member's deep and continuing interest in this area of activities of the IMF and of the World Bank. I will ensure that copies of the communiques are made available to him as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. He will recall that, on many occasions since we have been in government, we have clearly expressed our attitude towards the tragedy which is Lebanon. I must say I am sure, despite the fact that during periods like this we have very profound differences on both sides of the House, that on this occasion I would speak for everyone in the House in again expressing our sense of tragedy about what is happening in Lebanon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has always been the case, the innocents are the sufferers. The Government is gravely concerned about the current round of fighting in Lebanon, which has resulted in some of the heaviest shelling in recent years in and around Beirut.

<PARA> The Australian Government urges all those involved to abide by the Arab League call for a cease-fire and to cooperate with it in its efforts to achieve a solution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is one area of the conduct of the Government's affairs in which I need no assistance from the honourable member for North Sydney, it is in the area of foreign affairs. He lives in a time warp; he is irrelevant. Australia supports a solution in Lebanon based on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Lebanese republic. It supports a position where there should be a withdrawal of all foreign forces, except those which are there expressly at the request of a Lebanese government representing all communities in the Lebanon. No position could be clearer than that. That applies to Syria. Those forces should be withdrawn to the extent that they remain there other than at the express wish of a government in Lebanon representing all communities in Lebanon. They should be withdrawn and that proposition applies to all troops in the Lebanon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For far too long now we have seen the tragedy in that country where there has been a combination of conflict resulting from internal divisions and, loaded on top of that, the imposition of tragedy coming from the presence of foreign forces and interests which seek to play out, in the Lebanon, their own external conflicts. That has imposed an unsustainable burden upon the innocent people in the Lebanon, particularly women and children. So I easily and readily identify myself with the plea of the honourable member and trust that all governments, and men and women of goodwill around the world, will exercise their influence to try to bring about a situation where, at long last, some peace, decency and opportunity for sane living can return to that tragic country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will, but it is relevant to the misrepresentation to remind the Parliament of that. The Prime Minister said that the only occasion on which I expressed any pleasure, or a smile crossed my face, in relation to economic matters was whenever there was any bad economic news for this country. Even in the heat and turmoil of political debate in this place that is a dastardly unfounded charge. I have never expressed pleasure at economic pain inflicted on ordinary Australians, and it is a complete misrepresentation of the position for the Prime Minister to suggest otherwise. He sought to buttress that claim by reference to a quotation which owes its origins to an interview I gave in Washington in 1986 to Anne Summers of the Australian Financial Review. It subsequently appeared under the heading ` ``Times Will Suit Me''-Howard'. That reference has been constantly used by the Prime Minister and the Government to suggest that I took some relish in the economic difficulty that Australia suffered in 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The context of those remarks and the context of that statement was entirely to the effect that the sorts of policies I espoused in 1986, which I still espouse, were more likely to remedy Australia's problems than the policies then espoused by the Government and now practised by the Government. At no stage did I seek to derive any comfort-personal, political or otherwise-from the economic difficulties of my country. I regard it as beyond the bounds of reasonable criticism in politics for the Prime Minister or anybody else to allege that I will ever in my political life draw any comfort from the suffering of ordinary Australians and their families. </PARA>

I misunderstood him and believed he was asking me whether immigrants had benefited from the growth in employment figures. Having misunderstood that, I make it clear to the House that it is true that immigrants have benefited from the growth in employment figures.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems all too often in this place that we are debating the failure of the Government's policies in aviation. Today we have confronting the travelling public of Australia a crisis at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. It is not of recent origin; it has been in place for some time and is only one of a number of problems. The crisis today arises as a result of an industrial dispute. As in many industrial disputes, many charges, countercharges and allegations have been made by the parties. The air traffic controllers have been accused of being irresponsible and avaricious. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has been accused of being tardy and derelict in its responsibilities to address the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real question is: What is the Government's responsibility in this area? The problem for Australia is that this dispute is embarrassing and particularly expensive. It really amounts to a failure of this Government's industrial relations policy. It is very appropriate that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) is here to address this issue because it is a direct result of his failure to act, while Minister for Industrial Relations, that his statutory authority is now having so much difficulty addressing, solving and resolving this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The dispute is essentially very simple. It is about pay and conditions. It is about air traffic controllers who are in a position to use industrial muscle to hold to ransom their employer and the travelling public. What has happened to date is that the Industrial Relations Commission has ordered the controllers to end their bans and limitations on overtime and work reasonable amounts of overtime. Their reaction has been to ignore that order from the Commission. The Civil Aviation Authority has proceeded to stand down air traffic controllers. We were told in the House today by the Minister that a controller was stood down last night and that the Minister anticipated that other controllers would be stood down this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to say that certain action would be taken to have a bans clause inserted in the air traffic controllers' award. That is where the credibility of the Government falls in a total heap, and why it is appropriate for the Minister to explain with a straight face-I was amazed that the Minister was able to give that answer with a straight face-why he can advocate a policy which, when he was Minister for Industrial Relations, he said was totally moribund. In 1987 the Minister, when introducing the Government's ill-starred industrial relations policy, said:</PARA>
<PARA> An essential element of any industrial relations system which provides benefits and protections to registered organisations and their members is that there should be an effective means of ensuring adherence to the principles on which the system is founded and compliance with the decisions of its institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Minister that the Industrial Relations Commission has already ordered that bans and limitations be lifted. The Minister, at the same time, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the present bans clause provisions, which have long since fallen into disrepute and are now substantially moribund . . . </PARA>
<PARA>These are the clauses which the Minister in Question Time, not half an hour ago, said he would rely upon to resolve this dispute in Sydney. His words were: `. . . long since fallen into disrepute and are now substantially moribund, will be replaced by a new direction and injunction process'. We do not have to remind honourable members what happened to the replacement by a new direction and injunction process. It did not happen. It did not happen for a very good reason: the relationship of this Government with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> Let me spell out exactly why it did not happen. We have a quote from Simon Crean, who aspires to be a member of this House. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> They can still introduce a Bill, but it will have to be one which does not do anything on compliance. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Crean, who is not yet a member of this House, says that the Government can introduce a Bill but it must be one that does not do anything about compliance. Responding to what Simon says, the then Minister for Industrial Relations and present Minister for Transport and Communications, who has told us today how he will solve this dispute with moribund provisions, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe it appropriate to be amending the provisions within the arbitration system now. </PARA>
<PARA>The chickens have come home to roost. In his current capacity, the Minister for Transport and Communications faces an industrial dispute. He proposes to resolve it; yet his course of action has been condemned by his own words. I wish him luck; for the future of industrial relations in this country, I hope sincerely that he establishes a precedent and successfully uses the bans provisions. But I do not think he will and I am not sure that he is serious about it. I am sure that he has grave doubts and reservations about the effectiveness of the course of action that he has advocated here today. What it amounts to is that as Minister for Industrial Relations he failed to act and now he is reaping the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> One solution to this dispute would be for the Government to acknowledge the poverty of its industrial relations policy and adopt the course of action advocated by the coalition parties. That would mean repudiating the claims the Government has been making for six years, claims that are based on rhetoric rather than on effective industrial relations. What the Government really needs to do is to introduce effective enforcement and compliance provisions to the industrial relations laws of Australia. It is essential that the Government move in the direction advocated by the Opposition and provide for the ability of parties to a dispute to seek an injunction from the Federal Court-an injunction from a real court that can be enforced and enforced effectively with penalties. Only then will trade unions, employers and officers and members of those unions take the Government's position seriously in such disputes. Until the playing field is level and both sides of industrial relations are forced to comply with the same obligations and have the same responsibilities before the law of this country, we will see a continual rerun of the disputes we have at present. </PARA>
<PARA> This dispute is really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of this Government's inability to deal with the very complex and urgent issues facing aviation today. We have a crisis with the air traffic controllers. There are many other disputes that arise directly as a result of this Government's policy failures. We have a problem with Qantas Airways Ltd. Qantas recently wrote to its customers saying, `We are having difficulty with the Government's wages policy. It makes it extremely difficult for us to recruit the appropriate number of skilled tradesmen to maintain our fleet'. That is the Government's own airline-the Government is the only shareholder in Qantas. Qantas is saying that the wages policy is inappropriate. We have a problem with airworthiness surveyors and the issue of safety. There is a major problem with attracting to the all government service and to the industry as a whole qualified staff to maintain the safety standards and the Government's own regulations for aviation. That, of course, comes back to the problem of the wages policy, which is a very serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA> To give honourable members some idea of the magnitude of the problem, let me refer to the airworthiness surveyor's claim that fewer than 140 of the 193 existing airworthiness positions in the Civil Aviation Authority are filled because it cannot attract and retain suitably qualified people with the present working conditions. The CAA mounted a major national advertising campaign. Under the Government's wage fixing guidelines, it was able to attract one applicant. Much the same problem arises with air traffic control. One of the issues in dispute relates to support provided to air traffic controllers for data processing. There was a shortage of people qualified to perform that function and air traffic controllers were required to work overtime to fulfil that function. The Civil Aviation Authority embarked on a recruitment campaign which resulted in its recruiting 10 additional officers who were trained. I am told that of those 10 recruits only one took up a position. What happened to the other nine? Because of the inadequate pay and conditions, they sought other positions not only within government but also outside it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have example after example of how the Government's centralised, rigid and inflexible approach to industrial relations and wage fixing is causing problem after problem in aviation. The chaos in aviation continues. Not only will this former Minister for Industrial Relations who is now the Minister for Transport and Communications not acknowledge the difficulty he faces because of his failure to respond to the industrial relations problems but he is also failing to address issues that are critical to the future development of aviation in Australia. We want to hear from the Minister today exactly how he will settle this dispute-not the glib answer we got at Question Time, but an explanation of a procedure that will work, a procedure that he does have faith in. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to know what he proposes to do to address Qantas's problems in terms of skilled maintenance people. Already we have a situation where Qantas is forced to have its aircraft serviced overseas by United Airlines. Qantas is not happy with the standard of that service. It has removed aircraft from operation and it has told the travelling public that that is because it is not happy with the service provided. For the first time in its operating history, Qantas has questions concerning its safety and has suffered safety incidents with aircraft in Australia and overseas. That is a direct result of this Government's approach to the labour market issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to know this Government's answers for the capital funding of Qantas and of Australian Airlines. It is no good saying these issues will be dealt with by a committee. That is the approach that was used for industrial relations. The Government has thought of a course of action, it knows what that course of action is and it knows in its own heart what should be done. But when it is confronted with opposition over industrial relations from the Australian Council of Trade Unions and from the left wing of the Labor Party in the case of capital funding for Qantas and Australian Airlines, the Government has backed down and walked away from the issue. The lesson that should be recognised by the Minister at present is that the chickens do come home to roost. Inaction today will be repaid by a crisis in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the crisis at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport today. We will see it again and again in the future because of the failure of this Government to address the policy questions that must be addressed. We saw how difficult it was for this Government to come to grips with the airport capacity at Sydney. The procrastination and the internal turmoil regarding the decision on the third runway was just a sight to behold. The final decision is not even clearcut. It is almost a Clayton's decision. It is the decision one has when one is not having a decision. With a nod and a wink, the right wing of the Labor Party of New South Wales is saying, `Well, Cabinet may have decided to build the third runway but don't worry. We will have an environmental impact study (EIS) and everything will be all right'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has determined a timetable which very conveniently takes this EIS beyond the last possible date for the next Federal election. That is extremely convenient for marginal seatholders in the area and people who have already begun to campaign against this runway. The Minister's excuse for that long timetable is to provide an opportunity for public comment. Looking at the detail of the timetable, we see that only one of the 18 months is available for public comment. Where is the Minister's response to the offer from the New South Wales Government to accelerate and expedite that environmental impact study? What is the Government's response to the ongoing problem at Sydney? Despite the decision to build that third runway there is still inadequate capacity. The Government's decision has not improved or increased the capacity of the airport. It will still hit a crisis point in 1991. There will still be no runway and there will still be delays. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done about union bans? Only a couple of weeks ago we were treated to the spectacle of the Builders Workers Industrial Union not only banning work on the third runway but also making claims against building the international terminal. What was the Government's response to that? It has problems with the two-airline agreement. The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) says that, despite de- regulation, Australia will still have two airlines. There are massive industry complaints about the CAA and the FAC, with no Government response. The real problem is that the Government just will not address the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We could, of course, debate the waterfront and coastal shipping, but we do not have time. What the Minister must tell us today is why in 1987 he said that the provisions and the compliance procedures were inadequate, yet today he says they will work. He must tell us exactly how he is going to solve this problem and how he will enforce compliance on air traffic controllers. The country cannot afford a continuation of a very expensive dispute that is costing the airlines and the travelling public a lot of money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) was obviously battling to find a way to fill in his 15 minutes. He even wanted to start talking about the waterfront, which seemed to have little to do with the chaos in Australian aviation because of the failure of the Government's policies, which was the topic that he put up for discussion. There is a serious dispute involving air traffic controllers at Sydney; there is not chaos in the aviation industry in general. The aviation industry has grown spectacularly in the last several years. During this Government's period in office there has been an explosion in activity in the aviation industry, associated particularly with the growth of tourism. There has also been an explosion of aviation activity in many other countries. That has put great pressure on that industry in terms of its infrastructure and having sufficient skilled staff to service the demands of the customers. Of course, that shows up in various ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It shows up in respect of the shortage in some areas of skilled staff. There has been a shortage involving air traffic controllers, particularly support staff rather than air traffic controllers as such, and some maintenance workers for Qantas Airways Ltd have been mentioned, as have some other people employed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The domestic airlines also have found it difficult to achieve the staff levels that they want. But the airlines do not have that problem on their own. It is something which is not confined to the aviation industry. As everyone knows, the economy has been growing very strongly. There has been extraordinarily rapid growth in employment and there has been great pressure on demand for skilled labour. One of the key aspects of the Government's success in that respect has been that, when there has been enormous pressure on employers to bid staff away from each other, to retain or attract skilled labour, we have not had what would have happened in normal times, when that kind of activity would have taken place on a large scale, leading to a spectacular wages blow-out. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great successes of the Government's accord has been in the context of that kind of labour market. With the shortages showing up on various fronts, including the aviation industry, this country has not had in any respect the kind of wages blow-out which would have occurred under the previous Government's policies or which would occur, if the Opposition were to get back into government at some future time, under the then Government's industrial relations policies. What is preventing a spectacular wages blow-out at the present time is the accord, which has the support of the trade union movement, which has helped us through extremely difficult times and which will deliver responsible wages outcomes and enable the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in combination to ensure that wage and salary earners generally have their real incomes protected and in some ways enhanced. The package to be announced tonight by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will elaborate on that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> The dispute which is the main focus of the address by the honourable member for Richmond is a serious one. It is, as he said, almost solely about wages. The log of claims which the air traffic controllers produced went to matters beyond wages, but most of those matters have been satisfactorily addressed. It is the wages issue which remains unaddressed. It was addressed by the CAA and the Federal union of air traffic controllers, and by the end of March there was an agreement about the process which would take place to bring about award restructuring for air traffic controllers, who would then be among the first group of employees in this country to achieve increases from the award restructuring process. It was agreed that a case would be put to the Industrial Relations Commission by the end of March, and that was done. A little more work needs to be done on that before it can be finalised and accepted by the Commission, but it was hoped that, in the context of the review of award restructuring which is taking place at present, the Commission would consider the air traffic controllers' case along with several others, including other aviation industry employees and employees from some other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> That agreed process between the CAA, the employer and the union for the air traffic controllers has been put in great jeopardy by the actions of one section of the air traffic controllers-the air traffic controllers at Sydney, who constitute a sizeable proportion of the total union. Those people in Sydney have decided to ignore the approach of their Federal union and simply to put in a claim for a wage increase of up to 42 per cent. An increase of 42 per cent is absolutely beyond the pale. It is way beyond what there could be any reasonable expectation of achieving through award restructuring or any other sensible wages policy, but that is what they have claimed. It is the refusal of the Civil Aviation Authority to consider a claim of that dimension, and indeed to consider any claim outside the award restructuring context, which has led to the current dispute, causing disruption in the aviation industry and leading to great difficulty for passengers and the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in Question Time on a couple of occasions, the Government has addressed that dispute with the appropriate measures. It has sought to explain to the air traffic controllers in Sydney that their claims are well outside the bounds of reasonableness and outside the wage fixing principles and therefore could not possibly be accepted by the Government. We have explained to them that they are putting their prospects of an early award restructuring increase in great jeopardy by pursuing the current course and have indicated to them that there is no way that the Government will allow their continual closing down of the airport through refusing to undertake extended duties to continue and create great difficulties in the industry. The Government and the CAA have agreed that the appropriate course is to obtain stand-down clauses. They were obtained yesterday and have been utilised yesterday and today. The next step, as I indicated at Question Time, was to say that if this action continues the Government will take action to put a bans clause in the award, which will mean that if the bans and limitations continue there will be a possibility of fines or penalties of up to $500 a day being imposed on the union and the individuals concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> That process is in accord with the procedures provided for in the Industrial Relations Act. The honourable member for Richmond sought to get some comfort from the fact that at some stage I said something rather critical about bans clauses and indicated that another process would be preferable. Of course, that is history and I do not deny that I said those words, but what he got absolutely wrong was the reason that the Government withdrew its original intention to have a directions process put in the Act. He said that was because the ACTU would not tolerate it. The reason that we withdrew it was that the employers would not tolerate it. The employers insisted that the approach to penalties which we had in the original industrial relations legislation was one which they would not accept. It was on that basis that the Government withdrew the approach to penalties provided for in that package and went back to the bans clause approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the directions procedure would have been better but, given the circumstances that we faced, circumstances of considerable entrenched opposition from the employers, we decided it was best not to proceed on a course of which they would be extremely critical and obviously totally unaccepting. In those circumstances the Government has to rely on the bans clause. The bans clause was moribund for years because private employers would not use it. What the Government is doing here is making sure that it is used, if necessary. We do not want to use it, of course, but, if it is necessary, clearly it will have to be used. That action will be taken this afternoon. We will not allow a situation to continue in which air traffic controllers take industrial action which causes continual chaos with the closing down of Australia's most important airport-Sydney Airport. That situation must be brought to a head. We will do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Richmond mentioned maintenance problems. Qantas has had problems in relation to maintenance staff and other skill shortages. I have mentioned that those have not been confined to Qantas. They have been sought to be addressed by Qantas by the appropriate means-that is, through award restructuring. Qantas is one of the first groups which would achieve increases for its maintenance employees through award restructuring. Indeed, its case is before the Industrial Relations Commission at present. I expect that aviation industry maintenance staff, including Qantas aviation maintenance staff, will be among the first groups in the country to achieve an increase through the award restructuring process. Qantas, in its handling of this matter, has not conducted itself in total accord with good industrial relations policy. I have been somewhat critical of it in the way it has gone about it. Nevertheless, taking the matter through the award restructuring process is the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Richmond also indicated that there was something wrong with the way the Government was approaching this issue. He seemed to indicate that what we should do is throw a lot of money at the staff. He said that there was a skill shortage problem because of our wages policy; that we were too restrictive; we were not giving staff enough pay. He said, by implication, that if they were given big fat wage increases that would fix the problem. We know that that is the sort of wages policy which the Opposition has had in the past. Under its policy in 1982-83 there was an 18 per cent wages blow-out. That is what happened under the Fraser Government. Its policies were to abuse unions, continually threatening enormously tough action but, on the other hand, being utterly powerless to do much while wages blew out periodically through the total incapacity of that Government to produce a proper industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has not only achieved very good industrial relations outcomes in the sense of a level of industrial disputes which is 40 per cent of that which applied under the previous Government-there has been a massive reduction in the amount of time off as a result of industrial disputation-but also it has had a controlled wages policy. We have not had the booms and enormous surges which the previous Government's wages policy gave us and which would occur again if it were to get back into government. We heard from the honourable member for Richmond the kinds of things that the Opposition would do. Its solution, if there is a problem, a bit of a shortage, is to say, `Throw some money at it. Give them a big increase. Don't worry about the fact that everyone down the road will do the same thing. They'll try to make sure that they keep their staff in the factory down the road and they'll make sure that the one up the road from them keeps up with them' and so on. Under the Opposition there would be a round of large wage increases while everyone tried to retain and attract staff. That is the kind of wages system which the Opposition would advocate. That is what has brought Australia undone time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening with the award restructuring approach is that we are giving a wage increase in a sensible way and are addressing the need to attract people to become more skilled. We want to give them a career path-an incentive to gain more skills and get wage increases by moving up a career path into high levels of skills. That is a very sensible combination of a controlled wages policy and skill development policy. There is nothing in what the Opposition has produced either in opposition or in government which would indicate that it could possibly deliver such a wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Richmond said that the Government had not addressed Qantas's capital funding problems. There is no way that Qantas is being inhibited by its capital structure in acquiring any aircraft that it wants to acquire at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member said he would tell us what to do about Qantas's capital funding. There is no problem about capital funding. Obviously, over the next several years-if Qantas expanded in the way that it sees itself likely to want to expand-there could be a capital funding problem. However, that matter is being addressed. There is no problem now. Qantas is not being inhibited one iota from acquiring aircraft that it needs to obtain to expand its fleet and to keep up with its share of the business by its capital structure. The fact that there could be a longer term problem is being addressed thoroughly by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member also said that there was a Clayton's decision on the third runway because there was to be an environmental impact study (EIS). The obvious implication from that is that the Opposition would disregard the EIS and not abide by the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. It would just go through some Clayton's EIS instead of adhering properly to the processes of an environmental impact study to enable us to be sure that we would not be adversely damaging the environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the domestic and international travelling public of Australia, the airlines, the tourism infrastructure of Australia, the travel agents, the travel operators, and, indeed, industry in Australia, there is no joy to be had from the speech just made by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). In actual fact, the situation is the direct opposite. To sum it up we must look at the newspaper headlines of the last few days which read: `Nation's airlines face chaos'; `Willis ignored by airport controllers'; `No work on runway threat by unions'; `Third runway: union work bans'; `Warning of ALP runway fiddle'; `Six-hour airport closure will hit Queensland hard'; `Tourists in strife as air strikes hit'; and today's editorial in the Brisbane Courier-Mail says `Airport chaos has to end'. Those headlines say it all. They are indicative of the problems that each and every Australian faces in terms of the provision of international aviation services. That has to stop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Never before have we been in the state in which we are in at the moment. We are turning away people coming to Australia as tourists-people who will provide foreign income for us, who will help reduce our balance of payments. Never before have we heard of our second biggest industry, in terms of foreign earnings, being destroyed by lack of action of the Government. The Government's lack of action does not just apply to the present work bans that are hitting Sydney Airport. It refers to the last six years of absolute decay in the aviation industry in Australia. It is about time that that was fairly and squarely addressed and resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a state of chaos. Can honourable members imagine a situation, as occurred yesterday, when Sydney Airport was closed and flights had to be diverted to Brisbane and Melbourne? Can they imagine, as was reported today, 13 flights being transferred to Brisbane from Sydney? What happened then? Thirteen jumbo jets sat on the ground. The Courier-Mail described the airport as resembling a supermarket car park. What is worse, I would estimate that there would have been at least 5,000 international travellers on board, some of whom had come from as far away as the United Kingdom and the west coast of the United States. Five thousand international travellers into Australia sat on the ground, locked up in an aeroplane for 2 1/2 hours. That happened because we did not have the facilities to handle it. Time and time again, Minister after Minister has told us that the present situation in Brisbane is perfectly adequate; nothing will be done. Time and time again the Federal Airports Corporation has put off the construction of an international terminal there. Not only can Brisbane not handle its present traffic, when there is chaos around it cannot make any real contribution to the situation at hand. </PARA>
<PARA> So that I will not be parochial, I will quote a little gem from the intellectual giants of the Minister's Department. When an Air India flight was diverted from Sydney to Melbourne yesterday, some of its passengers were destined to go to Melbourne. What happened? Those passengers were locked up in the transit hall and told that they could not get out, that they had to go to Sydney and fly back again. That story appears on the front page of a newspaper. It was only when that was exposed on a Melbourne radio station that the authorities relented and let 12 passengers out of the transit lounge, even though their ticket said `destination Melbourne' and not Sydney. That is the type of thing we face at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> A monthly edition of a very influential international magazine to which I subscribe, Business Traveller, arrived on my desk yesterday. One of the feature articles is entitled `G'day mate, please wait'. This magazine has a circulation around the world of approximately 1.2 million copies. I would like to take a little time today to quote some of this article. `Things move slowly at the hub . . . in this look at Sydney's Kingsford Smith which was originally designed for B-707 operations' is the introduction. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Sydney airport is the major hub for most of the south Pacific as well as Australia-but unfortunately, like the wheel, things move much slower at the hub than near the rim. </PARA>
<PARA> Long-notorious for its seriously inadequate international terminal . . . the airport is an unpredictable feature on your travel itinerary. </PARA>
<PARA> A political debate is raging over the need for an extra runway or a new airport about 60km out of town . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Some improvements to the terminal have recently been completed, but these only make it almost adequate to cope with current traffic flow and at peak periods it still resembles the fringes of a war zone. Most mornings, almost on the dot of 6am when the nightly noise curfew is lifted, the wheels of a wide-body, longhaul international jet touch down on the runway. It is followed within minutes by a gaggle of others and they all race for the international terminal like chickens at feeding time. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point, experienced foot-soldiers in the frequent traveller infantry can be seen peering out of their aircraft windows towards the terminal to size up the combat zone awaiting them. </PARA>
<PARA> If your aircraft is one of the first to the terminal, this is one of those times when it really is worth pushing your way off the aircraft as rapidly as possible and then sprinting . . . to the customs and immigration check. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to advise travellers to avoid the inbound duty free shop because it is an absolute rip-off. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> By this time however, you are close to the customs barrier and a glance around will help you size up the tactical situation and check whether following jets have yet disgorged their shock troops onto the beach-head-or whether you are in the last wave. </PARA>
<PARA>It says that recent modifications to the terminal have helped a bit. Although one now has to pay for one's baggage trolley, the article says:</PARA>
<PARA> The performance of the baggage carousels has been improved by fitting more powerful motors to the conveyor belts feeding them. This appears to have put an end to the old farce of overloaded belts grinding to a halt, forcing men in overalls to climb up and down through various orifices to get things moving again. The system is still a bit of a lash-up however and flight numbers are sometimes switched around, forcing you to scramble from one over-crowded carousel to the next. </PARA>
<PARA>It then gives a few clues on how one can do a bit of queue jumping to get through immigration and customs. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not read the rest of the article, but the same story applies to people leaving Sydney. This is the premier airport of Australia. This is the major international gateway. This is the gateway that is handling 52 per cent of the business. This is the problem that has been totally and utterly ignored by this Government for the last six years. We will hear that there are all sorts of plans for the international terminal; but the point is that, no matter whether we look at Sydney, Brisbane or some of the other major developments at airports in Australia, the plain facts of the situation are that they have all come too late and that all the predictions of the Government in terms of international airline growth to Australia have been dead, motherless wrong for years. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted to see the other day that perhaps by the year 2000 we could have up to five million international visitors. That figure came from one of the government departments. Do government departments never check any of the other predictions? Have they not seen the figures of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which predicts that by the turn of the century there will be six million international visitors coming to Australia? I really wonder where the departments get their information from. I really wonder about the competence of the people who do these forward projections on the growth of aviation into Australia. As I say, on every prediction they have made so far they seem to be dead, motherless wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem in relation to publications such as Business Traveller, which has a world-wide circulation, is that once a destination is bad mouthed the word will get around pretty quickly. Already we have seen a move by the international airlines to get out of Sydney, to get out of the major gateway and go to other ports, particularly Cairns and Brisbane. That is great, as long as Cairns and Brisbane can handle that extra traffic. I am a great believer in allowing people to come through the front door of Australia rather than the tradesman's entrance, Sydney. That is exactly what Sydney international airport is, it is a tradesman's entrance. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when we are screaming for international money, when we are trying to solve the balance of payments crisis, when we have an industry which has been boosted not only by the Government but also by the private sector and we have tourists coming to Australia by the millions, we are doing the best we can to scare them away. </PARA>
<PARA> Never let us forget that, despite what the Government says, there is only one industry in Australia that is providing long term jobs for the young people of this country, and that is tourism. The longer we go on with this rubbish, the longer we restrict the number of international airlines coming into Australia, the longer we delay the development of these airports, the longer we take to get things right, those jobs will be going down the gurgler at a faster and faster rate of knots. There is chaos in the Australian aviation industry. There has been very little government guidance. The whole thing is an absolute disgrace. The sooner this Government goes and we get some competent management into the place, the better. Otherwise Australia really is in trouble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, what we have had from the other side is a litany of problems being enunciated without any offers of solutions. What we have seen is the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) and the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) reeling off newspaper articles, reeling off headings and talking about the difficulties experienced by tourists coming into this country and getting through Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, without offering any solutions. They conveniently forget many of the facts that can be clearly outlined to the people of Australia to show what this Government is doing about them. Let us go to a couple of them straightaway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, the honourable member for Fadden said that the problems at Sydney Airport, presumably because of the terminal position and so on, are turning tourists away. It might be news to him, since he emphasised in his contribution today the question of tourism into this country, that one of his colleagues on that side of the House, the shadow spokesman on tourism, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), put out a press release the other day saying that the problem for tourists coming into this country is not the airport but the high cost of accommodation in the tourist industry being charged by the hoteliers in Sydney. What does he say about that? Does he agree with that? Does he give that any credence at all? Is that a problem facing the Australian tourism industry? Is that at the heart of why tourists are not coming here? The answer probably is in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the honourable member for Fadden talked about the timetables of international carriers and said that come 6 o'clock the curfew is lifted, the bell is rung and all the airport activity is stirred up, the international aircraft come in and the domestic aircraft start to depart. Why is that? It is because international carriers choose to manage their timetabling in such as way as to meet the requirements of the curfew at Sydney because of environmental considerations that this Government has for the residents of the Sydney region. They choose, therefore, to put those people in as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again this Government has endeavoured to negotiate with those international carriers over the opportunity to space out the times of landing throughout the whole day. But it has not been successful because those carriers do not choose to do that. It is not because this Government has not endeavoured to influence those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that was said was that the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has completely abrogated its responsibilities in respect of the terminal. What the honourable member for Fadden conveniently did not say was that the FAC has already been authorised to spend $214m to double the size of the existing international terminal. Why did he not say that? Why did he not say that the FAC is already spending $40m, as of now, to make improvements in that system? Why were those facts not outlined in his complaints about this Government's supposed lack of initiative and lack of effort? He spoke absolute rubbish. He does not say it simply because his claims are not founded in fact. If one looks at what this Government is doing one can see that those problems have been recognised; but, unlike the Opposition, we have put forward solutions and we are achieving our objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Believe it or not, this matter of public importance is supposedly about the chaos at Sydney Airport that has been brought about by an industrial dispute. What the honourable member for Fadden neglected to say, when talking about the present airline dispute there, was that in 1977 there was an absolutely massive and chaotic air traffic controllers strike. The solution offered then by those opposite, who were in government at the time, was-guess what-buckets full of money. They said, `Here you are, boys. We don't care. Here are buckets full of money. Let's go'. What effect did that have? As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) said in his contribution today, it exploded the wages system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, through its consultation rather than confrontation policies, has always believed that Australia's economic interest is at the forefront. We have always believed that the process through the accord and negotiation around the table between the trade unions, leaders of the trade union movement and our Government is the most effective way to achieve a rational and sensible wages policy. We know that the Opposition does not have a wages policy other than that if there is a strike it will give in to industrial blackmail. It says, `We'll throw buckets full of money at it. That's the way we'll get over it. Then we'll forget about it for the time being. When the time comes around again, when another union determines that it perhaps will go outside wage guidelines to achieve its own particular ends, we'll throw more money that way'. What a great and sensible policy that is!</PARA>
<PARA> What did we see in 1982-83? We saw some great results-a wages explosion. The end result was that employers could not keep up with that wages explosion and 500,000 people were thrown on the unemployment scrap heap, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) constantly reminds the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), as he was responsible for most of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, this matter of public importance today emphasises one important matter-that is, the question of balance between consultation and confrontation. This Government is always in the forefront of consultation. No better has that been demonstrated than in this question of industrial relations. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) adequately covered that area in his contribution today and I do not propose to add anything further. But some comments were made about the process of the decision to have a third runway placed at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport as a result of the chaos that has occurred in Sydney because of problems over the last two years. Let me say one or two things about that process. I refer particularly to the proposed environmental impact statement (EIS) because some comments were made about a group on this side of the House and its involvement in that. The first thing that needs to be said is that, unlike those opposite and unlike what Greiner might do in New South Wales, we are proposing a rational environmental impact statement process which will draw out all the necessary information in a physical environmental and social environmental sense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Maranoa is asking why we need an EIS. Out in the cow country where he comes from, where there are not too many people and not too many planes flying around, it would not affect the cattle but it affects the people around Sydney. People's lives are affected by aircraft flying around all day. This Government has taken a rational approach to that. We have a curfew. We have looked at that curfew and, for the benefit of the travelling public, and Australia's balance of payments, because of the tourists who come in and spend money, we have revised that matter. But the environmental impact statement needs to look at a range of options.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It needs to consider the noise exposure forecast and the footprints that develop around the new runway proposals. Who is likely to be affected? If honourable members opposite took the opportunity to have a look at some of the proposals that have been put forward for the various spacings of the parallel runways they would see that, in the past, people who have not been affected by noise suddenly may be. Do honourable members opposite not think that we at least owe them the opportunity to come forward and put their views? This Government does. This Government believes in public participation in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to put the lie to another thing that was raised by the honourable member for Richmond. He said that only one month will be available for the discussion of this EIS. That is simply not true. The resolution and the press statement put out by the Minister stated a minimum of one month. The Government and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) have already indicated that that process will be extended, certainly to a minimum of three months. That is something that we on this side of the House would applaud because we believe that the residents of the Sydney region who could be affected by increased noise exposure have the right and obligation, and should have the opportunity, to put those views to this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Liberals of New South Wales, the EIS process should take no more than three months. Having been involved in such a process in a previous capacity, I have to say; `What absolute nonsense!'. They have conveniently forgotten that the EIS process to choose a second Sydney Airport site took approximately two years to complete. As part of that process, things like noise exposure forecasts, biosystems, problems about obtaining fill and the necessity for looking at social and economic consequences were looked at. All of that has to be addressed once again in this proposal. We simply cannot say that we want a third runway, a parallel runway, and pull the fill out of Botany Bay or put a drag line and a pump system right out to sea or go to some of the nearby bays and dredge all the sand up with no effect on the environment at all. We could do that if we were in the National Party or in the Greiner Liberal Party in New South Wales. This Government does not work that way. This Government will ensure that the environment is not affected and that an appropriate solution is developed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has demonstrated to the travelling public its commitment to a third runway in a number of ways. It has taken the decision to build a second airport and it has chosen the site. Did the Liberals ever do that? No, they did not. They did absolutely nothing. This Government has taken the decision in respect of a third runway and an appropriate EIS is being developed along those lines. It has taken a decision not to be subjected to industrial blackmail by a small group of aircraft controllers who have launched nothing more than a wages grab, and it has done it appropriately. What would honourable members opposite do? Would they give in? Would they throw more money at this group like they did in 1977? If that is their industrial relations policy we are in big trouble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will help you, Mr Deputy Speaker, by saying that it is a matter of direction. The point I am trying to make is that the criticisms that were made at that time which were associated with the Appropriation Bills were well directed and totally justified. Let me refer quickly to the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee C on 18 October 1988. The Minister Assisting the Treasurer advised that Committee by way of a letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the request from the Senate Estimates Committee C that the Statistician, Mr Ian Castles, be recalled from leave to attend these meetings, I am unwilling to do so. I find the current `Acting Statistician' arrangements adequate in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the week before Senator Shirley Walters expressed the view that it was most desirable that Mr Castles be present at that Committee. Mr McLennan, who was the Acting Statistician, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I could second that. </PARA>
<PARA>So there was a desire by both the Bureau and the Opposition to permit Mr Castles to appear. My view is that if the Government is going to play funny games with the commissions and statutory authorities of this country, of course the heads of those bodies will come under fire. If the Government is going to keep them away from the watchful eye--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will allude briefly to the Bill in accordance with your direction, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the allocation of $7,217,000. The Government needs a lot of this extra money because of the utter bungling that the Australian Statistician has gone through in the last year. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has been conducting a household expenditure survey which has required several visits from its collectors. People are refusing to do the survey because thousands of people are aware of the debate last year and they are encouraging their friends not to do the surveys.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When members of the Bureau appeared before the Senate Estimates committee the other day they said that they had only had a few people causing difficulties. I am getting people at the rate of three to five per week every week from all over Australia ringing me and saying, `Mr Cameron, we have heard of the Opposition's views on this survey. What should I do?'. I say, `I am aware of the Appropriation Bill allocating another $7m. The reason for this is that the Government has to finance the extra calls and the persuasive measures that the Bureau has had to adopt because it is not fulfilling the requirements of this Act'. What really gets in my craw is the fact that this Government is prepared to stand by statutory authorities which do not follow the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office is the collector of the funds that make the appropriations possible. In recent times we have had the introduction of the tax file number. There is a law in this land which specifically requires-Mr Deputy Speaker, you probably presided over the introduction of the legislation-that if the date for the introduction of what is called the introductory procedures of the tax file number extends beyond 31 March, there should be a proclamation. Members on the government side of the Parliament and members on this side of the Parliament all voted for it, the Senate endorsed it and yet come 31 March the Australian Taxation Commissioner puts out a press statement saying that the people in the Tax Office are reasonable and that they are not going to worry if the public took a few extra days to put their tax file numbers in. Quite frankly, as far as I see things, the law of the land applies to every individual and the Taxation Commissioner, as big-hearted as he might wish to appear to be, has no right to disregard the decisions of this Parliament and, on his own initiative, disregard the--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the additional money that we are told will be forthcoming as a result of the tax file number which makes these appropriations possible. I wish it were as easy for me to get through this debate as it is for the Taxation Commissioner to skirt the law and to conduct the affairs of the nation as he sees fit rather than in accordance with the dictates of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For my own peace, I will conclude my comments on this matter. I say to the Taxation Commissioner: no man in Australia's history has bored into the little man if he made a little mistake or a big mistake, whether he is an honest or dishonest taxpayer, more than the Commissioner. It is all the same; they are screwed into the ground to teach them a lesson. The laws of this nation apply as equally to John Citizen as they do to Mr Boucher and there is a requirement for him to follow the law, the decisions of this Parliament, and not to interpret the Acts of Parliament as he wishes. I suspect that I will be followed by the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that you are as tough on him as you have been on me. </PARA>

Members of the Opposition around Australia have participated in letter writing to the newspapers, in phone-ins to radio stations, in generating public concern about a survey that they think is a useful hobbyhorse to get onto to create disquiet in the community and, essentially, to frighten aged people.

The accusation was made that the survey is illegal. I will read one line from the Attorney-General's response to the Statistician: `In my opinion the two surveys were not significantly different'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, but the honourable member had his day in court. He was wrong. I do not want to advert to the matter any further. The advice is on the record. The Opposition has conducted a campaign of harassment. This survey is extremely important. It has been carried out over the years by successive governments. The Bureau does not carry out the survey just for something to do. The survey is essential to the formulation of social welfare policies. The conduct of the survey is essential to the development of the consumer price index (CPI), its accuracy and its appropriateness. It is important to every one of the three million pensioners in this country. They want to have confidence that the CPI adjustment is accurate and up to date with expenditure patterns. That is a major use of the survey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The survey is used in the development of information on the cost of health care and the cost of education and the impact of such costs on different sorts of households. It is used to assess the level of social disadvantage in the community, to help understand the nature of poverty and to identify the types of households that are in poverty. It is used extensively by industry in the development of its planning. It is used by the housing industry to monitor expenditure on house purchases. It is used by large manufacturers and manufacturing industry groups to assess the size of the market for their products and to analyse the characteristics of householders in the market. It is used by service industries, such as the insurance, child-care, health and tourism industries, to analyse expenditure data relating to them and the characteristics of consumers. It is used by the meat industry to analyse changes in consumer preferences, for example, for red meat, poultry or fish. There is extensive use of the survey across the private and public sectors. It is an important survey. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a year and a half the Opposition has run a deliberate campaign to undermine and put down this very important survey. What the Opposition is really doing is attacking the beneficiaries of that survey, those for whom the information is used-to determine their pensions, for example-and those who use the information in respect of industry activities. I recommend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 makes a number of amendments to existing legislation and repeals some outdated and unused legislation. The minor administrative amendments are to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 and the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Collection Act 1964. The Bill also repeals the South Australian Grant (Fruit Canneries) Act 1971; the States Grants (Fruit-growing Reconstruction) Acts of 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1976; the Victoria Grant (Shepparton Preserving Company Limited) Act 1971; and the Wheat Industry Stabilization Fund (Disposal) Act 1962. The only significant changes will be made to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The present Plant Variety Rights Act does not recognise the practical difference between propagation from seed and the faster process of asexual reproduction. Asexual propagation of plants can take place from either cuttings or tissue culture and reproduction is much faster via this method than it is through the sexual propagation of plants from seeds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment, people can buy a few protected plants and asexually propagate dozens or even hundreds of plants in a short time. While these plants cannot be sold, what they produce, such as flowers and fruit, can be sold. This amendment protects the holders of plant rights, by giving them the sole right either to asexually propagate their plants themselves or license others to do so for the purpose of using the produce commercially. The holder of the plant right will not be able to refuse a licence to asexually propagate for the commercial production of flowers, fruit or other products, unless the person refuses to comply with reasonable licence provisions. This does not affect the person who wants to asexually propagate plants for his or her own use, or even to give away, but it will prevent the sale of any of the plants' produce. That is the amendment to the Plant Variety Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 simply clarify the position that all late payers of milk fat levies, including State milk authorities, will be liable to 20 per cent interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Livestock Slaughter Levy Collection Act 1964 will allow the cost of collecting these funds to come from different funds. Currently, funds collected through livestock slaughter levies are allocated to more than one fund. This amendment will allow the industry to decide from which fund the cost of the actual levy collection will be paid. For example, the industry may want to pay the costs, or at least part of them, from the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> The next amendment is to the Tobacco Marketing Act 1965. This will change the name of the Australian Tobacco Board to the Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee. The new name of the Board will closely reflect its role of advising Ministers, on a Federal and State level, on prices and quotas and separates it from the other statutory authorities which actually handle and sell product. The Board administers the industry's stabilisation plan, which runs out in 1993. The Board is virtually a negotiating forum and has no role in the receipt, handling or sale of tobacco. These functions are carried out by the State marketing boards. Complementary State legislation is needed for the name change, so it will not become effective for six months in order to allow the States time to alter their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill repeals the States Grants (Fruit Canneries) Act 1976; the State Grants (Fruit-growing Reconstruction) Acts of 1972, 1973, 1974, 1976 and the Victoria Grant (Shepparton Preserving Company Limited) Act 1971. The Bills I have just referred to were introduced to provide some assistance at a time when there were dramatic adjustment problems in the canned fruit industry and, for that matter, the fresh fruit export industry, following the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) in the early 1970s. In fact, I made my maiden speech in this place on one of those Bills. Since then, exports of canned fruit have been cut by over 50 per cent, by not only the entry of the United Kingdom to the EEC but also the application of a common agricultural policy, particularly what is known as the Mediterranean policy, which provides considerable assistance for the growing and processing of deciduous canned fruits in countries such as Greece, Italy and now, more recently, Spain. Added to this is the external tariff which was subsequently placed on the imports of any canned fruit from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the canned fruit industry, in its very heavily rationalised and restructured form, is facing the loss of another market, the largest market for canned fruit, the Canadian market. It is our most profitable market with over $30m of exports. This loss is because the United States-Canada free trade agreement, which came into effect on 1 January, will give, over a period of time, preference to Californian fruit or, perhaps more correctly, remove the old Canada-Australia Trade Agreement (CANATA) or Commonwealth preference, from Australian fruit. Since 1 January a 1 1/2 per cent preferential tariff has been put in place for United States fruit against Australian and that will increase over the years ahead until there is no advantage whatsoever for Australia, in theory. In fact there will be a disadvantage for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay considerable credit here to the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy), who has been arguing, and continues to argue, with his Canadian counterparts that the CANATA provisions should not be overruled by the United States-Canada agreement. He has been arguing that we have existing rights not only for canned fruit but also for a number of other products. In this case I am speaking about canned fruit because it is the product most affected and Canada is the biggest market following the substantial loss of the European market over the last 15 or 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I was here last week with a deputation from the canning fruit industry to see the Minister, who indicated at that time that he would be involving the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in representations to Mr Mulroney, his counterpart in Canada. I note that that is taking place and I commend the Minister for that action. I am concerned that it has taken this long for Ministers in addition to the Minister for Trade Negotiations to become involved in this very serious trade dispute, which not only has repercussions for canned fruit, sugar and so forth, but also is a precedent for the overriding of existing Australian bilateral trade agreements by new trade agreements which will no doubt come in in those countries with which we trade and have existing trade agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that pressure on the Canadians be maintained at the highest possible level. I include the Prime Minister, on a continuing basis; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). The last Minister was present at that deputation last week, together with Mr Duffy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another potential blow, or problem area, for primary producers, Australia's agricultural exporters, comes this week with a request by the United States Agricultural Secretary, Mr Clayton Yeutter, that Congress increase spending on the export enhancement program (EEP) to $US1.1 billion from the current level of $US750m. These are mind-boggling figures. The United States is prepared to back from its taxpayers the subsidised exports of United States agricultural products. That means that, in this coming year, Australian farmers will have to compete against United States subsidies to a level of $A1.3 billion. How can Australian farmers, without government subsidies-I am not arguing for government subsidies in Australia-be expected to trade in this type of corrupt world market?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr John Allwright, the National Farmers Federation President, together with the executive officer and director, Mr Rick Farley, who are now in the United States talking to United States officials, have indicated that not only is the United States preparing to play it tough in world agricultural trade, but also it will be at least two years before the United States itself allows any better access for Australian exports to that country, which are presently severely restricted. I refer, in particular, to beef and sugar. Despite the initial success of the Cairns Group in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round, the negotiations which have just concluded in Geneva, where the United States and the European Community said they would place a freeze on agricultural subsidies and come back with a plan next year to start to reduce this assistance the following year, there are obviously still problems ahead for our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend again the Minister for Trade Negotiations and Australian officials who have been involved in the very long and painful process of the GATT Uruguay Round and, for that matter, the Cairns Group and the concept of the Cairns Group, which has made a very positive impact on obtaining the hope for sense in world agricultural trade. However, there is a continuing danger for Australia. It is obviously a very fragile peace or truce or arrangement between the United States and Europeans at present. That is indicated on the one hand by the budget-the gunfire, if honourable members like-that the United States is lining up with its EEP subsidy, with which it would very quickly and very obviously take on the Europeans in any sort of trade war. Such a trade war would be to our obvious detriment because we would be caught in it, as we have been, for example, with wheat sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The Europeans themselves have been arguing-although I am pleased that I have not noticed that argument in the reporting of the agreement in Geneva in the last few days-that as part of the consideration of the reductions to be negotiated next year, their slow progress to a more sensible and commercial agricultural support policy which began in 1985 should be taken into account. That is an absurd proposition because it means that the Europeans who caused most of the trouble-they are not alone in this; the Americans played their part too-by building up to the peak in 1984 could now argue that because they are becoming somewhat more sensible that is a virtue, rather than merely a reduction in nonsensical behaviour, and therefore a plus for them in these discussions. We certainly cannot allow that ambit claim to be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States $1.1 billion EEP budget will mean that the United States, in pursuit of its trade goals, has the ability to export a range of agricultural products to world markets at much lower prices than Australia can, even though US farmers receive price assistance which means that they still produce products, particularly some types of grain, at above the world price. It is then sold at a dumped price against the rest of the world. For example, two very recent sales of wheat from the United States-one to China and the other to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics-were with EEP subsidies of $US21 and $US25 per tonne, which means an export subsidy and a reduction in the price of $A25 to $A30 per tonne, which is a reduction not only in the sense of those initial sales, but also in the average export price of all sales of wheat taking place, with ramifications for Australian farmers and our balance of trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I said earlier that Australian farmers are quite prepared and able, because of their efficiency, to compete against any country on a fair basis, I did not mean that when the United States and the Europeans subsidised their exports it was fair to expect our farmers to have to trade down to those corrupt world prices or to accept those corrupt world prices as the basis for our domestic market price. It calls into question the tactics of the Government in its international trade negotiations. I have certainly been genuinely commendatory in my acknowledgment of the work done by the Minister for Trade Negotiations in particular, but I call into question the tactics of the Government in reducing the distorting effects of agricultural support policies in other countries. Ahead of any real negotiations, Australia has already reduced its very modest level of assistance or tariff protection for a range of agricultural export industries when the Europeans and the Americans, who have far greater levels of assistance, as indicated by their export subsidies apart from their home support price systems, have not yielded anything. There will obviously be some very hard bargaining before they do. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now quite a dilemma for the Government because, on the one hand, the Government and our officials have to argue that we cannot accept the European claim that anything the Europeans have done since 1985 should be taken into account because of the greater commonsense in these support price systems, and on the other we will want to argue next year that other countries should take into account the reductions in a range of our tariff measures which, as I said, are already very modest measures and below those of manufacturing industry in Australia. To be consistent, we cannot argue that the changes that have taken place in Australia since 1986 should be taken into account in any consideration of reductions in assistance or protection in this country. The dilemma for the Government shows that its tactics have been wrong. It should not have done anything in this country until the other countries were prepared to negotiate. We should have put our proposals on the table at the same time as other countries. We could then have been completely clean or able to argue against the tactics of the Europeans in going back to 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Another industry that has been mentioned in this debate because of one or two Acts that are being amended is the dairy industry. It has also undergone dramatic change following the entry of the United Kingdom into the European Community and the subsequent EC price support programs. The dairy program was the major feature of the common agricultural policy for many years. That program or policy provided domestic prices in the European Community of over twice the world price. Once there is the level of artificial support, there is an inevitable explosion in production. We saw that with a range of products in Europe and with sugar, for example, in the United States, although sugar may not be a completely true example for other reasons. Because of the high prices, consumption decreased in Europe and export subsidies or restitutions were necessary to get rid of a surplus product, which was dumped, in many cases into our traditional export markets, taking away those markets and corrupting the world price. Now, 15 or 16 years after that situation began, less than half the former number of dairy farmers remain in Australia, and they are very efficient farmers. There is now some return to a genuine and more commercial market internationally for dairy products. This follows the more sensible policies that Europe is now following with regard to the dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, with the changes, we now face another potentially accelerated period of adjustment for the Australian dairy industry because the Government has accelerated the complete introduction of the closer economic relations arrangement with New Zealand. It was to have been completed in 1995; it was then to be in 1992; and it will now be in July 1990. It comes also at a time when the New Zealanders, who have had their butter quota to Europe reduced, have nevertheless been given a compensatory increase in price by a reduction, as I understand it, of the external tariff payable on that product entering Europe, so that the value of that reduced tonnage is much the same. Under the pooling arrangements for dairy products in New Zealand, the industry has a great ability to marginally price not only into third markets in competition with Australian dairy products, but also into the Australian market after July next year. This was compounded by the decision of this Government-and I believe it was a wrong decision-to allow the New Zealand Dairy Corporation to be the monopoly trader of New Zealand dairy products to Australia. I think that is a contradiction. If a free trade agreement is being established between Australia and New Zealand-that is, an extension of the domestic market from Australia to cover New Zealand and from New Zealand to cover Australia-and there are no monopoly arrangements in New Zealand, the monopoly arrangements of an exporter should not be allowed to prevail in Australia. That practice increases the marginal pricing power and other less than fair trading possibilities for the New Zealanders in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We already have one example of that before us at the moment. This is why it is so necessary for this Government to be more vigilant about fair trading arrangements with imports than it has been to date. I refer specifically to the decision to allow low fat dairy products from New Zealand to be sold in Australia. The introduction of low fat margarines and low fat butters is a positive step; it is sensible and it is what the consumer wants. Therefore the consumer should have these products. However, it is wrong to allow New Zealand low fat dairy products, such as butter, to be sold in Australia when it is not allowed to be sold in New Zealand and when as yet we have no food standard to allow it to be formally sold in Australia. Therefore, no Australian company is allowed to sell it. At the same time, Australia, which has developed dairy blends-that is, combinations of margarine, vegetable oils and butter to allow greater spreadability-is not allowed to sell those products in New Zealand. I think that a little bit of fairness is a good thing in a genuine closer economic relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> The current marketing arrangement, quite often called the Kerin plan-and I think some credit should be given to the Opposition because there is at least as much Opposition input into that final plan as positive input by the Minister-runs out in 1992. That plan provides some degree of stability to an industry in a period of rapid change and adjustment. I acknowledge the contribution of that plan, but I believe the industry deserves to have some acknowledgment from both the Government and the Opposition as to their policies for the dairy industry in this country after 1992. This will be a period of adjustment and pressure from New Zealand and the rest of the world if the trade negotiations break down. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties have a commitment to be prepared to discuss with the industry the continuation of appropriate arrangements beyond 1992 for the benefit of a world-efficient dairy industry in Australia. The Opposition parties do not oppose this legislation, but my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who is shadow Minister for science, will move an amendment in relation to the other section of this legislation which deals with minerals and energy rather than primary industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As explained by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 covers many aspects of the primary industry sector. He referred to the beef and tobacco industries, plant variety rights, and the fruit and canning industries. He also dwelt a little on the dairy industry. I am pleased that in general the Opposition is supporting the proposals put forward by the Government because these amendments are desirable. It will be interesting to see the argument put forward in favour of the Opposition's amendment. I support the amending legislation put forward by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to canvass another issue in this debate, however. Whilst all these matters are vital to those in the primary industries sector, there is another matter that is raising its head-I shall not suggest it is an ugly head, but it is one which is causing grave concern. The issue to which I refer is one that is affecting rural Australia particularly, but also provincial and metropolitan Australia. That is the issue of land being bought up by foreigners and the ultimate effect that this will have on all industries: the beef industry, the dairy industry-it goes right across the spectrum of the primary sector. I tried to get some up to date figures and I found it was very difficult. However, I am able to show that in Queensland alone in 1985-86 some $70m worth of purchases took place involving 685,000 hectares of land. This increased the next year to $36m worth of purchases involving another 215,000 hectares across Australia--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take your point, Mr Deputy Speaker, because had the member for Gippsland been here to listen to his own Deputy Leader he would have understood that he canvassed very widely-I think correctly-the Cairns Group and a number of international issues that really had no direct relevance to the Bill. As a member who represents a country area, I would suggest that what I have to say is of very great importance to the honourable member's constituents as it is to mine. It relates to the beef industry and the dairy industry which are covered by the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not dwell on the figures I have except to say that in 1985-86 some $44m was spent across Australia and 3.1 million hectares were purchased by foreign interests. In 1986-87 this grew to $143m worth of purchases involving another half a million hectares. In 1983 5.9 per cent of Australia was owned by foreigners. There are some claims now that that has risen to some 10 per cent. There is a real concern and that concern is widespread. Sometimes it is based on misinformation; sometimes it is based on a threat to the livelihood of young farmers who are saying, `As these foreign interests come into our country, they will pay top prices for land and, as a young person, I will never be able to start my own property or have my own farm'. That concern goes right across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In my area the Cattlemen's Union of Australia has mixed attitudes to this. It has been monitoring very closely foreign investment and whilst it has stated that it is not opposed to this, it is concerned about investment that results in domination of any industry-again I refer to the Bill because this does relate to the beef industry in part. The concern of the Cattlemen's Union relates to the domination of the beef industry. Other industry leaders have expressed reservations where the investors are developing an ability to exert undue market power. If one talks to the average Australian one realises that this is an issue; in fact it may be the most significant sleeper issue in the political arena at this moment. It is being aroused, regrettably, by people who have racist tendencies. Some people are targetting, for whatever reason, the Japanese. Others are simply pursuing the issue because they take a pro nationalistic stance and I can understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a political issue in my own State of Queensland for a long time. When I held the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Queensland Parliament, it was part of our policy to set up a land register. I note that Mike Ahern has now acted correctly to set up a land register. As honourable members know, Mike Ahern is a National Party member, but he has seen the need, as have the beef industry and others linked with agricultural industries across this nation, to monitor land ownership. I sometimes smile at what Mr Ahern is trying to do in view of the conflict and contrast that exists in this House where his counterparts in the National Party are locked into a Liberal Party policy which will do away with the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) if the coalition ever gets into power. It must create some interesting times in the National's party room when this issue is raised by the member for Gippsland who, no doubt, would want to protect land in his electorate. The Liberals tend to pursue an open gate policy. I worry about this because it will be an open gate policy irrespective of the consequences; an open gate policy in tourism, in commercial investment, in any aspects of land, in the domestic real estate area and in the primary industries area, in particular. Whilst on the one hand Federal National Party members in Queensland are saying that they are concerned about this issue, on the other hand they are locked into the coalition position. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Australian people have the right to know the extent of foreign ownership in this country. They have a right to know how much substance there is in the claims that one hectare in every 10 hectares of land in this country is now owned by foreigners. We have a right to know how much of the real estate in our capital cities-the prime central real estate-is owned by foreign investors. The present Government has taken a reasonably positive approach here, in that it argues for a national interest measure. It is arguing for a community need measure. At the same time, there has been some deregulation under this Government and I believe members of the Government are raising the eyebrow a little as to how far the deregulation will go. We hark back to Gough Whitlam's time, when his Government put down strict guidelines or rules for foreign investment, rules that said, `The test shall be in the national interest'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fear I have here, and it is echoed across the nation, is that the test is no longer to be in the national interest; instead, it is not to be against the national interest. So it is a negative test. As long as something is not against the national interest it could be allowed. I suggest that that is getting very close to having no rules at all. I know that people who represent rural electorates are concerned and are starting to voice their concern. In the past, under the Australian Labor Party in 1972-74, there was the need for local equity, Australian equity. That has been very much cast aside, with the main exception of the mineral industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy, as I said, is to encourage foreign investment at the moment, and there is an economic need for that. It is stressing the national interest aspect. It is arguing that it must be consistent with the needs of the community and it is looking at issues one by one. Honourable members may realise that there is a requirement for a compulsory review of any proposal which directly involves a foreign power. So if a foreign government or its agency is involved in some purchase plan or investment plan, it is compelled to go before the FIRB and be reviewed. This also is true with some foreign takeovers and other already foreign-owned companies, land or projects in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The general threshold of review has been raised. In the agricultural area it is only $3m, which means that anything under $3m does not have to go before the Board. In manufacturing the threshold is $5m and in some mineral areas and for some new agricultural products it is now $10m. I suggest that a lot of properties throughout this nation could be bought for less than $3m and a lot of manufacturing firms could be bought for less than $5m. In fact, it is on the record that that is happening. Abattoirs have been purchased. Whilst I appreciate that the equity test still exists in the mineral industry and whilst I appreciate that we as a government, through the initiatives of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) last year, moved to prohibit investment in established residential property, I suggest to the Government, as a member of that Government, that we are not monitoring enough or, in turn, have not explained what we are doing. So often people out there in the constituencies misunderstand because of the lack of information being provided by the decision makers. I certainly think that is happening here. </PARA>
<PARA> That places a responsibility on me as a member of Parliament to ensure that people know. One of the reasons I welcome the chance to speak here is that people will know that something is being done. In fact, at the beef industry level, the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Council-a policy council-has set up a working group on foreign investment. It is looking for a long term strategy. It is taking a very objective look at the meat industry, and whilst this is a specialist study, I would suggest that it is going to have ramifications that will spread right across the market-place and across our nation. Also-and I am pleased with this-the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is monitoring all the applications before the FIRB. I believe most honourable members would welcome this. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, we have an increased threshold. We now have the $3m, $5m and $10m marks. Regrettably, the local equity content requirement is being gradually dissipated. Regrettably, the national interest test is now a negative one. I think because of that and because of the moves that are taking place and the pressure that is coming on our government from commercial interest groups and those very involved in the economy, we as members of Parliament and as Australians must ensure that the changes are in the interests of this country. I know that Australia is not a saving country. We rely heavily on overseas investment. We rely enormously on the ability to borrow overseas. I appreciate that there is a need for new capital. There is a need for upgrading our industries; there is a need for new plant and equipment; there is a need for the transfer of new technology, and there is a need for a link between the end users and ourselves as the producers. There is a need for all these things. At the same time there is a misunderstanding or concern in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1987 five Australian abattoirs have been purchased, in this instance by Japanese interests, and they range in every State. Abattoirs in Tasmania and Victoria are linked with the Gilbertson group. We have another one in New South Wales and some in Queensland. People are worried because they see vertical integration and vertical take- overs. People are concerned that foreigners will own the grazing land; that they will then own the feedlots; that they will then own the abattoirs; and that, because of their foreign links in the market as the end users, they will have an enormous say as to the price and return in dollar terms to this country. On the other side of the story there are some very valuable advantages. In the Gilbertson group in Victoria and Tasmania, where the company Itoman has taken a 40 per cent share, there has been a diversification in the industry, and it is now tapping other markets. A new trade link has been established in Japan. I am pleased that at least there has been a retention of Australian ownership in that case. But in the Oakey case in my own State of Queensland, Nippon-Hand now owns 100 per cent of that abattoir. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate again that the abattoir is moving into the high quality lot fed beef market. It is able to compete with the United States of America. It is very important to us to be able to sell our meat, but I question whether the real return that this country is getting from Oakey is only a few jobs. If that is the case, one must question whether it meets the community need. Is that in the national interest? The Macksville abattoir in New South Wales is a different matter. The Midco abattoir there has been purchased by a consortium of Mitsubishi and Hannan. There is new plant and new technology. The company was going bankrupt. It was in receivership. Now it is majority owned by the Japanese but the abattoir is fully operational and is a major regional employer. There are massive work force gains there and an industry that was dying, or almost dead, has been retrieved and revived. </PARA>
<PARA> In Kilcoy in Queensland there is another approach-a joint venture with an Australian company and three Japanese companies, notably the firm Nozaki, which is a specialist meat importer and marketer. There is value here in that Nozaki is opening up and expanding the markets. It is also establishing large-scale feedlots to meet the Japanese standards. Again there are some pluses. In the Forbes works in New South Wales, the Lachley Valley abattoir was council-owned and was non-viable, but it has been totally re-established with new technology. It is totally owned by Mitsubishi and Hannan. Here again the local authority has kept a hand in the abattoir because it owns the land. </PARA>
<PARA> I have presented five cases to the House, some of which have massive advantages to Australia, of an industry that was almost dead having been revived; another instance where the abattoir is still Australian-owned; and another one where there is a joint venture. We need to tell the Australian-people that foreign investment can have major advantages, but we have to explain them and ensure that the national benefits are there. </PARA>
<PARA> Most people know that no Australian can go to Japan and buy one inch of land. One just cannot go to Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand and buy land. For that reason I personally advocate that we should not have freehold land sales. If foreigners are to come into this country and purchase land, let it be on a leasehold basis. Let the Government at least protect the title of that land so that we can set down conditions and control the use of the land at the State government level. There are many advantages in foreign investment, as I said, and I acknowledge that, but I believe that as a nation we ought to be pushing for or urging joint ventures. We ought to ensure that there is equity investment. We ought to frown on those proposals that are being set up by private enterprise here which are foreign owned and where the money is being borrowed offshore. In the long term that process has negative economic consequences for this nation in terms of our national account. Whilst these, I suppose, can be weighed up with the new skills, the new technology and the technology transfer that takes place, we have to continue to monitor. We have to ensure that there are no collusive activities taking place in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> We have to be wary of the monopoly that can develop in certain industries whereby an undue influence can be exerted in terms of market power. I appreciate that fortunately in this country with the Labor Government in power, we have the Trade Practices Commission. I would be very concerned if certain members of the Liberal Party got their way and did away with the Trade Practices Commission because within the terms of the Trade Practices Act we have powers to stop the monopolistic activities of foreign companies or, in fact, any company. We have the powers to stop collusive activity. Let us hope that that never takes place, irrespective of who is in government in this country. There has been a winding down of the activities of the Foreign Investment Review Board because the thresholds are being raised. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I make a few specific points. We ought to throw out the negative test-that is, get rid of the requirement that is being placed on companies to show only that what they are doing is not against the nation's interest; that as long as it is not against the nation's interest it is okay. That is a twisted, difficult to understand, negative test. I believe the test should be that investment shall be in the interest of the nation-not that someone has to prove that it is against the nation's interest: it must positively be in our nation's interest. If that is the case, new technology and its transfer, the upgrading of equipment, new skills, new markets, the end user links and new investment will all come to the fore. I do not want to frighten away valuable foreign investment, but I would argue over and over again the need for an effective monitoring system to monitor the degree and characteristics of foreign investment both in primary industry and manufacturing. There is a need for in-depth and ongoing analysis of the proposals to ensure that this national interest measure prevails. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a need to try to do something to maintain the family farms. That is important because people are moving away from country areas because the family farms have been bought by corporations. Our nation's strength has been small business people, the small farmer. Yet if we continue to allow companies to move in, with massive foreign investment behind them, the family farmer will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to canvass these issues. They are important to every Australian, regardless of his or her political persuasion, to ensure that this country is run in the interests of every Australian. I fear that unless we continue to monitor very carefully the quality, degree and character of investment moving into this country-in many instances it is encouraged and welcomed-we will be the long term losers. </PARA>

<PARA> Later I shall move an amendment, which has been circulated in my name, which, if carried, will ensure that the fees that are set by regulation rather than, as previously, by amendment to the principal Acts do not exceed the minimum administrative costs incurred by the Commonwealth, the States or the Northern Territory in carrying out their respective obligations under the legislation. I believe that an amendment of this order will ensure that the discretionary power vested in the Minister will not become an instrument for raising revenue, nor in any way discourage the petroleum exploration industry from expanding its exploration efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make some comments about the battle for energy security in Australia. By 1998 we will be paying 10 times the present shortfall between crude oil imports and exports. This will amount to an annual bill of $5 1/2 billion for imported oil. This is a result of our level of crude oil self-sufficiency dropping from the 1985-86 level of 96 per cent to only 28 per cent by the year 2000. Yet even those figures have a conservative base to them. They assume that the per barrel price is settled at about $US20. That cannot be anticipated, given the fragility of the economic environment in which oil producers operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at four such variables which may very well mean that the price is not constant at $US20 per barrel. Firstly, exchange rates vary widely. Secondly, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will strengthen its grip on the international oil market in the 1990s with the probable impact of an increase in oil prices. Thirdly, growth rates and, therefore, energy demand, especially in the transport sector, could outstrip our expectations. Fourthly, rates of recovery of oil reserves are affected adversely by high interest rates which compromise investment strategy. So if by the year 2000 we are paying only $5 1/2 billion for imported oil, we shall be very fortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite possibly we may never close the gulf that is opening between oil imports and exports. But an intelligent energy policy can work to contain the blow-out in oil imports. The oil reserves are there. The innovative and efficient petroleum industry is there. What is not there, however, is the government policy to provide producers with the incentive and motivation to maximise their exploration efforts. As with its approach to so many other areas of its industry policy, the Labor Government has mortgaged the future of this country for its own short term political goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1982 and 1987 the Commonwealth extracted from the domestic oil industry some $18 billion in oil and liquefied petroleum gas excise and resource rent royalties alone. It is so dependent on the revenue from our oil industry that it cannot bring itself to provide relief to encourage exploration so that in future Australia can be more self-reliant in oil. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has saddled the petroleum industry with an oppressive, secondary taxation regime which saps the industry of its investment capital-investment capital which in other circumstances would provide for greater exploration activity. I will say this many times during my address to this House this evening, as I have on other occasions: exploration activity is dependent on the level of government taxation of the oil industry. Even with some tinkering with the excise charge structure last year, the Bass Strait operators-Esso and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-effectively are paying the Government a tax rate of 82 per cent on their net revenues from Bass Strait gas and oil. That is grossly inequitable and, given Australia's longer term needs, it is a disastrous policy miscalculation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to win the battle for energy security and economic stability, it is essential to encourage the industry to further its exploration efforts. If we are to retain just 50 per cent self-sufficiency in the 1990s, we will have to double our current level of discovery. In actual fact, at the present rate we will be down to 28 per cent self-sufficiency in oil by the year 2000. Maybe it is too much to expect the general public to understand fully the implications of that dependence on oil imports, but there is no excuse of any kind for a responsible government, with all its access to information, ignoring the increased dependence on oil imports. Why is the Government so paralysed that it is unable to provide the incentives for further exploration for oil in Australia? The answer is as simple as it is tragic. It is so dependent on taxation from the oil industry that it cannot see beyond the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, the future standard of living of all Australians is being held hostage to this Government's expediency. We simply have to promote domestic prospectivity. More reserves exist in Bass Strait. It is only the Government's taxing regime which treats that area as a dry basin in terms of prospectivity. Indeed, the secondary taxation policy of the Government basically writes off the prospectivity of huge areas, both on-shore and off-shore, which have not even been marginally explored as yet. There is oil on and off shore in Australia. The simple fact is that nobody has any incentive to go exploring for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these facts, it is even more appalling that as every year slips by our growing energy dependence on foreign oil producers becomes even more apparent. In 1989 the production level from proven and producing fields returned Australia 564,370 barrels per day. In 1991 that will drop to 447,900 barrels per day. In 1995 it will drop further to 261,540 barrels per day. In 1998, at the end of the decade, we will be producing in Australia a mere 178,890 barrels per day. In more general terms, while we currently produce some 200 million barrels of crude oil a year, we need to import only some 25 million barrels a year. In 1993 we will produce only 120 million barrels. We will need to import 125 million barrels. Yet in 1998 our domestic industry-in the policy framework of the present Government-will be able to produce only 74 million barrels of crude oil. At this point we will be importing over 200 million barrels of crude oil per year. It is at that time that we will be at our most vulnerable. The impact on our balance of payments will be devastating. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of these developments the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), who fully acknowledges our deteriorating import profile, has taken no serious measures to boost domestic exploration rates. He, like his colleagues in the Government, is complacent. He contends that the commodity prices for the energy and minerals sector will reach such a level in the 1990s that they will offset the $5 1/2 billion that we will be paying out for oil imports. Can honourable members honestly believe that a Minister for resources in Australia would be so naive and, frankly, so stupid as to believe that our $5 1/2 billion import bill by the year 2000 will be met by increased commodity prices for all of our other mineral exports? It is such a gamble. Even if it were to come about, it is such a risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a claim by the Minister on behalf of the Government assumes a favourable economic environment based on stable international growth rates and favourable exchange rates. Even assuming that our future import bills could be offset by other tradeable energy commodities-by the way, will this include uranium?-what strategy is there for this national prosperity? Where is the strategy? How can the Government dismiss the problem of declining oil self-sufficiency by pretending that our mineral extracts sales in 15 years' time will offset the import bill? We cannot reduce it to one sentence. Where is the proof of that? Where is the structured policy?</PARA>
<PARA> The lunacy of this situation is not lost on the rest of the world. The international and independent consultancy firm Petroconsultants observed in its newsletter of 3 April 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>Petroleum exploration and production in Australia must not continue to be treated as non-strategic . . . There are serious economic flaws in treating local crude as another commodity which, when deficient in future supply, will simply be bought on open markets, imported and paid via use of surpluses generated from non-oil resources and export development. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Minister's complacency extends even further still. He is exposed to advice within his Department that claims the impact of the pending $5 1/2 billion annual import bill will have little direct impact on our economic development generally. It is almost hard to believe that such advice would be given to the Minister. This claim emanates from public statements from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Rural Economics (ABARE), which argues that there:</PARA>
<PARA>is no obvious link between levels of self-sufficiency (of crude oil supply) and national economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA>We have ABARE telling the Government that there is no linkage between economic performance and oil self-sufficiency. It is an extraordinary claim and one which even a first year economics student at secondary school would reject. To justify its claim the Bureau makes recourse to the examples of the economies of West Germany and Japan. By the way, in case it has been missed by the Bureau, those countries have no natural crude oil reserves at all. What parallel is there between Australia's economic context and the economic context of West Germany and Japan? Japan enjoyed almost a $90 billion trade surplus in 1987. Australia presently suffers under a $120 billion foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the Minister nor his sources of advice betray any active interest in taking any special policy initiatives to extend the life of our crude oil reserves and limit the impact of the pending balance of payments blow-out. It is quite the opposite. Government policies have served to cripple the oil producers, whose exploration efforts are threatened as a consequence. The industry has struggled under adverse economic conditions for a lengthy period of time. It has struggled to maintain its exploration and production efforts at a time of very low average annual oil prices. It has struggled in a hostile macro-economic setting of rising Australian-United States exchange rates on top of depressed prices. </PARA>
<PARA> From August 1987 to October 1988 world oil prices fell by 39 per cent. In Australian dollar terms they fell by 47 per cent. Stronger world prices have been offset by the appreciation of the Australian dollar over the past year or so. As a consequence, the vast bulk of the smaller scale producers, such as Santos Ltd, have recorded sales revenue losses of up to 30 per cent in the past year. These problems have been compounded by the high interest rates and rising levels of inflation which have undermined investment strategy, as they have for all businesses in Australia. It is these problems which have led the industry to resort to costly shut-downs which have so far cost the Government $70m in lost export income as well as lost import replacement income. Approximately 65,000 barrels of crude oil production per day were locked in on the Cobia and Flounder fields in Bass Strait between September 1988 and January of this year as it was simply, and understandably, uneconomic to continue production. The Government's proposal to make adjustments to the top rates of marginal excise at that time in order to retain a continued revenue flow did not expand the capital requirements of the industry, nor meet the deeper problems which bedevil the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the onerous secondary taxation burden, the industry also labours under an extremely high cost structure which threatens exploration rates. It costs the domestic industry $6m to drill an average depth off-shore well. In the United States the same well costs only $1 1/2m. Similarly, on-shore wells are three times as expensive to drill in Australia than they are in the United States. In addition, labour costs and work practices contribute considerably to the comparative cost disadvantage of oil exploration in Australia. The enormous add-on cost imposed by work practices on the wharves, such as those in the ports of Melbourne and Westernport Bay, as well as the ineffective industrial system, which is meant to regulate union conduct, have stifled the productivity of the oil production industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we have witnessed the multimillion dollar losses incurred by Esso-BHP as a result of work bans by wharf linesmen who earn $60 an hour. The strike action cost the industry between $10m and $15m. In another case in recent weeks the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union brought work on a construction barge in Bass Strait to a standstill while it negotiated, in breach of its agreements, a $7,000 lump sum payment for five casual welders who had been employed-wait for it-for only 11 days. Eleven days work is involved and the union thinks that those men are entitled to a $7,000 lump sum payment. That strike cost the joint operators over $4m. The industry is calling out for micro-economic reform: reform of work practices, reform of the industrial relation system as well as reform of the sheltered coastal shipping system, all of which threaten the long term viability of local producers. The impact of these problems for the continuation of domestic exploration efforts by the oil industry is already in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me summarise. This Government is abdicating its responsibilities in regard to oil self-sufficiency. It is a matter almost of bewilderment that it fails to take note of the looming disaster for this country by the end of the century. Time will pass quickly and by 1998 we will find ourselves producing only 28 per cent of our oil needs. We will require at least $5 1/2 billion in import costs to make up the remaining 78 per cent. Unless the Government fundamentally restructures its tax regime in regard to the oil industry there will not be any further or any successful exploration for oil, either onshore or offshore. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the view that fees and securities to be set by regulation in respect of petroleum exploration activities should never exceed the relevant minimum administrative costs incurred by the Commonwealth, the States or the Northern Territory in carrying out their respective obligations under the legislation'. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is designed to ensure that the Government does not set fees for petroleum exploration that exceed administrative costs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I am introducing the Bill pursuant to the Commonwealth's obligations under the cooperative companies and securities scheme. A detailed description of the provisions of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. For the benefit of honourable members, I will explain the role of this Bill in the context of the Commonwealth's own proposals to regulate companies and the securities and futures industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of this Bill in no way diminishes the Government's commitment to the passage and early implementation of the national corporations legislation. That legislation was passed by the House of Representatives in September last year and was introduced into the Senate on 14 October 1988. With the Government's support the legislation was referred to a Joint select committee of Parliament, which has been giving detailed consideration to the legislation in the light of comments from the public. The committee's report will be tabled in this Parliament shortly. The Government will be moving to give the report full consideration as a matter of the highest priority to enable the debate to proceed in the Senate on the Bills at an early stage. The Government is concerned to avoid any confusion or uncertainty which may occur through delay in proceeding with the Commonwealth's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, the Government has indicated its commitment to amending the existing cooperative scheme legislation in accordance with decisions of the Ministerial Council. It is important that the existing scheme of regulation, including provisions for the protection of investors, be maintained pending the commencement of the national legislation. The Bill I am introducing today represents part of that commitment. In accordance with the formal agreement governing the cooperative scheme, this Bill has been agreed to by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. If passed by this Parliament the Bill will, in addition to altering the law of the Australian Capital Territory, have the effect of automatically amending the corresponding legislation of the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Outline of Proposals</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions which will enable a company to repurchase its own shares in certain circumstances. The Ministerial Council released an exposure draft Bill in relation to this proposal in September 1988. Many valuable comments were made in submissions received from the public on the exposure draft Bill. The Ministerial Council responded to the public comments by making a number of significant amendments to the proposals. The Ministerial Council is now satisfied that the buy-back provisions in this Bill will enable companies to purchase their own shares without compromising the interests of shareholders and creditors. The Government will be giving consideration to the inclusion of corresponding amendments on buy-backs in the Corporations Bill after that Bill is passed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes important deregulatory proposals that are adopted from the national Corporations Bill. The licensing of representatives of securities and futures dealers and advisers will be discontinued as provided in the Corporations Bill. At the same time, securities and futures dealers and advisers will be given increased responsibility for the conduct of their representatives. Provisions have also been included to remove existing delays in the transfer and registration of securities occasioned by unnecessary procedures. The Bill gives legislative support for the pilot testing by the Australian Stock Exchange of a new share transfer and registration system known as the flexible accelerated security transfer system, or FAST. </PARA>
<PARA> Other provisions in the Bill enable the inspection of computer generated documents and resolve problems experienced by the corporate affairs commissions with the retrieval of information in annual returns. Importantly, the Bill contains the legislative basis for the new proposal to give the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) additional funding and support from the 1989-90 financial year. The Bill will enable charges to be made for the performance of certain functions by the NCSC and State corporate affairs commissions which more accurately reflect the actual resources devoted to those functions. I will now outline in greater detail some of the features of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Share Buy-backs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The reforms contained in this Bill which give companies a power to buy back their shares have their genesis in the report of the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee entitled A Company's Purchase of its own Shares, published in September 1987. The Australian business community has strongly argued for the removal of the current statutory prohibition on share buy-backs contained in section 129 of the Companies Act 1981 and for the introduction of a regime which permits greater flexibility in the arrangement of a company's capital structure, in line with procedures available under the law of other major overseas commercial centres such as the United States and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> In the development of these proposals, the Ministerial Council has been particularly concerned to ensure that shareholders and creditors are not exposed to some forms of abuse of share buy-back procedures which have been experienced in overseas jurisdictions. The exposure draft Bill attracted substantial comment from the business community which was taken into account by the Ministerial Council in reaching a settled position on the provisions in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this concern about possible abuse and because buy-backs are difficult activities to regulate, public companies generally have been confined to an aggregate 10 per cent annual limit on the amount of the share capital that can be reclaimed in any of the following ways:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Pari passu offers to shareholders on a proportional basis;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Selective purchases approved by a resolution of 75 per cent of the shareholders of the company, excluding the vendor shareholder, with an expert's opinion that the price is fair and reasonable; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) On-market purchases regulated by Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listing rules. </PARA>
<PARA>Strong representations were received supporting the use of on-market purchases and the Ministerial Council has decided to include provisions in the Bill allowing that method of self-purchase. The provisions will not be proclaimed until the ASX, in consultation with the NCSC, has devised listing rules which satisfy the Ministerial Council that shareholders will be given appropriate protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ministerial Council has been concerned about the use of interposed companies and cross-shareholdings to achieve `indirect' buy-backs. The Bill contains provisions to regulate such arrangements to ensure that they are not used to circumvent the buy-back provisions. At the same time, the Ministerial Council has responded to the concerns expressed by the business community that cross-shareholdings can be a common and legitimate commercial relationship between companies. Both concerns have been met in this Bill. Under the Bill, in addition to the procedures described above, companies will be permitted to hold a 10 per cent indirect interest in their own shares through cross-shareholding arrangements. However, over the 10 per cent threshold, it will be open to the NCSC to examine all the relevant factors of a particular arrangement and to intervene if it considers the cross-shareholding transaction is unacceptable. The Bill sets out the criteria for NCSC intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to submissions from business, the financial assistance validation procedure in section 129 (10) of the Companies Act will be retained to permit legitimate commercial usage. specific anti-avoidance provisions will be inserted to prevent the use of section 129 (10) for `backdoor' buy-backs. The Bill provides that the section 129 (10) validation procedure cannot operate if it os used for the purpose of avoiding the buy-back provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>FAST and Licensing of Investment Advisers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned above, the amendments to the Securities Industry Act 1980 relating to the simplification of the share transfer system-FAST-and the reform of the licensing system, adopt the corresponding initiatives that are presently contained in the Commonwealth's Corporations Bill. The FAST system will allow shares to be transferred without share certificates and without transfer signatures thus reducing the amount of paperwork and procedural steps in the share transfer process. At the same time, the protection already afforded investors by the national guarantee fund will be reinforced by extending protection to shareholders for any losses arising from unauthorised transfers. A limited number of companies representing a range of large and small listed companies will participate in a pilot scheme to be run by the Australian Stock Exchange. If successful, the pilot scheme is expected to lead to the full operation of FAST. The provisions facilitating the pilot scheme were exposed for public comment in December 1988. The provisions contained in this Bill have been slightly modified following public submissions and further discussions with the Australian Stock Exchange and representatives of the business community. The companies participating in the pilot scheme are to be commended for their willingness to participate in a somewhat costly program. If the pilot scheme is successful, the entire Australian community will benefit from a streamlined system for the transfer of securities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also introduces reforms to the existing securities and futures industry licensing systems that have been adopted from the Corporations Bill. The licensing of representatives of securities dealers and advisers and of futures brokers and advisers will be discontinued. To ensure that proper responsibility is taken for the activities of their representatives, dealers, brokers and advisers will be made more fully liable for the conduct of persons who are, in fact, their representatives. Securities dealers and advisers and futures brokers and advisers will still require a licence. The Bill, like the national corporations legislation, contains additional sanctions against persons who act as dealers, brokers or advisers without obtaining a licence. The Bill will enable clients of such persons to rescind agreements made with the unlicensed person, provided third party rights are not adversely affected, and to recover any commission paid to the unlicensed person. In addition, the NCSC will be given power to ban undesirable persons from acting as participants in the securities or futures industries. </PARA>
<PARA>Computerisation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Presently, the public searching of Corporate Affairs Commission records takes place by manual inspection of original documents or microfiche transparencies of those documents. The Bill contains amendments to enable the use of computer-generated documents, or the display of information on a visual display unit, to satisfy most, if not all, company searches. In conjunction with this proposal, it is proposed that, to save administrative costs, microfiche transparencies and original documents will no longer be made available for inspection. Section 31 of the Companies Act will be amended to give effect to this decision, which does not affect a person's right to obtain a certified copy of a document. A new section 31a will also be included in the Companies Act to clarify the rights of a person to inspect registers maintained by the Commission. At present the Act does not expressly provide that a person may inspect or search those registers. </PARA>
<PARA>Annual Return</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the Companies Act was amended to enable the NCSC to partly complete the annual return of a company using information kept on computer. The partly completed annual return would then be served on the company, which was expected to complete it and lodge it with the NCSC. Experience has shown that as many as 40 per cent of companies have preferred to disregard the returns served on them by the NCSC and, instead, prepare returns using their own computer or word processing facilities. The processing of such returns has caused problems for the NSCS-mainly because information is presented in a different format from that used by the NCSC-and it is proposed that section 263 be amended to require companies to complete the annual return served on them by the NCSC. </PARA>
<PARA>Funding of National Companies and Securities Commission</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Ministerial Council decided at its meeting on 2 March 1989 that the very necessary additional resources required by the NCSC should be funded through revised or increased fees in those areas where the actual cost of performing certain functions is not met by the fees presently able to be charged for those functions. For example, the current maximum fee chargeable for labour intensive functions such as the registration of prospectuses and take-over documents and the granting of applications for exemption from requirements is $1,000. The decision included targeting those parts of the business community that are the principal `users' of NCSC services, and imposing additional fees on the annual returns of listed corporations and on licence holders in the securities and futures industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the various cooperative scheme Fees Acts contained in this Bill will give effect to the decision of the Ministerial Council. The amendments to the various Fees Acts will permit the making of regulations prescribing the revised fees. The major changes include:</PARA>
<PARA>increasing the maximum amount that can be prescribed to $5,000;</PARA>
<PARA>enabling fees to be prescribed in terms other than monetary amounts-for example, percentages;</PARA>
<PARA>permitting more than one fee to be prescribed in respect of each matter;</PARA>
<PARA>imposing a limit of $25,000 on the size of the fee that can be charged for any one matter;</PARA>
<PARA>allowing the Commission to require payment of a deposit when the amount of a fee cannot be ascertained prior to carrying out the function; and</PARA>
<PARA>giving a power to prescribe a fee for supplying, or for other parties accessing, information kept on the Commission's computer. </PARA>
<PARA>Not all the increased fees will necessarily be directly related to the actual service provided. For example, a prospectus registration fee may be based on a proportion of the amount to be raised or an annual return fee may be based on the capitalisation of a listed corporation. Thus the amendments recognise there may be a taxation component to the fee. In accordance with usual Commonwealth parliamentary practice, the authority for imposing that part of any fee which includes an element of a tax will be contained in separate `fees: taxation component' Bills under each of the principal pieces of scheme legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends a number of other provisions in the Companies Act and makes extensive amendments to the Fees Act for each of the substantive pieces of cooperative scheme legislation. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and the four associated fees taxation component Bills. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Bill will greatly increase the amount of compensation available to victims of a maritime accident. Australia is currently party to the International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Seagoing Ships, 1957 and its 1979 Protocol. The Convention and Protocol, which are implemented by part VIIIa of the Navigation Act 1912, establish upper limits for claims arising from a maritime incident in which loss of life, personal injury or property damage occurs. In response to widespread concern that the limits set by the 1957 Convention were too low, in 1976 a diplomatic conference adopted the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims. This Convention entered into force internationally on 1 December 1986. Sixteen countries are now party to the Convention, including the United Kingdom, Japan, Liberia, the Scandinavian countries, France and the Federal Republic of Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will enable Australia to become a party to the 1976 Convention. The inadequacy of the 1957 Convention is demonstrated by the fact that the total amount of the compensation fund for claims involving an incident to a ship of 10,000 gross tonnage would be only about $3.22m. If there were 193 claimants-the number of people killed in the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster in 1987 in Belgium-the average amount per passenger would be $16,700. The equivalent figures for passenger claims under the 1976 Convention would be $39m and $202,000, a twelvefold increase. </PARA>
<PARA> At the seventy-fifth meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council in December 1987, Federal, State and Northern Territory Transport Ministers agreed that Australia should accede to the 1976 Convention. Article 6 of the Convention establishes upper limits for two types of claims: claims for loss of life or personal injury and property claims. These limits are expressed in units of account. A unit of account is the special drawing right of the International Monetary Fund. For personal claims, liability for claims concerning ships with tonnage not exceeding 500 tonnes is limited to 333,000 units of account, or about $520,000. For larger ships, further units of account are added for each tonne in excess of 500, on a sliding scale. Therefore, the limit for a ship of 10,000 gross tonnage would be 3,914,000 units of account or about $6.1m. </PARA>
<PARA> For property claims-that is, claims such as for damage to other ships, property or harbour works-the system of determining the upper limit is similar. The limit for a ship of 500 gross tonnage is 167,000 units of account or about $260,000; for a ship of 10,000 gross tonnage it is 1,753,500 units of account or about $2.7m. On top of this, article 7 of the 1976 Convention provides for the establishment of a separate fund for loss of life or personal injury to passengers. Here the shipowner's liability is limited to 46,666 units of account multiplied by the number of passengers the ship's certificate authorises it to carry to a maxiumum of 25 million units of account. Therefore, the maximum compensation available to passengers on the Abel Tasman would be about $39m. As a trade-off for the vastly increased amounts of compensation available, the Convention provides for a virtually unbreakable system of limiting liability. It declares that a person will be deprived of his ability to limit liability only if it is proved that the loss resulted from his personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such a loss, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss would probably result. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several other issues I should mention. First, unlike the 1957 Convention, the 1976 Convention does not permit State parties to exclude damage to harbour works, basins and waterways and aids to navigation from liability. However, parties are permitted to give such claims priority over other property claims in their national law. The Bill includes such a provision. Secondly, the Convention provides that a State party may regulate the system of limitation of liability to apply to ships intended for navigation on inland waterways or which are less than 300 gross tonnage. The Bill is to apply to all seagoing ships, of whatever size. The Bill also contains a savings clause, which will permit any valid State or Northern Territory law which may be passed to apply the Convention's provisions to ships coming within the legislative competence of that State or Territory to the exclusion of Commonwealth law. Thirdly, the Bill provides for the exclusion of limitation for claims in respect of salvage or wreck removal. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would mention that the Bill provides for commencement on a day to be fixed by proclamation. This is necessary to allow for Australia's accession to the 1976 Convention and denunciation of the 1957 Convention and 1979 Protocol to coincide with the commencement of the Act. When this Bill receives royal assent, the process for denunciation of the Convention and Protocol will be initiated. As the denunciation becomes effective one year after lodgment of the instrument with the depositary, I anticipate that this Bill will be proclaimed in the second half of 1990. The Bill therefore provides for proclamation to take place within 18 months of royal assent. I commend the Bill to the House. I understand that the explanatory memorandum has been delayed as a result of some printing problem. It will be circulated as soon as it is available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments proposed by the Government and to reject the amendment moved by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). In this debate I wish to cover a couple of subjects in relation to this omnibus Bill, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. The first issue I wish to raise is in relation to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. That Act, of course, gives the grantee of those rights the sole right to propagate and sell plants and reproductive material. However, it does not stop someone else from propagating the variety if he or she is going to sell the product of the plant, that is, fruit, cut flowers or grain but not the plants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment gives the breeder sole right to asexually propagate, or license others to asexually propagate, the variety for the commercial production of cut flowers, fruit and other products. Overseas countries and the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) Convention have included similar provisions in the plant variety rights (PVR) legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Several issues have been raised in relation to this amendment. The amendment itself is widely supported. There has been opposition from some consumer groups and groups opposed to PVR from its inception. The issues they have raised are not specifically related to this amendment and have already been examined by the Senate inquiry and the Lazenby Committee. There is no intention to cover sale of product. This will continue to be safeguarded by subsections 38 (1) (b) and (c). Civil liberties are protected by the consumer protection provisions in section 39 of the PVR Act and subsection 12 (3) of the amendment. The PVR Act does not apply to people who propagate and grow varieties in their own gardens for their own use, which is something we have heard much about for many years in the run up to the Plant Variety Rights legislation. It does not do that. If someone unwittingly sells a protected variety, for example at a fete, subsection 43 (3) of the Act protects him from liability for damages. </PARA>
<PARA> Without the amendment, breeders are putting a high price on the few plants they sell to the growers and the growers are trying to recover this up-front cost quickly before others gain access to the variety. Restricting the amendment to ornamentals is not justified as the development of, and access to, new horticultural varieties is important to Australian primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Other sections of the omnibus Bill relate to the dairy industry. We have heard comments from the Opposition in relation to that issue. The Act imposes levies on producers to provide funds for various reasons. The Dairy Produce Act 1986 provides for this liability to be passed onto purchasers of milk in line with industry practice. The Act imposes a penalty of 20 per cent per annum on those who do not pay the Commonwealth the milk fat levies when they become due. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the current provisions, sections 62 and 63 of the Act, are not precise enough to ensure that all purchasers, including State milk authorities, are liable for the late payment penalty, as was intended by the Act. Such a situation arose when the New South Wales Dairy Corporation refused to pay the levy on behalf of New South Wales producers during the interstate milk war with Victoria in 1987. Whilst the levy was eventually paid, the penalty was not. This debt to the Commonwealth was remitted by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) on the basis of legal advice that recovery might not be successful, given the imprecise wording of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment does not represent a change in existing policy. It merely clarifies the original intention of the Act that all persons responsible for paying the milk fat levies should also be liable to a penalty should they fail to pay the levies by the due date. The Minister retains the right, under section 67 of the Act, to remit the penalty where its imposition would prove to be anomalous or inequitable. There are no pending recovery actions awaiting the passage of the amending legislation. The Australian Dairy Industry Conference (ADIC), which includes the New South Wales dairy industry, supports the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am talking about the Dairy Produce Act 1986, it is of interest to look at what has occurred with the Kerin plan in relation to the dairy industry, a very important industry in my electorate of McMillan. It is also an important industry in the electorate of the honourable member for Gippsland, who today talked about the energy side of things and Bass Strait oil. In relation to the dairy industry, I would like to put a quote on record today from one of my local newspapers. This newspaper is produced in an area where, three years ago, when we were attempting to introduce these deregulatory reforms to the dairy industry, there was a very large meeting at Warragul, which was attended by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and by me. We were there to put the case on behalf of the Government. Many supporters of the Opposition parties, particularly the National Party, were present. They were doing their very best to destroy and break down those reforms which were coming forward. They even went to the extent of kicking in the side of the Minister's car as he attempted to leave the area. It was very heartening to see, on the front page of the local newspaper, the Warragul Gazette, this week a report by the manager of Allowrie's Drouin company, a company which has developed a factory in that area and has taken over one of the old cooperatives. The article reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The dairy industry is performing well bringing good times to both farmers and the wider community, according to Allowrie's Drouin manager, Dale Thompson. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Thompson made the comments yesterday while announcing a company price step up for farmers of 10 cents a kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the price would be paid on all manufactured milk supplied for the period July 1988 to the end of June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> `In line with the company's policy of paying the highest possible price up front, payment of the step up will be paid immediately and included with suppliers returns for March 1989 and paid on April 15,' Mr Thompson said. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Thompson said the overall industry was looking better than it was a year ago, with his company now paying prices about 30 per cent higher than at the same time last year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is further evidence that this Government's policies in relation to deregulation in that industry, and the efforts it has put into it, are certainly paying off. Mr Thompson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>`It all helps to put the price up in the domestic market . . . </PARA>
<PARA>`The season is only in April and we would expect our price to be in the order of $6.00 by the end of the year,' he said. Current price is $4.96 kg. Mr Thompson said the higher prices now being paid by suppliers was also helping local communities through flow on effects. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers were making capital and other improvements to their properties, buying new equipment and servicing loans which all helped with the local money supply, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very heartening to be able to stand in this House and report something like that to the Parliament, when one considers that our opponents on the Opposition benches, who for so long had the opportunity to make those deregulatory changes in those industries, failed to do so. They are still failing to produce policies anything like the deregulated approach sensibly put into place by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened intently to the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Gippsland, speaking about Bass Strait oil and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act and related subsidiary Acts. He talked strongly about the need to develop further wells in Bass Strait and the need to produce our own oil here in Australia. I agree with him, in that there is a great need for us to remain as self-sufficient in oil as we possibly can. He and I share a boundary between our electorates and we both have the same coastline, the Gippsland coast in Bass Strait, where the great bulk of Australia's oil is produced. That oil has been a boon to Australia for many years. Under the regulations imposed by previous governments, not by this Government, there has been oil production for a long time in Bass Strait. Australia has been able to reap the wealth of that oil, which has been produced very cheaply. Levies and excises have been imposed upon that oil production, to the extent that we have been able to have a very good road building program in this country. In fact the amount of money that has been produced from that area has been very significant in the development of our nation over the years. Current low world petrol and oil prices are good for Australia, but not to the extent that those prices can make it profitable for many exploration companies to drill lots of wells. That has to be taken into consideration. We will not be able to rely on oil from Bass Strait in the quantities we have been used to. As the honourable member for Gippsland said, there will be a reduction in the amount of oil that will be coming from there, and there is a need in Australia for the development of drilling and penetration into other areas in the search for oil. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me great pleasure today to support these omnibus amendments made by the Government. They tidy up measures in relation to many of the Acts that have been put in place by the Government. They revise and improve upon the policies that the Government has in place. I look forward to the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) tonight, when we will clearly be able to see the benefits of a hard row of five years of putting Australia back on its feet following the Government's inheritance of a substantial mess created by past Budget policies in Australia, coupled with a collapse in commodity prices during the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> As an article in my local newspaper said, we are now seeing an improvement in the rural sector. That improvement is feeding through to the rest of the community, and we look forward to tonight, when not just the rural sector will share in that improvement in income; some of it will be available to others in the nation who have also tightened their belts over the last four or five years to assist the economy of Australia. With those comments I support the amendments being made by the Government. I reject the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Gippsland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices (International Liner Cargo Shipping) Amendment Bill is an extremely complex and specialised Bill. It deals with trade practices legislation as it applies to what are colloquially known as shipping conferences. The Opposition will not oppose this legislation, although we will comment upon some aspects of it and will move a second reading amendment which draws attention to the failure of the Government to achieve any worthwhile progress in the area of micro-economic reform as it affects transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is about not only liner conferences, but also the Labor Government's in- ability to make tough decisions about the future of Australia's transport systems. This Bill, intended to make international liner cargo shipping more competitive, has been sitting around on the drawing boards and drafting tables of this Government since 1984. It should be held up as a symbol of the Government's inability to seriously pursue a program of structural reform. The very fact that it has taken that long to get the Bill to the House, and it is in such a condition now it is here, indicates the Government's capacity to address these issues. As I said, the Bill has come to this place late, and does not do all the things it could or should do to make international liner cargo shipping more competitive. It has been badly drafted, and I believe that later on in this debate we will see a series of Government amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's rhetoric on micro- economic reform is really so many hollow words. Following the 1987 election the Treasurer (Mr Keating) took control of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) from Senator Button, and proclaimed that micro-economic reform would be the main game for the Hawke Government's third term of office. In macro-economic policy the Government has addressed questions relating to the banking and financial system, as well as the Australian dollar. These measures have exposed Australia to greater international competition and, in so doing, forced Australian business to compete internationally. The economy has benefited greatly from some of these policies, but most were introduced during the first two years of the Hawke Government's six years in office. Since then the Government has rested on its laurels and done precious little. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed to maintain the momentum of economic reform at a time when it is vitally important that the structure of Australian industry change so that we can maintain our international economic position and our relative wealth. Anyone who is aware of the complaints of the Australian electorate at the present time will understand that our relative wealth is not being maintained and that, in fact, we are facing significant declines in real living standards. That is very much the responsibility of the Government for not addressing the problem and acting to minimise the impact of changing world circumstances on Australia and its people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, which is big on micro-economic reform rhetoric, has baulked and stumbled on restructuring the Australian economy when it has been confronted with broader inefficiencies. The most outstanding failure is the absence of reform in our transport systems. The Government has had a number of reports from the IAC and the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) identifying inefficiencies in rail, international shipping, ports, the waterfront and coastal shipping. Even last week we saw the latest report on coastal shipping from the Inter-State Commission. The immediate reaction from the unions was to veto the report and indicate that they would have nothing to do with it. Our friend Mr Kelty from the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) was supportive. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told the unions, `Don't worry about it, fellows. It is going to be pigeonholed'. We have even seen a member of this place from South Australia call on the Government to do nothing about the Inter-State Commission report. The dumping of the report shows the Government's attitude. It took two years of study and heaven only knows what it cost to produce. Regardless of the effort that was put into it by the people who work for the Commission and those in both sides of the industry, the Government has dumped the report because the trade unions did not like it, notwithstanding the cost of waterfront inefficiency to the entire Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC recently calculated that reforms in these areas could produce savings of approximately $3.2 billion in transport costs which would, in turn, increase Australia's gross domestic product by 2.3 per cent or $6 billion. By simply addressing the question of micro-economic reform we could achieve an increase in gross domestic product of 2.3 per cent or add to our total production in this country some $6 billion. That is a lot of money which would have a big impact on the relative standard of living of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Progress on implementing these reforms has been slow. That is an extremely generous description, as I would say that progress has been non-existent. The Government has dropped its plans to include, in tonight's statement from the Treasurer, a progress report on its micro-economic reforms simply because it has nothing to say. The only piece of legislation to which it could allude would be the one we are debating here which, as I have said, is flawed and will be amended at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the big picture which the Treasurer talks about so fondly from time to time, this is probably not even the artist's signature on the bottom right hand corner. The Treasurer will be giving tax cuts in his economic statement tonight, we are told, no doubt as a lead-up to an early election, but the fact remains that a 3 per cent tax cut could very easily come about if the Government lived up to its commitment to reform transport. The Government has neither the political courage nor the capacity to address these issues and to carry out its micro-economic reform. It will take an expedient approach, an economically irresponsible approach, and seek to buy votes in the most economically detrimental way possible-by simply giving tax cuts when the economy is in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that anyone who is in any way informed about the economic debate would deny the fact that our economy is in trouble. I refer anyone who wishes to debate this to those little summaries under the heading of `State of the Nation' which appear in some of the popular newspapers from time to time and ask him or her to consider the level of interest rates, our balance of payments deficit, the rate of inflation, the trend in inflation and the trend in unemployment. That person will come to the conclusion that Australia's economy is in trouble. The only people who are responsible for that are those who sit on the other side of the chamber. Although Government members would like to deny it, they have been governing this country for some six years. If one makes one's bed, one has to lie in it. Australia today is very much the product of the Hawke Labor Government and `the world's greatest Treasurer'-Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has noted that those nations which have pursued micro-economic reform have the best productivity performances and that has consequently led to higher real wages and higher profits. One of the real issues in the political debate today is the real level of wages in this country and the real standard of living. The OECD is pointing out that had this Government addressed those issues, achieved micro-economic reform and reaped the benefits that have been pointed to by the Industries Assistance Commission and the Economic Planning Advisory Council in terms of cost savings and growth in gross domestic product, there would have been a substantial increase in the real standard of living of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> The current account deficit has reached $11 billion for the first eight months of 1988-89. That is a 35 per cent deterioration on the same period last year. This deterioration has occurred despite an improvement of some 15 per cent in our terms of trade. The improvement in our terms of trade has little to do with government policy; it relates to international demand for products. It is the result of rises in world prices for agricultural and mineral commodities which, of course, are significant exports for Australia-they comprise about 70 per cent of our export earnings. Although Australia currently basks in record prices for most of its commodity exports it has not given a thought to the micro-economic reforms that are needed to sustain us through the 1990s. The Government seems to think, like Micawber, that something will turn up. It has squandered the opportunity presented by the commodity boom to address the structural problems in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's attitude is that everything is on track. The reality is that everything is not on track. Australia would be an economic basket case if it were not for the international boom in commodity prices. This boom has enabled the Government to pursue an ostrich policy on economic reform because such reform is just too hard for it to face. It means coming to grips, face to face, with its friends in the trade union movement and telling them in some particular industries that no-one has a place in the sun; that everyone has to work for a living and that one section of the trade union movement-and I cite particularly the waterfront and coastal shipping-has to work as hard for its income as any other section of that movement; that work practices must be addressed in all sections of the labour force; that they cannot just concentrate on the easy areas and ignore the hard ones because in ignoring the hard ones they will let the opportunity for maximum progress go by. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the time when this Government should be boosting production by reforming the economy and reforming labour markets. It should especially reform the transport sector. It should not wait until commodity prices drop. It should not wait for another seven lean years. It is amazing that a government, motivated by such blatantly political considerations, could let slip the opportunity to address a significant problem. This country now has a monthly current account deficit of $1,500m. This has occurred when things are good. What will be the size of that deficit if our trading position declines, there is a world recession and the demand for our primary products and mineral exports declines? What will our current account deficit be like in those circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA> Inflation is rising well beyond that of our major trading partners and interest rates are crippling. In fact, the interest bill for a small business has gone up about 30 per cent as a result of this Government's excessive concentration on monetary policies and the dollar is reaching the point of being uncompetitively high. The Treasurer tells us that interest rates could rise even more. Today in this place the Prime Minister was reluctant to be drawn on that question and I believe that he showed some embarrassment when reminded of his promise at the time of the Western Australian State election that interest rates would fall. Since then they have gone in only one direction-and that is straight up. Most of the financial community agrees that interest rates are likely to continue to rise for the foreseeable future, that there is no respite in sight for hard-pressed home buyers, small business or business in general. That, of course, affects the ability of the Australian economy to compete. If one is in competition with business overseas and one's interest rate costs are considerably higher than theirs, one will have problems. If one is considering going into a joint venture arrangement with, say, the Japanese in Australia and the cost of one's funds is 17, 18, 19 or even 20 per cent while the cost of funds to the foreign joint venturer is in single figures, one's ability to be an equal partner and contribute the necessary capital to maintain equity in that joint venture is that much diminished. The Government understands that but it is just not prepared to address the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is in the unique situation of demanding that its farmers and other exporters compete with the subsidised lunacy of the world market. I know that the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Mr Holding), who is at the table, shares my views that this is subsidised lunacy. At the same time it insists that the farmers use inefficient ports, inefficient rail systems, inefficient handling and processing sectors. All the while these farmers must pay heavy taxes on machinery in terms of tariffs, fuel-and taxes on fuel continue to rise-spare parts, steel and fertiliser. It is hardly a level playing field; it is exploiting the capacity of an industry to adjust; it is unfairly placing more pressure for adjustment on one sector of the economy than another. If Australia aspires to healthy economic progress in the 1990s it must begin supporting the exporters and the way to do that is to introduce the micro-economic reform that everybody, including this Government and the more rational members of its Ministry, knows that we desperately need to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> All the waterside and shipping rorts are possible because the Government has eliminated competition in these industries. Thus some shipping and stevedoring companies have been able to pass excess costs on to their business customers-that is, the shippers-and the costs are then passed on to taxpayers through lost export earnings. In other areas of the transport sector, the Government has failed to act. Increasing levels of tourism and consequently competition among international and domestic airlines is leading to the expansion of airline fleets. This year it is expected that Australia's airlines will spend $2 billion on new aircraft and associated costs in a move to meet the projected growth rates of the 1990s. By far the biggest buyer of new aircraft will be the national carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd, which has on order six new Boeing 747-400s and a Boeing 767-300. All those aircraft are due for delivery this calendar year. The approximate cost of the aircraft and associated equipment and spares is $1.62 billion. That represents a cost of $1.62 billion on Australia's current account deficit for this year. That amount would not be there if Qantas were allowed more flexibility and independence in determining and implementing its commercial and financial strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the simplest things this Government could do in terms of reforming the transport sector would be to move to address the capital inadequacies of its own airlines. There is a desperate need to provide extra capital for both Qantas and Australian Airlines but the Government cannot even address such a simple issue. Some sections of the Government know that now is the time to privatise the airlines, to float the capital, to extract the maximum share premium and to minimise the cost of capital to the airlines, but because of the objections of a section of the left wing of the Labor Party, nothing has been done. I alluded earlier to the estimated cost of transport inefficiencies. A recent Business Council of Australia (BCA) report on transport showed that reform would result in gross domestic product rising by some $6 billion or 2.3 per cent. The flow-on effect would be a rise in real consumption of 2 per cent; that is, an increase of 2 per cent in our standards of living. Employment would rise by 17,000 new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government prides itself on talking about its success in job creation, but today we saw an example of the truth of that claim. Most of the growth in employment in this country is a function of the growth in the population. The Minister for the Arts and Territories was generous enough to acknowledge that in his response to a question we put. Not only would there be 17,000 new jobs created, but investment would grow by some 4 per cent, real wages would rise by 2.5 per cent and the Government's surplus could increase by over $1 billion, which could be taken over the longer term as a 3 per cent cut in income tax. This is what the Government is making the Australian public forgo simply because it will not address the issues of reform in transport. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of this Government's credentials in deregulation, it is interesting to examine the case of Qantas. In the Government's reform package of May last year, an exercise similar to that to which the House is about to be treated tonight, the Government proposed further controls on Qantas-this is a deregulatory government-in particular in relation to industrial relations coordination, financial targets and the appointment of the company's chief executive. Since the 1984 guidelines for Qantas were agreed between the Qantas board and the then Minister for Transport, Qantas has been under the onerous terms of Loan Council control. Yet the Government has continued to claim responsibility for improving Qantas's flexibility and its ability to compete effectively. The Government has imposed the Loan Council on Qantas and restricted its ability to raise capital, forced it to rely on borrowings, and forced it to sell aircraft and lease them back, yet the Government keeps claiming-without any justification-that it has increased the airline's flexibility and its competitive capacity. I suggest that what has happened is the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's interference in Qantas's affairs has placed very serious impediments on the airline's flexibility and competitiveness. Qantas is suffering under the ineptitude of this Government to undertake the privatisation policy it came to government with. We know that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer are in favour of privatisation. Qantas has, in essence, been hijacked by the left wing of the Labor Party, which already holds this Government hostage because of its commitment to irrational and totally outmoded economic concepts and ideas. What afflicts Qantas and Australian Airlines also is the economic terrorism of a political minority that wields more power that its actual numbers should allow in a truly free and open society. If the Government is serious about micro-economic reform, and in particular about making Qantas flexible and competitive, it should immediately begin the privatisation of the airline, making its stock available to its employees and the Australian public. I would invite the Government to consider the Opposition's policy on this if it is bereft of ideas as to how to go about it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to examine the comments that have been made by the Chairman of Australian Airlines. Last year the Chairman of the airline, Mr Ted Harris-who is an eminent Australian, well known to the Prime Minister-recommended to this Government that it either inject some $240m into Australian Airlines over the next three years or seek private capital for the airline. The Government has chosen to ignore the comments of the Chairman and to do nothing. Of course, that will begin to show in time and it may have had some impact on the decision of the managing director to seek employment elsewhere. It will undoubtedly have an impact on the ability of the Government to attract the replacement chief executive officer. I was talking about what Mr Harris said. Let us see exactly what he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Full or partial ownership would need to be contemplated if the Government is not prepared to further invest in Australian or is not prepared to lift Government controls which inhibit managerial flexibility and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `to lift Government controls which inhibit managerial flexibility and effectiveness'. Importantly, those were the very words that were used in a report on Australian Airlines by an advisory group that included a number of Labor Party hopefuls like Mr Kelty and Mr Peter Redlich. The advisory group also included the then head of the Department of Transport and Communications, Dr Peter Wilenski. Significantly, this Government has been unable to follow the advice of the Secretary to the Department of Transport on airline privatisation. It has also been unable to listen to the heads of its airlines, Australian Airlines and Qantas. The words of Mr Harris have of course been echoed by Mr Leslie, the Chairman of Qantas. Nor has the Government been able to listen to the advice of pro-privatisation members of its own party or the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Since the Government has proved deaf to the advice of so many people and organisations, independent ones as well as those from its own camp, we need to ask just who has the ear of this Government and what its excuse is for no action. The answer is frightening, for it is not experts that the Government listens to; it is not economists; it is not departmental heads; it is not the chairman or the directors of the airlines; and it is not the management of the airlines: it is an ideological faction of its own party that even the majority of party members disagree with, but it is a faction with considerable power. It is part of the Labor Party's political trade-off. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter what price the Australian community is forced to pay, no matter what price Australian Airlines and Qantas are forced to pay, the Government will pursue its own factional deals and accommodations. It is about time this Government overcame the hysterical approach of the left wing and other internal opponents of privatisation and provided for the privatisation of 100 per cent of Qantas and also addressed the capital needs of Australian Airlines so that they have the necessary funds to enable them to compete effectively in the future. Privatisation of both airlines right now is the most rational and sensible thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> To privatise Australian Airlines after deregulation would be putting into the marketplace an airline with inadequate capitalisation to compete against a very dominant airline in the form of Ansett Airlines of Australia. The Australian Airlines advisory group last year said that the airline will be significantly weakened and commercially untenable once deregulation begins in 1990 if it cannot raise the extra capital it needs and if the Government does not ease the restrictions currently hampering its operations. That is my point exactly. The Government has been given that advice. That advice is accepted around the industry, yet the Government is not prepared to act. What is it trying to do-make sure that Australian Airlines remains the poor relation of the Australian air transport system? It has come down to the issue of either privatise or perish. This is the issue for the airlines, particularly in the case of Qantas. Qantas is under considerable market pressure and the Government just does not seem to recognise its moral obligation, if not its economic obligation, to at least allow the airline to compete with both hands, instead of having one hand, if not both, tied behind its back. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of funding the airlines, the question of micro-economic reform, is very much on the political agenda of this country at present. Hence the Bill that is before the House. The only answer that the Government has to micro-economic reform is an outdated, late, badly drafted piece of legislation addressing liner conferences. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) raises his eyebrows and queries why I say the legislation is badly drafted. As late as last Monday night Cabinet was considering whether it would move amendments to this Bill. If Cabinet had been concentrating on this issue, which began in 1984, one would think it would have got the question right and there would be no need for these last-minute amendments. But the consultation process undertaken by the Government has obviously been flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> The interests of the conferences have provided both the Government and the Opposition with briefings of their concerns, and some of those concerns have been accommodated in the amendments. The amendments put forward by the conferences have been designed to correct flaws in the legislation. At the committee stage it will be apparent to the House exactly where these flaws are and what superficial treatment the Government gave this legislation, because some of the corrections relate to the definitions of the issues and the matters that the legislation seeks to address. Once again I say that the Bill in itself is not particularly impressive when one remembers the length of time taken in its preparation. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the Opposition will not be opposing the Bill. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House regrets the fact that the Government has failed to achieve micro-economic reform in the transport sector, a matter of such vital importance to the Australian economy'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) canvassed a very broad range of issues with some apparent nexus to this legislation and I will respond to some of his points. The first and most fundamental point to make is that it is only since 1983 that there has been any overall framework, any medium to long term view, underpinning a significant and far-reaching structural change in the Australian economy. One can go through a number of areas of significant import in relation to those current and proposed changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first is the taxation system. The taxation system has been completely modernised and, in my submission, it puts Australian corporations and business in a much better position to respond to the challenges that they face currently. Personal income tax rates have also been reduced dramatically to boost incentive. Company tax rates have been slashed to match those elsewhere in the world. That factor is most significant and one that, unfortunately, some of our major corporations still tend to ignore when they seek to utilise tax havens around the world to forgo the payment of taxation which Australia has an entitlement to expect. The double taxation of company dividends has been abolished and, as a result, companies can more easily mobilise capital investment. That was an ongoing problem in Australia's postwar period. Tax cheats have finally been brought to account. </PARA>
<PARA> Right across the taxation policy spectrum there have been significant changes; indeed, I would submit, unprecedented changes. The end result is that the tax rort industry has been brought to account to a large extent. The tax loopholes and rorts that former governments appeared willing to countenance have been closed. There is now a greater acceptance of a moral dimension to the conduct of the taxation system. When I became a member of parliament in 1983 it was not uncommon to hear from people across all walks of life the argument, `Why should I pay tax when other people, by using technical devices and highly paid lawyers and accountants, avoid paying their fair share of taxation?'. Of course, it was the ordinary pay as you earn income earner who carried the burden. The Government has transformed that unacceptable circumstance to a system where now we have, I believe, one of the most efficient taxation systems in the world and one that takes account of issues such as equity and incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about macro-economic reforms, we must remember that this country's banking industry has been absolutely transformed to one where very few observers would say other than that there is a very high level of competition. Certainly there are some problems in that sector of the economy, but the competitive forces operating there are leading to the possibility of garnering greater levels of capital. In so doing, they make possible an increased export capacity in Australian industry. Import controls and tariffs have been progressively reduced and, therefore, have opened up Australian industry to the forces of international competition. Australians, if they have learnt nothing over the last few years, certainly understand that attempting to hide our manufacturing sector behind artificial tariff barriers and quotas leads, in the final analysis, to complacency and inefficiencies and, by definition, higher prices to Australian consumers. Specific programs have been adopted for the car industry, the steel industry and the heavy engineering sector to modernise Australia's industrial base, to make it more export orientated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the industrial relations arena, the accord has gone a great deal further than simply providing a basis for wage restraint. Of course, it has been described as a state of mind. In national wage cases in 1988 and 1989 the commitments to fundamental reviews of award structures to eliminate restrictive practices, encourage training and multiskilling and develop career paths, will go close to having their culmination in the House this evening. This link provides a vehicle for addressing a wide range of issues designed to improve flexibility and efficiency in the workplace and should be the high water mark in terms of micro-economic reform in this country's postwar period. It is a little hard to listen to Opposition members who have a highly developed sense of criticism. When we reflect on their time in office perhaps they will realise that very few, if any, of those areas were addressed. Some of the problems with which we are grappling currently have been compounded by those years of inactivity and the years of abdication of political and economic leadership in the postwar period, substantially under conservative governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Education has been one of the Government's great areas of reform and achievement. There have been massive changes. Retention rates have improved quite dramatically. They are still below those in comparable countries but they are moving very rapidly in the right direction. In my electorate in the western suburbs of Melbourne there has been a dramatic improvement in retention rates. For the first time ever, young working class kids have a realistic prospect of not only going through to complete their secondary education but, increasingly, having the opportunity presented to them to pursue formal tertiary studies. In that context I should take the opportunity of bringing to the House's attention a document put together by me and one of my State parliamentary colleagues in Victoria-a joint submission to the Federal-State working party on higher education in the western region-which canvasses some of the issues. I hope that in the next couple of weeks that will culminate in an in-principle decision to develop a university of technology in the western region of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Hawke Labor Government came to office in 1983 there were some compelling statistics. I had the benefit of hearing the many statistics cited by the honourable member for Richmond. It is worth reflecting on the fact that when we came to office the inflation rate was 11 per cent; the unemployment rate was over 10 per cent; and industrial disputation was chronically high, in an ongoing way. There are some instances, such as the contemporary issue of the air traffic controllers which has caused enormous dislocation and has been rightly condemned by government, of industrial disputation nowadays, but in those days there was a chronic and ongoing series of industrial disputes. As a result, Australia was very much at the top of the international comparative industrial disputation list. That situation has been turned absolutely on its head. The level of industrial disputation, with the exception of some isolated events, has decreased quite dramatically. Compared with 11 per cent inflation when we came to office, inflation is now around 7 per cent. An ingredient in that figure is the unprecedented level of house prices. It is open to legitimate debate as to whether and in what form house prices ought to be included in the consumer price index. Obviously, a review in relation to that is under way at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment figure in 1983 was well over 10 per cent. If that were discounted for the increased participation rate, that is, the number of women who are now entering the work force and who previously would have been staying at home, the actual unemployment figure would be around 3 per cent, which would go very close to being an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development record in terms of the turnaround over that period of time. One ought not to underestimate the import of those figures. If we are talking about an employment rate in excess of 10 per cent, that sounds well and good. It is a stark figure, a round figure and a memorable one. The important thing to reflect upon is what that figure means in terms of institutionalised misery. We have all heard of the misery index. We have to go back to the last years of the previous Government to see it reach its high point. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has an unprecedented record in terms of employment creation and employment growth. As I indicated, were that increased participation rate to be removed and were we to compare like with like, we would be comparing a figure of nearly 10 per cent at the end of the Fraser Government with a figure of some 3 per cent today, under the Hawke Labor Government. That, of itself, is one of the most significant records of this Government. In terms of fiscal policy, real Budget outlays-not the rhetoric, but the reality-will fall for the third year in succession. The Federal Budget will be in surplus for the second year in succession, with the public sector borrowing requirement retained at zero. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be stated that this degree of fiscal discipline is unmatched in the 35 years during which comparable records have been kept. Once again, it is the substitution of decisions and outcomes rather than the rhetoric we hear from the Opposition. It is an embarrassing record if we compare some of those statistics with its period in office. Obviously, domestic demand is now running well above the Budget forecast. That increased level of demand has resulted, of course, in a higher than anticipated import growth, but particularly in the import of capital goods. The Australian Bureau of Statistics private capital expenditure survey that I have available to me reaffirms strong investment growth last year. There is an expectation that that will continue. The survey showed real growth of 10 per cent in 1987-88, expected nominal growth of 17 per cent in 1988-89 and expected nominal growth of 28 per cent in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first half of 1988-89 the value of hotel and factory approvals increased by over 50 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. That is, of course, indicative of a massive increase in investment in our infrastructure. To take one example, the value of hotel approvals obviously is related to the dramatically increased number of tourists coming to this country. It is obviously putting our tourism industry on a footing to ensure that we can maximise our long term returns from that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Factory approvals are up by over 50 per cent. I do not need to remind the House what that means. It clearly means a revival across the spectrum of industry, and, perhaps most importantly, it means a revival in our manufacturing sector. Comparing the first seven months of this financial year with the same period last financial year, we find that imports of transport equipment, excluding road vehicles, rose by some 112 per cent. There was, of course, a blip there caused by the import of civil aircraft. But, even though that figure increased some threefold, obviously that is being done to facilitate the massively increased air traffic levels associated, once again, with the tourism boom. Previously booms in Australia have led to fiscal and wage blow-outs that inevitably not only shatter job opportunities-they usually lead to massive job shedding-but also, by definition, shatter business profitability and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the history of Australia, there is an ongoing theme-boom and bust; boom and bust. The boom has as an almost inevitable corollary a wage explosion. The end result of that is that the short term gain of a few extra dollars in the pocket means that inflation levels tend to go through the roof. All the other major economic indices turn nasty, with the end result of business bankruptcies and large scale unemployment. The difference here is that this Government has a wages policy that can get us through those periods of too great demand and has already done so on previous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that in the next few weeks and months the existence of a coherent wages policy will ensure that this Government, unlike any-I stress the word `any'-of its predecessors, should be able to ensure that the wage outcome is kept within realistic levels. Tonight, of course, the contribution by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in this House will go a long way towards articulating precisely what the Government intends doing in that area. It stands in absolutely stark contrast to the Opposition, which in this crucially important policy area is still yet to put a coherent policy package together. It is my submission that, even were it able to do so, it would be incapable of implementing it because of its attitude to the organised union movement in this country. This time, in addition to fiscal and wage responsibility, the investment surge to which I have referred will create a capacity to help alleviate our balance of payments constraint. In that context, the mistakes of the past, of previous conservative governments, will not be repeated. This Government has a strategy. It is probably the first government in the history of Federation, in a non-wartime context, to have a broad-ranging strategy encompassing those policy areas to which I have adverted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is being restructured. In 1986-87 and 1987-88 service exports rose in real terms by 9.5 per cent and 13.5 per cent respectively. Over the same years manufactured exports rose by 32.5 per cent and 9.4 per cent respectively. This restructuring is absolutely fundamental. It does not necessarily imply popularity from time to time, but equally it is absolutely essential and it is increasingly understood by Australians to be just that. </PARA>
<PARA> The continued program of micro-economic reform, plus our current investment boom and our fiscal and monetary policies, will see growth ease to sustainable levels and should see Australia well placed to deal with the challenges of the future. Across that whole range of policy areas we can be marked out as being quite different from the Opposition. First and foremost, we are prepared. That will become manifest over the next few weeks in relation to the Treasurer's contribution this evening and the subsequent contributions by supporting Ministers during the month of May. Clearly we are prepared to grapple with some of these hard issues. Clearly that is absolutely essential to the future of this country. Until the Opposition is prepared to come into this House with coherent policies and an overall framework, its rhetoric will be treated, as it has been in the past, as just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I speak on the Trade Practices (International Liner Cargo Shipping) Amendment Bill and the amendment I would like to agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), who said that there was a difference between his side of politics and the coalition parties. To that I would say, `Viva la difference'. May it always be so. On return to government we will have the mammoth task of reversing the trends which we have witnessed under the present Government-a government which has imposed on this country record levels of taxation never before experienced and which could not possibly have been foreseen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commensurate with those record levels of taxation we have seen spending of a degree not foreseeable even as far back as the years of the Fraser Government. Hand in hand with that has gone record trade deficits and balance of payments deficits which will provide a challenge to the incoming Howard Government-one I might assure the House that will be met, but not without some difficulty. On return to government we will maintain the difference between us and the Australian Labor Party and we will set about creating the circumstances in which record levels of interest can be reduced for the benefit of home owners, potential home owners and businesses throughout the land. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill deals with the application of trade practices legislation to the important function of the shipping of goods to and from Australia. It goes without saying that Australia is a significant trading nation and should be more significant in the future. The importance of shipping to that trade is clear, yet Australia is not a great shipping nation. Despite a number of fine harbours and large coastal cities, maritime transport, as it has developed in Australia, has been a burden to the efficiency of Australian trade rather than the comparative advantage which it should represent. </PARA>
<PARA> From the earliest days of the Australian colonies a lot of the sea traffic to and from Australia was naval rather than commercial. I have no doubt that this contributed to the development of a waterfront dominated by monopolies and mercantilist style exclusive rights rather than competition and commercial considerations. The spirit of mercantilism still pervades much of the Australian transport industry with special privileges given to government sanctioned carriers of goods such as grains. Also, there are tightly controlled craft unions dominating entry into the industry and excluding competitive labour as well as outdated legislation protecting the whole structure from direct outside competition. </PARA>
<PARA> As with much of Australia's protectionist past, these institutions are now being seriously challenged. In the air, the two-airline policy will soon end. On land, the State government enforced monopolies on rail transport are threatened with competition from efficient and competitive road transport. The big question facing government which is raised in this Bill is how the shipping industry, in all its many facets, will respond to the growing necessity for deregulation, lower costs and eventually open competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House deals with the consideration of one of the areas of a very complex Australian shipping industry. The conference system is a feature of liner shipping throughout the world. To the extent that these cartel-like conference arrangements can survive without the direct support of government, our legislation should not interfere unduly with those schemes. However, the Government should not actively support or protect these arrangements through the extension of privileges which are not universally available. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation offers a partial withdrawal of the special position enjoyed by liner conferences which maintains continuity with the present position and, hopefully, will improve the lot of Australian flag carriers in the future. The legislation does not address the reasons the conference arrangements might lead to the better provision of regular, competitive services to Australia than an open market would allow. Of course, one reason is that the Australian shipping market is so hampered by uncompetitive practices on the waterfront and in coastal shipping that the market for shipping transport, as a consequence, is less profitable and, to that extent, would be undersupplied. The unfortunate need for the conference system is intimately linked to the enormous local problems which Australia has on its waterfront. These issues are now at the forefront of political debate although they have been a cause of economic decline for a much longer period. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Labor Government now floundering as it tries to avoid the consequences of its inability to reform the productive sectors of the Australian economy, the reform of the waterfront has become a test case of the ability of this Government to achieve some micro-economic reform. The wider importance of the waterfront is that it encapsulates the deepest problems of the Australian economy. The rejuvenation of the Australian shipping industry is inextricably linked with an end to the industrial relations disaster which has reigned under the accord between this Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The waterfront is the textbook example of the failure of centralised wage fixing to produce either industrial harmony or economic benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be difficult to exaggerate the magnitude of the failure of government policy to deal with problems on the waterfront and with maritime industries generally. The Government has been held hostage by the vested interests of the powerful trade unions on the waterfront and in the maritime industries and by local carriers as well who are afraid of competition from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-volume conclusions and recommendations of the Inter-State Commission's waterfront investigation effectively illustrate the depth of the problems which the ISC sought to address. It is worth repeating the long list which the ISC gave of the `classic symptoms of an imperfect market', as represented by the present situation on the waterfront. They include ineffective management; poor work force training and career arrangements; introspective industrial attitudes; poor response to user needs; poor information flows to users and between links in the transport chain; lack of supply and demand balance often reflected in congestion and queues or in under-utilisation of expensive facilities; diffusion of governmental responsibility; abuse of monopoly power reflected particularly in port authority pricing and investment policies; and a tendency for matters to improve considerably while they are under investigation but to lapse once the pressure is removed. That report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> To this litany can be added high costs, endemic unreliability, a high level of industrial disputation, inappropriate manning levels and work practices, poor discipline, poor motivation throughout the industry, and a pervasive lack of competition. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) is excited about this debate as I can see that he is listening to it, although occasionally he is trying to stifle a yawn. When one adds that most port facilities are run by government authorities at one level or another, it is clear that the great industry which once formed the basis of the growth of free world trade and prosperity is, in Australia, a victim of government interventionism at almost every point in its development and operation. It is little wonder that international shipowners are unwilling to service Australia without the protection of the conference arrangements which presently exist. </PARA>

<PARA> Labor's record on the waterfront flies in the face of claims that it has improved industrial disputation and managed to prompt a restructuring of industry. The ISC criticisms of the waterfront reinforce what the Opposition has been saying for many years about the problems in industrial relations and those problems manifest themselves in a number of industries. The response of the Government to the ISC report will test the ability of the Government to resist the pressure of the powerful waterfront unions such as the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. The Waterside Workers Federation and the ACTU have already stated their opposition to the proposals of the ISC despite the significant support for workers which the report recommends. The only rational motive which the trade unions can have for opposing the recommendations offered by the ISC is to defend and preserve their own influence and power. Under its proposals the ISC wants to reduce the dominance of the Waterside Workers Federation through the renegotiation of awards, the introduction of new stand down provisions which allow employers to stand down workers as soon as industrial action makes further work impossible, and the encouragement of new workplace-based certified agreements. The suggested move to enterprise-based employment would reduce the hegemony of the industry-wide unions which currently do so much to hinder competition. Employees would directly benefit from a generous retirement and redundancy program funded by the Commonwealth, yet the ACTU and the Waterside Workers Federation resist. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also suggests that as many as 1,000 new employees should enter the industry. The maritime and waterfront unions are insistent on maintaining their power at the expense of everyone in Australia and, in particular, all those who are excluded from working on the waterfront by a classic exercise in labour market protection. It is worthwhile considering just how wide the effects of maritime transport are on the whole of Australian industry, the whole of our economy. Not only are our imports dearer and our exports less competitive, but those manufactured goods which use materials produced overseas or components made in other countries are also less competitive. The profits of primary producers are reduced as they bear the burden of shipping costs. </PARA>
<PARA> While coastal shipping remains so inefficient in Australia, a number of other economic distortions emerge. There are too many examples of how much cheaper it is to bring goods by sea from another country than to ship between ports within Australia. The legislation before us does not address these wider problems with the Australian shipping industry which provides the backdrop to the arrangements which we have for international liner shipping. In line with the related recommendations in the ISC report, this Bill seeks the wider application of trade practices legislation to maritime trade. This will go some small way to ensure competition between non-conference carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are some problems with the detail of the legislation and the way in which the Government is going about achieving what are acknowledged desirable goals. First, the Bill omits any precise definition of what a conference actually is. Given this omission, everything which follows must be somewhat uncertain. A `conference agreement' is only defined as an agreement between members of a conference, although it is acknowledged that all conference agreements will be registered and publicly available. We are, in fact, offering the protection of an agreement with a party or parties that are not all that well defined. Similarly, the definitions of market power for the application of trade practices legislation, and those in division 9 of this Bill, are not all that clear. Division 9 of the Bill deals with the power of the Minister and various other bodies over liner carriers which are not part of conference arrangements. It is in this context that the definition of substantial market power must be clarified. I hope the Minister can do this in his summing up. </PARA>
<PARA> I have one other problem with the way the Government has gone about setting up this legislation. It is probably in keeping with the Government's corporatist approach, but the Bill gives official negotiating recognition to a `designated peak shipper body' and designated secondary shipper bodies. This approach to arrangements with international ocean carriers is a long way from the market-based approach which would be ideal. It provides no incentives to move away from the cartel-like structures of the liner shipping industry. This Government's automatic reaction to any problem seems to be to set up a committee or an association and we will deal with them. It uses the terminology and structures of its trade union masters and failed industry plans to pile new responsibilities on employers and businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, this Bill is a step in the right direction as far as international liner shipping is concerned. It should by no means be seen as an end in itself since the conference system has helped allow Australia to avoid fixing up major problems with our hopelessly inefficient waterfront and maritime industries. It is essential to the future of Australian industry for the Government to achieve micro-economic reform in transportation. Unfortunately the Government is hindered in that task because it is beholden to the powers of the trade union interests as represented by the ACTU and as manifested in these industries. It is likely that genuine reform will have to await the impending victory of a coalition government under John Howard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the contributions of members of the Opposition to this debate, one might have thought that the idea of free and active competition was somehow a virtue that they have a monopoly on. Unfortunately monopolies were things which they were only too comfortable with during their long period of Government in the Menzies years. In fact, the whole attack on the rorts and the monopolies, the structure of industry and the overcentralisation of control by too few was brought about by Labor Party legislation. The Trade Practices Act, which was the first legislation brought in to smash monopolies, to break down cartelisation, to make sure that the market trades efficiently, was Labor legislation and the legislation that is coming in today, that gives us a better shake in the world trading area, to make sure that some of the inefficiencies that can be caused by too extreme cartelisation, is again Labor Party legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is one of the peculiarities that we are being continually berated by the rural socialists about issues of freeing up the waterfront and the like when honourable members opposite persist with romantic nostalgia about some of the worst kinds of rorts in the marketing of some rural products. It is a disgrace in terms of intellectual coherence that they can come in here blithely and speak slightly of the interests of the working people of this nation and yet put forward proposals which are a framework to protect inefficient rural enterprises, to socialise loss and to maximise private gain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is rigorously looking at competition and at micro-economic reform. Today we are dealing with international shipping. International shipping is an area of Australia's trade in which Australian carriers hold a only minority share, far too small a share in my view and, I am sure, in the view of many of my colleagues. Part of our response in the Bill is to protect the fledgling Australian shipping industry and to make sure that it is not pushed under by unfair competition. Provisions in the Bill make sure that the traders that can exert huge market influence on the international shipping sector, the major cartels, which are known in the shipping area as conferences, are not able to conduct secret agreements and hide behind the previous exemptions in the Trade Practices Act, protecting them from the scrutiny to which other sectors of the industry are subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have heard a huge beat-up about the waterfront. This Bill is a huge step forward for Australia in the international trading sector. The Government plainly has on its agenda micro-economic reform of the waterfront. It has reports before it and is studying them. We get from the Opposition a strange, perverted, backhanded compliment-one line in a speech that says `You might be doing something good in this Bill'-then a discussion ensues, entirely disconnected with the substance of the debate. Opposition speakers ramble on about anything that happens to cross their minds and do not focus on the crucial issue of international trade. </PARA>
<PARA> We see two significant reforms in this area. The most significant of those reforms is to take away some of the protections which the conferences, the cartels, the major shipping companies, working together have had. We recognise that, obviously, major shipping companies have to continue to play a significant part in world trade. They have great advantages in being able to offer reliable and predictable services, continuous scheduling, and a price basis that is attractive to Australia. In a sense we allow them to negotiate together in an uncompetitive way. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill we restrict, or take away, some of the uncompetitive elements and expose to public scrutiny any remaining elements that we permit. The Bill will mean that essentially our international trading position will be significantly more competitive. It will mean that the rorts and the ramps that have been hidden under the veneer of secrecy will be exposed to public scrutiny. As I think many regulators would say, sunlight is the best antiseptic. If one knows what is going on, very often the worst excesses do not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the naive statement that we should somehow not allow shippers, the people who are exporting from Australia, to try to exercise some kind of effective market power. The last speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), suggested that we should allow individual shippers only to negotiate with the huge conference shipping lines. What nonsense. That is not competition; that is a prescription for being screwed down every time one does a deal. That is a prescription for Australia losing to the world's shipping conferences. It is not a prescription for the growth of Australia's shipping fleet or for its expansion from about seven or nine per cent to a much higher and more sensible proportion of the shipping fleet being in Australian hands; it is a prescription for the Australian shipping industry to remain moribund and in the control of international cartels. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are important in principle. They are significant. One could hardly expect an opposition that is totally inconsistent in its approach to major issues such as trade practices, the protection of the freedom of trade and consumer protection come in here with a coherent response to this legislation. Let us consider the States which are still in the control of conservative governments. In many of those States there is no consumer protection, no legislation to make sure that the operation of the market is free and informed. The consumer magazine has continually rated some of the consumer affairs Ministers of those conservative States right at the bottom of the barrel. Time after time, the rorts and the ramps are defended by the Opposition when it suits its parochial interests-its local, regional, rural or secular interests. It focuses on those issues while the Government, in a methodical way, considers how best to deal with the realities of the world, how best to cope with the fact that Australia is a relatively small nation with major needs in terms of reliable shipping. Australia is in some ways caught up with a very small national shipping fleet. The Government is considering how to make it work effectively in our national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the spurious contributions to the debate that have been made by some Opposition speakers one has to say, `It is heads in the sand time. There has been no real focus on the real issues. There has been no attempt to grapple with the hard-nosed problems that Australia faces'. The measure of this Government is that it is not interested in playing to the gallery; it is interested in engineering reforms which will actually work. Mr Deputy Speaker, given the time, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Madam Speaker, tonight the Australian Labor Party will fulfil the commitment it made in May last year to deliver substantial tax relief in 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>At that time I said the country would be able to afford these tax cuts only if wage increases over the ensuing year were held in check. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian workforce has kept to its side of that bargain. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight we will keep to ours. </PARA>
<PARA>From 1 July all taxpayers will pay significantly less tax, particularly low and middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA>This will be achieved while preserving the budget surplus at this year's record level. </PARA>
<PARA>But tonight's Statement is about much more than just personal income tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>It also includes a wide range of measures to increase substantially assistance to families and pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>These are all measures of great substance, carefully directed by the Government to those who deserve them most. </PARA>
<PARA>But even more than that, this package cements into place the central element of the Government's economic strategy for 1989-90 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>It secures the maintenance of sensible wage outcomes in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>We have sought and won agreement from the Australian Council of Trade Unions that the tax cuts will be accepted as part of next year's wages system. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that the tax cuts will take the place of what would otherwise have been very much higher wage cost increases, which would have threatened employment and thrown the economy into recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead, the tax cuts will play a central role in lowering inflation, enhancing competitiveness and supporting economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA>They will also underpin a far-reaching modernisation of the existing system of industrial awards, upgrading productivity and the quality of the working lives of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Compare this situation with that of our predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1982 the then Treasurer-the now Leader of the Opposition-made irresponsible tax cuts which were not part of any sensible arrangement to moderate wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA>To the contrary, they were paid on top of a wage explosion which ushered in Australia's deepest recession since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA>He rejected the notion of an orderly and agreed basis for wages growth, preferring industrial confrontation to co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The dismal result was strikes and wages chaos which destroyed the economy, killing jobs and shutting down businesses all over the country. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight's wage/tax package stands in stark contrast to that mayhem. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the very essence of reason and order. </PARA>
<PARA>Reason, in that the Government and the workforce can work out and cooperate in an arrangement that is vastly superior to the alternative of a wage explosion followed by a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Order, in that only an orderly arrangement can secure improved living standards while maintaining business investment, growth and progress. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, this package could only be delivered by a Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>This Labor Government, through its Accord with the Australian workforce, is the only party which can deliver economic growth without crippling strikes, confrontation and unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>In the last six years the Accord has delivered 1.3 million jobs, a phenomenal 20 per cent increase in employment. </PARA>
<PARA>And it did this with a sharp reduction in strikes. </PARA>
<PARA>By contrast, in the last six years of the Fraser Government job growth was a miserable 4 per cent, with three times as many strikes. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, in the last two years in which the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, served as Treasurer, unemployment doubled to 700,000. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why, Madam Speaker, Labor not only claims a superior economic strategy and performance-it has proved it. </PARA>
<PARA>If we leave you with one single thought tonight it is this: if a Government cannot run wages in Australia it cannot run the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>We have shown over six years that we can run a successful wages system. </PARA>
<PARA>In complete contrast, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, as Treasurer in 1981 and 1982, comprehensively demonstrated that he could not manage wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA>He failed and his failure cost the nation dearly. </PARA>
<PARA>The tragedy with the Liberals is that in the seven years since, nothing has changed-they are no further advanced. </PARA>
<PARA>If they were in office today, they would have the same wages policy that destroyed the place seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>THE MEASURES</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, I now turn to the details of the Government's tax and social justice statement, its wage/tax strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>At a total cost of $5.7 billion, it consists of tax cuts costing $4.9 billion and, at $710 million, the largest social security package in our history. </PARA>
<PARA>Overall, it provides big personal income tax cuts, significant increases in family allowances and pensioner benefits, increases in the Dependent Spouse and Sole Parent Rebates, and a radical restructuring of the Australian award wage system. </PARA>
<PARA>These combine to deliver a substantial rise in the disposable income of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Families particularly will receive the extra support they deserve, and the least well paid members of the community will benefit from an historic lift in incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Before detailing the changes, I will illustrate how the measures combine to apply in some representative examples. </PARA>
<PARA>The key here is to understand that a dollar in tax cuts is a dollar in the hand, whereas a dollar of wages is worth considerably less after tax. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the tax cuts are equivalent to larger wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA>The four examples I will provide are expressed in terms of their equivalent value as wages. </PARA>
<PARA>Take first a low income earner on about $290 a week or $15,000 a year, with a dependent spouse and two children, and qualifying for a $20 supplementary payment adjustment to his or her minimum award rate of pay. </PARA>
<PARA>On 1 July such a taxpayer will get the equivalent of a $24 a week pay rise from the tax cut and family assistance increases. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent award restructuring and supplementary wage payments will deliver an additional $40 a week, giving a total wage equivalent increase of $64 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>It is as though they received a $64 wage rise. </PARA>
<PARA>Second, in the case of a wage earner on $500 a week or $26,000 a year, with a dependent spouse and two children, the comparable wage equivalent increase is $71 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>Third, for a two income family with two children on a combined income of $860 per week or $45,000 a year, the increase is equivalent to a wage rise of $121 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>And finally, for a single income earner with no dependants on $500 per week, or $26,000 a year, the total wage equivalent increase would be $56 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, these increases fulfil the Government's commitment to lift real disposable incomes in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Had they all been paid in wages, such rises would have implied a 12 per cent increase in the national wage bill next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, however, the actual cost of the overall package will be 6 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>This reflects the efficiency of a `paid for' tax cut in providing a non-inflationary wage increase in place of a straight wage rise. </PARA>
<PARA>Putting it more starkly, the workforce will receive increases equivalent to 12 per cent at roughly half the cost to employers and to inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>This significant result could only be delivered by a Labor Government through the processes of the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA>TAX SCALE AND FAMILY</PARA>
<PARA>ASSISTANCE</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, I will now detail the new tax scale and family assistance measures. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already illustrated the real benefit of these tax cuts to wage earners.</PARA>
<PARA>The tax cuts and family allowance increases are large in their own right-ranging from around $15 a week for a single taxpayer on average weekly earnings to $30 a week for a family taxpayer with the same income. </PARA>
<PARA>When this Government came to office in 1983, the lowest tax rate of all was 30 cents in the dollar; after that there was a hefty jump to 46 cents in the dollar; then another steep climb to 60 cents in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA>Labor's new scale has a bottom rate of only 21 cents in the dollar, middle rates of 29 and 39 cents and, up to a $50,000 threshold, a new 47 cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA>Above income levels of $50,000 the rate will remain at 49 cents in the dollar until 1 January 1990, when it will come down to the new 47 cent rate. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the enormous progress we have already made in cutting the Liberal's punitive 60 per cent rate, it is only fair that people earning more than $50,000 a year wait a little longer this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, we have also acted to reduce tax burdens significantly by increasing a range of tax rebates. </PARA>
<PARA>For single income couples with children, the Dependent Spouse Rebate is to be increased from $1,030 to $1,200. </PARA>
<PARA>For single income couples without children it will be increased from $830 to $1,000, while the sole parent rebate will be raised from $780 to $940. </PARA>
<PARA>To assist families we are raising family allowances to $9 a week for each of the first three children, and to $12 a week for the fourth and any additional children, while the family allowances supplement will be lifted by $3.10 a week for children aged between 13 and 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result we will achieve this year the child poverty benchmarks promised by the Prime Minister-well ahead of the 1990 target. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, in an historic step, all these rebates and family allowances will be indexed in future to annual movements in the CPI, to preserve their real value permanently. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, two further key points need to be made about this new tax structure. </PARA>
<PARA>The first is that it more than offsets what is known as fiscal drag or bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, personal income taxpayers will now be paying less tax than if we had indexed the tax scales for inflation since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>The second point is that because of our past decisions, Commonwealth spending relative to the size of the economy will continue to fall in future years. </PARA>
<PARA>It has already fallen to its lowest level in 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have provided real scope for further affordable tax cuts in the years ahead because the public sector will be so much smaller. </PARA>
<PARA>AGE PENSIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, I now outline the major reforms the Government is making in assistance to age pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>First, the relationship between the age pension and tax systems is to be made more rational and less confusing. </PARA>
<PARA>Many pensioners have said to us that it was unfair that they are allowed to earn up to an extra $40 a week without affecting their pension, but must pay tax if they earn more than $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has examined this and will remedy it. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioner tax rebates are to be increased so that age pensioners with earnings within the income test free area of $40 for single pensioners, and $70 for married couples, will pay no tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA>When fully phased in by July 1990, this major reform will mean that 80 per cent of Australia's 1.8 million age and service pensioners will be exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA>For single pensioners, as a first step in 1989-90, the rebate will relieve $25 a week of non-pension income from tax, while in 1990-91 the rebate will be increased to a level which exempts $40 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>For married pensioners, the cost of achieving the same objective is smaller and the rebates will be raised in one step in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>The second improvement concerns the timing of pension adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1986 pensioners were asked to share the burden of adjustment to the collapse in Australia's export prices by waiting six weeks for pension adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA>They have done their fair share. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided not only to remove the six week delay, but also to bring forward the indexation of pensions by a further six weeks; a total bring-forward of 12 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>This bring-forward will be implemented in equal instalments over three indexation adjustments beginning in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, after June this year pensions will be indexed at five monthly intervals until the full 12 week bring-forward is in place in September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>These new payment arrangements will apply to all pensioners and beneficiaries and will compensate for price rises much more rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition, Madam Speaker, the 2 per cent discount imposed in 1986-87 for public service and defence force pensioners will be restored from November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>WAGES POLICY</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, I now describe in more detail how the changes fit into wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I can announce tonight that, on the basis of the tax cuts and assistance measures the Government will deliver from 1 July, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has agreed and accepts that average earnings growth in 1989-90 will be held to around 6 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, the ACTU also has agreed that there will be no claim for a CPI-based across-the-board wage increase in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, the new wages system will be determined by Justice Maddern and his colleagues on the Industrial Relations Commission in the current proceedings and the Wage Case scheduled for May. </PARA>
<PARA>We are envisaging the most far-reaching overhaul of industrial awards since Federation, and the Industrial Relations Commission has a vital role to play in establishing the new wage system and presiding over the orderly change to award structures. </PARA>
<PARA>Award restructuring will bring substantial benefits for all parties-for employers, a more flexible, productive and highly trained workforce; and for employees, more interesting, varied and better-paid jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>For very low-paid workers, the Commonwealth will support moderate supplementary payment adjustments, phased over two years, to lift their incomes to a reasonable living wage. </PARA>
<PARA>Only members of unions prepared to implement genuine award restructuring will be eligible for pay rises. </PARA>
<PARA>The tax cuts, by raising take-home pay from 1 July, will establish an environment in which comprehensive award restructuring negotiations can proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>We anticipate that wage increases from this process will be paid progressively in two stages, beginning later in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>This new pay system brings about historic changes, including reforms called for by the business community over many years and now able to be implemented under the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA>It will make Australian industry much more productive, competitive and better placed to overcome our balance of payments problem. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth will back up the award restructuring process by allocating $12 million to fund its Workplace Reform Program. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training is announcing tonight new programs to assist training in industry. </PARA>
<PARA>FISCAL POLICY</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, like wages policy, budget policy will continue to be deployed fully to bear down on Australia's trade deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>Already I have said the 1989-90 Budget will retain a surplus at least equal to this year's forecast of $5.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, we will budget for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year of real declines in spending. </PARA>
<PARA>And we will again ensure the public sector borrowing requirement in Australia is no greater than zero. </PARA>
<PARA>Fiscal policy will therefore be kept as tight as a drum. </PARA>
<PARA>To this end tonight's Statement includes a first instalment of savings measures for incorporation in the August Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>These savings will more than offset the $710 million overall cost of the new policy measures I have announced to assist families and pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA>Savings on direct Commonwealth payments totalling about $360 million will be achieved principally from four areas. </PARA>
<PARA>There will be a further tightening of procedures to avoid social security abuse; the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be restructured-I stress without affecting pensioners; a new pathology fee schedule will apply; and Defence spending will be maintained but without a real increase. </PARA>
<PARA>Payments to the States will be determined at the Premiers' Conference next month. </PARA>
<PARA>But savings against the forward estimates at least equal to the cuts in direct Commonwealth spending will be realised. </PARA>
<PARA>The States too must contribute to the national economic and wage strategy from which they materially benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>STRUCTURAL REFORMS</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, I turn now to on-going reforms in key areas of the economy designed to remove supply bottlenecks and raise efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>The new wages system opens the way for a dramatic lift in the productivity of Australian industry, as does the continuing boom in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>But further progress in other areas is essential if we are to sustain rising living standards in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>Our determination to pursue changes was demonstrated by the structural adjustment measures I announced last May. </PARA>
<PARA>It was demonstrated again earlier this week when the Government declared its intention to override restrictive State provisions in order to accelerate the essential deregulations of wheat transport and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA>This followed our decision to press ahead with the development of additional capacity at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA>In their own ways both these decisions will lift our competitiveness and improve our trading performance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has already announced that Ministers will be outlining additional reform measures during May. </PARA>
<PARA>Important amongst these will be a statement by the Minister for Transport and Communications detailing fundamental changes to the operations of our ports and coastal shipping. </PARA>
<PARA>These are key areas where inefficiencies and bottlenecks have held back our trade effort for decades. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Commonwealth alone cannot do all that is needed. </PARA>
<PARA>Ports and railways are a State responsibility and we will be seeking from them a meaningful commitment to reform in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, this Government already has implemented many fundamental reforms to the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>Tonight I am releasing a comprehensive document which outlines how we will crack down on the use of overseas tax havens by Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA>We have no intention of allowing unscrupulous operators to exploit ordinary taxpayers through sham companies established for the sole purpose of avoiding tax. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC CONTEXT</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, I will conclude with some observations on the economic context of tonight's Statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The single most significant development in our economy in the past 12 months has been the huge surge in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA>This holds out the prospect of major benefits to Australia through increasing our capacity to produce exports and replace imports. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Government has not sought to disguise the fact that this investment phase has also led to substantial tensions in key areas of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>With so much of the new equipment needed by business having to be imported, the balance of payments deficit has not narrowed as we expected. </PARA>
<PARA>And with demand running too strongly inflation has not fallen as we had hoped.</PARA>
<PARA>We have therefore seen interest rates in Australia rise to higher levels than any of us would like. </PARA>
<PARA>However, recent indicators have provided welcome signs that demand is returning to more sustainable rates of growth. </PARA>
<PARA>We are confident that this trend will continue as the past tightening of fiscal and monetary policy takes increasing effect. </PARA>
<PARA>This should be sufficient to slow demand and cut back the recent lift in imports and lower our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government is unequivocally committed to pursuing the strategy necessary to achieve a lasting turnaround in our current account and external debt imbalances. </PARA>
<PARA>As a nation we must never lose sight of the fact that both are unsustainably high. </PARA>
<PARA>For this reason I reaffirm that monetary policy will continue to play its vital balancing role in our overall economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>In all of this, tonight's wage/tax package is central. </PARA>
<PARA>It imposes a discipline on the key cost area of wages. </PARA>
<PARA>Without it Australia would simply return to the high cost recessionary days of the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>We have acted decisively to prevent that dismal outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>We shall continue to pursue our economic strategy because it is the only strategy-I repeat the only strategy-capable of delivering lower inflation and a lower current account deficit in combination with sustained business activity and higher employment. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Rebates) Bill 1989 will amend various taxation Acts to give effect to matters announced earlier tonight by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his economic statement. The Bill will declare the general rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for the 1989-90 and subsequent financial years. It will also declare the rate of fringe benefits tax to apply from 1 April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Other measures to be implemented by this Bill will increase the maximum levels of the rebates of tax available to taxpayers who support certain dependants and allow those rebates to be indexed annually. The Bill will also allow instalments payable under the quarterly provisional tax system to be reduced to take account of the reduction in tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Personal Tax Rates</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the personal income tax rate measures contained in the Bill. The reform of the rate scales will be in two stages. With effect from 1 July 1989, a five-step scale will apply and this will reduce to a four-step scale from 1 January 1990. There is to be no change in the tax-free threshold of $5,100. From 1 July 1989 the existing 24 per cent rate will be reduced to 21 per cent and will apply to income over $5,100 and up to a new threshold level of $17,650. The 29 per cent rate will continue to apply, but in the altered income range $17,651 to $20,600. The existing 40 per cent rate will be reduced to 39 per cent and apply to income from $20,601 to $35,000. For income over $35,000 and up to $50,000 the rate of 49 per cent will be reduced to 47 per cent. Finally, for income over $50,000 the 49 per cent rate will be reduced to 47 per cent from 1 January 1990. To give effect to this decision a composite rate of 48 per cent will apply to that income on assessment for the 1989-90 year of income. </PARA>
<PARA> These tax cuts will be reflected in lower pay-as-you-earn deductions from 1 July 1989 and, in the case of income over $50,000, from 1 January 1990. The changes to the rate scale will also affect non-residents with the rate of 29 per cent applying on income up to $20,600 and above that amount reduced rates will apply as for residents. Other rates to be reduced include the rate on unearned income of minors which will be 48 per cent for 1989-90 and 47 per cent for all subsequent years, subject to shading-in arrangements for income just over $416. Also the rate of tax on trustee assessed under section 99a of the Income Tax Assessment Act will be 48 per cent for 1989-90 and 47 per cent in subsequent years. The cost to revenue of the personal tax cuts and the increases I will outline shortly to dependant rebates is $4,900 million in 1989-90 and $5,700 million in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Fringe Benefits Tax Rate</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The rate of fringe benefits tax will be reduced to 47 per cent for the year of tax commencing on 1 April 1990 and subsequent years. The cost to revenue is estimated at $55 million in 1990-91 and $60 million in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>Dependant Rebates</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Increased levels of concessional rebates for dependants are being made available for 1989-90 and subsequent income years. As announced by the Treasurer, the dependant spouse rebate will be increased to $1,000 and to $1,200 where there is a dependent child or student. Similar increases will apply to the rebates for a daughter-housekeeper or a housekeeper. The level of the sole parent rebate is being increased to $940 and the levels of the concessional rebates for an invalid relative, a parent or a parent-in-law are also being increased. There will be a flow-on of these increases to the zone rebates of tax for people in isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Indexation of Concessional Rebates</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Bill will give effect to the announcement that from 1990-91 the concessional rebates referred to earlier will be indexed annually on the basis of movements in the all groups consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA>Quarterly Provisional Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will permit the Commissioner of Taxation to reduce to an appropriate level the amount of a quarterly provisional tax instalment otherwise payable in circumstances such as these where tax cuts have been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains a more detailed explanation of the provisions of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so I ask the Parliament to endorse four historic commitments. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 would establish:</PARA>
<PARA>A secure fair deal for families with children;</PARA>
<PARA>A guarantee of adequate standards of income for children;</PARA>
<PARA>For the first time maintenance of the real value of family payments; and</PARA>
<PARA>Indexation of pensions and benefits at the earliest possible date. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1966, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission did away with the basic wage. From that time Australia has not had a wages system that takes account of the costs of children. From that time fair income distribution has been a function exclusively for the tax and social security systems. Since then the social security system has been required to make sure working families have adequate income to care for all children. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia owes much to Professor Ronald Henderson for his clear articulation, as early as 1970, that the 1966 moves in the wages system would compel attention in public policy. He spelt out that we would have to address through tax and social security policy the issues of equity between families with and without children and the adequacy of incomes for all families with children. The report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty highlighted what issues had to be addressed. The work of that Commission lead to the Whitlam Government converting deductions for children into tax rebates and to the Fraser Government's cashing out the rebates to family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> With the benefit of hindsight we can see that those moves were not sustained. The issues of fairness of the tax treatment of families and adequacy of family income, having been addressed by Henderson, were not further addressed for some years. Not until the Social Security Review were the issues thought through. The issues addressed by the Review include:</PARA>
<PARA>First, the balance between horizontal equity measures, such as family allowance, and vertical equity measures, such as family allowance supplement (FAS) and additional pension-benefit;</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the make-up of families and the importance of adequate provision for all family types-couples with one and two incomes, sole parents, families with pre-school age children, school children and teenagers, families with children with disabilities;</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, to which family member should particular payments go; and</PARA>
<PARA>Fourthly, standards of adequacy for families with inadequate incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Cass's Issues Paper No. 1 of the Social Security Review, Income support for families with children, is the first comprehensive analysis of the detailed policies required to build a fair, secure policy that deals with the issues identified by Henderson 20 years ago. Cass identified short term measures which were demanded by the appalling extent of poverty among families with children. Over the last two years those recommendations have been progressively implemented through the families package: family allowance supplement was introduced, payable to the mother; child disability allowance was introduced, differential rates of payment for younger and older children have been introduced; massive increases in payments per child have occurred; family allowance supplement and family allowance have been integrated into a single payment. Tonight we move from the short term to the long term recommendations of Professor Cass, addressing the more fundamental issues of horizontal equity and sustaining the system into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes the biggest increases in family allowance in history. In 1976 when tax rebates for children were cashed out by the Fraser Government assistance for working families was cut-from $4.50 per week for the first child to $3.50. This was done by converting the tax rebate for the first child of $200 a year into an increase of $3 a week in family allowance to a total of $3.50. In 1982, the Fraser Government gave its first and only family allowance increase-of $1.75 a week to $5.25, a net increase in assistance for the first child of 75c a week in 7 years. Tonight I ask for Parliament's endorsement of a rise of $3.75 a week to $9-an increase of 71 per cent for the first child in every family. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would massively simplify the family allowance system. The current system of four rates of allowance will be replaced with two rates: $9 a week for the first, second and third children and $12 a week for fourth and subsequent children and for children in institutions. This new simple structure accords with proposals of the Social Security Review-a basic family allowance at a flat rate, with special recognition for larger families. The increases to family allowance would directly benefit almost 2 million families with 3.8 million children. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance system announced tonight is simple, fair and sustainable. The Bill would index all family allowance payments in line with movements in the consumer price index (CPI). This fair deal for families will not be eroded by inflation. The fair deal for Australian families in this Bill is complemented by the major rises in, and annual indexation of, the dependent spouse rebate and sole parent rebate announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> In our policy commitments at the last election we promised that `during Labor's third term an adequate living standard for children will be achieved by:</PARA>
<PARA> Raising child payments to ensure that total assistance per child moves from its current level of 11 per cent to at least 15 per cent of the combined married rate of pension; and</PARA>
<PARA> ensuring that the aggregate payments for older children attain a benchmark of 20 per cent of the combined married rate.'</PARA>
<PARA>Tonight, this Labor Government delivers on that promise. That promise was made because of our firm belief that the greatest scourge facing our nation is child poverty, that we must put an end to that, and that there is only one way to do that: to guarantee adequate income for all children. This Bill delivers on our promise, putting behind us the scandal of child poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The levels of child payments set by this Bill are consistent with Australian research on the income needs of families with children. For the first time in Australian history a government has set a standard for child payments that is adequate and will be maintained in real terms. Professor Henderson in the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty recommended payments equivalent to 12 per cent, 15 per cent and 18 per cent of the payments for a married couple respectively for first, second and third children. The package we have announced tonight of 15 per cent of married rate pension for each younger child and 20 per cent for 13- to 15-year-olds goes beyond the Poverty Commission's work, providing for the first time in history a guaranteed income for families at a higher real level than recommended by the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the Social Security Review's work, Labor made its commitment to benchmarks for child payments-a commitment to establish enduring relativities between families with children and people without children. For the first time in Australia we have a policy based on what it costs to raise children, rather than on what happens to be available in the Budget pro- cess. That policy that recognises the costs of children has built in what every parent of teenagers knows, and all the research shows: teenagers cost more. In just 18 months we have introduced and won universal acceptance for a higher rate for teenage children. These policies are complemented by the common allowance structure for youth incomes. We have put in place income support of 15 per cent of married rate pension for children up to 12, 20 per cent for 13- to 15-year-olds and 25 per cent for 16- and 17-year-olds, taking account of the Austudy payment. This Bill would implement the guaranteed standards of adequacy from 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Building on Henderson's work, the Social Security Review examined in detail 30 separate studies of equivalence scales-of the relativities of incomes needs or expenditure patterns between different family types and sizes. For younger children family allowance of $9 a week plus family allowance supplement of $24 a week will be payable-a total of $33 a week per child. For 13- to 15-year-olds the increases in family allowance will be added to by a $3.10 increase in family allowance supplement, providing a combined payment of $43.10 per week per child, in comparison to the $15.25 available when we came to government. Reaching those standards means massive real increases in payments for 1.1 million children in low income families. The level of those payments lines up with Australian research on income needs of families. The days of policy based on anecdote, of increases based on what is left over at the end of the Budget process, are behind us. Policy is now based on explicit standards that are available for rigorous scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The third commitment I ask of the Parliament this evening is indexation of family payments and maintenance of the standards of adequacy. As a nation we like to think of ourselves as placing our children first. Until tonight the actions of this Parliament have not placed our children first. We have fully indexed payments for adults, offering them some security and protection from the ravages of inflation. Before tonight no government had ever committed itself to maintenance of payments to families with children in real terms. Tonight this Labor Government has done so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to index family payments: family allowance, mother's-guardian's allowance, child disability allowance, multiple birth payment and double orphan's pension. The first indexation increase will be on the first payday in 1990. Family allowance will be adjusted in line with the increase in the CPI between December 1988 and the June quarter this year. After that family allowance will be indexed annually with effect from the first payday each calendar year in line with movements in the CPI in the preceding financial year. Mother's-guardian's allowance, child disability allowance, multiple birth payment and double orphan's pension will each be indexed on the first payday in 1990 and each year after that increases will be in line with CPI movements in the preceding financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the real declines in tax and family allowance provisions for families with children under the previous Government. All families suffered in that period because payments and rebates were not adjusted for inflation. For low income families the absence of that adjustment was devastating: 800,000 children-one child in every five-were forced into poverty. Payments for children in low income families were increased in nominal terms only once in 7 years-from $7.50 to $10, a real decline of 35 per cent. Under Labor those payments have been increased every year: In 1983 from $10 to $12; in 1984 from $12 to $14; in 1985 from $14 to $16; in 1986 from $16 to $17; in 1987 from $17 to $22 for younger children and $28 for older children; and in 1988 from $22 to $24 for younger children and $28 to $31 for older children. This Bill proposes a further increase for older children in 1989 from $31 to $34.10 and historic rises in family allowance for all children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would guarantee these gains would not be eroded by inflation. On top of family allowance indexation, family allowance supplement, additional pension and additional benefit will be adjusted from the first payday each calendar year. This adjustment will increase rates of FAS and additional pension-benefit whenever necessary to maintain the standards of adequacy. Total payments for children in low income families would be guaranteed as a percentage of married rate pension, which is automatically indexed in line with the CPI. The standards of living of low income families with children will never again be subject to decimation through policy indolence and lethargy of governments. Tonight, all members of this Parliament are asked to step beyond attitudes and to commit themselves to a solid policy-of a secure and fair deal for families. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last year we have had vigorous debate in Australia on the appropriate levels and type of provision for families with children. That debate is central to any concern about fairness and equity in our community. To quote Professor Cass:</PARA>
<PARA>In a period of restraint on public expenditure it is essential to address the matter of immediate priorities for family assistance. This focuses attention on those approaches which provide greater assistance to low income families by improving adequacy of income-tested payments for pensioners, beneficiaries and low income working families and introducing measures which minimise work disincentives and support the transition to employment. </PARA>
<PARA>There she described in 1986 the processes the Government has implemented in the past two years. She went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Proposals for reform based on the principle of horizontal equity have the long-term objective of improving and maintaining the disposable incomes of families with children relative to individuals and couples without children . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The value at which family allowances might be set is obviously contentious, with the terms of debate set within the outer limits of appropriate assistance with the costs of children on the one hand, and the capacity of government revenue and the willingness of the political process to redistribute to families, on the other hand. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, together with the Treasurer's announced increases and indexation of family taxation rebates, delivers a fair, sustainable deal for all families with a guarantee of adequate income for all families with children. There is a balance involved-a balance that until tonight Australian public policy has addressed for 20 years in what can only be described as an ad hoc way. The balance we have struck provides a fair distribution of income and provides a guarantee of income for every family which is adequate for them to share fully in the life of our community. It accords with the very essence of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustainable, equitable social reform is never easy, never quick. Tonight's package is a fair, sustainable deal for families. Professor Henderson indicated the need for it 20 years ago. Professor Cass did the detailed work on how to do it and spelt out the process to achieve it. Tonight, we have delivered it. We have delivered for all children-whether they live in one or two parent families, whether one, two or no parents work, or whether they live in institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as in family policy we have known of the issues for many years and just as we needed the Social Security Review to look at the detail and work through the detailed processes, so we are entering upon a detailed review of retirement incomes. In October 1988 the Social Security Review released Issues Paper No. 6, Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy. Following release of that paper, the Government initiated an extensive series of community consultations on retirement income policies. The task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on retirement income has travelled to all States to meet with, and listen to, several thousand pensioners and retired people at some 40 separate meetings. Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr McLeay, I think you, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), the Prime Minister and I got some benefit from listening to aged people, hearing what some of their concerns were and getting some idea of their priorities. The Australian Council of Social Service, in conjunction with the Australian Pensioners Federation, has also undertaken an extensive consultation process to obtain the views of pensioners and the community welfare sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been consulting State governments, trade unions, business, the superannuation industry and relevant national organisations, as well as considering the many written submissions received in response to the Social Security Review's issues paper. I think almost 300 submissions have been received. Tonight we have announced two measures that were recommended by the Social Security Review, the Prime Minister's task force on retirement income, and consultations and submissions received by the Government. These initiatives form part of a phased reform of retirement income to improve adequacy, fairness, security and sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to recommendations from the Social Security Review and from the subsequent consultations, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs recommended that the Government should reduce the lag between the release of the CPI figures and the indexation of pension payments. The Government has therefore decided to bring forward pension indexation increases in three stages. Each stage will bring the indexation increase forward by four weeks. The Bill would provide for indexation dates to be 15 November 1989, 18 April 1990, and then Each September and March. Indexation dates would be brought forward in total by 12 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Consultations on retirement income have also shown quite clearly that the differing free areas for tax and social security confuse many age pensioners. The Government has therefore decided to ensure that the income test free area will become 100 per cent tax free. This will be achieved by setting the pensioner tax rebate at an appropriate level. The Treasurer's announcement tonight that the pension free area is to become tax free is a major reform. No previous government has ever committed itself to a standard for the amount of non-pension income that pensioners can receive without paying tax. This announcement, together with the changes to indexation dates, is a clear statement of the Government's direction in retirement income policy. It will enable people contemplating retirement to plan for their future with the security that their real levels of total income will be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90 a single pensioner will be able to receive $25 per week on top of the maximum rate of pension without having to pay tax. In 1990-91 this amount will be increased to $40, so that the income test free area is totally tax free. In 1989-90 married couples will be able to receive $35 per week each tax free. This means that married couples will be able to receive 100 per cent of their pension income test free area without paying any tax. The Government's decision will also mean an extra 75,000 pensioners will not pay provisional tax. This is because all pensioners receiving the pensioner tax rebate are exempted from paying provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has repaired the damage done by the previous Government by repairing the income security safety net, by protecting the safety net from inflation through indexation and automatic adjustment and by restoring employment. Last week unemployment benefit number fell to less than 400,000-the lowest figure since 1982. Unfortunately, those who have been unemployed longest are finding it hardest to take advantage of employment growth. New-Start offers a leg up to those people-to end their scarring and exclusion. It is available to long term beneficiaries. With effect from 1 February this year New-Start has been extended to the spouses of long term beneficiaries. This Bill would extend employment entry payment to those spouses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also seeks to correct anomaly affecting the payment of child disability allowance. Under the current legislation, in some cases allowance may not be payable where a father is caring for a disabled child. The Bill would make it clear that the family is entitled to the child disability allowance regardless of which parent actually cares for the child. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience with the operation of the savings provision introduced with the maintenance income test in June last year has shown the need for refinements in three areas. First, the Government has decided to restore and backdate fully indexation increases to people in the saved category who are receiving spousal maintenance only and have no dependent children. Secondly, income payments received in arrears would be excluded from the definition of `total income' so that people who receive late what they were entitled to all along maintain the benefit of the savings provision. Thirdly, the Bill would close a loophole in the maintenance income test savings provision by ensuring that the previous level of benefit is `saved' only to the extent that the client continues to meet the basic eligibility criteria for the payment. It is being made clear, for example, that if a child ceases to be a dependant for the purpose of the payment of additional benefit, then that component of the entitlement ceases. Entitlement to a one-off double payment of benefit to ex-prisoners will be extended to former long term beneficiaries who reclaim unemployment benefit on release from prison within three months of last receiving unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill refines rules governing the portability of Australian pensions overseas. This refinement is necessary for the effective negotiation and operation of our reciprocal social security agreements. Broadly speaking, the rate of pension currently paid overseas after 12 months' absence is based on the proportion of a person's working life spent resident in Australia. To date, each agreement has contained this rule within its own text. However, future agreements will apply the rule by reference to our domestic social security legislation. It is necessary, therefore, to set down this mechanism in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would increase penalties for the unauthorised disclosure of client information. The penalties currently provided by the Act on summary conviction for unlawful disclosure are up to six months' imprisonment or a $1,000 fine. On indictment, an offender can face a gaol term of up to two years or a fine of up to $5,000. This Bill would raise the fines for breaches of the secrecy provisions contained in the Social Security Act to $3,000 on summary conviction and $12,000 on indictment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last three years we have redesigned and rebuilt the system of income support for families with children. That has involved major changes in the approaches required of the staff in the 220 regional, area and state offices of the Department of Social Security. I place on record the Government's and my own appreciation of the diligence, competence and commitment of all those people who have been charged with delivering those changes. Often they must have thought there were far too many changes. Those changes have been designed by a large number of dedicated professionals in each of the divisions of the central office of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of our political differences, I am sure all honourable members have seen the changes in social security in the last three years and will join me in congratulating and thanking the Secretary and his staff. I also wish to place on record my appreciation of the work of Professor Cass as head of the Social Security Review and the many people who have worked for that Review. It is their detailed work which has made tonight's package possible. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1510" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="RICHMOND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Since March 1983 the Government has provided the Australian National Line (ANL) with total additional capital of $160.5m, comprising amounts of $90m in 1982-83 and $70.5m in 1984-85 (of which $60m and $50.5m respectively represented conversion of outstanding Commonwealth loans).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Trade results for ANL since 1982-83 are detailed on page 7 of ANL's Annual Report which was tabled in December 1988. Profit (Loss) from all Sources figures are:</PARA>
<PARA>$000</PARA>
<PARA> 1983-84... (67 753)</PARA>
<PARA> 1984-85... 19 054</PARA>
<PARA> 1985-86... 18 993</PARA>
<PARA> 1986-87... 39 490</PARA>
<PARA> 1987-88... 3 768</PARA>
<PARA> (3) ANL has no significant foreign exchange risk exposure in terms of its assets and liabilities. All overseas borrowings are fully hedged. On day-to-day operational transactions, ANL is a net exporter with foreign based revenues greater than foreign expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Since 1982-83 ANL has incurred net abnormal/extraordinary foreign exchange losses on overseas borrowings totalling $55.4m as a result of declines in the value of the Australian dollar from the levels prevailing when foreign currency loans were taken out. In addition, exchange losses on day-to-day operations (other than for 1983-84 for which separate figures were not reported), relating mainly to reversion of overseas bank balances and hedging activity, totalled $14.2m.</PARA>
<PARA> However, a substantial proportion of the foreign exchange losses explicitly set out in the financial statements is offset by increases implicitly included in higher operating profits because of the same decline in the value of the Australian dollar. ANL's overseas borrowings were made in the same currencies as the revenue streams generated by ANL vessels involved in international trades. Such an approach provides a natural hedge against currencies fluctuations. The improvements in revenue streams, and therefore in operating profits, resulting from a weakening Australian dollar are not (and cannot) be separately highlighted in the financial statements. Assuming other factors remain largely unchanged, ANL currently estimates that over a 12 months period a one cent reduction in the value of the $A against the $US would increase ANL operating profits by approximately $1m.</PARA>
<PARA> Generally lower interest rates on foreign borrowings, compared with Australian dollar borrowings, also result in higher profits, and implicitly contribute to offsetting foreign exchange losses.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) ANL actively pursues a policy of risk minimisation in its management of foreign exchange exposure. Forward cover or other hedging mechanisms are employed for overseas capital transactions and all overseas borrowings are fully hedged. ANL constantly monitors its forecast revenue and expense streams and, where possible, adopts a policy of matching foreign payments and receipts.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) ANL was provided with guidelines for managing its dealings in foreign exchange in 1986. In summary, these provide:</PARA>
<PARA> that it shall generally adopt a risk averse policy in managing exposures, including the use of natural hedges as far as possible</PARA>
<PARA> that trading will only be undertaken in categories of transactions involving genuine financial risk exposure arising from activities in the performance of its functions under the Australian Shipping Commission Act 1956; and</PARA>
<PARA> that any policy approach for managing financial risk is to be specifically endorsed by Commission resolution before being generally adopted by management and that the Commission be informed at each meeting on all risk averse activities since the previous meeting.</PARA>

<PARA> Australia was represented at the last meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee (IGC) of the Convention in 1987 by a senior officer of my Department. That was the only IGC meeting to have been held since the meetings referred to in my earlier answer.</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in the answer given on my behalf in the Senate on 22 August 1988 (Hansard page 26) to question No. 298, it is intended that Australia accede to the Convention in the near future. Australia already meets the Convention's requirements for phonograms (ie. records and tapes). Following the Copyright Law Review Committee's report on performers' protection, the Government has introduced the Copyright Amendment Bill 1988 to provide performers with rights and remedies in relation to their performances. If passed, the amendments will meet the requirements of the Rome Convention for performers' protection. Amendments are also proposed to be made to the Copyright (International Protection) Regulations that will meet the Rome Convention requirements for protection of foreign broadcasts emanating from other Convention Countries. When these amendments have been made and brought into operations, the Government will therefore be able to accede to the Rome Convention.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) The Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) were established by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide assistance, on concessional terms, to low income countries facing protracted balance of payments problems. The facilities are intended to support a member's medium term macroeconomic and structural adjustment programs and thereby help establish the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth. With assistance from the staff of the IMF and World Bank, a member seeking funding under SAF and ESAF must develop a three year adjustment program which is set out in a policy framework paper (PFP). The PFP outlines the macroeconomic and structural policy objectives and priorities, and the measures to be adopted during the three year period. The PFP contains a detailed description of the policies and reforms to be implemented in the first year and an assessment of the member's financing needs and likely sources of finance. In part, the PFP is intended to help a member attract additional financial support and to provide a basis for improving coordination amongst lender and donors.</PARA>
<PARA> The specific policies adopted under the PFP depend largely on the particular circumstance of the member. In general, however, members successful in obtaining SAF and ESAF assistance have outlined wide-ranging reforms, including the abolition of price controls and associated subsidies, trade and exchange rate liberalisation, tax reform, a reduction in fiscal imbalances and the restructuring of public sector enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) World Bank adjustment lending aims to increase the efficiency, flexibility and stability of the economies of borrowers with balance of payments difficulties. The basic objective is to strengthen the growth orientation and external viability of these economies. To this end policy improvements have been sought by the World Bank in four main interrelated areas: trade policy (eg. through reductions in barriers to trade), mobilization of domestic and foreign resources (eg. through improvements in the tax system and tax collection, and reductions in foreign investments regulations), efficiency in the use of domestic resources (eg. through economic pricing policies) and institutional reform (eg. through selective privatisation and increased competition). The precise blend of these reforms, the specific measures chosen to implement them, their timing, and their particular sector focus have depended on several factors, in particular, a country's initial economic condition and the strengths and weaknesses of its institutions. There are no general solutions; the design of adjustment programs has to be carefully tailored to meet specific needs and policy objectives of individual borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The IMF Executive Board has recently examined the impact of Fund assisted adjustment programs on the poor in recipient countries. While experience has shown that adjustment does not necessarily lower the living standards of the poor, the review has served to increase the importance of designing programs so as to protect this disadvantaged population group.</PARA>
<PARA> The impact of adjustment policies on the poor was explored in the World Bank paper ``Protecting the poor during periods of adjustment'' discussed by the Development Committee of the World Bank at its April 1987 meeting. A copy of the publication has been forwarded to the honourable member. Fund and Bank papers on poverty issues including the impact of structural and adjustment policies on poverty alleviation are scheduled to be published shortly.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), in its publication `Adjustment with a Human Face', has urged the combining of adjustment with protection of the vulnerable and the restoration of economic growth. Such an approach has six main policy components:</PARA>
<PARA> More expansionary macro-economic policies, with a more gradual timing of adjustment and larger amounts of medium-term external finance.</PARA>
<PARA> The selective use of economic policies for protecting the basic needs of the vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA> Sectoral policies to strengthen employment and income generating activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Improving the equity and efficiency of social expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA> Monitoring the living standards, health, and nutrition of low-income groups during the adjustment process.</PARA>
<PARA> The International Labour Organisation (ILO) convened a High Level Meeting on Employment and Structural Adjustment in Geneva from 23-25 November 1987, which concluded that adjustment policies should provide the basis for future growth of employment and incomes. The meeting advocated the urgent implementation of labour-intensive investment schemes, policies to increase the productive capacity of the poor, development of small and medium-scale enterprises, and efforts to improve the management of human resources. It also concluded that an open world trading system is vital for the attainment of this objective.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) Australia's IMF Executive Director participated in the review of adjustment programs and the impact on the poor. Australia's position on this issue was essentially agreement with the consensus view of the Executive Board that considerable importance should be attached to improving program design so as to protect the poor during periods of adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Executive Director representing Australia has supported World Bank initiatives to re-emphasise the Bank's role in poverty alleviation and has also supported the Bank's policy of protecting the poor during adjustment. The Bank is helping adjusting countries address poverty problems by: (i) designing adjustment programs so that they take greater account of the effects of specific policies on the poor; (ii) maintaining, whenever possible, social expenditures that disproportionately benefit the poor, and improving targeting of other expenditures such as food subsidies; and (iii) designing short-term compensatory programs that benefit identifiable poor groups affected by adjustment, including employment generation through public works and food-for-work projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia supports World Bank and International Finance Corporation initiatives to assist small business development. Australia also supports the work of the Bank's Economic Development Institute which provides training to broaden the perspective and increase the competence of senior officials concerned with developmental work in the member countries of the Bank. Australia is funding a program of special support for the Bank's South Pacific Training Program.</PARA>
<PARA> In my Plenary Statement to the 1988 September IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings I emphasised that Australia welcomes the Bank's efforts to sharpen the focus of its attack on poverty. The Bank has provided an important and continuing stimulus to economic growth; this is the primary factor in alleviating poverty. Under growth-oriented adjustment programs, the lot of the poor can be improved through the fairer application of taxes and subsidies and more realistic exchange rates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As part of its drive to contain the rate of growth in costs attributable to the aviation industry, the CAA is pursuing a strategy which is designed to take advantage of the Australian communication satellite system by consolidating air traffic service functions and staff into fewer, larger centres. There are substantial benefits arising from such changes which will contain costs to the industry without any noticeable change in the manner in which services are provided to pilots. It is expected the change will extend over a period of about seven or eight years and that, in the medium term, services will be provided to the industry from five centres, based on capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As indicated in the answer to Part (1) above, it is intended that Flight Services Units will be concentrated into centres in the capital cities, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. The planning processes for consolidation of the Units to these centres is dynamic and variations will occur depending on the relevant economic and industrial implications.</PARA>

<PARA> The final location of individual flight services functions is subject to continuing review on cost/benefit and operational grounds and, for that reason, the above lists may be amended from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The relocation of staff and functions into capital city centres will have the effect of providing much greater flexibility in the use of staff, the opportunity to take advantage of a more concentrated management infrastructure and the elimination of substantial costs incurred in maintaining staff located away from centres of population (particularly remote area costs associated with the Units in the outback).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is not expected that there will be any insurmountable technical difficulties or disadvantages associated with the consolidation plans. The technical capability necessary to undertake the changes is readily available.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The planned consolidation of outstations back to capital city centres and the associated Airways Investment Program over the next 5 to 7 years is expected to yield a rate of return of about 20% on funds invested.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There has been only one SES position or equivalent reclassified in the Department of Defence since 1 July 1988, viz, PN 1648, from SES Level 1 to SES Level 2. This position was subsequently filled by the permanent transfer of an SES officer at that level. Therefore answers to parts 1 (a) and 1 (b) are not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The above position was created to head up a new Exports and International Programs Branch in conjunction with the restructuring of the Capital Procurement Organisation. The Branch is responsible for export policy and programs, and for providing a continuing focus on the development of collaborative arrangements with other countries for capital equipment production. Although initially established as a Level 1, the work value has been reassessed in the light of changes in responsibility. The scope of the industry operations functions has increased with a greater emphasis being given to commercialisation, exports and offsets. Additionally, the following functions have been added:</PARA>
<PARA> long term Nomad continuing support which involves authorising and controlling expenditure of around $2m per year;</PARA>
<PARA> administration of the CODOCK Trading Agreement Lease;</PARA>
<PARA> oversight of establishment of the Western Australian ship maintenance facilities including the Commonwealth contribution of $8m; and</PARA>
<PARA> technical/implementation aspects of collaboration with overseas countries in respect of equipment development under Memoranda of Understanding currently with UK and Sweden.</PARA>
<PARA> The increase in responsibilities exercised and the wider scope of functions managed have significantly increased the work value of the position to the extent where reclassification to Level 2 was warranted. The responsibilities are directly comparable in work value terms to those exercised by the other Branch Heads in the same Division.</PARA>
<PARA> The reclassification, therefore, conforms with national wage fixing principles.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The number of Senior Executive Service positions currently on establishment is as follows:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In March 1988 the Government decided to introduce charges for Commonwealth Reporting Service (CRS) services from 1 July 1988. That decision was made on the basis of recommendations of an Efficiency Scrutiny Report that CRS charge for its services on a partial cost recovery basis constructed to reduce demand. Charges were introduced to Courts, Tribunals and Inquiries, for the recording of proceedings, and to Courts, Tribunals, Inquiries and all other users for the provision of transcript in accordance with general user pay principles.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government's decision was that any subsidy for transcript charges should not be borne by CRS. The cost of production of transcript, including subsidy in cases of hardship, was to be borne by and be identifiable with the appropriate agency rather than CRS. Any party suffering hardship as a result of having to meet the cost of transcript should seek assistance from an appropriate agency, such as Legal Aid, as is the case in relation to other costs associated with litigation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In view of the Government's decision that CRS should charge all users of transcript and that the cost of any exemption from such charges not be borne by CRS, the question of determining impecuniosity is not one for consideration by CRS.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Upon receipt of an order for transcript, CRS provides a copy of that transcript to the person or organisation placing the order and subsequently issues an invoice. If the amount is not paid the credit facility is no longer available to that customer. Upon payment of the outstanding amount, the credit facility is restored to the customer. Until the outstanding amount is paid, CRS will not supply any further transcript to that customer except upon immediate payment of the charges for that additional transcript. In cases of genuine hardship assistance may be obtained from appropriate agencies (see (2) above).</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Transcripts are not edited but it is not unusual for a Court or Tribunal to request CRS to provide an abridged transcript of proceedings in an effort to conserve resources, reduce the cost of producing transcript and enable CRS to provide a more timely service.</PARA>
<PARA> An abridged transcript is readily identifiable by the notation `Recorded: Not Transcribed' in the body of the transcript. Of course, CRS retains the original tape recordings and/or shorthand notes of the untranscribed segment(s) of proceedings and it is open to the Court or Tribunal, or a party to the proceedings, to order a complete, unabridged, verbatim transcript of those proceedings.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr West</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1987-88 the procedure for booking Commonwealth cars for electorate staff of Members and Senators required staff to telephone the Transport Booking Office at the appropriate branch of the Transport and Storage Group of the Department of Administrative Services quoting the hire code of the Member or Senator and the transport requirement. Staff had access to car transport at government expense when directed to travel under the electorate office staff travel entitlement. Staff were expected to nominate the lower cost service supplied by the Transport and Storage Group. Because costs were charged to Members and Senators it is not possible to provide an accurate cost of electorate staff use of Commonwealth cars. Departmental records show however that identifiable electorate office staff car transport costs in 1987-88 were $133,594.</PARA>
<PARA> Similar arrangements applied to the staff of Ministers and Office-holders when travelling at their direction. Separate hire codes existed for these staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In 1988-89 there has been no change in the booking procedure other than the use of separate hire codes for electorate office staff. Staff have also been reminded that the standard level of service should be utilised. Staff access to car services has been extended to enable them to carry out their duties within the electorate or State including the State Capital and in Canberra as directed by their Member or Senator.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In 1988-89 a budget approach for electorate staff travel was introduced. Electorate staff travel costs are met from a budget and staff also have access to car transport when travelling within the electorate at the direction of the Member or Senator. Each electorate office has been issued with a hire code to be used when making staff car bookings. The budget approach provides an incentive for offices choosing to select lower cost services.</PARA>
<PARA> The revised staff travel arrangements are designed to increase the productive capacity of staff and thereby form a major offset required for awarding the Second Tier salary increase to electorate staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements for access to Commonwealth car transport have been clarified and it is expected that for the same level of expenditure on car transport more flexible travel arrangements will be possible. Staff travel costs will no longer be shown on the record as having been undertaken by Members and Senators.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No additional administrative costs are involved with the revised arrangements. It is expected that closer attention to the cost of services will result in a greater capacity for staff to travel with a budget neutral outcome.</PARA>
