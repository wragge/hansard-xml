<PARA> We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that,</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>

<PARA> Take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>

<TITLE>Gold Producers: Tax</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned endorse the actions of Graeme Campbell, MP, in pursuing his stance against removing company tax exemptions for gold producers. We further commend the work of the Western Australian Government to have the Federal Government's decision on gold tax reversed.</PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the assistance provided to Australian manufacturing industry, the taxation arrangement applying to gold is transparent and therefore an easy target. Moreover, because of the concentration of the industry in remote areas of Western Australia, far from Canberra, the legitimate voice of the industry is drowned out by special interest groups close to the capital.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed change to the gold taxation regime has already produced substantial distortions in exploration drilling activity and development plans of gold mines. Exploration drilling has declined and there is a real risk that some mines could begin the high grading of their orebodies which will shorten the life of the mine.</PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Government has strongly opposed the proposed tax changes because of these distorting effects.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:-</PARA>
<PARA> Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the Parliament require the Hawke-Keating Government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families.</PARA>

<PARA> 3. The Australian Taxation Office disregarded its privacy obligations by sending out a large number of tax file number letters during March in unsealed envelopes.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Australian Taxation Office extended the deadline for employee declarations beyond the 31st March as defined by section 202C (4) (a) of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988 but failed to obtain a Proclamation from the Governor-General for this extension as stipulated by section 202C (4) (b) of the Act.</PARA>

<PARA> The majority of World War II servicewomen, together with thousands of wartime servicemen who also did not hesitate to volunteer their services in the Defence Forces of Australia at a time when their country was at serious risk from an implacable enemy, did not serve in a theatre of war. This was not of their own choosing but as a result they are not eligible for a Service Pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> Many receive a Disability Pension because of injuries or conditions resulting from or attributable to their wartime `home service' in Australia's Defence Forces and the fact that they did not serve in a theatre of war does not lessen their disabilities which have caused them considerable pain and frustration and spoilt their quality of life over a long period.</PARA>
<PARA> Any Disability Pension received by a Service Pensioner is not income for the assessment of basic Service Pension but is considered as income by the Department of Social Security, at times meaning the loss of fringe benefits as well as reducing the amount of Age Pension granted because of compensation for injuries or conditions accepted by determining authorities as war-caused. A Disability Pension is considered as combined income in the case of a married couple when the rate of Age Pension entitlement is being assessed.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the parliament will determine that-</PARA>
<PARA> Social Security Legislation be amended to correct the anomaly which exists in the inclusion of a war veteran's Disability Pension in the assessment of income for the purposes of the Department of Social Security when it is not income for the purposes of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, this being an injustice which discriminates against the veterans of World War II who did not serve in a theatre of war.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give these matters earnest consideration and request the Rumanian Government to abandon these horrific acts against the Rumanian Community and its minorities.</PARA>

<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9F4">Mr DONALD CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just presented on behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure recommends that the House alter its procedures for the election of Speaker at the first sitting of a Parliament or at any time when the position becomes vacant. The Procedure Committee's consideration of this matter was instigated by a request from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that it consider the matters raised in notice of a motion given by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). The motion proposed that the member with the longest continuous service who is not a Minister or Opposition officeholder preside at any election of the Speaker of the House. Our standing orders relating to the election of Speaker developed from the practice in the United Kingdom House of Commons where, for over three centuries, the Clerk of the House acted as chairman of the House during the election. Our Standing Orders contained detailed rules regarding the conduct of ballots for the election which were adopted by the House in 1937 and which the Committee does not propose to alter. This report is confined to the question of who should preside during the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that the member with the longest cumulative service in the House preside during the election of Speaker, both at the beginning of a Parliament and when a vacancy occurs in the course of a Parliament. The Committee has proposed this change for two reasons. The first is that it gives the House the opportunity to recognise and honour long-standing service to the House by a member. Secondly, it removes the House from a potentially vulnerable situation as the member presiding can be vested with the powers of the Speaker to apply the Standing Orders to deal with any difficulties that may arise. Under the current rules, the Clerk performs certain duties which are limited to what has been described as the `mechanical aspects'. He calls on members to speak, draws attention to the fact that a member's time has expired and puts the question if the closure is moved. As stated in House of Representatives Practice, however, many questions as to the role of the Clerk remain undetermined and it is unclear as to just what action he could take if members engaged in disorderly conduct. The House has been very well served by the Clerks in the past but there have been occasions where they have been placed in a difficult position. The action of the Clerk was questioned both during and after the election of Speaker Salmon in 1909 and during the election of Speaker Bell in 1934. </PARA>
<PARA> I add that the changes proposed are similar to those made by the United Kingdom House of Commons in 1972. More recently, the Canadian House of Commons adopted major changes to its procedures for the election of Speaker, including the provision that the member who has the longest period of unbroken service preside at the election of Speaker at the opening of a Parliament. The report proposes that the member with the longest period of cumulative service preside at any election of Speaker, but that it would not be appropriate for any Minister, party leader or deputy leader or Whip to preside. The duty would not be compulsory. Proposed standing order 2 (f) stipulates that until the Speaker is elected, the Chair is taken by the member `available' who has served for the longest period as a member. In the event of more than one eligible member fulfilling the criterion for length of service it is expected that, after consultation, commonsense will prevail in the determination of which member will preside. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the member presiding shall enjoy all the powers exercised by the Speaker during the proceedings, except that he or she shall have a deliberative vote only when casting a vote in the election of Speaker and in any division in the House. Should there be an equality of votes in any division in the House the member presiding would not have a casting vote and the question would not be carried as there would not have been a majority vote. I believe that the changes proposed will give the House the chance to recognise longstanding service, will remove the House from potentially vulnerable situations and will be supported by all members. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I originally proposed this matter and I spoke to it at that time. I would first like to thank the Standing Committee on Procedure for the report that has come forward arising from that, and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) for having it dealt with without the necessity of a long and protracted debate in this House. It does change a tradition which has existed in this Parliament for nearly 90 years. As has already been said, there have been only two occasions when problems have arisen, but there have been occasions when the potential for very difficult circumstances was there, and it was avoided by a handful of votes in the electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to the consequences had not the then honourable member for Moreton, Sir James Killen, been elected in the 1961 election, when we would have had a circumstance in the Parliament where both parties had an equal number of voting members on the floor of the chamber and there were two non-voting members, both of whom were members of the Opposition. In theory, in the vote for the election of the Speaker, the Opposition could have had a majority of two. Had it nominated one of the non-voting members, that could have changed the majority on the floor of the Parliament by the fact that the Constitution would have given the non-voting member a casting vote. I think this matter as to the eligibility of the member for the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory would have been debated at considerable length on the floor of the Parliament. If I might say so, on the election of the Speaker, unless the Government then elected was stupid, it would have given them both full voting rights, which was within the power of the Parliament. But it would have been an impossible position for the Clerk, because there would have been rulings sought and other attempts to move motions in the course of those events which would have been part of the proceedings of the Parliament in a way other than the ceremonial function, which was and is normally expected to be that of the election of Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been mentioned that there have been problems on an earlier occasion. I warn that with the proposal to televise Parliament and the more spectacular type of publicity that is available and is obtained in this Parliament, in the circumstance even in the election of a Speaker, where there are literally no powers at the moment to discipline a member for whatever action he takes in this House during that period, there would be the temptation-it is not for me to say whether anyone would succumb to that temptation-for a member to act in a manner which was not in keeping with normal standards of, and would normally not be acceptable to, the House, and get a lot of publicity out of it. That has to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Should a crisis arise during that period, I believe the Clerk's prime responsibility would be to ensure that the proper advice was available to the person in the chair, which is not always possible when one has to concentrate on other duties. We have been well served in the past, but we should follow other parliaments in this change. It is not a momentous change and it will not make a great deal of difference to the operations of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that we have to examine much more significant changes to the manner in which we do business in this Parliament. We now have the facilities to change. The sooner we bite the bullet and examine the manner in which we do business-I have long advocated that we have both plenary and committee sessions of this House in order to conduct our business-the sooner the Parliament's efficiency levels will be raised and the sooner the Parliament will function as a parliament should. I think it does not do that now. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter which is of importance in this motion, that is, that it recognises the longest serving member of the House. It has already been pointed out that that has been done in other chambers. I draw attention to the fact that on the last occasion a Speaker was elected in the House of Commons, Sir James Callaghan, a recently defeated Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, took the chair. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) notes that the world population is now in excess of five billion people, of whom three billion reside in Asia;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) considers that the overriding problem facing the world is that of a rapidly increasing population which is making ever increasing demands on the world's natural resources, thereby threatening ever greater environmental damage; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) considers that this population problem is the most serious aspect of the world's overall environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Many issues are raised each day in this Parliament; yet one topic that gets little mention is that of the rapidly increasing world population. Perhaps it is because we, as members of parliament, or indeed our constituents, do not see population as a problem for Australia. I would suggest that of all the problems facing this planet, the overriding one must be that of the rapidly increasing population. Australia, with a population of just over 16 million and a population density of 2.2 people per square kilometre, does not face the population related problems of many other countries. Indeed, for many years, through our own immigration program, we have sought to increase significantly our population. </PARA>
<PARA> Geographically we are part of Asia. Last year, in his launching address on the day of three billion in Asia, the Hon. Tasko Sato, Chairman of the Asian Forum on Population and Development, said that the Asian population is increasing by 54.5 million a year-about 4,540,000 people, on average, every month or 150,000 people every day. Indeed, seven babies are born every second. We, in Australia, cannot remove ourselves from the population problems of Asia. It is not only an Asian Problem; it is a world problem. For this reason, I am pleased that Australia is a member of the Asian Forum on Population and Development. Indeed, I represent Australia on the executive of this important group. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. Nowadays we hear much about the greenhouse effect. It is a serious problem, but it is a problem that has been created, as some would say, by the overdeveloped world. I get rather angry when I hear well meaning groups in the United States of America, Australia, Germany, Britain and other countries lecturing to Brazilians about the dangers of cutting down the Amazonian rainforests. Of course it would be a tragedy if that happened and of course it would have a dramatic and disastrous impact. But the Brazilians did not cause the problem; the industrialised countries did. What we are, in effect, saying to the Brazilians is, `Look, the whole ecological balance is so precarious that you people must stay in your position of under-development so that we can continue with our own present lifestyle'. If we were really serious about the greenhouse effect, we in Australia, the United States of America, Germany or other industrialised countries will fundamentally change our lifestyle. We would reduce our over-indulgent lifestyle so that others can catch up. Then, in a cooperative manner, we can with some credibility approach the Brazilians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just as we cannot opt out of the environmental debate, nor can we opt out of the population debate. It is our debate as much as the debate of the people of China, India or anywhere else. In recent years, India has achieved tremendous success in agriculture, industrial production, science and technology and in diversifying the capabilities in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. Yet we have to recognise that each month India's population increases by approximately one million people. The Asian population broke the one billion mark in the 1950s. During August 1988 the Asian population reached the three billion mark. Population growth in Asia is still huge, not because population is so huge, not because the population growth is so high but rather because the population base is immense. The excessive population growth will result in shortages of food, resources and energy, which are limited on earth, and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries. Not only will it threaten the living base of human beings but it will also have the power to cancel out civilised society, even with the technological innovations and economic developments society has produced. </PARA>
<PARA> Asia, with its huge population, has problems of population growth, food, environment and development. To cope with these problems, Asian countries must build up their base of socioeconomic development to facilitate the absorption of the young labour force, improve agriculture productivity and industrialisation, diffuse education and improve health and medical services. </PARA>
<PARA> Population and environment issues are closely related when viewed from a global perspective. The world population passed the five billion mark two years ago and it is still increasing by 220,000 people a day, or more than 80 million people a year. A simple calculation tells us that it is increasing by one billion people every 12 years and it is expected that 90 per cent of the increase in population will be from developing countries. On the other hand, tropical forests are decreasing at the rate of 12 million hectares per year due to burning of fuels, commercial deforestation and the loss of top soil amounting to 26 billion tonnes a year. Elements such as unstable rainfall added to over-cultivation on sterile land, due to the pressures of population growth, as well as pasturing and excessive consumption of trees for firewood or charcoal, are aggravating soil, reducing farmland and promoting desertification. Six million hectares of new desert is created every year. It is a depressing picture to which we in Australia have not paid nearly enough attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Population policy should play a vital part when drawing up and promoting a national development plan for a country. We need to have a total policy, including environmental conservation measures, in a development plan. Based on such a total policy, we can strive for the stabilisation of population and environmental protection in an effort to actualise the sustainable development proposed by the World Committee on Environment and Development. Continuous and stronger support in this field is strongly expected from advanced countries. As I have attempted to illustrate, there is a close and inseparable relationship between population and environmental problems. It is absolutely necessary to strengthen cooperation beyond national boundaries in order to stabilise the population and to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth rate for Asia as a whole is lower than that for Africa or Latin America. Because Asia has such a large population base, the total number of people in Asia will continue to grow rapidly for some time to come. As stated, the Asian population is currently increasing by 54.5 million people every year. Even by the year 2025 the Asian population will be more than half the projected world population of 8.2 billion people. Population growth varies greatly among the different subregions of Asia. It has already declined substantially in South East Asia, and in many countries programs are beginning to show impressive results. However, in the countries of southern Asia, with the exception of Sri Lanka, the growth rate continues to be high. </PARA>
<PARA> Asia's population of three billion is in many ways a testimony to the victory achieved over the region's age-old enemies-famine and high mortality. What is clear now is the need for Asia, like other developing regions, to continue to lower birth rates, to stimulate economic growth and food production, and to provide jobs and food for its increasing population. This, I admit, is not an easy task, but Asia provides a good example of both what can be done and what needs to be done in the future. Asia's patterns of growth and associated problems are in many ways typical of other developing regions. They pose grave problems for the future. One of the most disconcerting is that, while population in the industrialised countries has slowed or stopped, it continues to grow rapidly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This global population imbalance poses dangers to the environment, to international trade and, indeed, to peace. </PARA>
<PARA> When population growth outstrips its natural resource base it begins to destroy it. The destruction of trees and forests causes deserts to spread and creates worldwide climatic changes. Countries which have to devote much of their energies to cope with high population growth have little chance of economic improvement. This requires awareness and commitment by national political leaders; the creation, where they do not already exist, of government units to direct population efforts and resources; and strong population institutions to conduct research and to train population managers. </PARA>
<PARA> The population of the world is now more than five billion, and it will reach six billion before the end of the century, seven billion by the year 2010, and eight billion by 2022. Although overall the world's growth rate is declining, the numbers are such that the annual increase will continue to grow for another decade. Some 90 per cent of population growth is occurring in the developing world-by definition, in the countries least able to afford it. At the same time, the population of the industrialised nations has largely stopped growing. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments of high fertility countries are being forced to spend increasing amounts on essentials and have little left over for investment. For example, Kenya spends about one-third of its total budget on education, health, rural water supply and urban housing. If fertility rates remain high, total government expenditures on these items will have to be multiplied by a factor of nine just to maintain current standards. Because of the increasing outflow of capital from the developing countries for essential imports and for debt service, governments are spending proportionally less on social investments, such as in the education and health areas. The differential levels of development, international inequalities, coupled with acute poverty and lower incomes in many developed countries in the post World War II era, force the international community to think in terms of concerted international community efforts to attack the problems of poverty. The high population growth negated the fruits of development to the poor in the developing countries. Naturally, attention was focused on tackling the problems of such high population growth.</PARA>
<PARA> I have devoted much time in this speech to an overview of the Asian situation, but we in Australia cannot give advice from afar. Indeed, I do not think we can give advice at all, but we can give assistance to world bodies such as the United Nations in solving the problem. We must also take seriously our role in the Asian Forum on Population and Development. Let us dispel the myth that politicians are short-sighted and not capable of seeing and appreciating the issue over a longer timeframe. We must start to confront the issues with determination and on the basis of dialogue and consensus, with the unified and integrated objective of a better future for the countries of our region. We in Australia have a role to play and we must take up the challenge. We cannot isolate ourselves. We cannot continue to think in the short term, and we can no longer think only of Australia. We must think globally and, indeed, we must match our words with action. Threats to the very survival of the human race, so evident as the twentieth century approaches its end, and the need to deal with those threats more effectively at the political level, are forcing us to act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that humanity has been reckless in the use of the planet's resources for development. Since the industrial revolution, in the name of progress, we have fouled air, water and soil worldwide. As populations increase resources are strained beyond their limits and environmental refugees migrate from the rural areas to the cities and across national boundaries. Despite technological advances, some 40,000 children die each day from preventable causes-malnutrition, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, measles and other diseases. The current world population growth of between 2 and 3 per cent is maintained through very high fertility which imposes special burdens on women, particularly high mortality and morbidity related to childbearing. Today, many societies are no longer threatened by high mortality, yet individual women and children are still dying needlessly because of high fertility exacerbated by poverty and the lack of health care. </PARA>
<PARA> The world agreed at three different United Nations conferences, in Teheran, Bucharest and Mexico, that family planning is a human right. Delegates agreed also that its oppression discriminates against the poor, the ignorant and the illiterate. I must say that I have always seen it as a basic human right for a woman to control her own fertility and, naturally, she must have access to information to do this. Giving parents the right to plan their own family voluntarily can improve everyone's health as well as that of their children, and bring rapid population growth under control. A sound population policy is essential to sustainable economic development. Perhaps one of the outcomes from the 1990 International Year of Literacy will enable people to gain access to printed literature to better control their fertility. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me, in the time remaining, return to the wording of this notice of motion. Since I have been speaking the world's population has increased by 2,550 persons. By this time next year it will have increased by 80 million worldwide and in Asia by 54 million people. This increasing population must be the overriding problem facing the world. We have no hope of solving environmental problems-indeed, a whole range of problems-unless we tackle this, the main problem. I hope that, in the many issues that we as politicians face every day, we can devote more time to this issue. If we do not I ask: What sort of future will we and future generations have?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is significant that today, as on so many other occasions since private members' business has been allocated more time and importance, two honourable members have taken the opportunity to draw our attention beyond the short term and party political issues to long term fundamental and global issues. I refer to the motion of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) on human rights in Brazil and to the motion of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) on population pressures on the global environment. I commend the honourable member for Throsby for his very cohesive and succinct speech which drew our attention to this very serious problem. It is on the latter motion that I have chosen to make some comments. The honourable member for Throsby has asked the House today to look beyond its debating chamber to those countries and regions which are under enormous resource and environmental pressure, and which are failing to cope with or meet those pressures. He asks us-I believe correctly-to consider our own involvement and responsibilities concerning what he implicitly presents as the overpopulation of this very fragile planet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion proposed by the honourable member asks us to identify increasing population as the overriding problem facing the world and as the most serious aspect of the world's overall environmental problems. I believe that, while population growth is a serious problem facing the global community, it should not become the primary focus of policy solutions. I make that judgment, firstly, because of the repressive and inhuman policies of forced sterilisation and state-coerced abortion and infanticide which have characterised past and current experience in India and China when population became the central focus of state development policy. </PARA>
<PARA> My second reason is that such a focus would be analytically erroneous and, more importantly, politically dishonest. The real priority areas to be addressed when responding to unsustainable population growth are, firstly, socioeconomic and, secondly, technological and scientific. We know that one of the most significant factors affecting population growth is poverty and infant mortality rates. We know that by attacking poverty and the economic vulnerability of families in developing countries, and by attacking infant disease and mortality, we do, in fact, address the underlying disincentives for having fewer children. The honourable member for Throsby spoke very clearly on that issue. We are reminded that relentlessly every year over 14 million children under the age of five die from malnutrition and poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> I used the phrase `politically dishonest' earlier. I did so because we know that to tackle infant mortality and poverty and dependence in developing countries we have to tackle corrupt traditional and socialist agricultural systems, unfettered industrialisation of both capitalist and socialist varieties and oppressively hierarchical social and cultural systems such as caste systems, in most of the countries facing population pressure. The political reality is that it is a lot easier to focus on family planning and contraceptives, and to resort to sterilisation and abortion in those countries, than it is to undertake political, social and economic reforms. So, the point of focus should not be human sexual relations but human social relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The second priority area I raised was technological and scientific. I want to say two things in that regard, one negative and one positive. The reason population growth by humans seems to present the earth's environment and the earth's other life forms with a zero-sum dilemma is not with the fact of human existence in increasing numbers, but the choices humans make, particularly in the area of technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The greenhouse effect, which was referred to by the honourable member for Throsby and is on everybody's mind at the moment, has to do primarily with the automobile, power generation and industrialisation. The threat to the ozone layer has to do with the use of spray cans and refrigerators and other chemical products. Erosion of soils has to do with land management techniques. Oil spills and deforestation alike have to do with the resource demands of modern industrial societies. So, the policy focus should not be human fertility, in the first instance, but human technology. Increasingly, the answer must be a policy mix of incentives and sanctions which delivers modern society alternative, appropriate technologies and which nurtures attitudinal change in industrial consumer society. </PARA>
<PARA> The positive comment I wish to make about technology and science relates to the hopes we justifiably hold about human intelligence. In the early 1970s dire predictions about starvation and resource exhaustion were made. In the late 1980s we know that many of those predictions were falsified by human scientific and technological breakthroughs. We should continue to encourage and fund human ingenuity, especially in the areas of earth repair and earth sustenance. I have suggested that population pressure is a problem to be addressed, not on the surface by family planning strategies, but radically by reference to the patterns of human, social, economic, political and technological structures, relations and techniques. I have suggested a primary focus on human social relations and on technology, rather than on human sexual relations and fertility in the search for policy responses to population pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that unsustainable population growth, and its environmental consequences, can be met by strategies which deal with poverty and dependence and by the move to alternative technology and models of development. These are the two areas of challenge we are forced to consider. As I have said before, we should commend the honourable member for Throsby for drawing our attention to those areas via his motion on population. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been dealing with matters of the head during this short debate. I would prefer to end my comments by dealing with matters of the compassionate and outreaching heart. We know of the human misery of over- populated cities in Africa, Asia, Latin America and other parts of the world. We know that peoples of developing countries are unable to survive, through famine, flood and erosion, or because of state agricultural and development policies and priorities. We know, as I have said before, that 14 million children under the age of five die each year because of disease and malnutrition-almost the population of Australia is dying relentlessly every year. Throughout this country, and throughout the world, we need to think about that fact continuously in a practical and compassionate way. Most of all, we know that, as we talk, there are others who are the front-line providers of compassion: providers of healing, sustenance and opportunity for those who suffer around the world. I think of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, the Save the Children Fund, the Evangelical Alliance Relief Response Fund-the TEAR Fund-the Catholic Relief Fund, World Vision and many, many others. I take this opportunity to acknowledge their commitment and their work. I also take this opportunity to suggest to this Parliament, and to the community at large, that perhaps we still have not provided the levels of support in cash or otherwise that these workers require to tackle poverty, dependence and equality. I challenge this Parliament and the people of Australia to have a much more compassionate heart and support, through these organisations, people who are in such desperate need in this great world of ours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise and support the motion put before the House today by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). Earlier in this debate the honourable member made an extremely worthwhile and valuable contribution to this House. The debate shows that many honourable members do not just go from issue to issue. They attempt to address the very difficult issues which affect all of us in the longer term, particularly those in the Asian region. This is important in the context of the motion before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The member for Throsby mentioned that today the world population is in excess of five billion people. It is estimated, depending on whose estimates one accepts, that by the year 2100 the world population will be in excess of 10 billion people. In other words, in the next hundred years, we can, in all probability, expect that the world population will double again from around five billion people to 10 billion people. It was not so many years ago-1960, in fact-when the world population was only 3 billion people. So the growth which is occurring in the world population is quite dramatic and its implications for our survival, for living standards, for the environment around the world and for the resources of the planet are very significant. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to some of the work that has been done in this area in relation to the world population. In 1988 a report was released by the United Nations (UN) entitled State of World Population. It is a very good report which basically concludes that the growth rate continues to widen the gap between the rich developed countries such as Australia, where the birth rate is low and per capita income is high, and the poor developing nations, which include much of Asia and Africa, where birth rates are high and incomes are pitifully low. The report exposes the distortions in production, trade and demand which have occurred. World food production, as members of this House would know, is quite adequate to feed everyone in the world. Yet one person in six throughout the world is unable to obtain sufficient food to sustain an active working life. So there is no shortage of food in the world, certainly not at this point, but there are serious problems in the way in which it is distributed around the world. While the Western World, the developed world, is able to stockpile grain and butter, the people of the poorest nations often lack the money and resources to feed themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Improvements in farming methods have not been able to reverse the trend. For instance, African food production has increased by something like 20 per cent in the past decade but the population growth has substantially outstripped it, leaving per capita food production some 10 per cent below its 1977 level. So productivity is occurring in the way in which land is used, but in many of the less developed nations population growth rates, which are still very high, are simply outstripping the rate of agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report State of World Population, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities warns of the serious economic and social circumstances facing the developed nations unless both the developed and the undeveloped nations are able to rein in population growth rates. Australia's population growth rate is about one per cent. The growth rate is below one per cent in the United States of America, Japan and West Germany and a little over one per cent in China. In Kenya, which is the fastest growing country, it is 4 per cent and that country's population is expected to double to 40 million people by the year 2005. The United Nations report makes an interesting point. In 1950 Africa's population was half that of Europe but it is expected to be three times as large as that of Europe before the year 2050. It is already larger and will be three times as large within the next 60 years. One gets an idea from that of the dramatic impact which population growth can have. </PARA>
<PARA> In turn, that affects relative standards of living. I make a comparison here, which is mentioned in the report, between Brazil and Japan. In 1960 Brazil's gross national product (GNP) was $900 per person compared to $1,400 in Japan. There was not a great deal of difference. But over the next 25 years Brazil's GNP grew at between 5 per cent and 10 per cent per year and it now stands at only $2,000 per person. Japan, with much smaller population rises but a similar economic growth rate, now has a per capita GNP of $16,000 per head. The relevance of those population growth figures in terms of living standards is quite dramatic. So, according to this UN report, there is a very clear link between population growth and health. It is too clear to be denied. </PARA>
<PARA> While I support the motion before the House, I want to say that in terms of world resources it simply is not good enough to suggest that the major demands on world resources or the problems for the world's ecosystems are caused primarily by the rapid population growth which is occurring throughout undeveloped nations. If one looks at the statistics of who consumes the world's resources, it is the people of Western civilisations-the developed countries like Australia and the United States-who consume many times more resources per head than those people who live in the underdeveloped nations. If one looks at the consumption of oil, electricity, energy in general, tin or even food-all of the crucial and fundamental resources of the world, the basic products-one sees that each of us, as well as our family pets, in developed countries, consume more resources per day than many people in the underdeveloped countries of the world. The real drain on resources is coming just as much from the excessive consumption habits of people in the developed world as it is from the enormous population growth in the underdeveloped world. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of points can be made. The first one is that since we are talking in this motion about demands on the world resources and environment, it is important that we embrace strategies in the developed world which tend to put a lid on the consumption of resources. Perhaps we can do that through pricing mechanisms, as we in the developed world seem to do fairly well. Some countries ensure that consumption of oil is not too excessive by imposing high prices for it. We can also look at embracing strategies like recycling. Countries like Australia can make a significant impact on resource use simply by re-using resources. Recycled paper is an obvious example. I hope that the proposal of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for a mill to make unbleached paper comes off because it is the sort of project which offers potential for recycling in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The other side of the coin is that developed countries should still be doing much more to assist underdeveloped countries in terms of foreign aid and development programs. As a member of the Government I have been disappointed-I know economic times have been tough in the last few years-that this Government has not been able to maintain its contribution in real terms to foreign aid in the last few years. I know that many Australians have had to make sacrifices but it concerns me greatly that as a relatively wealthy nation we have allowed our contribution to foreign aid to slip. I hope that in this year's Budget and in future Budgets we are able to lift our contribution to foreign aid above 0.4 per cent or 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product and that in the long term we meet the target of 0.7 per cent of GDP. There is no doubt that while we have had some tough economic times we are still immeasurably more wealthy and more comfortable than the vast majority of people in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a role to play in resource use. Recycling can make a contribution from the developed world's point of view and we can provide significantly more aid to underdeveloped countries to assist them. One area in which we can particularly assist underdeveloped countries is in the education area which can have a major social and cultural impact on living patterns. It can make a major impact on issues such as birth rates in underdeveloped and developing countries and on understanding in those countries of the way in which they use their resources and the environment. I support the motion which is before the House. It has provided the opportunity for a valuable discussion. I hope that Australia can make a contribution towards overcoming some of these problems by providing an increase in the amount of resources which we provide annually for foreign aid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to take part in this very important debate because there is no doubt in my mind that this motion, when it says that `the population problem is the most serious aspect of the world's overall environmental problems', correctly focuses our attention on a very important issue that faces the whole world. Some time ago I came across a quotation that I found very interesting, and it reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What kind of spirit is there in a society which does not have the gumption to replace itself?</PARA>
<PARA>That quotation was made in relation to the Western industrialised countries whose population growth rate has fallen below the replacement level. Of course, one could vary that quotation and have it read `What kind of spirit is there in a society which does not have the gumption to avoid destroying itself?' and apply it to the world society. Both expressions of that quotation are equally correct because the problem of world population varies from country to country and from region to region. </PARA>
<PARA> As was pointed out earlier in this debate, the world's population is growing fast and will continue to grow fast. Even if as from tomorrow every country were able to achieve a replacement rate fertility level of no growth and no decline on a long term basis, there would be population growth in the world for the next 100 years. That population growth of itself would be difficult enough to cope with, but many of the big countries in population terms have fertility rates far in excess of the replacement rate. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974 the agenda of an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference held in Tokyo included the topic of world population. Until the early 1970s, the question of population growth was regarded as the preserve of the demographer and the academic economist in the universities. There was not much political debate about the question of population growth. At that conference, members of parliaments from over 100 countries debated the issue. I was fortunate enough to be at the conference. I was impressed then, and have remained impressed since, by the common view, with one exception to which I will refer, that was expressed by members of parliament from a diverse range of countries from the four corners of the world that the world faced a population problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The one exception was the tragic area of central, east and west Africa. Because of the state of political development, the representatives from that area believed that talking about population control and limiting the expansion of world numbers was an attack on their ability to develop by those they regarded as former colonialists. One only has to look at the tragedy of central, east and west Africa since then-the desertification of the sub-Sahara desert and the famines that have affected those countries on top of internal political strife. I think the rest of the world has observed with horror that lack of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has brought this matter forward. During the debate some honourable members have said that it is not for us to tell other countries how to manage their affairs. But it is for us, having the experience of our own development and having an understanding of the development that is occurring in other countries, to play a part in the world political community, to draw attention to those countries which do not understand the damage that will be done to the survival of the human race if efforts are not made to restrict unbridled population growth. Where the population growth is growing at a very fast rate, the population is living at subsistence level and sometimes very much below that level. Yet those people have a yearning to have a higher standard of living, which they all deserve. The green revolution has shown that the world can get its act together and feed itself. We need to get our act together to uplift the standard of living for people in those countries where, for the most part, large populations are living at a subsistence or lower level. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some dilemmas, because we in Australia, as with other peoples of the developed world, have a different problem. We have to look at how we will replace our population. It seems very perverse that we should be advocating an increase in our fertility rates while expressing concern at the very high fertility rates in other countries. The world population is a function of those fertility rates, but it is also a function of mortality rates and, increasingly, mortality rates are having an effect on the increasing world population. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that members of parliament in all countries around the world are conscious of the effects of population growth. We should be having debates on how fertility rates, mortality rates and infant mortality rates affect population growth, and on a whole range of other interrelated issues that affect the future destiny of this world. We do not want a world society that destroys itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, while welcoming advances for the provision of human rights contained in Brazil's newly adopted constitution, this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) conveys to the President of Brazil its concerns about the killings of peasants, indigenous peoples, rural trade union leaders, lawyers and religious workers in the areas of rapid economic development;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Brazilian Government to take urgent measures to ensure that the rule of law is applied equally throughout Brazil and that goodfaith investigations be undertaken into those reported political killings; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) urges the Brazilian Government it ensure that prompt and effective inquiries are made into allegations of arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment of peasants by local law enforcement agents. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion will be seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner). It is with a great deal of pleasure that I have come to the House today to move this motion, which I have put firmly on the record for those who might wish to read what I have to say or who are listening in to this debate. I think all honourable members are familiar with the fact that I am a member of Amnesty International and am involved with the parliamentary group of Amnesty. The honourable member for Hughes is also involved in that group and is its President. A large number of members of this Parliament are associated with that unique organisation. All are no doubt familiar with the fact that Amnesty's charter obliges it to take up the cases of people who are locked up around the world because of their political views-people who are known as prisoners of conscience. Its activities have two other arms, which, simply stated, are its opposition to the use of the death penalty and its abhorrence of the use of torture on people who are incarcerated. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this motion to do with Amnesty? Amnesty is very much concerned when the rule of law in any country breaks down to a point where large numbers of people are unable to rely upon the legal system and law enforcement agencies to protect their personal well-being, in many cases their lives and their property. We have, unfortunately, seen in Brazil-and it has been recorded and documented over some years-a breakdown in the rule of law as we understand it. We have consistent, well documented reports of a pattern of human rights violations in rural areas of that country, carried out by local authorities or with their acquiescence. That is the situation about which we are speaking. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know from news reports that we have seen-I have one before me from Time of March-about the changes that are taking place in Brazil, the quest for development and the impact that that development is having upon the community. Environmentalists are concerned about the destruction of the jungles of Brazil and the erection of dams which displace large numbers of people. I think it is generally understood that a large number of indigenous people, the Indians, in Brazil are likely to be displaced by these developments. The Indian population in that country is about 220,000, and it will be affected by particular proposals. It is already threatened in numerous other ways but is now also threatened by the changes that the Government has been encouraging to bring in. These changes, of course, involve the international community. The World Bank in particular is being called upon to fund a number of dam developments. Many others who are likely to benefit from the access to water see opportunities for the exploitation of land that has not previously been available. So there is a tremendous conflict between those who see land as a traditional matter and are living in a traditional lifestyle and those who seek to graze livestock in one form or another or bring land under cultivation and who make claims for land and find these competing interests to be a distraction. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty does not seek to involve itself in resolving the question of land ownership. However, it does say that, in the context of resolving those matters, governments have to have regard to the human rights of those who are likely to be affected. Amnesty reports indicate that there are some 50 cases of peasants, community leaders, trade unionists and church workers who have been killed in trying to assert claims to land and labour rights in that area. The majority of these killings appear to have been carried out by gunmen hired by landowners, speculators and rival claimants, and in some areas there are indications of direct police involvement. We see the international community saying to Brazil, `Notwithstanding your constitution, the central government has to play a role in ensuring that these matters are resolved'. This is not a matter that can be left simply to local communities to resolve as they see fit. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems is that an enormous amount of evidence is emerging that local authorities not only tolerate the human rights abuses but frequently assist in them. Official inquiries into some of these killings that have occurred have frequently jeopardised and obstructed the quest for justice. Prosecutions have invariably failed to proceed and the scale of failure in these cases suggests very strongly that the obstruction is not coincidental but rather systematic and deliberately intended to impede the effective application and equal application of the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty, when in January it published its last document that I saw on this matter, indicated that there had been over 1,000 cases of killings reported since 1980 but that it knew of only three cases in which gunmen had been convicted. There were no convictions of those who had hired those gunmen to commit those killings. Amnesty has called upon the federal authorities to open independent investigations into the cases documented and to use the federal police in parallel investigations of future cases. If we need a local example, I guess Amnesty is seeking the sort of intervention that we have seen in Australia, where concern has naturally arisen about the large number of deaths of Aboriginals in custody. Our Commonwealth Government has sought to ensure that there are no questions raised about the way in which human rights are protected in Australia and that there are proper inquiries to ascertain whether the rule of law is being properly applied or whether there have been breakdowns. We are asking that those same efforts be undertaken in Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA> In a debate of some 10 minutes it is very difficult to document the cases of those involved, but let me mention just a few. Chico Mendes was assassinated on 22 December 1988. The authorities failed to investigate six previous attempts on his life. He was one of the rural trade union presidents. Moises Vitorio dos Santos, a rural trade union president, was found shot dead and with his throat cut in November 1988. The previous month he had led a delegation to the State Governor to appeal for the disarming of gunmen in the region. In another case, Sebastiao Pereira de Souza, a squatter peasant, and his three-year old son were killed in October 1987. His widow reported it to the local police chief but he told her he could not register the crime, which she had witnessed, because he lacked pen and paper to write down the details. Over a year later no-one has been brought to trial for the murders. The widow and a local priest fled the town because they received information that their names appeared on a death list. The same list included a State deputy, Joao Batista. Gunmen shot and killed him in the presence of his family in December 1988. On the day of his murder, he told the State Legislative Assembly that two military policemen had threatened to kill him. I could go on. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest it be thought that between January and now there have not been further developments, I regret to say that the developments are not that there has been a firm intention at a federal government level to bring these matters to finality to ensure that the rule of law is applied equally and fairly. Rather, we see new allegations about excessive use of force, torture and ill-treatment. Over 1,000 State military police of Rio Grande do Sul expelled 600 peasant families which had squatted on the land in that area. Planes were used to drop tear gas and the like. The police then moved in. We received reports that 22 people had been arrested as a result of that. They have been held in detention since 11 March and they have been tortured. This gives further concern to Amnesty. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to encourage my colleagues and others to let it be known to the Brazilian Government that this form of action is reprehensible in the eyes of the international community and that there is an expectation that the United Nation's declaration on human rights ought to be upheld by the Brazilian Government. The declaration states:</PARA>
<PARA> Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. </PARA>
<PARA> No one shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> No one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. </PARA>
<PARA>This matter is of grave concern not only to the members of the Parliament involved with Amnesty but to the whole Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. It is not unusual for me to second, support or indicate my strong backing for propositions put forward in this House by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). I have great pleasure in working with the honourable member in the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International. Indeed, it is really that group which sponsors the motion before the House today. People may wonder why we in the Australian Parliament, on the other side of the world from Brazil, seek to take up these issues of human rights. The answer to that is that we, as members of parliament, believe there are certain universal standards of human rights that all people and all parliamentarians around the world ought to stand to defend. So, when human rights are violated in Brazil, we, as Australians and as Australian members of parliament, ought to do all we can to defend those universal principles of human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent times there have been incredible gains and advances in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the promotion of human rights. Much more needs to be done but, importantly, I truly believe that the concerted, coordinated campaign for human rights in the Soviet Union was a positive and contributing force to the changes that occurred in that country-as it must be for Brazil. We, in Australia, cannot sit back and allow the continual violation of human rights that the honourable member for Dundas referred to in the course of his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Dundas said, Amnesty International has investigated very thoroughly the allegations of human rights violations. it has done that by sending a number of missions to Brazil and by its own independent investigations. What has been recorded is a frightening legacy of mistreatment of our fellow human beings. The reports of Amnesty have recorded the failings and irregularities in police and judicial investigations; the difficulties in officially registering crime, as the honourable member for Dundas has so ably demonstrated; the failure of open police investigations and their premature and unexplained closure; the failures in conducting post-mortems; the failure to arrest criminal suspects; the repeated escapes from custody, in mysterious circumstances, of gunmen; the death threats that go unchecked; the continually arbitrary arrests; and the allegations of ill-treatment in custody. It has to stop. We as Australian parliamentarians, stand resolutely behind the commitment of Amnesty International to highlight these violations of human rights to the world. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate in the Parliament occurs not because of Opposition inspired motions or Government inspired motions; it comes from the parliamentarians themselves. This is an important part of parliamentary business; it is when members of the Parliament can put items on the agenda for discussion in this place. My message today goes beyond that. I believe that not only members of the Parliament but every citizen in this country who cares about what is happening in Brazil can do something about it. To the people who are listening to this parliamentary broadcast today I say: `Go to the phone book, look up Amnesty International in the capital city of your State or Territory, phone Amnesty and join us in doing what we can to make sure that these repressive governments in fact adhere to these international standards that are so vital to life on earth'. </PARA>
<PARA> I could say many things in the course of this debate but time does not permit me to continue much longer. The Australian Government has done its bit to raise these violations of human rights with the Brazilian Government. Late last year, Trish Feeney, the Amnesty International researcher for Brazil was a visitor to Australia. She told us what was happening in Brazil and asked us to approach the Australian government-as we had done before-to take up these violations of human rights. We have received formal responses from the Government which detail the repeated high level representations by the Australian Government to the Government of Brazil to answer and act on the concerns that the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International has publicly raised. When Senator Richardson went to Brazil last year on his environmental mission he intended to raise the concerns himself. He found that only three days before strong and formal representations had been made by the Australian diplomatic representatives about the violations of human rights. The Government has gone on record as saying that it will continue to monitor and make further representations to the Brazilian authorities. That is an important stand by Australia. If other countries follow our example it is going to be a far more effective international campaign, not just on the Brazilian issue but in relation to human rights generally. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe we ought to be instituting a much more formal reporting back process by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as to what actions it has taken on human rights questions and, in particular, to act on the concerns of Amnesty International. It is a very proud record of that Department. It is doing a good job for Australia and for human rights. It is important that that work, that track record, be publicly recorded in the Parliament. I commend its actions. I have great pleasure in seconding this resolution and strongly believe that it is shared by every member of this House. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House rejects the principle of separate development for Aboriginal or any other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I tend to speak as often as I can on this subject and similar subjects because I am one member of this Parliament-and I know there are many more-who is dedicated to the proposition that all Australians are equal. I believe that any nation which departs from that principle of equality of all of its citizens is going down the wrong track. I expect that because of some of the things that I will say I will be criticised and I will receive some flak. It happens every time I speak about multiculturalism as well, but I have broad shoulders and I do not mind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great principle and it is one that I think most people in this House would espouse. There is no doubt that there is a great need in some areas of Australia among some people of Australia. Whether it is a question of lack of education or employment or poor health facilities and housing those needs should be satisfied on the basis of the need itself, not on the basis of race or skin colour. I use as an example the Aboriginal community of Burnt Bridge near the town of Kempsey in my electorate of Cowper. Quite frankly, I am appalled and shocked at the conditions in which my fellow Australians are living at Burnt Bridge. There are some 57 people in this community. I know there are difficulties because of the title, but some 57 of my fellow Australians are living in this very small area. There are two decent houses but the great bulk of the people are living in wood and tin humpies with dirt floors and no running water. They have to fill buckets to get water from the decent houses. There is no sewerage and the electricity is supplied in a very dangerous fashion by power leads from the two decent houses. Something definitely needs to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My State colleague Wendy Machin, the honourable member for Manning, has been in contact with the State Minister, who the week before last was in touch with the office of our Federal Minister, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). I know that the Minister is a compassionate man and really cares. His policies are frequently, if not always, wrong but I believe he is innately sincere, caring and compassionate. His office will be in touch with me shortly. The point I want to make is that these people who need help should be helped not on the basis that they are Aboriginals. They should be helped on the basis that they are Australians who are housed in absolutely disgraceful conditions. That should apply to anybody else. I find it absolutely amazing that in 1989, after six years of the Hawke Government's supposed care for Aboriginal people and other Australians-to remain true to my theme-I still have people in my electorate who are living in such appalling conditions. </PARA>

If there is a need for some Australian citizens to be given certain help and assistance, I repeat-and I will go on repeating this forever-that aid and assistance must be given on the basis of need, not of race.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1988 the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill was introduced but it did not get too far. It set the path for separate development. It set out to create an Aboriginal Parliament in Australia. `Self-determination' and `self-government' were the words used by the Minister. As I said when debating that Bill, I deplore it; I am totally opposed to it. I believe that Aboriginal people, just the same as any other Australians, should be part of Australian society. This is where we should be going. We now have a mishmash of the ATSIC Bill in the form of the ATSIC Bill 1989 plus another couple of Bills-namely, the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill 1989 and the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill 1989. It is worth recording my approval and support of the fact that most of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs' majority reports' 40 recommendations have been accepted by the Minister. There are still quite a number of outstanding matters, four in particular, which have not been addressed. But the point is that we should not have this Bill. We should not be having a separate black parliament in Australia. We have the Federal Parliament of Australia and the State parliaments. Surely that is enough. All we are going to do if this continues is to further isolate our Aboriginal fellow citizens. That is what is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there is a backlash throughout the white community of Australia. I deplore this. I say again that I believe all Australians are equal. All Australians deserve the same care from government regardless of race or creed. We have a whole range of things in place to alleviate this problem. We have additional expenditure for Aboriginal Australians, in the areas of education, employment, housing and health over and above what is available to every other Australian citizen. As well as that, in 1989 an additional $671m is being provided for our Aboriginal brothers-a total expenditure of just over $2,900 a head over and above what every other Australian is entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth noting that some 227,645 people claim to be Aboriginals. I think it is worth making the point that the definition of what is an Aboriginal person tends to vary very frequently. When the benefits were first made available separately in the Whitlam years, many people who until then had been living as white European Australians suddenly discovered their aboriginality. We have 1.46 per cent of the Australian population claiming to be Aboriginal. I think it is worth noting that the Aboriginal people of Australia control an area of land, in the form of freehold, mission reserves and leasehold, equal to one-seventh of the entire land mass of Australia. A little over 14 per cent of the Australian land mass is controlled by Aboriginal people. This is an area roughly equal to the total area of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania. An incredible significant amount of Australian land has been given back to the Aboriginal people. I do not object to that. </PARA>

I believe, too, that it is appropriate that we should and must acknowledge the cultural heritage of our Aboriginal people, and they should be free to pursue for themselves what they want to do in creating, respecting and keeping their heritage-just as every other Australian citizen has the right to do. I have said in this place before in other debates that I am proud of my Scottish and Danish forebears; it is my right to enjoy the heritage and culture of my forebears. But I am an Australian, not a Scot or a Dane living in Australia. I believe that, if we boil it down to the crux of what our society must be, we cannot escape the absolutely valid proposition: all Australians are equal, all Australians should be equal before the law, and all Australians should be treated equally.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to contribute to this debate because this issue does concern me a lot. It is an issue which makes me very angry. I believe that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is a compassionate man, but like so many people, I do not think he has come to grips with the problem. Until such time as we do that we will never be able to solve it. We really must look at the basis of the problem, and that is the matter that I want to address today. We hear people talk about the Aboriginal problem in Australia: there is no one Aboriginal problem in Australia-there are thousands of different problems, all needing different solutions. Basically, those problems can be broken up into three groups-the communities, the fringe dwellers and the urban Aboriginals. While they overlap at the margins, they are clearly different groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my electorate I probably have more Aboriginals than any other politician in Australia. The Kalgoorlie electorate is very under-enrolled, whereas the electorate of the Northern Territory is highly enrolled. However, there are many Aboriginal communities in my electorate. I want to put on record the fact that I get a very good vote out of Aboriginal communities. I get that vote because I do not lie to them, I do not make extravagant promises and I endeavour, wherever I can, to fulfil the promises that I make. While it is true that my electorate has so many Aborigines, it is also true that the western suburbs of Sydney have more. The problems that those people have are the hardest to address. Those people are generally disunited, they are broken into family groups, they tend not to vote and they have all the same problems in relation to alcohol that generally affect low income people. The problems are going to need an enormous effort to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems will not be successfully tackled under the umbrella of Aboriginal affairs. It is quite clearly a social security problem. However, I want to make the following point very strongly. It is a great failing of the system that in Australia we are confusing poverty culture with Aboriginal culture. One often hears the comment, `We must acknowledge their culture'. What people refer to as Aboriginal culture is in many cases nothing of the sort. We are merely enshrining a poverty culture because of some misguided belief in a multicultural society. That is the truth and a reality. Nothing can be achieved until this is recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal for a moment with the question of freedom. What is freedom? If we said to people anywhere in the world that they could have political freedom or economic freedom, I can tell the House now that overwhelmingly they would take economic freedom first. They would always take economic freedom because that, inevitably, buys political freedom. Political freedom, which the Aboriginal people have had bestowed on them, does not, however, buy economic freedom. This might be a lesson to those people in society who seek to impose sanctions on South Africa. What they are doing, of course, is impeding the economic development of black Africa and therefore impeding political freedom. This is something that people should well and truly consider. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people seek to undertake measures out of an emotionally based compassion while others act for purely cynical reasons. I would suggest to the House that this occurs in Australia in respect of Aboriginal affairs. What is Aboriginal affairs policy about? Is it about advancing the position of Aboriginal people? Is it about raising their literacy levels and their health and housing standards? Those things have certainly been done, although often at the margins. Is not the question of Aboriginal affairs policy overwhelmingly about placating affluent urban white middle-class guilt? I suggest to the House-and let us not kid ourselves-that much of Aboriginal affairs policy is about exactly that. There has been a great success in this regard-such a success that we are now feeling the backlash. People are starting to talk about how much money has been put into Aboriginal affairs-and the honourable member for Cowper alluded to this. People are saying, `We have given so much help in this area, but nothing is happening'. Nothing is happening because we are going the wrong way. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be seeking to engender economic independence in these communities. There are many things that can be done, but I do not see them being done. I see obfuscation at every turn, with people tending to write off the endeavours of the communities. I find this very depressing. Why does this occur? One reason is that we have created an Aboriginal industry and people make a living out of serving this industry. It is a little bit like the position in relation to doctors: if the patient gets better, there is no work for the doctor. I suspect that there are many people in this `industry' who are simply serving their own self-interest by being there. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a high regard for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and many of the people in it. But it is a fact of life that the Department is hopelessly understaffed. The staff that it does have is hopelessly undertrained and works under extreme pressure. For those reasons, the Department is totally demoralised. Recently, when I was in western New South Wales an officer of the Department told me that the position was hopeless. He said, `I find myself competing with white people employed by Aboriginal communities who are far better educated than I. He said that they know all the ropes and all the lurks and that it is hard for him to compete. He also said that on top of that he spends all his time answering ministerial questions generated by these people and that he is never able to attend to the people who need his help. That is just so true. I see this sort of thing happening in my electorate every day of my life. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to criticise the Department when one finds that a community is suddenly $100,000 short in the store or that someone employed by the community has shot through with the funds and that no action has been taken. This is particularly frustrating for a person who has been saying to the Department that it ought to look at the situation. However, the Department cannot do so because it is understaffed, it does not have adequately trained staff and it does not have the necessary resources. Until these problems are addressed we will not get anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to think very carefully about what is happening in Aboriginal affairs, but let us not delude ourselves into thinking that this is a major problem for Australia, because it is not. Aboriginal people represent less than 2 per cent of the entire population. Two hundred years ago events changed irrevocably for Aboriginal people. They were taken over by a more advanced culture. There is no doubt about that. One can argue about whether it was a better or a worse culture, but that is irrelevant; it certainly was more advanced. It was a more warlike culture. By the standards of the day Aboriginals were not treated particularly harshly. I think Aboriginals can be thankful that they were not taken over by many other cultures that existed at the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And I do not like the honourable member's interruptions. He ought to listen to this. We have to realise that if the major culture, while being very tolerant, feels pressed hard enough or sufficiently threatened, it will simply do it again. I am frightened that a backlash will be generated in the community. It is there, and it is growing. It is growing in the country towns such as Broome, where an Aboriginal person was murdered. He was interfering with a motor car. He may have been drunk, and he was probably slightly retarded. He was a pleasant chap, a fellow who would harm no one, but he was brutally murdered. There is no other word for it. The jury found the accused guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. I am pleased to say that the judge in his wisdom imposed the maximum penalty for manslaughter, and I hope the fellow serves it all. That is the sort of situation that is occurring as this backlash develops. Aboriginal people say to me, `Mr Campbell, we are frightened. Things are worse now than they were 12 months ago. They are a lot worse now than they were two years ago'. Every time the agenda boils this sort of thing happens. The people who will be the losers are the Aboriginal people, the people who had no say in it. The people who generate this backlash-many of the advisers and the professionals often in government departments-simply move on. They leave the people to carry the can-the people who have had no say in what has happened to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is just another mishmash, another rehash. It is not solving the problem, because Aboriginal people are sick to death of consultation. The concept of self-management was brought in as a noble view, but the reality is that self-management is a recipe for doing nothing. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs will say, `Yes, we understand, but until we get the community's agreement we cannot do anything'. Of course we cannot get agreement from the community. We can never get any community's agreement on this basis. I have known communities where there is consultation on where to put power poles. No such consultation takes place in my suburb; the power poles are simply put in. Communities have said to me, `We want police stations. Please give us police stations'. They want police stations for reasons that they understand. We say to them, `No, you have self-management; do it yourself'. We do not say those things to people in a white town. It is something we ought to think about. We spend millions of dollars on the Muirhead Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which will prove nothing and satisfy no-one, but we do not have the money to put police stations in communities where Aboriginal people are asking for them. That would go a long way towards addressing the problem. Certainly in Western Australia, of all government bodies, the police are probably the most respected by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> This is definitely an urban situation but, as I said earlier, it is not a uniform problem. Problems must be addressed with solutions that are appropriate. The truth is that the Department is engaged in crisis management but it does not have the ability to do anything else. When a community is in a state of crisis the Department looks good. It can smooth over that particular crisis. It probably sits back and waits for the next one to make sure that its existence is justified. This is an important debate. It is one that I believe deserves far more than 40 minutes. I regret that there is so little time to discuss this matter more fully. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for the Northern Territory will shut up instead of wanting to challenge everyone to a fight, as he does the Aborigines in his electorate, we might be able to get on with a proper debate. This Government seems to be hell-bent on separating 1 1/2 per cent of the population in this country from the other 98 1/2 per cent. It wants to do it not just by action but by legislation. It wants to justify this on the grounds of race and the colour of a person's skin. I say to Government members who are pursuing this course that it is a dangerous road to go down. It will lead, and is already leading, to unexpected and unfortunate consequences. I acknowledge that much of what those opposite intend to do, or are trying to do, is done with the best of intentions. Nevertheless, in doing so they are constructing a very precarious foundation on which to build a harmonious nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know of the experiment back in the 1930s in Germany when Hitler tried to exterminate a race simply because they were Jews. That was obviously wrong; it was evil. It is interesting to note that he was a member of the German socialist labour party. There have been many examples around the world since then. There has been the South African experiment of separate development. While I have considerable sympathy for that country, the apartheid policy is both morally and economically wrong. There are worse examples such as that in Burundi where there is racial persecution. The ruling Tutsi tribe brutally persecutes the Hutu tribe solely on racial lines. There is racial discrimination in Malaysia. There is the caste system in India. We are witnessing the non-Amharic persecution in Ethiopia. All these types of discrimination are engaged in, no doubt, with the very best of intentions on the part of those who are ruling-for the overall good they would claim. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Government members that wherever there is discrimination, wherever it is forced such as by a dictatorship or by legislation, even though the intentions may be good, it is always wrong. I would go even further and say that if we discriminate in society along such lines-even though we do so with good intentions-ultimately there will be a bad result. In fact, if we discriminate with good intentions, the suffering, misery and ultimate cruelty can end up being worse because it is more drawn out and more subversive. I know of no exception to this rule in the world. If on the grounds of race people are killed with viciousness, such as those in Burundi, or with kindness, as we see in Australia today, they are still being killed. If honourable members doubt that, they have only to see the tragic, premature shortening of Aboriginal life in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no better example of discriminating with good intentions with ultimately bad effects than the example of what this Government is doing in Australia today. There are other examples of this around the world. We have seen what has happened to the Eskimos and to the North American Indians. Wherever governments have a patronising, chequebook mentality, we end up creating a race of people apart from the rest of mainstream society. Every other ethnic group in Australia-and there are many-is included in the mainstream society, but for some reason, we are hell-bent on separating 1 1/2 per cent of our population from the rest. The Aboriginal people in Australia today have ended up without dignity, education, jobs or pride. Unfortunately, they are being more and more resented by a large proportion of the remaining 98.5 per cent. So, we have Aborigines in a depressed and totally demoralised position. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of what has been done, we in the Parliament are now being presented with legislation for further separation of Aboriginal people. It is absolutely unbelievable. Australia is, or should be, one sovereign nation under one flag, not many nations under a number of flags. But, instead, this Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and this Government want to aggravate the situation with proposals to further and formally divide Australia. I say to the Government that Australians do not want to find themselves in the position of signing treaties with themselves. The concept of signing treaties with groups within a nation is a nonsense and it leads to all sorts of unforeseen consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in about 1985 we saw the example of the National Aboriginal Conference, which was then in existence, wanting for people on Aboriginal land the right to be able to form their own foreign policy, for heaven's sake. Nowadays, we have this talk of a treaty and the separate development of a black parliament within Australia. All of this is building up unreal expectations which can never be realised and which will end up disappointing and disillusioning the Aboriginal race more so than it is now. It only feeds the stirrers and the malcontents, the Michael Mansells of this world, and gives them a higher public profile that they otherwise would not have. It causes resentment amongst the rest of the population-the backlash effect-and the Aboriginal people end up feeling cheated. The result is totally negative, and the cheap attempt of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to win votes by trying to instil guilt into the rest of the Australian population by offering compensation for what has been done in the past is totally ludicrous and is a divisive concept.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worthwhile recalling that most Aborigines who are alive in Australia today have a considerable proportion of non-Aboriginal blood in them. In other words, they would not be here today were it not for the migration programs that have taken place in this country over the past 200 years. Why should we single out the Aboriginal population for compensation? What about the Chinese, for example? There is no more persecuted ethnic group in Australia than the Chinese, if we look back at the history of what happened to them on the goldfields. If we consider that question, therein lies at least some of the answer to what we see happening to Aborigines in Australia today. In the end, the Chinese were left alone and today they are part of the overall mainstream of Australian society. They have done very well and, although they make up only a small proportion of the Australian society, they have made a great contribution to this country. The average Chinese family has paid a lot of tax since 1983, for instance. In contrast, average Aboriginal families have received, I think, $100,000 in grants since 1983. I put the question: which group is better off? I would say that the Chinese group is much further ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> I realise that this is an oversimplification of the situation; nevertheless, it points the way in which we should be going in Australia. This paper that I have in my hand indicates nine or 10 different grants for Aboriginal children to attend school. They will be available to no other colour, whether it be white, red, yellow or whatever. I know that these grants have been given with good intentions, but I refer to the following grants: an allowance for students living at home of $120 a fortnight; an allowance for students living away from home of $182 a fortnight; tuition fees paid up to $3,000 a year for approved boarders; fares between home and school; tutorial assistance to study ballet, art, craft, et cetera; an allowance for school excursions of $280 a year; orientation visits; grants for parents to attend parent meetings; travel for compassionate reasons; educational and vocational guidance, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> These grants are causing division in our society. We should make no separation between people based on colour. It is a recipe for disaster and will destroy the ethnic group at which it is targeted. By doing this we are treating people differently and then showing surprise when they end up acting differently. We are patronising these people by giving them handouts, something for nothing. This is not the direction in which we should be going. We should be aiming to bring them into the mainstream of Australian society so that ultimately they will have pride and dignity, so that they can get rid of the hand out mentality and start contributing to this great country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us start to reverse the mistakes we have made. Let us reject this patronising behaviour and this Government's grand plan for separate development. As I say, let us restore dignity to this ethnic group and bring them back into the mainstream of Australian society so that they can make that contribution to it and so that we can start to advance this nation more than we are doing, for the ultimate advantage of us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that the speeches made by the National Party members in this debate have been two of the most disappointing speeches that I have heard since entering this House after the last election. They have demonstrated what I believe to be everything evil in terms of the myopic, ethnocentric view which is typical of the National Party, and, indeed, the Opposition parties and the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who is sitting in this House. The speeches reflect the historical and cultural arrogance of the Opposition's approach to the issue of Aboriginal affairs and its total lack of compassion, feeling and understanding for Aboriginal perceptions, aspirations and needs as articulated by Aboriginal Australians. It reflects poorly on an Opposition which really has shown the division which exists between the Government and the Opposition on the issue of Aboriginal affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to refer quickly to a point made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I do so not only on my own behalf but also on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the House, particularly the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). It would do well for those people who do not understand the facts of history in this country, who have no knowledge of this country's present status in the international arenas of the world, if they would think about the matter. The Opposition spokesman on Aboriginal affairs ought to hear and understand this, because Australian history is absolutely littered with examples of genocide of Aboriginal Australians. It is not enough to say, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, that we have dealt with our indigenous people, the Aboriginal people, more kindly than if they were settled by another race. What absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the shadow Minister: What is the position of Aboriginal people in his State? What is the recognition that has been accorded to them by the State Government of Tasmania?

It is instructional to read through the Notice Paper because the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who moved this motion, has another notice of motion to the effect that this House queries the benefits of multiculturalism to Australian society. That is where the National Party is coming from and that is where the Opposition is coming from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us not hear about this cosy relationship that the Augustus of the Opposition, the new Leader, has brought into this House. Let us not believe that members of the Opposition are talking about a united Australia, because it is clear from the motions moved by this person, who masquerades as a representative of the Australian people, that they are promoting division within the Australian society. The issue is very clear in relation to this motion. It is about giving special recognition to the needs and wishes of Aboriginal people. It is not about giving mainstream service delivery. It is about giving special recognition and regard to Aboriginal needs and it is about taking care to make sure that one gives Aboriginal people a right to articulate their own concerns, desires and wishes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the policy of this Government to do that. It is within the realms of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation that that will happen. The legislation will be supported not only by Aboriginal people, but by the mass of the Australian community, as it has been, I might point out to those people on the Opposition benches who masquerade as churchgoing Christians, by the majority of the Christian churches in this country. It has been supported by all commentators outside this Parliament who have any understanding of Aboriginal affairs or the concerns of Aboriginal people in this nation. However, it is not supported significantly by the Opposition, nor is the issue of multiculturalism supported by the Opposition. That is the point which is significant about this debate, because it demonstrates the division, the chasm, which exists between the Opposition and the Government on policies such as the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country, the administration of immigration policies, and the policies and issues related to multiculturalism. That is what this debate is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The cold, hard facts are that we have people in the Opposition who have views reminiscent of the views which oppressed Aboriginal Australians and Chinese Australians in the nineteenth century. They were the views of assimilation. One only has to look at the documents and read through the policy statements of the then Country Party, articulated by government decree in the 1950s and 1960s. Those statements were all about assimilation. Those views have absolutely nothing to do with the reality of the concerns of Aboriginal Australians. Those views have to do with oppression; with not allowing Aboriginal people the dignity they deserve in their own land. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest to Opposition members that they come with me around the Northern Territory or around north-west Western Australia and talk to Aboriginal people the way they talk to the community in this House about what they think of Aboriginal people. I know the resounding impact they will make on those people will be one of disdain and horror. Those are the facts. Aboriginal people will not accept the views of the Opposition. They will not vote for the Opposition in a pink fit and the Opposition knows it. Yet, the Opposition masquerades in here as a champion of oppressed people. It does not understand Aboriginal people; it does not care about Aboriginal people and it most certainly does not desire their votes. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House expresses its deep concern that the Tasmanian Government has:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) failed to take up significant Commonwealth initiatives which would have benefited the people of Tasmania;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) mismanaged the Tasmanian economy with the result that Tasmania has fallen behind every other State in key areas such as employment and growth; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) failed to develop either a coherent economic strategy or a constructive working relationship with the national Government. </PARA>
<PARA>It should now be beyond question that Tasmania has failed to keep pace with the growth of the engine of the Australian economy. Under the Australian Labor Party, the national economy has gone through a period of quite significant growth. Unemployment has been falling and some commentators express the view that the national economy has become what they call overheated. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania, after many years of Liberal administration, the Tasmanian economy has barely begun to warm up at all. Our economy is suffering. Our unemployment rate stands at 9.7 per cent; 3.1 per cent above the national average. Twenty per cent of our young people cannot find work. Contrary to the national trend, employment continues to fall. Tasmania has the lowest growth of building approvals of all States. During the period 1987-88, it experienced a net loss of 3,434 people. This is a tragedy. It is the reason why I have moved a resolution drawing the attention of this Parliament to those very sad statistics. I do so, not in order simply to say, `Look, Tasmania is in difficulty', but to point to what I believe is a constructive alternative for the people of Tasmania, the program put forward by the Labor Party in Tasmania and which I will turn to shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go through the points I have raised in this notice of motion. The first was Tasmania's failure to take up significant Commonwealth initiatives. One of the first points which drew this to my attention was that, in the course of my election campaign, I sought from the Federal Government a commitment to fund an inquiry into the parlous state of the Tasmanian tourist industry. The national tourist effort was obviously succeeding. Arrivals from overseas had risen dramatically, but in Tasmania we were not able to attract a significant component of those overseas visitors. The Commonwealth Government said it would make available the sum of $50,000, plus the cooperation of Tourism Australia to assist the State Government to look at the reasons why there were difficulties in this regard and to put forward constructive proposals. To this day I am still waiting for the State Government to accept what was surely a constructive proposal and to kick into a study which would have a beneficial effect on our important tourism industry in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only in the areas of those proposals where the State Government has been unwilling to pick up the burden. We also have the problem of youth homelessness and the supported accommodation program; a tragedy, particularly in a State where youth unemployment is at 20 per cent. The State Government dickered, refusing for over 12 months to pick up that money before reluctantly being forced by public opinion to pick up money the Commonwealth had made available. Yesterday we heard in this House that the Commonwealth initiatives regarding proper respect for women in the work force had not been picked up by Tasmania. There are countless instances where the State has failed to respond constructively to initiatives introduced by the Commonwealth, which would have assisted Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I made in the notice of motion was that the Tasmanian Government had mismanaged the Tasmanian economy. That is self-evident. The record is there. I have mentioned some of the elements. I do not want to be negative in this approach. All I say is that any State Government which could put its head up and say that it is proud of the economic record it is leaving behind would be laughed out of court anywhere where a reasonable man was making a judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I pointed out that the Tasmanian Government had failed to establish either a coherent economic strategy or a constructive working relationship with the national Government. Let us look at this business of coherent economic strategy. The State Government has relied on what I think is essentially a gambler's instinct. It has no policy that would allow it to go forward in a constructive and well-organised way. Instead, like the gambler who has got himself into hock, it has found itself making more and more desperate bids to somehow make that one big bet that will win back the house. Unfortunately, it is misjudging not only the mood of the Australian people but the mood of the Tasmanian people, because the Tasmanian people were not interested in putting forward a proposal to dam the Franklin River. Even the State Government's own economic and energy advisers of the Hydro Electric Commission now say that that proposal was an economic nonsense. We now have the latest proposal which has been put up as somehow being the economic salvation of Tasmania; that is, a pulp mill. The contortions, the backdowns, the evasions and the shoddiness of the Tasmanian Government's approach towards that proposal shows that it does not have a coherent economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> This failure to develop any coherent economic policy is reflected also by the State Government's approach to the proposal that Tasmania service some of the Russian fishing fleet, if the Soviet Union is granted approval to use Australian ports. When that proposal was first put forward it got the knee-jerk `reds under the bed' sort of reaction from the Deputy Premier in Tasmania, Ray Groom. Unfortunately, there are still some honourable members opposite-for example, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck)-who persist with this knee-jerk `reds under the bed' negative approach to Tasmania's economy. Premier Gray has at least eventually seen wisdom on this point and has made strong representations to the extent of lending to us yesterday a senior official from his Department, the Premier's Department, to come with me to discuss this proposal with the Soviets and the senior Government Ministers involved. But that has happened only after months of agonising and backtracking. As a result, we are way behind the ball and chasing from behind. It is an appalling record. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the point about the lack of a constructive working relationship with the national government. When I was first elected, I remember an announcement being made about a road opening for the bypass around the Hobart roundabout. I remember seeing a picture of the smallest Minister in Australia, Minister Braid, and Nick Evers proudly cutting a ribbon announcing the opening of a roadway. But there was a failure to mention that every dollar of that roadway had been provided by the Commonwealth Government. Having milked this event for every piece of publicity they could get, there was then a formal opening some months later after the road was in use. This is just one instance where the Tasmanian Government tried to take credit for funds provided by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What about its much touted proposal for a forest industry package amounting to $50m. This big election campaign promise is just a rehash of what has already been given by way of funding from the Commonwealth under the Helsham heads of agreement. It has been repackaged. The Tasmanian Government has put its name on it and gives no credit to the Commonwealth. It continues to criticise the Federal Government falsely. It alleges that the Federal Government is responsible for a failure to fund when the reality is that every Tasmanian is funded to the extent of some $500 per capita more than the national average. That is the situation. I do not resile from that at all; it is appropriate. There are particular reasons why we in Tasmania need to have the sympathy and the support of the Commonwealth Government. But the Tasmanian Government criticises us every time. We get no credit when we give the Tasmanian Government money. It blames; it has no responsibility; and it is shameless. I am sure that when I sit down the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) will stand up and begin a tirade about why it is all the Federal Government's fault, refusing to accept that any of this malaise and mishmash of economic incompetence could be sheeted home to its own State colleagues. Tasmania is the only State which is falling behind, which has rising unemployment and which is losing people, who are moving away to find employment in other places. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a bright side. The Tasmanian Labor Party will cut away that kind of negativism and carping. Instead, it will work out a constructive program with the Commonwealth Government. More importantly, it will also work out a constructive program that involves all sectors of the Tasmanian community. It will involve the trade unions, the business community and all who have a significant input into the future development and growth of our State economy. The Labor platform calls, firstly, for an employment summit to be held early in the first term of the Labor government to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas for ways of creating more employment for Tasmanians. Apart from that constructive approach, it has specific promises that will do much to overcome the kind of negative knee-jerk nonsense that has been passed up for economic policy for far too long in Tasmania. In a key initiative, the new Labor Government will establish enterprise centres in each of the State's major regions-the first to be established in Launceston, followed by the north-west coast and Hobart-designed to foster and encourage the development of new enterprises and the expansion of existing firms. In addition, there will be a new export orientation which recognises that Tasmania has to market to the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems is that the Tasmanian Government has a loser's mentality. There are always little whingers. We need Tasmania to be an exciting place, looking forward to capturing part of a world market. We are not looking to sell to mainland Australia, which itself only has a limited market. We have to look to overseas markets, niche markets. Austrade has been right behind those few initiatives which are a ray of light for the Tasmanian economy. For example, industry in the Tasmanian agriculture area has shown some real prospect of growth. We need to look to these niche markets where we can sell to the world and not be satisfied with negative carping of the kind that so often passes for State Government policy. We cannot live in Tasmania with a cargo cult mentality where we seek to blame every failure of policy on the Federal Government, where we give no credit where credit is due and where we seek to blame even when a policy has been initiated by the Federal Government to the great benefit of the State. That is the way that we expect less sophisticated people in primitive societies to behave. It is not the way we expect people who govern a State of this country to behave. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we look forward in a positive way. Tastrade, the Labor Party's proposed new marketing authority, will look to the world. Tastrade will also be responsible for the development of other Labor initiatives designed to create new markets for Tasmanian goods. These will include the development of a new export label, designed to identify Tasmanian goods with quality and craftsmanship and to create a distinct Tasmanian market image; the enterprise of market outlets, shop fronts in other States and then in other countries; and an economic excellence week designed to enhance community awareness of the quality of Tasmania's products and the export opportunities available to the State. That will be underpinned by a project development fund which will specifically assist manufacturers to develop products for export. Linked into this will be payroll tax exemptions, jobs through training and a Tasmanian youth foundation to create job training opportunities for Tasmania's young people. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrast that with the negative knocking, blaming failure of the Liberal Government in Tasmania. I think everyone should make a choice based on that contrast. It is a choice between a group of people that has failed and failed and failed, that against the national trends has gone backwards. Tasmanians have an opportunity to make a historic choice, to act decisively and to elect a Labor government committed to a program which is comprehensive, looks to provide a coherent economic strategy and allows for an effective working relationship with the Federal Government. It is crucial to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on these important issues. All Australia will be watching the results of the Tasmanian election on Saturday. I commend to the House and the people of Australia the very sensible proposals that have been put forward on behalf of the Labor Party. If anyone is left in any doubt, I point out that there is one party which has a program, a policy and an optimistic view of the future. If my fellow Tasmanians make the choice to stay with the failures that have inhabited the House of Assembly in Tasmania for the past half decade, I will be very surprised about the quality of their judgment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that even the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) would have the temerity to move in this House a motion such as the one before us. I can only conclude that he has been provoked into bringing on a debate such as this today because the Tasmanian election is to be held on Saturday and the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania is in sheer desperation because it knows it cannot win; that Mr Field has prevailed on the honourable member for Denison to bring forward this motion as an act of sheer political desperation. All I can do is admire the honourable member's tenacity in bringing it forward knowing that his Party will lose, and lose conclusively, on Saturday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the accusations made by the honourable member for Denison about the Gray Government in Tasmania is that it has mismanaged the Tasmanian economy. The one thing that is different about the management of the Gray Government is that it is the only government in Australia that has consistently balanced its budget. It is the mentality of the Labor Party to do things on borrowed money. That is the great problem faced by this Federal Government. It borrows money and cannot live within its means. The honourable member for Denison obviously expects the Gray Government in Tasmania to do that as well. The Gray Government is the only responsible government in Australia, the only government that consistently balances its budget, yet the honourable member accuses it of bad economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline for the House some of the so-called initiatives of this Federal Government in respect of Tasmania and let the people make up their minds as to who has been mismanaging the affairs of Tasmania. Firstly, I refer to the sharing of taxes among the States. The State of Tasmania has had its share of Commonwealth taxes cut back by an average of $440m per year. In other words, if the financial arrangements that were in place under the Fraser Government were still in place, the Tasmanian Government would receive an additional $440m from the Commonwealth, which equates to 25 per cent of the State budget. That is how severe the Commonwealth's cut back to the State of Tasmania has been, yet the honourable member says that that is an initiative. I ask the people of Tasmania to be the judge. You talk about sharing on a per capita basis among the States. I point out that the Commonwealth's cutback to Tasmania on a per capita basis has been at the rate of $1,000 per man, woman and child. The average of all the other States has been cut back--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3F4">Mr BURR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be happy to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I point out that the average cut back to all the other States, has been $500 per man, woman and child. In Tasmania, the cut back has been double that, at the rate of $1,000 per man, woman and child. Let us look at the capital works program. What has happened in Tasmania? The Commonwealth's own projection for capital works activities in Tasmania for the next two years is the expenditure of $17.3m, which is an average of $38 per man, woman and child. Capital works expenditure in all the States amounts to an average of $145 per man, woman and child. Who in their right mind could claim that that is a fair initiative for the State of Tasmania?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us keep going. The honourable member for Denison in his contribution referred to the very dramatic cutbacks in employment in Tasmania. We are all concerned about the unemployment rate in Tasmania. I remind the honourable member for Denison of the Callaghan Inquiry into the Structure of Industrial and the Employment Situation in Tasmania, which was tabled in 1977. Perhaps the honourable member was not in this place at that time. It was a most exhaustive inquiry into the problems faced by the State of Tasmania. The Callahan report pointed out that if Tasmania had the same average employment opportunities provided by Commonwealth activities in other States-in other words, in armed services, Commonwealth public servants and that type of Commonwealth activity-there would be an additional 5,000 jobs in Tasmania. Yet the honourable member claims that the Commonwealth is taking initiatives on behalf of Tasmania. What absolute rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA> If the Commonwealth was being fair to the State of Tasmania, as it is to the other States, particularly those governed by Labor, there would be a considerable increase in economic activity in Tasmania. However, that is not the case. The actions of the Commonwealth are consistently retarding economic growth in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I will press on, because I have not yet finished my remarks on Commonwealth activities and Commonwealth employment in Tasmania. I remind honourable members of another fact: The Commonwealth is also cutting back on those jobs it provides in Tasmania. In fact, since 1984 the Commonwealth has reduced its payroll in Tasmania by 867 Commonwealth jobs. That is, 867 Commonwealth jobs have been withdrawn from Tasmania. The most recent withdrawal was the withdrawal of 72 jobs from the Australian Taxation Office. This is another so-called Commonwealth initiative for Tasmania. The Commonwealth consistently overrides the State of Tasmania in respect of allowing Tasmania to develop its own resources. Perhaps that is the most negative thing that the Commonwealth has done--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me remind the honourable member for Denison of the findings of the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests which was set up by the Commonwealth to look into the forest industry in Tasmania. The Helsham Commission recommended certain things, but what did the Commonwealth do? Contrary to the findings of the Helsham Commission, set up by the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth locked up 257,000 hectares, nine times the forest area of national parks recommended by the Commission. Again, in the case of the Wesley Vale pulp mill, the Commonwealth has overridden the State of Tasmania. The Commonwealth has prevented that great initiative, which in itself would have created 2,000 jobs and would have allowed investment of $1,000m in Tasmania to develop its resources. For political expediency and to attract support from the conservation movement, the Commonwealth Government has again overridden the State of Tasmania and prevented that great development going ahead, depriving 2,000 people of jobs in Tasmania. Yet the honourable member for Denison has the temerity to come into this House and claim that it is mismanagement on the part of the Tasmanian Government that is holding back the State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the House, to those listening to this broadcast and to the people of Tasmania that if there has been mismanagement of the Tasmanian economy, if Tasmania has experienced deprivation under any government, it has come from the Hawke Government and the very negative attitude it has adopted towards the State of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only assume that when the election is held on Saturday the response of the people of Tasmania towards the Labor Party will be made well known in the ballot box, and that is where it counts. I can assure the honourable member for Denison and this House that, when the votes are counted on Saturday night, the people of Tasmania will make well known what they think of this Commonwealth Government and the Labor Party. I am quite certain that the people of Tasmania will want their State developed in the way in which the Gray Government has put its program forward, through a balanced budget and proper development of our own natural resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Grievance debates are a procedure in this Parliament for honourable members to talk about issues that they believe in their judgment are extremely important and ought to be brought to the attention not only of the House but of the nation. Today I want to talk about one of the victims of this Government's activities, one that we do not talk about very often but one that I think many of us on both sides of the House are aware of, and that is the people who live in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think regional Australia over the last seven years of the Hawke Government, has had a raw deal. There has been a concentration in politics on meeting the needs of those in capital cities. My view, as I represent a regional area, is that there needs to be a balanced approach in the development of policy and government initiatives. In the course of the Hawke Government's time in office I have seen a concentration to support people in areas where the votes are, and therefore an abrogation of responsibility to look after those who live in regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to quantify it, if we can, the ones who have had the raw end of the deal, the worst treatment, and who live in the regions of Australia which have suffered most at the hands of the Hawke Government, are Tasmanians. We have just heard a debate in this chamber about Tasmania because there is to be an election. If this election were not going to take place, the issue that I raise today-that is, the victims who are living in regional Australia-I think would still be a question for discussion. What has happened is, I think, quite clear. There has been a calculated attempt by the Hawke Government to direct Commonwealth funding to those areas where it believes it can maximise its votes. We have seen a classic example in the environmental debate. We have a self-confessed born again greenie in Senator Richardson. He has sniffed the political wind in the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne and he believes that in addressing their needs he will get more votes, and the best way to do that is to work against the best interests of development in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Allegations have been made that the Tasmanian economy is on the slide. In fact, the economy in Tasmania has been on the up and up. It was quite interesting to hear some of the figures that were cited previously. The Gray Government has in fact boosted business investment in a wide range of industries. In 1982-83 capital expenditure per head was $529 per annum compared with a national average of $1,028 per year. By 1986-87 new business investment had increased to $909 per head against a national average of $1,093. So Tasmania has grown tremendously in terms of business investment. Business believes that there are opportunities in regional Australia, and the Wesley Vale debate is a classic example. One may have views as to whether or not that proposal ought to have proceeded on environmental grounds. Those on this side of the House, and indeed a large number of those in the Cabinet, thought that it ought to proceed. The point I make is that business saw that there were opportunities in regional Australia. That is not the case with the Hawke Government. It has blatantly directed government activity away from regional Australia and particularly away from Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) in his speech detailed in quite accurate terms the movement of Commonwealth activity right out of Tasmania. There have been dramatic drops. The level of capital works in Tasmania has dropped tremendously as well. It has also been dealt a harsh blow with all the allocations of Commonwealth public servants. I think he quoted the Australian Taxation Office which increased its staff by 4 per cent in Tasmania and by 30 per cent in Western Australia. The Department of Administrative Services is up 2 per cent in Tasmania but up 15 per cent in New South Wales. Tasmania, being part of regional Australia, has been the testing ground for this Government's political strategy, and we are suffering because of it. There have been a whole range of other things that this Government has taken away from Tasmania, and a whole range of issues that it has not addressed. Some $6m in airline assistance was taken away. The Helsham Inquiry into the forestry package has been minimal. There are not nearly sufficient funds there for one of Australia's greatest and growing industries that needs to be developed on a sustainable yield basis and to have proper forestry practices. </PARA>
<PARA>. Let us look at the wheat issue. One of the unsung issues with regard to the wheat debate has been the effects that issue will have on Tasmania. The effects of this Government's policy may well mean that Tasmania, for the first time in some 40 years, will have an increase in the price of bread above that of anywhere else in Australia. The equalisation of basic commodity bread prices in the shops to ordinary consumers right around the nation was an instrument of policy supported by both sides of this chamber for many years. But because of this Government's neglect and its inability to address the issues, it has decided to walk away from supporting Tasmania, and in a calculated way-I admit that negotiations are still proceeding-it has left Tasmanian consumers facing higher bread prices. </PARA>
<PARA> We have talked about tourism. Tasmania is a gem of an island. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been there. Many of us have been there. Some of us live there. We love the place. It is a wonderful place to visit. To hear the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), a Tasmanian, earlier decry the efforts of the Tasmanian tourism industry, saddens me and my colleagues on this side of the House. We have been trying for many years to develop that industry, but what help have we got? This Government was asked to take one initiative, and that was the initiative to set up the centre for tourism studies in Australia, and where did it go? We suggested that it should go to Launceston in northern Tasmania, but it came to Canberra. Where is the policy about making sure that the rest of Australia shares in Government activity? Tasmania is certainly not considered. </PARA>
<PARA> There is lots of rhetoric from the other side of the House, but once we look at the record we find that it shows a completely different intention. What is to happen to the national fish laboratory, the laboratory that determines fish export licensing and the quality of fish? We heard the honourable member for Denison talk about the growth of aquaculture, the new multi-million dollar industry in Tasmania, which has great potential. We are the greatest exporters of live fish and new and exotic fishes in the nation. We need that national fish health reference laboratory in Tasmania, but it is proposed that it go to Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA> When is regional Australia going to get an opportunity to be involved in some of these activities? That was a classic example of where the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) could have made a positive decision in favour of Tasmania. But again we were the victims, as we have been for some seven years. There is no doubt about it, Tasmania's economy has been growing, perhaps not at the rate that we would all hope that it would, but we have to remember that there are 450,000 people in Tasmania. Let me make this point about exports and new industries: the value that Tasmania adds to the export values that accrue to this nation has been in the positive ledger since Federation. We have been exporting minerals and agricultural products in a positive way since Federation. There has not been one year when the exports from Tasmania have been in the deficit. We have been positive contributors. It is all right to look for new industries, but the important point-and this is the point I make consistently during science debates-is that we must support our comparative advantages. Our comparative advantages are enhancing those areas in which we do well now-our minerals, forestry, fishing and agriculture. They are the areas we need to be enhancing. We need to be adding value to those. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an attempt to do that with Wesley Vale. This Government, through its ineptitude, stopped that proposal dead in its tracks. The economic decisions were made to proceed. Other proposals will come forward. We do not want the regional areas in Australia that rely on these industries, and have done since Federation, to employ their communities, to add value to their communities and to make sure that their communities continue; we do not want those types of activities that took place regarding Wesley Vale, to be in any way a detriment to future development. Development must be balanced and must take into account environmental issues. There is no doubt about that. There is universal support for that. At the same time, we want a government that recognises regional Australia, that does not see regional Australia as being expendable and that does not treat it as a victim and its people as though they do not deserve proper consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of government is to govern for all Australians in a fair and equitable manner. Tasmania has not been treated fairly and equitably, and the figures show it. The Tasmanian people know it and if those people, wherever they sit in this chamber, look objectively at the issue, they will know it as well. A calculated political campaign to win votes in capital cities will not reap the Government a reward at the end of the day, because regional Australia will vote against it. That is what is going to happen in Tasmania this weekend. Honourable members opposite hope that there will be a real swing towards the Australian Labor Party. This will not occur because the people of Tasmania know that they are not being treated well, that they are being treated as victims and as second class citizens by Labor. This Government will rue the day that it did not look after Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today my grievance relates to the renewed interest in Queensland of the State Government's confrontationist voluntary employment agreements legislation. Honourable members who take an interest in Queensland affairs will remember that the concept of voluntary employment agreements was first raised some years ago by the former Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Many in Queensland believed that voluntary employment agreements, otherwise known as VEAs, had disappeared along with the political fortunes of that former Premier. Regrettably, the National Party of Australia in Queensland, under its new leader-I use the term very loosely-has seen fit to breathe life into the VEA legislation again and in fact provide financial encouragement to business to opt out of the tried and true conciliation and arbitration process. His motives for doing so must be questioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For more than a year of his leadership of the National Party, Mr Ahern was quite happy to have VEAs languish on the industrial relations agenda and do absolutely nothing about them. His Government is now under siege, due to the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct and due also, in no small part, to his dithering style of leadership. These things will culminate this weekend in an inevitable loss for the Nationals in the Merthyr by-election caused by the resignation of that former National and former Liberal, Don Lane. Queensland and Tasmania are holding very important elections this Saturday. There is no doubt in my mind that both conservative governments will receive quite a jolt. </PARA>
<PARA> I want people in Queensland who are listening to this broadcast not to forget the fact that Don Lane, the disgraced Minister who was forced out of the Party and out of the Parliament, was a Liberal member before he became a National. People should not forget this. With all of this going on around him, it is obvious that Mr Ahern very badly needs an issue which he perceives will restore the community's confidence in him as a leader. The issue which he has chosen, I believe very unwisely, is the issue of forcing voluntary employment agreements onto the work force. The problem Mr Ahern has is that things are not working quite his way. For a whole range of very good reasons, the community at large and, importantly, the business community are rejecting voluntary employment agreements in that State. The union movement is united in its opposition to VEAs and is acting with utmost responsibility to discredit the concept. The unions have not, as Mr Ahern would have liked, reacted by taking to the streets picketing and striking. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience in Queensland on voluntary employment agreements is one of which the Federal Opposition should take very careful notice. The Liberal Party of Australia, and certainly the National Party, would wish to introduce workers' contracts as an alternative to the conciliation and arbitration process. This is still the case notwithstanding the recent change in the leadership of both parties. Nobody should be fooled into believing otherwise. The fact is that VEAs in Queensland have been a complete disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go through the dangers and issues behind voluntary employment agreements in the hope that anyone who currently thinks that there might be some good in VEAs will be convinced otherwise. The Ahern Government's actions have been highly irresponsible in the current climate of restraint by the union movement and its participation in a wage system which is bringing about very real benefits for this country. Mr Ahern is, essentially, inviting workers to opt out of the centralised wage fixing system of which this Federal Government has striven to convince unions to remain a part. Unions have responded magnificently to that call and have stayed within the national wage system. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the Power Brewing issue in Queensland, the workers and their unions could quite easily go outside the wage fixation guidelines and organise a better deal with the company. But no, the unions are hamstrung by the very fact that they want to do what the Federal Government has asked the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the whole of the union movement in this country to do; that is, to try to keep wages at a manageable level. The union is hamstrung because it is trying to do the right thing but the Government is trying to prod business into causing confrontationist attitudes between unions and employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing that Queensland workers should recognise is that by accepting voluntary employment agreements they could be denying themselves the opportunity to cash in on the benefits of the award restructuring which is presently going on throughout the country. VEAs mean that the Queensland industrial relations system is on an entirely different track to that of the rest of the country. The restructuring of awards which is going on in the rest of the country to the benefit of both employers and employees will not occur in Queensland as a result of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland media in recent times has been full of stories about how workers are embracing voluntary employment agreements. The two latest examples are employees of the Metway Bank Ltd and, as I previously mentioned, the Power Brewing Co. Ltd. In both of these cases it is true that employees have voted in favour of VEAs. What the union movement has noticed, however, is that employees in these organisations who are supporting voluntary employment agreements are those who have been with these firms for a very long time-or at least for a considerable amount of time. This has meant that management of the companies has had the opportunity to persuade many of the employees over a long period, at close quarters, to support the agreements. There is very little support among those who have joined the organisations in recent times. Those who have not been got at by management can see right through those voluntary employment agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the evils of the typical voluntary employment agreement include the abolition of penalty rates, no commitment to minimum retrenchment payments, no protection against unfair dismissals, no provision for consultation before any major changes to employment, and the fact that the agreement can be changed at any time. Workers in Queensland should be warned about what they are trading in exchange for, in some cases, only slightly higher pay. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the dangerous features of the VEAs is that they need to be renewed between employers and employees every so often. Despite the fact that employees may be better remunerated during the period of the first voluntary employment agreement which they sign, there is nothing to suggest that the next voluntary employment agreement which they sign will contain the same remuneration. In other words, in many respects it is a bit of a con job. It is my belief that the aims of those employers who are supporting voluntary employment agreements is to do away with all the benefits by conning workers into accepting a temporarily higher wage and then, in the second VEA, doing away with that higher wage. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking on the topic of voluntary employment agreements, I do not want to give too much credence to the concept. After all, only 15 voluntary employment agreements have been registered with the Commission in the 15 months since the idea was first mooted. The overwhelming majority of Queensland employers have been responsible and have not rushed to take up the State Government's offer of backing to introduce voluntary employment agreements. In fact, the Queensland Confederation of Industry has expressed severe reservations about the system. The reality is the majority of employers are quite happy in the knowledge that the currently existing industrial relations system is working very well despite a massive public relations effort by the Government to convince employers to take up voluntary employment agreements. The Queensland industrial relations Minister, Mr Lester, has admitted that the National Party Government financially assisted a test case by a company called Mini Movers. How would the Opposition in this place feel if this Government decided financially to assist a trade union in a test case? It would not like it at all. </PARA>

It is refusing employees the right to any such professional assistance through their unions.

<PARA> In conclusion, I refer to a Courier-Mail article which appeared on Tuesday, 28 February this year. The article was headed, `VEA cuts pay-Power workers'. In the article a Power brewery worker said that he had been conned by accepting the VEA agreement. He explained that he had earned $135 less in the week ending 14 February than he would have if he had worked for the Castlemaine brewery under award conditions. His conclusion was that he had been conned-and he had been, of course. I warn all Queensland workers not to be so gullible as to believe that the State National Party Government, which has never in the past supported workers' rights, will help them on this occasion. This whole campaign and issue is a complete fabrication to try to get the community on side before a crucial by-election and a State election at the end of the year. The sad thing for the National Party is that its tactic will not work. The union movement, the Labor Party, business and community generally are one step ahead of it, and will remain one step ahead of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) talked about some of our prisoners of war. Any person who heard his speech could only feel very much in debt to those people who were prepared to serve their country and also a certain sense of shame that the honourable member had to bring up their case in the way in which he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I would like to talk about something else that is being done to our returned servicemen; in particular, what is being done to those who wish to apply for a pension. A returned serviceman is someone who has served his country and who has been prepared to go overseas to do so. Many of them left school when they were young and, in any case, have probably had no formal education since that time-well over 40 years ago. Those people, in good faith, because they are eligible, seek a pension. Imagine their reaction when they are told not only that they will have to undergo a medical examination-that is probably fair enough; everyone would expect that-but also that they are expected to fill in a lifestyle report which is a bit like a school examination. I will give more details of that. This report has to be filled out by the servicemen; they have to answer questions which in some cases are clearly trick questions and in many cases are extremely intrusive into what should be private matters. In fact, so embarrassed are many members of the Veterans Affairs' Department that they ask the veterans not to talk about the forms and not to show them to anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that these forms were designed, approved and promoted by this Labor Government. I think that if all Government members knew what they had authorised they would be horrified. The form represents a gross intrusion of privacy. We have been through the saga of the ID card. Everyone realised what would occur-that records of people's private financial affairs would be kept on a computer; and that it would invade the privacy of all Australians. In this case, something similar is occurring, but it is applying only to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt some people have thought, `This little examination form is very good; it will certainly create some extra jobs, because think of all the people who are going to have to mark the exam'. But it is much more serious than that. I think people ought to look very closely at this invasion of privacy and, more importantly, they should ask whether this form is actually necessary. It should be remembered that, as well as the assets test and the income test, the Government now wants veterans to bare their souls for the sake of a government requirement as to pension eligibility. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table a copy of this report, about which I will now give more details. </PARA>

This report which the veteran is asked to fill in begins, fairly predictably, by asking for a few personal details such as name, date of birth, et cetera, and then asks for a few details about the veteran's potential problems. It asks: `Do you have any problems walking? Do you need something to help you move around-for example, crutches or a wheelchair? If yes, what do you use? Do you use the device all of the time or only sometimes?'. Okay, maybe that is fair enough. It asks: `Do you need someone to help you move around or to go with you?'. That is okay. It then asks: `Do you drive a car?'. Well, maybe that is all right. It asks: `Are there any restrictions on your ability to sit in, or to drive a car? If yes, please describe the restrictions. Are there any forms of transport which you normally use, but have difficulty using?'. If the answer is `yes', the veteran must give details. One might say that so far the form is reasonably straightforward. But it ensures that nothing is missed out by asking: `Are there any forms of transport you cannot use?'.

But a doctor can find that out without the veteran having to fill in a little examination form. It then asks about personal relationships. This is where people really start to bare their souls. The form asks: `Which of the following statements apply to you? Mark all of the boxes which apply to you'. The statements beside the boxes include these: `I am going through a bad spell at the moment'; `I am able to cope with my life with the help of a few drinks'; `I feel contented with my life'; `My life is completely ruined'; `I am usually relaxed and get on well with most people'; `I often get cranky'.

Veterans are asked to tick the appropriate box. The questions continue: `How would you describe your life with your family? Very full, active and satisfying? Good most of the time? Good only some of the time? Unsatisfactory? Very poor with little or no enjoyment?'. Those who have no family can mark the appropriate box. The next question is: `Does your disability affect your life with your family? If yes, please describe'. This is the next question: `How would you describe your social life?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will repeat it: `Does your disability or disabilities affect your sexual feelings or abilities?'. The veteran must mark one of these boxes: `Yes'. `No', `Sometimes', or `Affected by medication'. I think there should be another box marked `None of your business'. There is provision for the veteran, if he wishes, to elaborate on his answer to that question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are questions about employment and domestic activities. One of the questions is: `How well can you do the following things?'. The veteran then has a choice of six different options which are described as follows: `Easily', `With difficulty', `With help', `If I take my time', `I can't do it', or `I don't need to'. The list of activities includes grocery shopping, house cleaning, washing up, and minor house repairs, although what the hell that has to do with it, I do not know. If one rents a house, I am not sure whether one would be expected to do that sort of thing. Other activities listed are light gardening, such as weeding or watering, or heavy gardening, such as digging and pruning trees. I do not know what happens if one does not have a garden, and one is not asked whether it is a large or small garden. Lawn mowing is also listed. One is not asked what sort of lawnmower one has, but it does ask if one can mow the lawn. The final activity listed is washing the car. </PARA>
<PARA> The next section asks: `Are there any domestic activities you have stopped because of your disabilities? Are there any domestic activities which take you longer to do than they used to? Are there any activities which you need help with?'. The next question is interesting as it might relate to another matter: `Do you have to pay someone else to do things that you used to do?'. In other words, it is asking, `Have you got the money? Maybe you can afford to go without the pension, anyway'. It is a bit of a trick question. No doubt some people would be a little nervous about that. The next question is, `Are there any home duties that you have recently started to do? If yes, do these duties have an effect on your disability? Are you presently employed?'. Those who are still working must give details about their occupation. These questions are asked: `Have you changed jobs in the last five years? Are there things you can't do at work that you used to do? Have you changed your workplace?'. Those who have stopped working-just to make sure no-one misses out-have to outline when they stopped working, why they stopped working, whether it was due to age, ill health, or other reason; if there are reasons, they must give details. It then asks: `Do you intend to seek employment?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 4 relates to recreation and community activities. Veterans are asked: `How often do you do the following activities?'. The choices are, `everyday', `a little', `weekly', `monthly', `rarely', and `never'. The activities listed include visiting or having visitors-I am not sure what that has to do with it; anyway, someone wants to find out-going out, such as to church, to watch sport or for entertainment; and playing a sport. Veterans should be careful, as that is a trick question: it could be golf, tennis, bowls or fishing, but the sport cannot actually be categorised. Other activities include doing a hobby, relaxing-everyone does that, I would have thought-and doing voluntary work, such as with Meals on Wheels or Legacy. People can describe the activities in one line. Then we see these questions, `Are there any other activities that you do? Are there any activities you have given up because of your disabilities? Question No. 32 reads, `Do you have difficulties doing, or taking up, any recreation activities?'. Clearly, these are trick questions to make sure that if one contradicts what one wrote in the earlier part of one's examination, one will fail the examination. I believe that this is a gross invasion of privacy and the Government should rethink what it has done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In an unconvincing attempt to explain away his ministerial incompetence in the administration of drought relief, the Queensland Primary Industries Minister, Mr Harper, misled State Parliament on 4 April 1989. In a ministerial statement Mr Harper said he had not been aware of any irregularities in the scheme up to two years ago. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I did act promptly when the concerns of the officers in charge of the drought secretariat became known to me not two years ago but at the end of last year. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Rod Henshaw program Mr Harper said:</PARA>
<PARA>As I say, I have been counselling these matters for the best part of two and a half years. </PARA>
<PARA>Which of Mr Harper's statements can we believe-his statement in Parliament or his confession on morning radio? In fact, what Mr Harper deliberately suppressed in his ministerial statement was a Cabinet minute of 24 August 1987. The then Acting Premier and Treasurer, Mr Gunn, passed on a warning to Mr Harper after Mr Harper recommended several ineligible shires to be declared drought stricken in 1987. The Treasury warning said there was little doubt the drought-declared areas were experiencing difficult conditions but none qualified for assistance in terms of the guidelines. the Cabinet submission said:</PARA>
<PARA>Any absence of clear guidelines for area drought declarations on aberrations from the established guidelines could well provoke Commonwealth intervention into the State's administration of drought relief. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Fisher says, he should resign. Mr Harper has never shown any prior concern about the rorts in the guidelines for national drought relief assistance. My own electorate has experienced drought conditions in some areas for a number of years. The National Party has embarked on a misinformation campaign to confuse my electorate. In one case, one National Party stooge actually used the issue as a basis for his preselection campaign in Hinkler. I am well aware of the way the Nationals have looked after their mates, to the exclusion of the overwhelming majority of primary producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are several other aspects of this scam which I wish to bring to the House's attention. All honourable members will recall the lousy loans affair involving a National Party organiser who incorrectly received money after the intervention of a former National Party primary industry Minister. In 1986 Senator Walsh wanted an investigation of Queensland's actions. The then Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, said he had no intention of investigating, or cooperating with a Federal investigation. Indeed, in an article in the Brisbane Telegraph of 24 September 1986 Mr Bjelke-Petersen said, `Why should we cooperate? I know what he is after'. </PARA>
<PARA> In April last year I called for an investigation into the scheme on behalf of my constituents in Burnett and Isis. My call was answered in my local newspaper, the Bundaberg News Mail. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA>The State Finance Minister, Mr Austin, denied Mr Courtice's claim that the administration of relief funding should be investigated to restore confidence in the scheme. The State Auditor-General had reviewed and certified the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Austin was quoted as saying, `How could Mr Courtice then fault the State Government's efforts?'. This is a total contradiction and undermines Mr Harper's sham and concern about the scheme. Mr Harper said in Parliament that he was pleading to change the system, while his Cabinet colleague said there is nothing wrong with it. The truth is that Mr Harper cannot be trusted. His actions, since an internal departmental memo became public, do not promote public trust and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at his reaction. When first pressed on the allegations contained in the departmental memo on drought irregularities he dismissed the memo as the work of a junior officer. In fact, the public servant was head of Queensland's drought secretariat. He was a long-standing, well-respected beef husbandry officer who was seconded to the position. For his trouble in writing the memo, the public servant was transferred by Mr Harper. This heavy-handedness was followed by the sending in of the police to terrorise public servants, to scare them out of testifying before the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Fisher says, the Special Branch-it is something that happens in South America and it is tragic that it is happening in Queensland. The issue was referred to the Committee. Again, Mr Harper refused to act in a responsible manner. The Public Accounts Committee's preliminary report found that the Primary Industries Minister's response to the memo was cursory and did not address the specific issues raised by Daly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The preliminary report stated that Mr Harper issued a press release which said that the State's 1988-89 Budget announced a revitalisation of local drought committees. The report stated that this revitalisation was to involve the drought secretariat, but by 13 December 1988-the date of the drought memo-the drought declaration problems referred to by Daly had not been addressed by the revitalisation. So Mr Harper was caught out in the preliminary report by the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Harper has a penchant for dishonesty and maladministration. His ministerial incompetence is legendary. As Justice Minister he turned a blind eye to the Sturgess report's warning of possible corruption in the licensing branch of the Queensland police force, and of course we are fully aware of the subsequent matters that have flowed from the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. A former public servant in the Department of Primary Industries (DPI), Mr Clive Sellwood, passed this commentary on the system Mr Harper has presided over in his administration of drought relief:</PARA>
<PARA>You could drive a truck through some of the holes in the scheme and some owners have been getting away with hundreds of thousands of dollars for years.</PARA>

The problem is that they feared that if they knocked back prominent National Party members in some areas, senior officers would tell them not to rock the boat. If they are paying off a home and have a young family, the last thing they want to do is to be sent to Birdsville or somewhere like that for making trouble. What do they do? They accept the pressure that is brought to bear on them; they have no other choice. It is a sad indication of the way in which the Department of Primary Industries has been run in Queensland for many years. The officer said there was a constant threat of a punitive transfer hanging over any officer's head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are serious allegations. I hope that the Public Accounts Committee inquiry will be able to bring all this out into the open. What we need in Queensland is decent, open, accountable and honest government. Mr Harper's sending in of the secret police shows the desperate lengths to which he is prepared to go to prevent the truth coming out. Even in Daly's memo, there are no names mentioned-possibly because he feared his Minister's reaction. If the Special Branch has been sent in, as I said, it is no wonder that he was fearful. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many grounds on which Mr Ahern should sack Mr Harper. Mr Ahern has failed to provide effective leadership and has not demanded the resignation of someone who has so pathetically failed the overwhelming majority of primary producers in Queensland. Politically, Mr Harper is a walking disaster and it is about time Mr Ahern gave him a political burial for misleading Parliament. </PARA>

I know the Minister will recall that she recently wrote to me about the aspirations of Kempsey Shire Council in my electorate to have some form of night navigation beacon. It is absolutely wrong that a vibrant community such as Kempsey, and the whole MacLeay valley, should be hamstrung and hampered by the fact that regular scheduled aircraft are able to land only in daylight hours. I think it is quite amazing. An argument has been going on for some time. Deputations have approached previous Ministers about this matter. While we have always had a good and sympathetic hearing, sympathetic hearings are not worth the paper they are not written on. I seize this opportunity to again say to the Minister that we are not talking about a great deal of money. Kempsey Shire Council is prepared to cooperate with the Government in every way. I appeal to her to look at this matter again to see whether there is some way that the Government can assist in providing something which is not remarkable-a night navigation beacon so that Kempsey airport can be used by commercial aircraft in the hours of darkness. This problem greatly inhibits the area's commercial growth and tourism potential. </PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadow to the Minister that I will be approaching her fairly soon, in the next month or two, on behalf of Hastings Municipal Council, the local government body which serves Port Macquarie and the Hastings area. As the Minister knows, Port Macquarie is one of the jewels of the north coast of New South Wales, and one of the great growth areas in terms of development and tourism. It is also an area in which elderly people choose to retire. Again, the airport situation is not adequate. There is a need for upgrading to jet standard. I acknowledge the Minister's sincerity and the way she feels about these matters. I know she would agree that as the Government says it is interested in tourism, it should acknowledge the great potential for growth in this area. I know that the Minister will give every possible sympathetic consideration to my request for Hastings Municipal Council to be able to upgrade its airport so that it can play its part in the great growth of the tourist industry in Australia. I will be making that approach to the Minister in the next several months. I know we will get a sympathetic hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I wish to raise again-and I am sure it will come as no surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, or any other member of this House-is the need to upgrade the Pacific Highway. It is a pity that the Minister's colleague the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) is not in the chamber because I could again issue to him an invitation to travel with me along the highway. I have suggested to him on a number of occasions that what he should do is travel by car with me from Hexham in the Hunter region adjoining his own electorate, to the Queensland border so that he can see at first hand what is necessary. The Pacific Highway serves the fastest growing areas in Australia. It is the busiest highway in Australia. I will be consistent: I applaud what the Minister has done in specifying it as a national arterial road. It was the right thing to do, but it requires special funding on two counts: one is the volume of traffic and the other is the climate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal first with the climatic factor. Mr Deputy Speaker, a cyclone is possibly approaching your electorate at the moment. We know there have been three cyclones in the north-east of Australia in the last few weeks. The Pacific Highway on the north coast of New South Wales is adversely affected by the spin-off-the flooding and the devastating heavy rain. Therefore, there needs to be an acceptance and an acknowledgment that the climatic factor means that the highway requires additional funding. It is vastly different from, say, the Newell Highway in the west of New South Wales. Regrettably, rain does not fall with such regularity in that area. Along the Pacific Highway there is not flooding but constant heavy rain and the impact on the road surface is such that road crews are out virtually night and day for months at a time, trying to repair potholes. I make the plea to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support that he consider looking at appropriate funding to compensate for the climatic effects on the Pacific Highway. Of course, those of us who are lucky enough to live in that area do not suffer a climatic disadvantage, because the climate is absolutely superb. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point is the safety factor. I have with me the accident statistics for 1987-the latest figures I have-produced in a paper entitled, `Road Traffic Accidents in New South Wales 1987'. There are five local government areas in Cowper: the Hastings Municipal Shire, which I have mentioned already in terms of its airport-Kempsey Shire Council, Nambucca Shire Council, Bellingen Shire Council and the City of Coffs Harbour. It is interesting to note that all five of those local government bodies share my dedication to improving the Pacific Highway. They are on the spot; they have first-hand information. They realise the need for additional funding. The north coast of New South Wales is, as I have said, the fastest growing area of Australia and the Pacific Highway has the greatest volume of traffic. There is a crying need for it to be upgraded to a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway. I am delighted to report to this House that in recent months the very first section, comprising two kilometres south of Kempsey, has been transformed into a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that where there are divided highways, the accident level drops amazingly. We are looking at the saving of human lives, and matters of enormous significance to Australian society. I do not expect the highway from Hexham to the Queensland border to be transformed overnight; it is a 20-year job. What I have been saying since I was elected to this Parliament is that we must starting planning now and taking the steps which will permit that marvellous transformation to occur over time. The first section has been completed. I have told the House that there is an incredible need for such a project to be completed as soon as possible. I urge the current Minister to look at the matter carefully, to look at the provision of special funding so that the Pacific Highway between Hexham and the Queensland border can be turned into Highway No. 1, which is what it is called, and which is what it should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about the United Nations Conference on Disarmament Issues, but before I do so it is important to note that today is the day on which members of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly are being sworn in. It is a nice coincidence that the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) is in the chamber. Both of us, I am quite sure, would want to give our warmest congratulations to Rosemary Follett who has just been elected the first Chief Minister for the ACT and to give our wholehearted best wishes to the new ACT Government. We also welcome that swearing in, of course, because today is liberation day for us.

We have been trying to do the work of a number of people and we are very glad to be relieved of that responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between 19 and 22 April the United Nations held a conference on disarmament in Kyoto, Japan. The Japanese Government paid for the Conference and the 90 or so participants included disarmament and UN ambassadors from the North, South, East and West, scientists leading the national seismological monitoring agencies, plus a few parliamentarians, journalists and non-government organisation leaders. Australian participants were Mrs Stella Cornelius, head of the Conflict Resolution Centre in Sydney, Dr Ken Muirhead, head of the Australian Seismological Centre, and me. Five plenary sessions were held addressing the issue of a nuclear non-proliferation treaty; issues surrounding a comprehensive test ban treaty; confidence building measures; bilateral and multilateral approaches to disarmament; and global security, which concentrated mainly on superpower relations. The Conference was brilliantly chaired by Mr Akashi, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament. The Conference received enormous publicity in Japan and was important as a means of increasing open, rigorous discussion among senior diplomats, scientists, parliamentarians, journalists and community leaders. The quality of discussions was high and tinged with cautious hope. The debate was predominantly about practical issues in negotiating nuclear, chemical and conventional weapons agreements rather than generalities. </PARA>
<PARA> The topics discussed by this Conference are profoundly important. Certainly, in the international community hope has been increased by the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by Mr Gorbachev and Mr Reagan a couple of years ago. Obviously, cooperation between the superpowers is increasing. Also, in 1988 there were major steps toward the resolution of conflict in several areas of brutal violence around the world. There was the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan; there was a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq; there were signs of independence for Namibia, and the ending of the internal war in Angola; and there was the start of some contact between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which gives us hope of greater dialogue about the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Those achievements certainly generate hope, but we should not become complacent, for potential conflict remains a high possibility. Distrust between the superpowers remains intense. Violent conflict is still a daily occurrence in many countries, as we all know from watching television programs. Military expenditure is still increasing in many countries and is now at a level of about $US1,000 billion a year-a massive waste of resources. Military expenditure is concentrated with the superpowers but many other industrialised countries have large outlays on weapons and forces and even in the Third World there is a high level of military expenditure. Approximately 20 per cent of global military expenditure occurs in developing countries. That represents about $US200 billion a year. It is a tragedy because those funds could be used for much more economically and socially useful activities, let alone for repaying debts. </PARA>
<PARA> The central idea behind the continuing arms race, of course, is that deterrence is the best defence. At this Conference at Kyoto both the United States and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union, attempted to justify the continuing arms race on the basis of deterrence. They would argue that deterrence has been successful because there has not been a war between the United States and the Soviet Union during the last 40 years. As Mr Akashi said in his closing statement, that is like the story of the man who goes around the village beating a stick on the ground and, when asked why he is doing it, says, `To keep the elephants away'. People say to him, `But there aren't any elephants' and he says, `Yes, aren't I successful?'. I thought that proper note of scepticism was quite daring on the part of the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament when both representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union were present. I think there is a very appropriate moral to the story. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, deterrence has a high cost and we need to be sceptical about that argument because of the cost. The deterrence cost is due partly to the increased danger of a conflict through intensification of the arms race and partly to the increasing technological sophistication of weapons. Also, it ties up enormous funds. Those funds could be better spent on more economically and socially useful government programs. </PARA>
<PARA> A reduction in military expenditure by both the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1990s could lead to a decade of higher investment and therefore more sustained economic development both in those countries and in the rest of the world. It is impressive to see that both the United States and the Soviet Union are beginning a process of reducing their military expenditure. That process has been included in the Bush Administration's first budget and in announcements by Mr Gorbachev quite recently. The Soviet Union has announced a 19 per cent reduction in its military expenditure next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations Conference on Disarmament Issues concentrated on practical policies for arms reduction. Those policies should include the strengthening of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). There was agreement that it is important, when the Treaty comes up for renewal next year, that it should be continued for another five years and that it would be strengthened. That strengthening requires the stopping of vertical as well as horizontal proliferation. Vertical proliferation involves an increase in the technical sophistication of weapons by the nuclear states. It is important that they do their part in stopping proliferation if the countries which are not parties to the NPT are going to be persuaded to join. A number of countries-China, France, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Argentina, Israel and South Africa-either have such weapons or are on the verge of having such weapons. It is important that they be persuaded to be parties to the Treaty so that they do not extend the nuclear arms race any further. </PARA>
<PARA> An important part of that is a second policy which was discussed in detail-a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. Both party groups in this Parliament support a comprehensive test ban treaty. It has been a policy of all Australian governments for a long time. It is important that we encourage the superpowers to be willing to accept a comprehensive test ban treaty. Each year at the UN General Assembly motions supporting such a treaty are passed, but so far they have not had much effect. Therefore, there would be value in the proposal for an amendment conference regarding the partial test ban treaty so as to force existing nuclear powers to the negotiating table. </PARA>
<PARA> A third set of proposals discussed at the Kyoto Conference covered confidence-building measures-measures for greater openness, transparency and trust in military relations between countries. The best example of confidence-building measures is the conference on security and cooperation in Europe, which has agreed to prior notification of manoeuvres, sending observers to two large manoeuvres, and the right to inspect military activities of other countries. A fourth set of proposals involved permanent peace keeping forces for the United Nations and the strengthening of dispute settling procedures through the United Nations. I conclude by quoting from the final statement of Mr Akashi, the Chairman of the Conference, because it sums up at least part of the agreement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the differences of opinion, however, there seemed to be agreement that existing levels of nuclear weapons are far more than needed. There will continue to be differences of views on how the objectives of greater international security can be achieved. . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to recent events involving an incident that occurred in the city of Brisbane. In many ways one should not even have to raise such a matter in this place, but one must do so. I commence by acknowledging the attention given to the issue by a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, former Senator Arthur Gietzelt. Honourable members may recall that in April or May of 1986 I raised in this place concerns as to the proposed treatment by crematoria throughout Australia of the remains of former Australian servicemen. It transpired that some crematoria had no intention of keeping remains beyond a certain period unless a new fee was paid. I protested about this. Senator Gietzelt stepped in and said that this should not be so. All Australian crematoria were asked to give an assurance that remains would never be removed and `ditched' at the end of a period of tenure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter arose because at the time Brisbane Crematorium Ltd, the owners of the Albany Creek crematorium and the Mount Thompson crematorium, had had a change of ownership. The new directors and owners had decided to strip its assets and to sell land adjoining the area currently being used by the crematorium. Until that time that land had been zoned for crematorium use. There was tremendous local opposition in Brisbane, based on a number of grounds. Some 5,000 people protested in writing about the events of that time. I became a respondent in the courts after the Brisbane City Council had-and correctly so-refused the application for rezoning of the land. I even put up money. I put my money where my mouth is, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the objections to the rezoning was that it was claimed by people that the area to be rezoned for housing at Mount Thompson had been used by Brisbane Crematorium Ltd as a disposal area for the ashes of those persons whose remains were unclaimed or unwanted. There was considerable argument about that subject. The Brisbane Courier-Mail even saw fit to report on 21 April 1989, in an article by Tess Livingstone, that a spokesman for the Brisbane Crematorium had denied that ashes had ever been sprinkled or buried on the land in question. It was very difficult for those of us who opposed the rezoning to prove that ashes were located there. A month beforehand human bones had been found in the area, but that was not proof that the area had been used as an ash disposal area. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment that land is being developed and 39 houses will be built. I have no argument with the developer because he has been made the fall guy. He has been caught as a result of the lies that were told in 1986. Industrial Equity Ltd, Mr Brierley's company, has owned 50 per cent of the company since 1985. A number of other people were involved in a takeover just prior to that time. They are the guilty people. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, during development of the property, the excavators had cause to dig up the ground. A nearby resident who was taking his dog for a walk that evening looked in the trenches that had been dug and saw 40 or 50 name plaques from coffins, as well as seams of ash. He rang me and I went out there. Fortunately, I had the brains to take a reporter with me. As it was night-time I used a torch to look down the trench. I could see seams of ash, which caused me to call for forensic tests to determine exactly what they were. That night I suspected that I should be smart enough to hide my evidence, so I gathered a lot of name plaques, hid them under a tree and covered them with branches and leaves-just in case something happened. Coincidentally, next morning the bulldozers filled in all the trenches. Suddenly this question was raised: `Well, there are no ashes there, so what is he talking about?' I thank the media for sticking by me. It was agreed that tests be carried out. The crematorium did its own digging, saw what was uncovered and admitted that they were human remains. It is proposed that drainpipes and other pipes be laid in those trenches. I am not prepared to see that happen. Next Saturday, in my presence, the excavating company will dig up the trenches. Crematorium staff will be present to remove those ashes and reinter them in the grounds of what is now the contracted crematorium. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this note: If ever there has been an example of people deliberately lying, misleading the public and misleading the Brisbane City Council, this is it. The denials at the time were so strong that there were doubts as to the legitimacy of the claims that there were ashes there, yet the Brisbane Crematorium has now admitted that the area was last used for the disposal of ashes in 1985. That was at the beginning of the administration of the people who applied for rezoning of the land. Employees, including the person who drove the tractor into this area every morning, must have known that ashes were being buried there. I cannot understand how fellow human beings could remain silent when they knew that the company that employed them was virtually lying through its teeth in a bid to cause land to be rezoned so that it could make a fast buck. I do not believe, nor do I accept, that the then directors would not have known of the presence of the ashes. Indeed, a director from Sydney was brought in to take over the administration in Brisbane because the issue was getting too hot. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask all former directors of Brisbane Crematorium Ltd, including people such as Sir Edward Williams from Brisbane, Michael Evans from Brisbane, and four or five others, to attend the site on Saturday and, when the bulldozers uncover the ashes, to be involved in carefully placing them in receptacles so that they can be reinterred in the grounds of the Brisbane Crematorium. It was a most dishonourable performance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to take the extraordinary step of reading into the House's record part of the normally confidential record of proceedings of our Caucus. I read from a paragraph on page 6 of the record of our Caucus meeting on Tuesday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Whip in the House of Representatives reported on arrangements for tomorrow, Question Time, and arrangements for leave. </PARA>
<PARA> He also extended congratulations to Duncan Kerr on the birth of his son. Duncan replied giving Caucus some details of arrangements he had made for the smooth running of the household at the time of the important event. </PARA>
<PARA>Surprisingly, some of the details of the `smooth running' of our household were reported in the Press. In today's Sydney Morning Herald there is an article written by Mike Seccombe. Because it is so delightful I take the opportunity of mentioning it. Mike Seccombe wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Moves to deregulate the wheat market played their part in losing John Howard and Ian Sinclair their jobs but others, too, have suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Duncan Kerr, Labor member for Denison. On Anzac Day, Duncan's wife, Celia, gave birth to a son, Hamish. It was a difficult labour, so for the next four days, husband spent most of his time at the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, he neglected to walk their two large dogs, and when he finally did, late on the fourth day, one of the dogs bolted right under the wheels of a passing car. </PARA>
<PARA> With the car driver and his wife, also about to have a baby, for company, Mr Kerr began frantically ringing late-night vets. </PARA>
<PARA> Eventually one told him that if the dog had survived the first five minutes, it would probably be allright. Just monitor its breathing, and the colour of its gums for the next couple of hours, the vet said. So Mr Kerr curled up on the floor beside the dog. </PARA>
<PARA> The time came when Mrs Kerr came home from hospital, still substantially below par. She told him, understandably, that she could not cope with the baby and the sick dog, while her husband was busy attending to Parliamentary duties. So her mother, Mrs Joyce Taylor, move in to help. </PARA>
<PARA> Night one, and the mother-in-law trips over the black dog in the dark on her way to the bathroom and breaks her wrist. </PARA>
<PARA> You might think with a new baby and a house full of walking wounded, Duncan might have a case for getting leave of absence. But no. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government Whip, Mr Barry Cunningham, cancelled all leave because the Government's legislation deregulating the domestic wheat market was coming up in the House, and all hands would be needed in case the Opposition became fractious. </PARA>
<PARA> So Mr Kerr dutifully attended in Canberra, only to see the bill go through the House by 124 to 4. </PARA>
<PARA> To make matters just slightly worse, he decided to exercise away some of his tensions with a game of squash. An encounter with a flying squash racquet left him with a black eye. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this was aired at length in the Labor Caucus on Monday. When the laughter stopped, Mr Cunningham apologised. But he left no doubt he would do it all again if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> If you're the relative of an MP or, indeed Kerr's cur, you have to learn to fend for yourself. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a delightful story, and beautifully put by Mike Seccombe. It is also true. I place on record the fact that everyone is well. I now have a very healthy, happy boy, Hamish, aged nearly two weeks. He was born on Anzac Day. My wife has almost fully recovered. My mother-in-law, despite the fact that she now wears a cast, is well and has returned to her home. My dog, although it was run over by a car and suffered bruising has also fully recovered. All is well that ends well. I echo the remarks of the Whip, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham). He indicated that he would do it all again if necessary. The birth of a child is such a happy event that I am sure all of us would go through it again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This weekend in Brisbane a by-election is being held for the State seat of Merthyr. The by-election was caused by the resignation of a former Minister, Don Lane, after admissions of corruption and misuse of his ministerial expenses. Today I want to remind the people of Merthyr about a few things. I want to remind them that only the Labor Opposition opposed Lane's $500,000 superannuation payout, arguing that he should have to pay back the money that he ripped off the public. The Liberal and National parties supported his payout. The only really credible explanation as to why they handed Lane this huge golden handshake is that he has considerably more to tell the people of Queensland than he has already told the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. That is a frightening prospect but one which, when looked at logically, is entirely probable. The 30 pieces of silver he could get for dobbing in his mates is chicken feed compared to $500,000. The people of Merthyr should keep a few things in mind this weekend. The first and most important is that corruption has flourished in Queensland under both the Nationals in power in their own right and a coalition between the Nationals and the Liberals. Don Lane's admissions about his own corruption date back to the time when he was a Liberal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This by-election to be held on Saturday is really a referendum. The people of Merthyr will decide whether the Nationals and Liberals should be taught a lesson for the way they have handled Don Lane and the corruption issue. The by-election gives the people of Merthyr the opportunity to signal to the Liberals and Nationals that playtime is over. The Liberals and Nationals are saying in the by-election that they have the result sewn up and that the people of Merthyr will never vote for Labor. I hope that voters will see through their facade and prove them entirely wrong. </PARA>

So any person who votes for the green independents, albeit that it may be a populist movement, will be, without doubt, voting for political instability in that State. The green independents make up a single issue group, which has caught on to a populist bandwagon of conservation. But beyond their common belief in conservation issues, there is no common policy amongst those candidates. It is simply a single issue group which has caught on to a populist bandwagon.

Labour Day is a very important day in the trade union calendar. It is the day on which trade unions get together to remember the achievements of the trade union movement in improving and maintaining the conditions of workers. It is also a time for workers to look to the future to ensure that those hard fought conditions are not eroded.

<PARA> Australian workers were amongst the first in the world to win these conditions with the famous slogan, `Eight hours to work, eight hours to play, eight hours to sleep, and eight bob a day'. The celebrations were held over the weekend not only in Brisbane but also in many provincial centres throughout Queensland. In my own electorate of Oxley, which is based in the city of Ipswich, a very successful Labour Day dinner was held on the Friday night, followed by a well attended march through the streets of Ipswich on the Saturday morning and then a family sports day in the afternoon. In fact, the first May Day march was held in Queensland in Ipswich in 1891, commencing at 9 a.m. It was always believed that Barcaldine held the first May Day march in Queensland, but in fact Ipswich holds that record, as Barcaldine did not hold its march until the afternoon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make this statement today to advise Western Australian ME and chronic fatigue syndrome sufferers and their families that a public meeting will be held on Saturday, 20 May at the Dorchester Hall in Warwick, commencing at 2 p.m. The purpose of the meeting is to give sufferers an opportunity to have a say on what they want from such a support group. Many people have contacted me regarding the need for such a group and I am pleased to be able to assist in organising this meeting. Whilst I will be writing to people who have already expressed an interest in the subject, as well as placing an advertisement in the local newspaper, I thought that this avenue of making the meeting known to a broader section of the public could not be ignored. I urge as many people as possible to attend so that any propositions put forward represent the needs of sufferers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been suggested at a recent discussion of interested people who are willing to assist such a group that a multifaceted approach would be most helpful, for instance, by providing constructive support for sufferers and their families; by providing information on the diagnosis of the disease; by providing links with other groups, such as the allergy association and pesticide group and by raising the public profile of the disease in the media and in any other way we can. Naturally, doctors and other people who are prepared to treat the disease sympathetically would be very welcome also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has made a great play of its supposedly profound science statement delivered here on Monday, but already the statement is beginning to fall down around its ears. Yesterday the report by the Auditor-General was released. It questions both the administration and the effectiveness of the highly valued 150 per cent tax deduction for research and development. The Auditor-General found that it was 2 1/2 years after the commencement of that scheme before the Australian Taxation Office clarified eligibility by issuing a ruling. So how much abuse of the 150 per cent tax deduction occurred in that intervening period?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moreover, this Government relied on the Tax Office to conduct audits to determine whether eligibility criteria were being satisfied. The audits are only about 2 per cent of the claimants of that tax deduction. It is an abrogation of responsibility of the very worst kind for the Government to have allowed what undoubtedly occurred. Moreover, we now find that the Auditor-General questions whether that tax deduction is really assisting private sector investment in research and development. So there is a whole cloud over this 150 per cent tax deduction. It is foolish for the Government to say that it is the one thing that will bring about increased investment by the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently this Parliament saw the passage of the wheat marketing legislation which, in essence, deregulates the wheat industry. In Western Australia the Potato Marketing Board looks after the marketing of potatoes and regulates the industry. The problem with the Potato Marketing Board is that the result of its marketing activities and its restraints upon the supply of potatoes is that the range of quality potatoes on offer to the public is severely restricted and the quality is inferior. That has meant that potatoes are losing market share to alternatives such as pasta and rice. However, in defence of the growers, very good potatoes are grown in Western Australia. Yet when one goes to the marketing end of things, that is the greengrocers, it is very difficult to find quality potatoes consistently throughout the year. However, if one shops in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne one has a wide range of potatoes. They are marketed according to grade, brand and species.</PARA></TALK.START>

He should have known better than to open his 90-second statement as he did: He began by saying that the wheat legislation was designed to deregulate the wheat industry. Far from deregulating the entire industry, the legislation passed in this House was designed solely to deregulate the domestic market for Australian wheat. That point needs to be reinforced. Too many people, including Senator McGauran, have insisted that the legislation has the potential to dismantle the Australian Wheat Board. There is no such potential. The Wheat Board remains the sole exporter of Australian Wheat and, by my calculations, the prominent seller of wheat on the domestic market. There needs to be an increasing appreciation of the fact that the legislation does nothing more than provide opportunity for the sale of wheat within the Australian domestic market. It does not, as the honourable member for Stirling erroneously has alleged, deregulate the Australian wheat industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As part of an ongoing campaign against the Government, pharmacists in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory have threatened to undertake a token two-hour stoppage during a relatively quiet part of the business day. This campaign is based simply and solely on demands for more money. It has nothing to do with patient care or the delivery of drugs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Pharmacists and some other people are attempting to make the patients the scapegoats of this fearmongering which has taken the form of misleading information about pay cuts and pharmacy closures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government certainly acknowledges the problems with pharmacy remuneration caused by the impact of the 25 per cent mark-up on the escalating drug prices. We also acknowledge that pharmacies in some areas, particularly those single pharmacies in country towns, may be facing difficulties in some circumstances. I want to assure the House that this Government has a total commitment to ensure that essential pharmacy services and health care throughout Australia continues.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not in a position, nor should it be in a position, to prop up any businesses which, for normal commercial reasons common to any other retailer, are no longer viable. It has been claimed by some pharmacists in recent days that up to 70 per cent of the 5,622 pharmacies operating in Australia will be forced to close. This is just absolute nonsense, as some of the more responsible members of the Pharmacy Guild will say. Just as unrealistic are claims of a 14 per cent cut in remuneration in pharmacies in the last 12 months. The calculations that the Pharmacy Guild has put forward are a hotchpotch of wrong assumptions, statistically biased, periods and simple mathematical miscalculations.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is alive and well. Well over $1,000m will be spent on it in this year alone. In the next three or four years the amount will rise to about $2,000m. A look at the number of pharmacies that operate in Australia along with the rate of growth in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme over the next few years shows that claim of such drastic closures and unprofitability are patently ridiculous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my second reading speech on the wheat legislation, I referred to the need for the States to pass complementary legislation, because without it the Australian Wheat Board cannot operate intrastate.

However, just last week the then Leader of the National Party said that I:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . must go to the State Ministers and attempt to get some complementary legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>I did that ages ago. As a result, the Victorian and Western Australian governments have decided to take the necessary action to enable the Wheat Board to operate within those States. So that is about 30 per cent of the domestic market fixed up. But it is the National Party States of New South Wales and Queensland that will not pass the necessary legislation. The New South Wales Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Mr Armstrong, has said that his Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has no reason to pass such legislation, and we will not do so.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an outrageous political stunt at the expense of New South Wales wheatgrowers. I can give Mr Armstrong the reason why he should pass legislation. If he does not do so the Wheat Board will be effectively excluded from up to 45 per cent of the domestic wheat market. A man who does not want private traders in the market will have no-one in the market but the private traders.</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland has passed amendments to its wheat pool Acts to use its State Wheat Board to regulate its domestic market. I recently referred to that Government's agrarian Stalinism. Commenting on these amendments, the Primary Industry Newsletter said of my observation:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that this Government has had an extremely proud record in job creation in this country ever since we came to office. The figures released by the Australian Statistician today, which reveal an unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent, confirm what we have been saying; that is, that the unemployment rate is now the lowest since January 1982, the lowest for seven years-a symmetry which I am sure the Prime Minister will find fascinating. The fact is that there are now fewer than half a million people out of work. The figure is just over 497,000. That means that, in the period we have been in office, over 200,000 people have come off the unemployment queues and into the labour market. Of course, the figure would be much higher than that in terms of the number of people in families who have benefited from this labour growth. However, in net aggregate terms, that is the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noticed yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition was sneering somewhat at the Government's record in relation to alleviating poverty, and particularly child poverty. There has been no better contribution to the improvement in living standards of ordinary Australian families, particularly those who were in the poorest of circumstances when we came into office, than the growth in the labour market. People who were totally reliant on social security payments are now in the labour market, in the work force, and earning a decent living. That is a record of which the Government is justly proud, and a record that we intend to continue.</PARA>
<PARA> In the period we have been in office we have created some 1.4 million jobs. That has not been confined to any particular area, although I might point out that female employment has grown particularly strongly, with an increase of 33.4 per cent, and female participation rates continue at record levels. When we came to office youth unemployment was nothing short of a national scandal, but we have now seen a drop of something like 50 per cent in the number of unemployed young people. Never has there been a more important issue than how we can help young people to make that very important transition from education to the work force. Young people now have better prospects of doing that than they have had for a very long time. I might observe casually that there have been some differences across the country. It is a lamentable fact that in Tasmania the unemployment rate is some 50 per cent higher than it is for the nation as a whole. I suppose that that is a reflection on the regional policies being pursued in that area.</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn for a moment to some other considerations of this issue, particularly as I am today wearing my hat as Minister representing the Treasurer. There has been some suggestion that this growth in the labour market which the Australian Statistician has revealed today is some indication of excessive demand. It is important to remember that what the Statistician is here measuring is the supply of goods and services. This relates to the number of people who are in the labour force who are actually producing goods and services. It is not a measure of demand; it is a measure of the supply of the economy. That needs to be borne in mind. It is also worth recognising where this growth has been. Some people have made the point that this has not been contributing to the easing of our balance of payments situation. Of course, some of the strongest growth in the labour market has been in the area of tourism and hospitality, which is quite clearly an area which makes a very direct contribution to our current account situation.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a tendency for people to concentrate on the export of merchandised goods when what we have to look at first is the question of net exports, that is the extent to which not only merchandise is being exported, but also the extent to which locally produced merchandise is satisfying local demand. There is a very important growth in the export of services in Australia, an area in which I think we have an optimistic future, whether it is in relation to the areas of finance, tourism, hospitality, or even in the provision of education services. So there is no need for this Government to be remotely apologetic about the improvement in the labour market. We are justly proud of it, and we hope it continues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there are none there either. They have been wiped out. Scallop fishing traditionally has been a boom and bust industry. It all depends on the spat fall. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, Victoria and Tasmania increased their scallop fishing efforts, including some bogus investments. I was never able to say much about that at the time. The Commonwealth restricted entry to the fishery in 1984, despite opposition from Tasmania. There was continual opposition and obstruction from the Tasmanian Minister at the time. He was claiming that even a piece of wood in the dirt was a boat to be used in order to increase the fishery's effort. By 1986 the seriousness of the level of the stock was apparent. Major scallop fishing is an area of State jurisdiction, not of Commonwealth. We are responsible for the central zone but, by arrangement, there is a 20-mile Tasmanian zone and a 20-mile Victorian zone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the failure of the Tasmanian Government to take hard decisions over the last five years, the scallops were overfished and the State scalloping areas have been closed for almost all of the last three years. A two-week season is being contemplated in Victoria. I am currently experiencing precisely the same difficulties with Tasmania over shark. As Victorian members will know, shark provides the basis for fish in the Victorian fish and chip market. I am sure that the honourable member for Dunkley is worried about that too. The Commonwealth instituted a shark management plan with the understanding that Tasmania would introduce complementary shark legislation. It failed to do this with the result that I am again faced with the prospect of the Commonwealth Government having to make more difficult and tougher decisions on shark. It will be obvious to honourable members that it is for these reasons that I look forward to the prospect of an Australian Labor Party government in Tasmania. With David Llewellyn as Minister for Sea Fisheries, I am confident that we will not get this constant lack of intestinal fortitude on any conservation issue in Tasmania.</PARA>

It is just as entitled-in fact, in terms of the commitment it has made and what it has produced in this country, some could argue that its entitlement is second to none-to have disposed to it public funding for the undertaking of processes which will be to the benefit, not merely of their members but of the whole community.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2499" SPEAKER="Morris The Hon P.F." NAMEID="HI4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SHORTLAND" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question highlights what is an effective clear choice between the stable effective industrial relations and wages policy of this Government and what can only be described as the irresponsible deregulation policy that is proposed by those opposite and some people in the private sector, which effectively constitutes a no wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past six years, as a result of the consensus approach through the evolutionary accord process, we have seen the creation of some 1.4 million new jobs. We have seen inflation cut from 11 1/2 per cent to 6.9 per cent. We have seen a 12.2 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs and we have seen almost a 60 per cent reduction in the rate of industrial disputation. That is all highlighted by today's figures which reveal the lowest unemployment rate in over seven years; 6.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask the honourable member, because of his deep concern about this issue and the role that he has played with the trade union movement, which is the area he represents, to compare that record with the decentralised approach of the Opposition which relies on the mythical forces of the market to keep wage cost growth in check. A decentralised approach provides for a freedom for sweetheart deals. History shows that when one has that kind of policy, there is one inevitable result: a breakout in wages, a breakout in wages costs and a flow-on to the rest of the community. Even the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia acknowledges a willingness to concede that wage increases of that nature flow through in boom conditions. It also leaves the way open for the weak to be exploited, be they employers or employees. We saw the fallacy of that policy in 1981-82. As the Prime Minister said earlier, we saw in a period of just over 12 months a quarter of a million Australians lose their jobs, we saw the worst downturn in the economy in 50 years and we saw a rapid escalation in the inflation rate. At this time, when there is very strong demand across the trades for labour-specialised tasks, there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that were we to go to a deregulated policy, or an enterprise-by-enterprise environment, as suggested by the Opposition, a massive wage explosion would result.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member referred to the Queensland Government. That Government's voluntary employment agreement arrangement is facilitating the risk of that happening. There is no role, under the recent amendments to the Queensland legislation, for the Queensland Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. There is no safeguard against exploitation of workers and their families, nor is there a safeguard against exploitation of employers. There is no way to prevent sweetheart deals.</PARA>
<PARA> Contrast that situation with the orderly, stable, responsible approach we have through our industrial relations policy and legislation for certified agreements. Within the stability of the Industrial Relations Act of this Government there is room and opportunity for special circumstances of employees to be taken into account through certified agreements. The Industrial Relations Commission has a role in that process to protect the public interest and to prevent an automatic flow-on. That is the responsible approach of this Government to wages policy. It is only this Government that has a practical wages policy. Flowing from that policy, through the award restructuring process, employers and employees now have the opportunity to lift productivity in this country, to lift efficiency and competitiveness, to overcome demarcation problems, to develop multiskilling and to develop career paths and more satisfying and better paid jobs. All of that can be done in the context of more effective training systems with national standards of accreditation. Voluntary employment agreements and labour deregulation would result in one inevitable massive wages explosion.</PARA>
<PARA> As to small business in this country, for those 581,000 businesses with less than 20 employees, deregulation represents a nightmare. It can only spell for them a recipe for disaster. They want the stability and reliability of the assistance this Government provides. This Government will continue to provide that responsibility, stability and uniformity in the administration of wages and industrial relations policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the assessment by the Australian Wool Corporation, published on the front page of this morning's Australian Financial Review, that the value of wool exports next financial year could be as much as $1 billion down on recent official forecasts, the prob- able increase in consumer imports following 1 July tax cuts and the likelihood that the share of investment in tradeables-that is, in mining, manufacturing and other non-manufacturing as defined by Treasury-will be below 50 per cent this financial year compared with 57 per cent in mid-1987, what new steps does he propose to take to contain further deterioration in Australia's chronic balance of payments deficit?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2500" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just get the comments about the wool export figure into some sort of perspective. I do note, as the right honourable gentleman has said, that the Australian Wool Corporation has forecast most recently that wool exports for 1989-90 will be about $5.5 billion. As I think the right honourable gentleman knows, this is lower than the most recent forecast of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, which was a figure of $6.48 billion. It is lower because it takes into account the fall in wool prices over recent weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I think it should be remembered that $5.5 billion still represents a very high level of wool exports, and not significantly lower than the 1987-88 peak of $5.8 billion. So let me not in any sense say to the right honourable gentleman that we would be disappointed if this most recent figure turns out to be the figure. Of course, we would be disappointed if it was $1 billion lower than the earlier forecast of the Bureau, but it should be put into the perspective that it is still in just about the same ball park as that peak figure of 1987-88.</PARA>
<PARA> The question was asked as to what we are doing in regard to the total balance of payments situation. The sorts of things that we have been doing cover a range of areas. Let me quickly go to them. Firstly, from the point of view of the constituency with which the right honourable gentleman is most particularly concerned, I think he has been generous enough in the past to acknowledge, with approval, that we have been doing the best we can, with like-minded countries, and particularly through the Cairns Group, to ensure that the Uruguay Round leads to a successful conclusion. If one looks at the whole world spectrum, there is no doubt that amongst the greatest sufferers of an international trading system which has become corrupted are our great, efficient Australian rural producers. They deserve better. They are efficient; they are among the most efficient in the world. We have sought through our endeavours, not just using our own resources but aligning ourselves with the members of the Cairns Group, to bring every possible pressure to bear to create a situation where out of the Uruguay round we will get a less corrupted international trading system. It is a matter of public and international acknowledgment that Australia's leadership has been significantly successful in helping to break the impasse which had developed at the end of the mid-term review in December in Canada.</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that we can do nothing more important than that. Without trying to score basic political points, I believe that the way that we have not just gone to Belgium and bellowed, as used to happen before, but aligned ourselves with other like-minded nations, has been much more productive in the international sphere than anything that has ever come out of this country before. That is the first thing I say.</PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I say is that, by trying to create a more competitive Australian economy, we are gradually broadening the base of our exports. In the last two years there has been a very substantial increase in the exports of manufactured goods. I say subject to correction that I think in the last two years there has been an increase of 18 per cent, and then about 9 per cent, in the exports of manufactured goods. Also, by giving the enormous boost to tourism that we have by the range of measures we have undertaken in this country, we have made tourism the fastest growing industry in Australia. That is making a significant contribution to the balance of payments situation.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said all those things, we are not in any sense able to rest on our laurels because we are going to continue to make the Australian economy more competitive. We will proceed with the processes of micro-economic reform. I do not want to go through the whole list of things that we have done. That has been done here before in the House recently, and I want to save the House's time. But that list is very significant, as the right honourable gentleman knows. In the near future, the Minister for Transport and Communications will be announcing significant reforms on the waterfront and in the maritime industry-reforms which will have been unmatched by anything that any government before this one has ever done.</PARA>
<PARA> Looking internally at the way in which we are trying to diversify the Australian economy and broaden the export base so that we will not be as vulnerable to swings in commodity prices as we have been in the past, and looking at what we are doing in the international field by trying to create a more level and equitable playing field, I can say to the right honourable gentleman that no government has done more or is doing more than we are doing in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said all those things, I would readily concede that there is no reason why the Government or the Australian community can or should be complacent about the external accounts situation. That is why-and this is the paradox of the Opposition's position-we have fiscal policy as tight as it can possibly be. We have had three years of real reductions in Commonwealth outlays, we have got the public sector borrowing requirement down to zero, and we have reduced Commonwealth outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product from 29.1 per cent to 25.6 per cent. So fiscal policy could not in any sense be tighter than it is. It is impossible for wages policy to be tighter than it is. That leaves only the arm of monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The question is about the current account situation. The simple fact is that if we allow the Australian economy to continue at its current high level of activity and suck in the level of imports associated with that high level of activity, the current account situation is going to get worse. Those on the opposite side of the House rant and rave about interest rate policy when it is quite clear that that interest rate policy is necessary if we are going to attack directly the question of current account policy.</PARA>
<PARA> I say to the right honourable gentleman, therefore, that what we have done in the international negotiating field, in restructuring the Australian economy and in the conduct of macro-economic policy is directed successfully towards gradually, through time, achieving a reduction in what is admittedly a very difficult external situation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of claims made by the West Australian Hotels Association of the kind mentioned by the honourable member for Perth. I think those statements are totally unsupportable. The fact is that the Federal Government, which, rather than Qantas Airways Ltd, has the responsibility of negotiating with foreign governments in relation to bilateral aviation agreements, has been ensuring that there is increasing capacity for other airlines and Qantas to bring traffic into Perth. It is not a lack of capacity which is the cause of any problem with regard to the hotels losing out on tourist revenue in Perth. I do not know the details of the degree of occupancy of hotels in Western Australia, but I can say that as far as international aviation capacity goes there is no problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent months, a number of initiatives have been taken to ensure that there is an even greater increase in capacity. As mentioned in the House the other day, recent negotiations have been completed with Singapore and Thailand to increase aviation capacity between Australia and those countries. That includes the capacity for the airlines of those countries to fly to Perth if they so wish. Recently Qantas approved additional services between Sydney and Perth which will facilitate travel to New Zealand and North America, and also extra connections from Perth to London, Frankfurt, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. I also understand that Qantas and the Western Australian Tourism Commission meet regularly to review air services issues in respect of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government can, and does, encourage foreign airlines to take up their entitlements to serve Perth. The fact is that at the present time 15 international carriers have been granted rights to serve Perth, but only eight have taken up that right. So the problem is not a lack of negotiating capacity but rather the fact that seven airlines which have a right to service Perth do not take up that right. In the end, airlines will make their own commercial decisions about whether or not they wish to fly to particular ports. If the Western Australian Hotels Association believes that more should be done to get foreign tourists to Western Australia, I suggest that the problem is not one of getting increased capacity but rather increasing the relative attractiveness of Western Australia to foreign tourists, and it should be working harder in that regard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present the Government's response to the report Personnel Wastage in the Defence Force prepared by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and tabled in the Parliament on 10 November 1988. The Committee sought to analyse the extent and magnitude of the personnel wastage problem in the Australian Defence Force, and its effect on the ADF's capability. The report offered a series of recommendations which the Committee believed would aid in the retention of personnel in the ADF. On behalf of the Government I thank the members of the Committee for the time and energy they spent in preparing this report, and for their demonstrated concern for the well-being of the Australian Defence Force and for the defence of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As my predecessor Mrs Kelly said to the Committee in August last year, the profession of arms is a unique occupation. It requires people with special skills and a high level of commitment to their work and to their nation. I am pleased to have this opportunity to give due recognition to those who contribute so much to Australia's defence. The men and women of our Navy, Army and Air Force and their families are a very important part of our Australian community. They are justly proud of their service and of their own individual achievements. It is a pride in which we can all share. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, during the bicentennial celebrations, millions of Australians did share that pride, and paid tribute to that skill and commitment during the Naval salute, the Army Tattoo and the air show. But recognition of the Defence Force is not something that should be confined to such occasions, or remembered only on Anzac Day. While it may not always be so visible, that skill and commitment continues every day at hundreds of locations both in Australia and overseas. The Government acknowledges and fully supports that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other important groups also need to be recognised. Firstly, the spouses and children of members of the Defence Force. While they provide invaluable personal support, the inescapable reality of service life means that these families must endure considerable disruption and separation. This Government has been the first truly to recognise and act on the problems of service families. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group which needs to be recognised is the civilian element of defence. The provision of Australia's defence is a partnership to which both the Defence Force and the Department of Defence make a vital contribution. Many thousands in the Department work directly for and in support of the Services, many others, such as those in defence science have, as their primary and predominant task, the support of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's strong and continuing support for the Defence Force is a matter of public record. Despite the present era of economic constraint and reducing public sector expenditures, the real level of defence funding has been maintained. The 1987 Defence White Paper has provided a logical and coherent basis for force development and exercise planning. A wide range of new high technology equipment has been provided or is in order. Later this year, exercise Kangaroo 89 will provide the Defence Force with a great opportunity to test its skills and capabilities right across the northern part of the continent. </PARA>
<PARA>Personnel Wastage</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The present levels of personnel wastage from the Defence Force is an issue of very great importance and concern. The Government has not sought to deny this fact, nor to disguise, in any way, the extent of the problem. We have been most active in taking effective measures to deal with this problem. We have reviewed our manpower statistics so that the true extent of the wastage problem and its impact on specific employment categories, can be assessed accurately. This analysis demonstrated that the primary concern with separations is not necessarily the overall numbers leaving, but rather the impact on some specific employment categories. </PARA>
<PARA> We have analysed the reasons for the current high wastage rates. The major conclusion of that analysis is that there is not one cause for increased wastage and thus there is no one simple answer. The public image of the Defence Force, the challenge of peacetime service, job satisfaction, Service-civilian relationships, conditions of service, housing, the needs and interests of spouses and families, education, postings policy, personnel management, competition from the wider economy, the simple desire to do something different-these issues and more are all involved in the wastage equation. All this analysis was made available to the Committee by the defence organisation in three agreed and detailed and public submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's deliberations and its report took place within the context of a continuing program of Government action both to address the wastage problem, and more broadly, to improve the conditions and personnel management of the Defence Force. Many of the Committee's recommendations had already been implemented or were in train before the Committee's report was tabled. Action has continued during the period in which we have been analysing the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of our overall Defence Force personnel policy we have been actively seeking better personnel management practices, and an ongoing improvement in conditions of service. We have introduced some creative new schemes that go beyond what the Committee's report recommends. We have continued to give priority to the areas we recognised as crucial before we had the benefit of this report. We have, I believe, a proven record of performance across the full range of Service personnel issues, including: successful support for substantial increases in many key general and specialist allowances; the provision of financial, educational and support arrangements for service families; a commitment of $750m to address the long neglect of service housing, with more than $200m spent in the last two years; and recognition of the important area of morale and job satisfaction through more responsible career management, and increased devolution of authority and responsibility. These much needed improvements were introduced as part of an overall personnel management strategy. They were introduced in advance of the Committee's report. Where these improvements also overcome a perceived cause of wastage, we know we are on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report, like any report to government, has the status of advice, not policy. I am happy to say, however, that much of what this report recommends has been implemented, is in the process of being implemented, or will be. A detailed response to each of the Committee's recommendations has been finalised, and I will table it at the completion of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In this statement, I want to go beyond an examination of the Committee's recommendations. I intend to place those recommendations within the broader scope of the Government's initiatives on Defence Force personnel policy. There is one very important difference between the Government's personnel policy strategy and the terms of reference that constrained the Committee's report. As the Chairman said in his tabling speech:</PARA>
<PARA>If people are asked what is wrong with their organisation and why they are leaving it, then that is precisely the kind of information they will provide; they are unlikely to say much about the positive aspects of their employment. </PARA>
<PARA>ADF personnel policy, however, cannot choose to ignore the positive aspects of ADF employment. Indeed, personnel policy cannot be run by wastage. In that regard the parliamentary report is not, and cannot be, the engine for reform in ADF employment and family support. Reform was already in progress at the time the Committee's report was in preparation, and has continued since. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report has provided a valuable focus for discussion; and the spirit of its recommendations fits in very well with what we have been doing. However, I am sure that no member of the Committee would want to see the report taken as the outer limit of what the Government might do to improve retention. In fact, the Government's initiatives in the area of Defence Force personnel policy do go beyond the scope of the Committee's report. Our initiatives take up the Committee's call for awareness, concern and action. They involve some major changes. </PARA>
<PARA>Review of DFRDB</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Today I announce that there will be a complete review of the defence force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme. The Chiefs of Staff Committee has advised me that the DFRDB scheme no longer meets service objectives, nor provides the right incentives to those who choose to make the profession of arms their lifetime career. The Chiefs of Staff Committee has recommended that the scheme be reviewed. The Government concurs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are effectively three groups of ADF personnel. There are those who join up for a short period, often to learn a skill or a trade, who serve out their period of engagement, and who leave to join the civilian work force. There are those who, encouraged by the structure of the DFRDB scheme, serve for 20 years in the ADF, and, in their late thirties or early forties, take their benefit and enter a second career. The third group consists of those who serve as members of the ADF until retirement, making the service their life's work. The DFRDB scheme works well for the second and third groups at the expense of the first. While fitness and strength are still very important attributes, the Defence Force is coming to rely more and more on skills and technology. Therefore, it is time for us to question seriously whether 20 years is still the optimum period of military service for all groups in the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The DFRDB scheme was established in 1972 with the aim of providing a scheme which would be easily understood by its membership; would be simple to administer; and would provide retirement benefits suitable for the special requirements of its members on re-settlement into civilian life. The scheme is now failing to meet at least the last of these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> All public sector superannuation schemes, including DFRDB, are required to conform to the Government's occupational superannuation standards. With regard to the DFRDB scheme, the only significant change which may affect benefits relates to the reasonable benefit limits which are to be set by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. These limits relate to the size of lump sums and pensions on retirement, relative to the level of salary at retirement. While these limits are yet to be set for the DFRDB scheme, they are likely to affect only a very few senior officers. I will make an announcement on the effect of the reasonable benefits limits when they are decided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee said that any review of the DFRDB scheme must be on the basis of no detriment to current contributors. I agree. Let me be quite clear about this. Subject to the effect of the superannuation standards I have just mentioned, the Government gives an ironclad guarantee to those presently in service that the benefits of the existing DFRDB scheme for which they are contributing will remain available to be taken up when they leave the Services. Some months ago my predecessor announced a limited examination of dependants and invalidity benefits under the DFRDB scheme. That examination will be completed. In that respect, it has been of much concern to the Government that orphan benefits under the DFRDB scheme are considerably less than under the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. I am pleased to announce that from the first pension pay day in July, orphan benefits will increase by some $4,300 per annum. Full details of this interim adjustment will be announced separately. </PARA>
<PARA> A small board of expert people will be appointed to review the DFRDB scheme and to recommend what changes should be made to it. The ADF will be represented on the review board. Complete details of the terms of reference for the full review of the DFRDB scheme and the composition of the board will be announced shortly. There will be opportunities for service personnel to make submissions. The terms of reference for the review board will include a requirement to investigate and report on the feasibility of providing serving members with the option of transferring to any new scheme, if they so wish. There will be absolutely no compulsion for any serving members to do so, if they prefer not to. The review of the DFRDB scheme will also be, in effect, a review of the personnel needs of the ADF into the 1990s and beyond. The DFRDB scheme must provide ADF personnel with fair recompense for their service, but must also be a major structural element in the pattern of ADF employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The great challenge for service personnel management into the future will be to make the ADF a competitive and attractive employer of the specialists whose skills our re-equipment program and the modernisation of our force structure require. The Committee rejected the Department of Defence's analysis that, while wastage was of major concern, it was of serious concern only in some specific specialist areas. Without reopening this debate, I think it is important to realise that in future the following is a likely scenario: as Australian industry restructures and develops there will be a shortfall in skilled trades, engineers, project managers and executives until the Government's greatly accelerated tertiary training effort can take up the slack. Skilled members of the Defence Force will be targeted to fill such shortfalls. This case is one where, I suggest, a personnel policy that allowed itself to be directed by wastage would be off the track. The DFRDB review will be predicated on the future manpower needs of the ADF, and on the retirement incomes policy that this Government has put in place throughout the work force. </PARA>
<PARA>The ADF and Community Standards</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government bases its ADF personnel strategy on two fundamentals. The first is the recognition that the profession of arms is a unique profession, with unique traditions, duties and skills. The second is that the defence community, while it is unique, is also part of the Australian community. ADF personnel and their families live much of their lives just as all the rest of us do. They are affected by the same rules and regulations, they are influenced by the same social dynamics, they have the same aspirations as the rest of the Australian community. And that society is changing. It is from a changing society that the ADF has to recruit, and in a changing society that the ADF has to retain, its personnel. We cannot afford to hanker after the values and work practices of the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> We live and work in the late 1980s and the ADF must accommodate itself more to that reality. It is a reality that includes increasing job mobility, especially by younger members of the work force. It includes the legitimate and rising expectations of women for education, for their own careers and for child-care. It includes all the legitimate expectations that members of the Defence Force share with every other Australian-expectations such as good quality housing and educational opportunities for their children. To ignore wider social movements in a serious discussion about service personnel policy is to duck the issues. It is also ducking the issues to pretend that the two fundamentals on which our personnel strategy is based are always harmonious, and this is the one area in which I and the Government are strongly at odds with the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-the Cross Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Review of ADF Pay</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 21 of the report asks the Minister to direct the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal to `undertake a complete job analysis and job evaluation review of the ADF, exclusive of national wage guidelines, for the purpose of establishing wage levels which are based on the recognition of the members of the profession of arms as a distinctive institution'. There are two reasons why this recommendation is unacceptable. First, it attacks the independence of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal is established by legislation to be an independent body which reviews Defence Force pay and allowance claims on their merits. The Tribunal is not subject to Government direction, nor should it be. The only limitation placed on the Tribunal is the requirement that it should have regard to principles determined by the Industrial Relations Commission. These principles include the national wage guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason the recommendation is unacceptable is the principle that the national wage guidelines apply to all Australian employees. In this sense, the notion of service personnel as members of the Australian community overrides their membership of a unique profession. While the Government does not accept this particular recommendation, we do believe that a full pay review should be undertaken-a review within the guidelines. The current structural efficiency principle is designed to reward enterprises that improve efficiency and provide more varied and fulfilling jobs. The ADF has commenced a pay review under this principle. This review will address the compression of salaries of senior officers as recommended by the Committee. The review will incorporate the outcome of the current structural review of higher ADF staff arrangements being undertaken by Major General Sanderson. An important additional outcome of this aspect of the case should be more fulfilling jobs for those posted to Canberra. This will address the perceived dissatisfaction in the middle levels of the ADF towards Canberra postings-a topic much discussed in the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADF pay case will also seek pay adjustments based on structural changes and efficiency measures introduced across the whole ADF. The case will therefore encompass the pay of all ranks in the ADF. The aim is to develop the case for submission to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal later in 1989. A leaner, more efficient organisation uses every resource in a more effective way. And people are our best resource. If they feel they have little effective input into the defence process, are just shuffling papers, or duplicating someone else's job, then dissatisfaction and disillusion are inevitable. The current structural review of higher Defence Force staff arrangements is directed towards rectifying such problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Civilianisation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to continue our policy of civilianisation within Defence. I am aware that the Committee had some difficulty with this concept. Let me reassure it, and this House, that civilianisation does not, and will not, be allowed to degrade combat capability or the operational or manning flexibility of the Defence Force. The aim of civilianisation is not to convert positions from military to civilian for its own sake, or for reasons solely of peacetime cost effectiveness. Rather the aim is to ensure that our military-civilian balance is the one which maximises the combat potential of the ADF. Used this way, civilianisation releases service professionals from tasks which do not require specific military skills and puts them in field positions where these skills are needed. Civilianisation thus increases the `teeth to tail' ratio across the whole of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>Conditions of Service and Service Families</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to the other two major areas: the service family, and conditions of service. I plan to take these together, because they are by nature related. Conditions of service are the elements of ADF remuneration that recognise, in a tangible way, that the profession of arms is a unique profession. Specialist allowances recognise special skills, and other allowances make up for disadvantages or difficulties inherent in service life, most of them clustered around the operational need for postings. Postings impact very much indeed on service families. The dissatisfactions identified in this area by the Committee relate very closely to the effect of mobility. Thus, education, housing and disturbance and rental allowances are all involved here. Under this Government, the service family has become, for the first time, a recognised entity with its own special needs, pressures and difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government, and in particular my predecessor, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) can be very proud of what has been done. I do not have the leisure to go through what we have achieved today, but the Minister has already reported to this House on the implementation of the recommendations of the Hamilton report. We intend to proceed with an alternative to the Committee's suggestion for a White Paper on service families. There have been enough reviews and reports. We prefer to keep achieving results. A defence families policy plan, therefore, will be incorporated in a proposed defence personnel policy plan. That plan will parallel the defence five year program. The family policy plan will coordinate family support measures and allow for a systematic periodic review of these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Disturbance Allowance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Despite improvements in postings policy, mobility is a fact of service life, and disturbance an inevitable consequence. Disturbance allowance is a difficult allowance to administer. It is meant to cover the range of costs incurred by an individual or family during a removal that is not individually reimbursed. Naturally, personal circumstances and expenses of a removal will vary to some degree. Recognising the mobility of the ADF, we consider the present arrangement for married members is sound whereby the amount of disturbance allowance is tiered according to the number of removals experienced. Present rates effective from 29 November 1988 range from $545 for the first and second removals to $1,095 after seven or more removals. We support the recommendation that there should be a survey of disturbance allowance. Defence has set in train a cooperative study with 12 large organisations, both in the public and private sector, which have a requirement to relocate their employees. On a confidential basis each organisation is being asked to provide details of the degrees of assistance provided to its employees to relocate. Defence will reciprocate by providing details of its assistance. It is hoped to have the survey completed by June. The data gained could provide a valuable insight into approaches in other industries and assist in deciding whether present assistance provided to the ADF is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Temporary Rental Allowance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendation on temporary rental allowance reflects a general dissatisfaction with the operation of this form of housing assistance. The whole arrangement for this allowance requires major improvement. Therefore, the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) will, on a progressive basis, substitute itself as the lessee of rented housing. That is to say, when the defence housing stock is inadequate for the ADF's total needs in a particular area, the DHA will take out leases with private owners and the individual ADF tenants will occupy these houses on the same basis as if the houses were part of the permament defence housing stock. I hope that the DHA also will establish a market among ADF members who are home owners and who are leaving their homes on posting. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements when fully in place would remove, for many, the frustrations of house hunting in a new locality and should enable more door-to-door removals with considerable benefits to families who at present must sometimes endure longer than necessary stays in temporary accommodation. The new arrangements will require a lot of preparatory work by the DHA. However, the DHA will take over the role progressively from 1 November this year. Initially, the DHA intervention will be to remove some aspects of the present system which the subcommittee criticises. Members eligible to rent privately will advise the DHA the details of suitable accommodation that has been found. The DHA will take out the lease and the member will be required to pay only the normal personal rental contribution. Bonds paid by individuals will be eliminated, and experienced DHA staff will manage repairs and maintenance in consultation with individual landlords. The important element of choice in rental housing will be preserved. I am aware that some families choose to spend more on housing than the normal level of contribution. Such families will be able to opt out of the new system, while still receiving the same level of housing assistance. As the DHA operates on a commercial basis it will charge the Department of Defence a fee for its services. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is proud of its achievements in defence housing. Progression in new construction and acquisitions has been matched by improvements in the speed and standard of repairs and maintenance. Housing management centres are being progressively established by the DHA in all regions of defence housing concentration. Letters from tenants attest to the high degree of satisfaction with the new standards of repairs and maintenance which these centres are delivering. Following the report in 1986 of the task force that examined Public Service and Defence Force housing, the Government adopted a set of principles to govern the provision of housing for its employees. A key principle is that there should be compensation provided for those who incur a housing disability by virtue of employment. Rents paid by Defence Force personnel have always been viewed by this Government as conditions of service. There is no intention of changing that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other defence housing initiatives that I wish to address today.</PARA>
<PARA>Renegotiation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Services)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The first of these concerns the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Services)-the CSHA(S). Under that agreement, the Commonwealth provides subsidised loans to the States to provide low income housing which in turn is leased to Defence for service housing. Some 14,000 houses presently are provided under that agreement. It is the view of the Government that the agreement has outlived its usefulness. The agreement has failed to provide and maintain housing of the quality or maintenance standard required by Defence Force families. I am pleased to announce that the Government has agreed to seek the renegotiation of this agreement with the States. This action will greatly assist service families by allowing for a marked improvement in the standard of service housing. Under our proposal, the Defence Housing Authority would take over the ownership of 7,000 CSHA(S) houses. These houses could then be upgraded or replaced. The remaining 7,000 CSHA(S) houses would be released to the States for public housing purposes over the next five years. These houses would be replaced by new housing provided under the existing defence housing program. </PARA>
<PARA>Post May 1985 Housing Assistance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The second housing initiative concerns the form of housing assistance to be provided for those who enlisted after May 1985 and who are ineligible for the Defence service homes loan of $25,000 over 25 years. It has been the Government's wish to establish a new form of housing assistance which would help to retain members in service and which would in some way provide a benefit proportional to the service rendered, and to the housing disability encountered by virtue of service. The new scheme, which I announce today, will, as previously, require an initial period of service of six years. Having met that eligibility period, a member who enlists after 14 May 1985 will be entitled to a housing loan of $40,000 with interest being subsidised so that it remains 40 per cent below the market housing loan interest rate. This subsidy will be provided for a period equal to the number of years in excess of six that a member serves. For example, a 16 per cent market rate would mean a subsidised loan interest rate of 9.6 per cent. Loan subsidies will be available for a maximum of 25 years. The maximum subsidy period is 20 years. Details of the scheme will be announced separately. Eligibility for the scheme will begin to accrue when members reach their six year service point in May 1991. At that time, service personnel who enlisted before May 1985, who are still serving and who have not used their Defence service homes loan, will be given a one time option to forgo that entitlement in favour of the new scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Defence Force Families</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important products of the Hamilton report was the establishment of the Australian Defence Family Information Section (ADFILS). By providing service families with information and the skills to use it, ADFILS' aim is to develop a better community spirit and to enable families to help themselves. ADFILS staff is presently working on projects such as employment opportunities and work skills for spouses, health care and parenting issues, neighbourhood houses, child care, sole parent support groups, children's educational programs and youth activities. </PARA>
<PARA> This self help approach, and local defence community efforts need to be recognised and fostered. I therefore have given approval for grants of up to $20,000 per year to be made to each major base for allocation to organisations of defence families which are formed with the objective of assisting local community welfare. Within guidelines necessary to protect the spending of public moneys, the priorities for use of the funds will be at the discretion of the local organisations. I believe these grants will encourage innovative ideas on community support and will be a useful mechanism for the defence community to determine its own highest priority needs. </PARA>
<PARA>Family Information Network (FIND)</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> We have also, since Mrs Kelly reported to Parliament on the implementation of the Hamilton report, introduced the FIND system, a 008 number that service personnel and their families can ring, from anywhere in Australia, to get information on their entitlements or about community services in a new posting, or about anything else they need to know. FIND is convenient and confidential. It answers a need identified in the Hamilton report for service families to have a `clear point' to direct their questions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obviously answering a need. The planning estimate was fifty calls a day; but the inquiries have been running at between two and three times that rate. FIND is a case of appropriate, and relatively new, technology being harnessed to an identified need. 008 telephone services have been gradually increasing in popularity since their introduction, and people are now familiar with the idea. I am delighted that the Defence Force has been able to respond with a creative, simple solution to a time-honoured problem. </PARA>

<PARA>Education</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Cross report identified education as an area of special concern to defence families. Progress, real progress, is being made in that area. The Australian Education Council, the peak group consisting of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the State Ministers for education and their directors general, set up a committee to study mobility issues, following the student portfolio scheme trialled by Defence in 1988. Core curriculum issues are being addressed as part of a related review. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments are a significant breakthrough. They are a tribute both to the Minister and to his State colleagues, some of whose predecessors have been more interested in competition and confrontation than in the sensible spirit of cooperation that is now abroad. I am delighted that the defence student portfolio scheme has been the catalyst for such a positive development. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Consultative Group of Service Spouses also has been asked to advise me on improvements that could be made to the conditions governing extra tuition allowance, which assists with the costs of private tuition when a child changes schools. The take up rate of the allowance has been well below expectation. I believe the scheme could benefit many more families. </PARA>
<PARA> All these steps are designed towards assisting defence families to preserve unity and to minimise education considerations being the cause for family separations. This should be our fundamental principle. When separation must occur due to stages of education reached, the education allowance may be available to assist. The take up of this allowance has been improved in the last two years. This reflects changes made to give greater discretion to those administering the scheme. Nonetheless, there remain a few aspects of the scheme that seem to produce unfair outcomes. These aspects are being reviewed.</PARA>

<PARA> I can also announce today that the Government has decided to implement, in a modified form, the suggestions made by the Committee on postal assistance, and the provision of equipment and supplies so that members of the Defence Force can undertake minor `do it yourself' improvements to their married quarters and singles accommodation. In addition, we are at present finalising arrangements for a discount buying scheme for defence families. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I should like to thank Rear Admiral Alan Beaumont and Mr Ray Finnegan, who have been tireless in their task of reviewing the recommendations of the Joint Committee, and in coordinating the development of the initiatives which I have announced today. Their cooperation, and the cooperation that they have obtained from throughout the personnel areas of the three Services and the Department, demonstrate that service-civilian relations in Defence often are less competitive and more harmonious than myth has them. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay a special tribute to my predecessor, Mrs Kelly, for her great contribution to the improvement of the conditions of members of the Defence Force and their families. The very widely based and genuine statements of appreciation and regret that greeted her move from this portfolio provide eloquent testimony to that contribution. I have high hopes for the measures that I have outlined today. They represent another substantial series of steps in the rational and integrated program of improvements that this Government has provided for ADF personnel and their families. I am confident that these measures also will have a significant effect in turning around the current high levels of wastage. We have proved that we are about getting results. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything that I have detailed today, together with the detailed responses to the Committee's recommendations, is part of a coordinated strategy to improve personnel management in the ADF and to provide better services to defence families. With this package of improvements, ADF personnel and their families have further evidence of this Government's clear commitment to them. I thank the House for its attention, and I table the Government's detailed responses to the recommendations in the Committee's report. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to respond to the Government responses to the report and recommendations of the Cross Committee on Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force (ADF)-the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I point out that some portfolio areas are of such national importance that the Government and the Opposition should be able to adopt a high degree of bipartisanship in respect of our various Party attitudes. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) indicated last Tuesday, immigration is such an area. This should also apply to matters relating to the defence of this nation. By and large, with defence matters, the usual cut and thrust of political sparring should be constrained-acknowledging that the importance of the security of Australia and its people is so fundamental as to warrant a high level of objectivity in political debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, to date, such bipartisanship and objectivity has not been evident in the Government's response to the findings and recommendations of the report on personnel wastage in the ADF produced by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. As we know, that report has identified a most serious state of affairs in the ADF. Yet the Minister's response at the time of its presentation to Parliament and in a formal response today was couched in such evasive and apologetic terms as to make one wonder whether the Government had either not recognised the seriousness of that situation or was so embarrassed that it was hoping to sweep most of it under the proverbial carpet. The response that the Government has given today can be characterised only as being complacent and self-satisfied. It is not the response which the situation in the ADF requires. I remind the House that some of the findings of the Committee were arrived at after the most exhaustive inquiry yet conducted into the question of wastage, with submissions from all sections of the ADF and from people outside the ADF inquiry. Let me quote from the document so that we can once again understand the seriousness of the situation presently confronting this nation. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In sum the effects of wastage adumbrated above amount to a loss of operational capability. It is manifestly obvious that the prevailing excessive level of personal wastage is damaging the organisational health of the ADF. Wastage is undermining the experience and competence levels of personnel. It is impacting on the capacity of the training and personnel management systems to maintain the Force's integrity. The financial cost arising from the abnormal loss of skilled staff and the increased training effort is enormous. At the psychological level, morale has fallen and the potential has been created for institutional and community polarisation. </PARA>
<PARA>We cannot get a more ringing condemnation of the situation than that. I remind the House that this is the report of a joint standing committee which comprises members of all political parties from both Houses. But what do we get? We get a complacent, self-satisfied response. </PARA>
<PARA> The evasiveness of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) has been quite remarkable. In his November speech he managed to condense 40 pages of findings and recommendations in the report into a three-to-four-minute comment with the 48 recommendations summarised and considered in an incredible 70 words. Today's statement is very little better. In a lengthy 40-minute statement on the report, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, was able to comment on only 10 of the report's recommendations. In fact, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the Minister gave as much attention to the recommendations of the report of the Hamilton Review of Effect of Service Life on Spouses as he did to those of the Cross report. To hear the Minister's remarks and then to read the report itself makes one wonder whether the same document is under consideration. I have just read to the House some of the salient findings of the Cross report. </PARA>
<PARA> In his November statement the Minister for Defence informed the House that wastage is substantially too high, that its extent and magnitude will adversely affect the ADF for at least the next decade, that it has caused the loss of operational capacity, that it is damaging the organisational health of the ADF, and that morale is a problem. He acknowledged that. He drew his comments to a close by stating that the Joint Committee nevertheless concluded, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The ADF remains a capable organisation staffed by many high quality and committed individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Minister did not tell us that almost every word in his speech, which pretends to be a summary of the Committee's findings, is taken from only the first six of the 40 pages of findings and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion quoted by the Minister in the preceding paragraph would have us believe that despite all of the identified problems with the ADF, it remains a capable organisation. It is, in fact, not the report's conclusion, but merely is a statement some 10 paragraphs into a 72-paragraph summary of findings and recommendations. The conveniently ignored 62 paragraphs of findings and recommendations contain some of the most highly critical findings of the inquiry-findings, I remind the House, that are so serious in their implications for the quality of leadership and management of the ADF, the appropriateness of its organisational structures and the difficulties caused by the interrelationship between political leadership and professional management of the ADF, as to question the ability of the ADF effectively to achieve its national security objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take the House through some of the disturbing findings which have been so conveniently passed over by the Government in presenting this report to Parliament and in its response. Paragraph 19, which is headed `Leadership', states:</PARA>
<PARA> Service personnel believe that government is not particularly interested in providing . . . leader- ship, but rather is concerned only with managing the Force . . . The fact is that government-regardless of political persuasion-is no longer regarded as a trustworthy employer and politicians generally are considered to be uninterested in defence. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 20 states:</PARA>
<PARA>If political leaders are not well-regarded by broad sections of the Defence Force, then neither are many senior military officers. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 29 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The majority of Defence Force Personnel are dissatisfied with their Service's career management. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 30 states:</PARA>
<PARA>There is also considerable evidence that in some areas the ADF is not well managed. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 38 states:</PARA>
<PARA>During an extended session of questioning, none of the CDF, the secretary or the Dep Sec A was able to give the Committee a convincing answer to the question of whether data are used as a proactive management tool. The clear impression gained was that the system is essentially reactive. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Personnel Management' paragraph 41 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Some of the strongest criticism this inquiry received from serving ADF personnel was directed at personnel management practices. Surveys have found that almost two-thirds of ADF officers view personnel management within the Force as unsatisfactory . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 43 states:</PARA>
<PARA>During the . . . hearing CDF singled out the defence complex in Canberra as having the worst morale in the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 46 states:</PARA>
<PARA>As long as senior management continues to subscribe to the absurd euphemism of `creative tension' as a description of the work environment within the defence complex, the `Russell Office syndrome' will continue to generate avoidable wastage. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 55 states:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Committee were to identify one issue which has mobilised Service discontent it would be what was in effect the 1982-85 wage `freeze' implemented by one government and continued by another . . . There is now widespread dissatisfaction with . . . conditions throughout the ADF . . . While we believe the root cause of the high separation rate the Defence Force is experiencing essentially arises from dissatisfaction with leadership and lack of career and/or job satisfaction, any coordinated strategy aimed at reducing separations is unlikely to succeed if it does not address the conditions of Service anomalies, shortcomings or outright failings . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those quotations, rather than the highly selective remarks of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, give a far more accurate summary of the nature and extent of the malaise which is afflicting the ADF. The Committee's findings should provoke serious concern in government and in the Australian community, for we are not dealing with some minor segment of government responsibility but with a Defence Force commissioned with the task of defending this land and its people. </PARA>
<PARA> When a parliamentary committee-as I have reminded the House-composed of both Government and Opposition members, and intent on being bipartisan, comes to the sombre conclusion that the ADF is suffering from poor political leadership, inadequate management and an inappropriate organisational structure and that this, in turn, has largely destroyed service morale, commitment and motivation, we face not just a problem for the ADF but a situation with the gravest possible implications for national safety and security. </PARA>
<PARA> How has the Government responded to the Committee's findings? We have been told today by the Minister that further studies by the ADF have shown that the primary concern is not with the overall numbers leaving but rather with their impact on some specific employment categories. That view was expressed by the ADF to the Committee and after careful examination of available wastage data, the Committee concluded that it could not support the Department's view. The Committee's precise response was that the ADF's:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . kind of assessment pays insufficient attention to the qualitative aspects of wastage, as well as understanding the overall effect and extent of numerical loses. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Our assessment is that there is cause for concern across a wide range of ranks and skills'. </PARA>
<PARA>That conclusion simply has not been properly addressed by the Government. The Minister told us today what his departmental advisers told the Committee some months ago. It was rejected then, and it must still be rejected, as an inadequate response to a particularly serious problem of widespread and increasing wastage across broad areas of the Defence Force and its specialities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to tell the House that the ADF has concluded that there is no one cause for increased wastage and thus no one simple answer. The Committee and the Opposition agree entirely. But please do not let anyone look to the Minister's statement today for elaboration or acknowledgment of what those causes or remedies are. He does not even try to address the question raised by the Committee's report. The causes of this serious wastage are simply not addressed by the Minister. There is no discussion of the Committee's findings about leadership problems within Defence-not a mention-or the inappropriate organisational structure-where did that come into it?-or the identified difficulties between political leadership and military management. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, we have heard the Minister today devoting almost his entire speech to reassuring comments about personnel practices and conditions of service which either have been, or are being, addressed. Those specific conditions of service improvements may well be commendable and may go some way towards rectifying the unsatisfactory state of affairs that has arisen within the defence forces. However, just as the Minister has acknowledged that there is no one cause of the increased wastage, I suggest to the Government that there are many in the defence forces who will see the Minister's response to the Cross report as having failed to acknowledge and address those major organisational, institutionalised and attitudinal problems that are the root cause of high wastage and low morale. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in my address I suggested that the Government either had not appreciated the seriousness of the personnel wastage situation or was hoping to sweep it under the carpet. Regrettably, after listening to the Minister today, I fear that the work of the Cross Committee and its report have been lost on the Government and that it is unable to appreciate the seriousness posed to Australia's defence capabilities by continuing high wastage rates. How else is one to interpret this comment by the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>As Australian industry restructures and develops, there will be shortfalls in skilled trades, engineers, project managers and executives until the Government's greatly accelerated tertiary training effort can take up the slack. Skilled members of the Defence Force will be targeted to fill such shortfalls. </PARA>
<PARA>There is only one way in which to interpret that remark. The Government believes that there will continue to be a serious wastage from the defence forces into Australian industry; we must all be patient while our defence forces are drained to meet those needs, and somewhere in the future all will be well, as the Government's tertiary education policies produce the skilled people necessary to return Australia's defence forces to an effective and efficient state. In other words, the defence of this nation and its people is to be subordinate to the needs of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the other matters raised by the Minister in his address. I refer to the review of ADF pay. In his speech the Minister said that recommendation 21 of the report asks the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to direct the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal to undertake a complete job analysis and job evaluation review of the ADF, exclusive of National Wage Guidelines, for the purpose of establishing wage levels which are based on the recognition of the members of the profession of arms as a distinctive institution. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There are two reasons why this recommendation is unacceptable. First, it attacks the independence of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>That is sheer and utter nonsense. In fact, it is misleading. As I understand it, this Tribunal has been in force for some years. It is required to do a full review, which it has not yet done. That matter is dealt with in some detail in the report of the Cross Committee. I draw the Minister's attention to page 259 of the Cross Committee report, which talks about the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal consists of three members who are required to have specific qualifications which are appropriate. They are appointed on a part-time basis. They have security of tenure for a period of five years and may be removed during that period only by act of the Governor-General and then only on the grounds of misbehaviour or physical or mental incapacity. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to inquire into and determine salaries and allowances in the nature of pay which are to be paid to members of the Defence Force. It may exercise that power of inquiry and determination of its own motion and from time to time. The legislation prescribes a maximum time between general reviews of salary. The maximum time between general reviews of salary is now two years. </PARA>
<PARA>When was there a general review of salary? In relation to that statement about how the Tribunal is set up, where is its independence in any way compromised by a request `to undertake a complete job analysis and job evaluation review of the ADF, exclusive of National Wage Guidelines, for the purpose of establishing wage levels which are based on the recognition of the members of the profession of arms as a distinctive institution'? Where is the independence of that Tribunal compromised in any way by that recommendation? Paragraph 7.40 on page 267 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Government also strongly influenced submissions made to the COR by the Services themselves. The Defence Force had to rely either on counsel from within its ranks (which was inexpert) or from the Industrial Division of the Department of Defence which was itself an instrument of government policy. As a result, the `submissions of the ADF were hardly those of a body capable of independent decision-making having received independent advice'. The Committee notes that in its early submissions to the DFRT, the ADF made it clear in both its written and oral submissions that it did not necessarily agree with the general wage levels fixed by the COR. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, while we support the establishment of the DFRT, we believe that the wage base from which percentage increases awarded by the Tribunal apply may be wrong; at the least, the method by which that base has evolved is questionable. As long as that base remains unchallenged, therefore, doubts about the adequacy and correctness of ADF salaries will justifiably continue. This unsatisfactory circumstance is compounded by the fact that the DFRT has prevented any inquiry into the correctness of the COR determinations by consistently holding itself bound by National Wage Case Guidelines. Consequently, service personnel have found themselves locked into a system in which the starting-point may be unfair, but the rules have prevented any challenge. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is hiding behind this response: `We think that the recommendation of the Cross Committee would in some way interfere with the independence of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal'. People right throughout the defence forces know that the starting point which they have had to put up with is most probably wrong. Yet, they are prevented, by the rules which the Government is continuing to administer, from having that starting point properly evaluated. I do not know-and neither does the Opposition-what the result of that review, which we recommend, would be. However, we do know that service personnel right throughout Australia would feel a great deal happier about the basis of the data upon which their salaries are calculated if that review were held-and properly held. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest that in some way the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal's independence would be qualified is sheer and utter nonsense. It is simply a way of locking the defence forces into a situation which so many people believe is unfair. If we want to seriously consider the morale and the attitudes within the ADF, we cannot have a continuation of a situation where people strongly believe that the basis upon which salaries are being calculated is simply and fundamentally flawed. We will not change that attitude by saying suddenly, `We are not going to accept that recommendation because it would attack the independence of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal'. It is simply a sham, it is a subterfuge, and it will not do anything to attack one of the main causes of concern right throughout the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA> A large number of recommendations are contained in chapter 7 of the Cross report. I refer to recommendation 47. Let me spell it out to the House:</PARA>
<PARA>To assist the Committee in its wish to monitor progress in the implementation of its other recommendations, the Government in its response to this report to provide costings for each of the individual measures proposed in Chapter 7. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. Chapter 7 encompassed recommendations 20 to 46 inclusive. The Minister, in supplementary information provided to the House but not mentioned in his speech, said this in his response to the recommendations:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Agreed. Chapter 7 encompasses Recommendation 20 to 46 inclusive. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a few. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It has not been possible to cost each recommendation as a number depend upon the outcome of further study or reviewed during the period through Feb 90, whilst others will be subject to the normal industrial processes. Financial provision will be sought in draft Estimates in 1989-90 and subsequent years to implement those recommendations which Government has approved. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Cross Committee was trying to do-and no doubt it did not escape the attention of the Minister-was to nail down the cost of the recommendations so that the debate about whether the recommendations could be accepted or not would be conducted in a full and open manner with people aware of their costs and so there could be no dispute about the costs. It did not require the Government to agree to all of those recommendations; it required the Government to cost them. What do we find? The document reads:</PARA>

He knows that Forward Estimates are prepared every year for Budget systems and he knows that when he puts forward a proposal which will be implemented in the future, it can be and must be costed before it is considered by the Cabinet of the day. The document states further:</PARA>

<PARA> There are a substantial number of recommendations. The purpose of recommendation 47 was to avoid the very thing that the Minister has done in his response to this report. I have not added them up but, a significant number of recommendations Nos 20 to 46 are not costed. Why not? Was it too hard for the Department? Was it too much trouble? Does it make the argument a little more difficult to sustain when the Minister responds to the Cross report? Is it a bit embarrassing?</PARA>

<PARA>That is some of the toughest language about a situation in the Australian defence forces ever put down. As my colleague has remarked, it is a bipartisan, all-party two-House report. The Minister has come in here with a lengthy statement of 40 minutes duration, has not addressed the basic underlying reasons which have been clearly set out in the report, has dealt with a few of the recommendations and has given us a response-a pretty weak response-in a supplementary document which has been issued. He has talked about one of the most fundamental areas, that is, the review of ADF pay in a way which is clearly misleading, totally wrong, hiding behind a spurious excuse. Yet he expects this Opposition and this House to respond positively to a most disappointing, a most complacement, a most self-satisfied reaction from a government which, it can be seen from that response, does not take seriously one of the most fundamentally worrying aspects of modern Australian life; that is, a situation within the defence forces which calls for the most serious concern on behalf of the Minister and the Government. Unfortunately, it does not have it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I do not think we are going to find that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), in his prepared responses, largely read, will make as much use of the 30 to 40 minutes he is allowed as senior Opposition spokesman in participation in debates such as this as did his predecessor as defence spokesman, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White), who will speak later in the debate. I think he completely misunderstands the nature of the response document which has been put down. Basically, most of the hard matters addressed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade concerning the question of defence service pay and conditions and the way members of the Defence Force live were addressed in the response of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons). Unaddressed were many of the vagaries contained in the quotes that the honourable member himself used: general expressions of concern about the way in which the defence forces are managed and led which may or may not accord with the facts. They are simply perceptions and many of the recommendations of the Committee are offered up just as perceptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government is to take note of those, then basically it is a question of how Ministers and leaders in the defence forces choose to conduct themselves in public and the points they intend to make to service personnel who may have those general impressions of overall management. But quite clearly, they are not matters that can be sensibly addressed in the sort of response which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel was obliged to make today. They may or may not be accurate perceptions, and in a considerable number of those cases they simply have to be addressed by reference to the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, one particular quote that was headed off as fact by the honourable member for Warringah was the suggestion that the previous Government had imposed a wage freeze and that had been sustained. That is absolute nonsense. We are supposed to take that particular statement seriously. It may be true that that is a perception, but it is a perception not based on reality. So, indeed, there is a problem for the Minister if that perception is widely held, because I am obliged therefore, by the lesson I draw from the report, to convince Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel of the facts as opposed to an erroneous perception which may be held. But I am not sure that that perception is as widely held as the Committee considers. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been one wage freeze in the history of the last decade of Australian politics. That was instituted for a 12-month period by the previous Government. The Defence Minister of the day made absolutely certain that the wages and conditions issues that were to be considered by the committee of reference, which in those days was totally dependent on ministerial direction as opposed to our remuneration tribunal which is not at all, was totally dependent on defence direction. He made absolutely certain that what was to be a reference for a pay increase did not get before it before the decision of the Government overall to legislate to prevent pay rises generally in the community. So the defence forces missed out whereas others went through. Since that time, of course, there have been regular wage adjustments obtained through the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal and substantial increases in service allowances and other aspects of pay and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> So that we can get this debate in perspective, I quote a few statistics in the short time available to me so that when this is debated in a fortnight or so honourable members can base their comments on them. The situation in terms of wastage is now materially different from the time when the Committee sat to consider the matter. On the basis of actual separations to the end of March and known separations for the remaining three months of 1988-89, the following statistics can be offered: Total ADF trained force officer separations in 1988-89 are anticipated to be 15.3 per cent lower than for the previous year. This result is evident in each of the Services, and the detailed comparison is: Royal Australian Navy, down by 8.7 per cent; Army, down 24.9 per cent; Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), down 9.5 per cent. While ADF trained force officer separations are lower than last year, they are still higher than the long term average. However, Army officers are below the long term average by 9.5 per cent. As is well known, RAAF experienced pilot losses are higher. Projected losses for Air Force other ranks and trained forces are 2.4 per cent lower than for the previous year. Navy projected separations are slightly higher due to two one-off factors. These are separation increases due to an extra apprentice intake which occurred in 1980 and the three intakes of general duties recruits in mid-1987. All of these personnel have completed their contracts. While Army other ranks separations are significantly higher, this is a consequence of the introduction of the open ended enlistment scheme. This increase is a one-time effect with no negative long term implications. </PARA>
<PARA> So the situation is now materially different, due to a large number of factors. Some of those factors are entailed in the way in which the Government has chosen over the last few years to address the issue of service pay and conditions. Other of those factors are a product of a generational process through the defence forces. The fact is that we are now coming to the conclusion of a 20-year period after the very substantial intake into the armed services that occurred during the Vietnam war. Those who came in at that point in time-and there was a certain inflation of ranks to cater for that-are now largely moving out of the process. There are still another few years worth of that, but we are getting pretty close to the end of that 20-year period. That no longer impacts upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be adjustments from time to time in loss rates in the Services that relate to the performance of the economy generally. I would have thought that it was obvious that if there are skills entailed in the defence forces, and the training services are being provided uniquely in the community, we are going to be the object of depredations from the civilian sector when those skills are in high demand. There has been a sad neglect until recently by the airlines, for example, as regards their obligations to provide training opportunities for pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the adequacy of the response to this report, whatever the view of the Opposition which is one group that has been notably critical of the Government's response to personnel wastage issues, the Returned Services League of Australia has a totally different response. I quote from Brigadier Alf Garland who today congratulated the Government on accepting 41 of the 48 recommendations made. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>These recommendations can be expected to have a significant effect upon the conditions of service for the men and women of the Navy, Army and Air Force. The response shows that the Government has recognised the unique nature of service in the ADF with special conditions to compensate for some of the special disadvantages under which members of the ADF work. I congratulate Minister for Defence Beazley for his actions in bringing about acceptance of the recommendations and past Minister for Defence Personnel Kelly, for the work she did. Minister for Defence Personnel Simmons now has to ensure implementation and allocation of sufficient funds to keep these new programs going. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, most of the things which people have wished us to address on the question of pay and conditions in the armed services that are raised in the report have been addressed by the Government. Many were being addressed before the Cross Committee on Personnel Wastage in the Australian Defence Force sat. Whilst there is some recognition in the Cross Committee report of the activities undertaken by the Government, I would be somewhat critical of it in the sense that it did not thoroughly deal with these and analyse their potential impact in the long haul. </PARA>
<PARA> One area where I think this Government has reason to be very proud is in the defence service housing area. When I became Minister for Defence there were two essential points of criticism on service pay and conditions. Subsequently, there have been many others, and they have been addressed particularly by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, when she came in to take that portfolio. The first issue was that of pay. The Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal began to systematically address that. There have been dramatic increases in service allowances in some areas and substantial increases in service pay. The other area was housing. We hear no more of housing these days. And well we might not, because the performance of the Opposition in this regard makes no comparison whatsoever with the achievement of the Government as far as defence housing is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already provided funding and are committed to a $750m program. In six years we will have authorised nearly 3,500 new houses and completed the same number. This is over 33 per cent more houses than the previous Government achieved in seven years. There have been similar improvements in the area of accommodation for singles in the defence forces. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, in response to the Cross Committee report, has been announcing new flexibility in the housing area to make very substantial improvements in that utterly critical service condition even more effective; that is, widening the range of choice, opening up new opportunities to Defence Force personnel to choose the nature of their accommodation so that they can perhaps have opportunities to save more and acquire their own housing for the long term and in terms of a benefit to enable them to acquire houses. So what the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel was talking about was addressing the serious issues as far as our defence forces are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I take some comparisons on wages. I take a comparable position from 1 January 1980 to 30 June 1988. In this period a private has had an increase in income of 102 per cent, while an Australian Public Service (APS) equivalent fitter has had an increase of 84.3 per cent; a warrant officer, class 1,109.6 per cent and an APS equivalent, 90.5 per cent; a lieutenant, 101 per cent and an APS equivalent, 83.1 per cent; a lieutenant-colonel, 93.5 per cent and, the APS equivalent, 86.7 per cent; a major-general, 95.1 per cent and the APS equivalent, which is Senior Executive 4, 87.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that needs to be made here is that one of the disabilities we have suffered in the Defence Force is that, in any circumstances, it is difficult to maintain morale in peacetime. One has only to ask the fellows going to Namibia what their morale is like. If one then compares that with the morale of the rest of the Defence Force, one will get a pretty good idea of the extent to which peacetime soldiering and peacetime participation in the service is difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems we have confronted is a persistent misleading of service personnel in respect of the relevant conditions of staying in the service compared with what is available outside. Sometimes it is possible to secure better employment outside but, in many cases, it is not. In fact, after travelling around the bases and talking to service personnel I have found that they have not comprehended the fact that in the community generally people have had considerable difficulty, because of the economic problems faced by the community as a whole, in securing the pay rise that they would like and, in that regard, they are not unique. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the lessons from the Cross Committee report that I take seriously-and this goes to those many, I am afraid, very vague sections-relates to the question of leadership. When inaccurate information is conveyed, when there is an impression that there is a unique singling out of the defence forces for unfair activity and when there is criticism of their capacity, capability or whatever-all of which impact on morale-instead of sitting back and taking that as part of the argy-bargy of politics, the chiefs of the various defence forces and I must exercise leadership, get up and counter false propaganda, whether that false propaganda has a basis of misunderstanding or is deliberate in order to secure a political effect. However, one of the things that is certain in respect of the more extravagant claims in the area of pay and conditions, is that there will be well considered cynicism-and the Cross Committee mentions this, too-about whether or not the other side of politics will deliver all that is demanded. Bearing in mind that cynicism, I would say that commonsense ought to suggest that members on both sides of the House should be very careful about inducing it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the Government has respect for the profession of arms. We have respect for the excellent job they do for this country. We are prepared to call on them in time of need and honour the commitment they make to us. We have respect for them as individuals in our society, for their families and for their pay and conditions. We have exercised that respect in detail in the seven years that we have been in office, and the many improvements in benefits to service personnel in that period are ample testimony to that. Our response in this instance is just one further example-not a new start-of the way in which we have been prepared flexibly and generously to address the needs of our serving personnel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This response is nearly the last that I will make as a shadow Minister, and it seems appropriate that I speak to the report on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force-the Cross report. I, with the support of my colleagues, initiated this inquiry by asking the Senate last year to direct the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to examine the wastage which was crippling the Australian Defence Force (ADF). We had to do it that way because the Government would not act, despite the fact that it was told time and again of the problems that were emerging within the Defence Force and the serious implications of a reduction of defence force capabilities. The Government would not act so we took the matter out of its hands and put it into the hands of Parliament through a parliamentary committee. I congratulate the Committee and its chairman, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Cross), who is in the chamber. The people of Australia thank him and the Committee for the job they did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon I have sat here and listened to the Government's response. Certainly, the report contains things that will be welcomed. I have already heard the Government's response described as evasive, insubstantial, self-congratulatory, inconsistent, bureaucratic, rhetorical and disappointing. In some respects, I agree with all those criticisms. The average soldier, sailor, or airman who picks up this report, which undoubtedly they will do from this afternoon onwards, and reads it will, generally speaking, look in vain for a substantial improvement in his pay and conditions of service. So, generally speaking, I believe that the Government's response has been ineffective basically because of the approach of the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). I do not know whether that response is still based on ignorance or just academic arrogance. In an interview given by the Minister for Defence in March of this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not owe anybody really an explanation on how it is dealing with defence. </PARA>
<PARA>That implies that the Government owns the Defence Force instead of its being a very temporary administrator. I believe that there is a reason for this arrogance. The Minister has an academic approach. He has read some books on defence and simply thinks that he knows it all. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that in later years, when people look at the period in which the Government was in charge of the Defence Force of this country, the Minister will be judged as a failure, as the man who presided over the destruction of the Australian Defence Force as a viable, effective fighting machine. The Minister has promised much but given little. His first major failure was his continual promise leading up to, and during, the presentation of the White Paper of a real 3 per cent increase per year in defence funding. That has never eventuated and year by year the defence budget has been whittled away. The equipment program, above all else, has been retained and that has meant a continual cut in operations and in personnel programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The second failure stems from the continual cuts in the budget. Because the planning proceeded on the basis of a 3 per cent real increase, the equipment programs were maintained. However, anyone who has any understanding of the ADF knows that the essential balance between equipment, personnel and operations has been destroyed. As the experience levels drop, more training-not less-is required and we simply cannot afford to cut back on the operational budget. The Minister has created a disaster in respect of this imbalance which will take years to put right. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's third failure has been his inability to grasp a proper strategic concept for the Australian Defence Force. Although the Government denies it, it has created a fortress Australia mentality which is simply not appropriate for 1989. It is a `come and get us' mentality which will lead to great problems. Our strategic concept should be based on a strong deterrent, which has been allowed to diminish, based on submarines and F111 aircraft. The F111 group is under threat of disbandment, there is no aerial refuelling and no airborne warning control. The Government has neglected its responsibilities in regard to regional involvement. The regional assistance program is of a minor nature. The regional deployment capability has continued to run down since the Minister took stewardship of the ADF. We still have no helicopter lift ship and no real offshore capability. The Minister is now talking about our deployment capability-I have not heard him deny this but I wish he would-being dependent upon paratroopers. Imagine, as a first response that this country undertakes, dropping paratroopers into some country that is experiencing problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth failure, and the one we are really addressing here today, has been the shameful neglect of the Australian Defence Force personnel. The Minister keeps saying that all is well. The fact is that, of the 70,000 men and women who have been looking to this Government for leadership, support and guidance, 50,000 have left in the last six years. It is not just 50,000 over a base of 70,000; it is 50,000 over a base of 62,000, because the other 7,000-odd are under training. In another year or so the Minister will have turned over the equivalent of the entire Australian Defence Force, yet Government Ministers stand up here day after day saying that all is well. Today I hear Ministers saying that the rate is declining. It is declining for one very good reason-that there are not enough people left in the Services who have served sufficient time to get out. That is the exact point that the Royal Australian Air Force made at a recent meeting. Of course the rate is declining, because the base is declining. For years the government has ignored this problem. It was passed on to Minister Kelly, who started off by saying in August 1987:</PARA>
<PARA>And frankly I think the whole issue is being incredibly exaggerated. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that following that she improved her performance. She did try, but with a lack of resources there was not much she could do. It is no wonder she ran for cover at the first opportunity, knowing that this response to the Cross report was coming down. Now we have a new Minister, Minister Simmons, who has been sold a dump. He started off by saying the other day, when talking about the RAAF problems:</PARA>
<PARA>I specifically reject the suggestion that the RAAF lacks sufficient aircrew to deal with anything more than the most benign contingency. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the very thing the RAAF was telling him. The new Minister comes in here and says that he rejects it. I do not know on what basis he rejected it. Minister Beazley continues to deny that there is a problem. Again today he said that everything is going well and that the problem was caused by the Vietnam hump. Most of the people who served in Vietnam have long since gone. That has nothing to do with the current wastage problem. The Minister says that one of the reasons for the wastage is that people are coming to the end of a 20-year service period. If he looks at the figures he will see that most people are going well before they have done 20 years. I do not know whether he is speaking from gross ignorance or just bad advice. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some credit to be given to Minister Beazley, and that is for the restructuring of the Australian defence support industries, and we spoke about those here yesterday. But in all other aspects he has failed. He does not yet understand what he has done to the Australian Defence Force. The best summary of the Minister's performance, I believe, was in a recent article by a very experienced defence correspondent called Peter Young, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the reality is a politician who was rolled in Cabinet in his first major funding fight and who is now desperately trying to stretch out the lowest allocation of GDP to defence in nearly forty years. A strategist who has been proven disastrously wrong in his assessment of our regional environment . . . A leader who has turned his back on the special demands of the men and women under his command and seen more than half of them vote with their feet. A Minister who has seen his White Paper fall apart in tatters as his brave new plans for reform have been stretched from five to twenty-five years. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the state of our Defence Force is abysmal. I have spoken about the lack of balance between equipment and operations and personnel. A lack of a proper strategic concept and a lack of attention to personnel have resulted in a sadly debilitated state. We think back to our disastrous reaction to the Fiji coup in 1987, not because of any lack of effort on the part of the personnel who took part, but simply because they did not have the resources to do the job. Since then, the situation has gone backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Services say about themselves. There are cries from the heart for someone to help them. The RAAF. in a recent report, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is unarguable that the current aircrew to aircraft ratio is so low that the RAAF would be incapable of fully utilizing its assets in any situation except for the most benign contingency, and then only if this was transitory in nature. </PARA>
<PARA>What more damning report can we get than that? The Royal Australian Navy said in its report:</PARA>
<PARA>Greater emphasis on unit training is required to compensate for this low level of operator and maintainer experience . . . generally, ships have achieved most annual continuation training targets, but have maintained a less than optimum level of proficiency in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. The Army reports similarly. And the Minister for Defence has the hide to get up in here and say that there has been no loss in Defence Force capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to address some remarks to people in the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force. As far as the Department is concerned, it is true that it has been heavily politicised. Anyone in the Department will tell us that, and it is a much poorer department for it. It is not offering frank advice to the Minister; it is not saying what should be done; it is trying to anticipate what the Minister and the Government want. It is certainly offering the advice that the Minister wants to hear. Either the public servants who are doing that are frightened or they simply do not understand. If they are frightened, there is no hope for them. If they do not understand, they should take the advice of experienced service men and women who, to many public servants, are simply becoming irrelevant as the Public Service gets its grip on the Department of Defence. I remind those public servants that they are there to serve the nation and the military forces of this country and not to impose their own standards, disciplines and ideas on those military forces. </PARA>
<PARA> To the leaders of the ADF, who have been criticised here today by other speakers, I say this: You have a great responsibility to the men and women you command. I urge you to put them before your own personal ambitions or the whims and obsessions of politicians. Not all the leaders in the ADF have done so. I urge you to give your advice strongly and fearlessly to politicians and to public servants, most of whom simply do not understand what is happening in the defence forces in this country. I remind you that your soldiers, sailors and airmen are depending on you. They have nobody else to turn to because the Government has let them down. Lastly, I thank the men and women in the Defence Force for their contribution under difficult conditions in recent years. The Australian nation owes them a great debt of gratitude, and I want to put that on the record from the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, to the Government and the Ministers I say this: Stop posturing and prancing where the ADF is concerned. Take a look at what is happening in the forces and move to fix it before it is too late. You have been dragged screaming to confront the problems by the Parliament and the Cross Committee giving you the evidence of what is happening in the Australian Defence Force. Regrettably today you have made a wimpish response and even in this simple test you have failed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is, in many ways, defence and veterans' affairs day in the House of Representatives. There are Bills for debate tonight on Namibia and Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd. There has been the response to the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade about personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force-the Cross report. At the instigation of the Opposition, reflecting its priorities for veterans and war widows, there is, on this broadcast day, this very important matter of public importance for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The commitment to veterans is a debt owned by a nation as a whole to those who fought for their country in time of war. The whole matter of repatriation should, to the maximum extent possible, be dealt with on a bipartisan basis as an obligation to those who served. Indeed, let me quote two former Prime Ministers-one from each side. Ben Chifley, speaking about those who served their country in time of war, once told this House:</PARA>
<PARA>On this Parliament rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Arthur Fadden told this House:</PARA>
<PARA> A grateful nation must see that those who are privileged to return from battle areas shall be properly cared for. </PARA>
<PARA>What have we had since the mini-Budget of May 1985? What has impacted on the half a million veterans of World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and other conflicts, on their dependants and on ex-service personnel generally? According to the Bureau of Statistics the veterans community is quite large-some one million people. We have had a series of cutbacks and a series of very complex changes. The situation reached the stage where, on the day after Anzac Day, some 2,000 veterans rolled up to a rally in the Sydney Town Hall. It was not even an official rally for veterans' organisations, but it was one which enjoyed the support of the State President of the Returned Services League (RSL) Sir Colin Hines. In attendance was a very determined group of veterans and war widows. The apology of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) was recorded. </PARA>
<PARA> At that rally a statement was made which should have shaken this Government to the core. The statement was that the veterans had not had a fair go under this Government. They did not want excessive entitlements or indulgent government expenditure; they wanted the right to a proper and dignified latter-day life for the service they had given to their country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Veterans' Affairs was not there. I acknowledge the reason for that. It was that he was the Minister officially escorting the Vice-President of the United States of America, Dan Quayle. But I do not accept the fact that no other Minister was sent to that rally in his place. There was not even a senator or a lower House member from the Government to represent the Minister. Who was sent? The Deputy Commissioner of the Repatriation Commission in Sydney was sent. He did a workmanlike job; but it was not his job. It was a rally dealing with policy. Notice was given of that rally and no Minister turned up on the occasion to represent the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that this afternoon we saw, for the first time, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs cross the Rubicon and cast personal reflections upon me at Question Time. That is particularly regrettable. I have always conducted the veterans' affairs debate on a bipartisan basis as much as possible. I have spoken of policy matters and decisions and not cast any personal reflections. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Minister's decisions which rankle the veterans and war widows that we are addressing today. Let us look at some of those decisions. Let us go back to just prior to the 1985 mini-Budget. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) will remember that at that time the assets test was ripping the heart out of veterans through cutbacks in service pensions. Some 13,000 veterans lost their service pensions or had their service pensions reduced. Poverty traps were created in particular areas, especially on the north coast of New South Wales and in northern Victoria, because of the flawed design of the assets test introduced by the Hawke Labor Government. It was only after campaigning by the coalition and the RSL that the Government brought in the hardship provisions and made some adjustments. But that was too late for many veterans, who saw it as a bitter pill in recognition of their service to this country. We then had the 1985 mini-Budget and the travel allowance was halved. That affected veterans travelling from Gippsland to Heidelberg for specialist treatment and from suburbs all round Melbourne to specialists in Glen Waverley. At the same time, the related subsistence allowance was also halved. There has been very little adjustment since that time. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Government do then about dental treatment for veterans? It placed a limit of $300 on four categories of dental treatment. Mark my words, this was four years ago-the 1985 mini-Budget. Has there been an adjustment of that $300 limit since May 1985-four years ago? No, there has been no adjustment. So the real value of that limit has come down with the increase in dental costs. The Minister should be ashamed of his approach to that issue. Last week in Question Time we gave him a chance to explain that, but he passed it up. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members might well ask: Who squibbed what? Finally, in the May 1985 mini-Budget we had the tightening up of the totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) criteria. It was brought into the Parliament late one night and subsequently affirmed in the Veterans Entitlements' Bill which came in later in that month of May 1985. An official report of the Government says that it is saving more than $100m a year in respect of the cutbacks in the TPI criteria. In conjunction with the RSL, the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association, the Australian Veterans and Defence Service Council and others, we had to battle to get the Government to take on board the anomaly which that provision created. Time does not allow me to detail it, other than to say that our policy came out earlier last year before that report came out-as it happened, by a matter of weeks-and in it we declared our support for the introduction of an extreme disability adjustment. Subsequently, the report recommended that. I will give credit where credit is due. For once, the Government moved rather quickly. In the subsequent Budget, the Government adopted the extreme disability adjustment, but adopted it on criteria which are so stringent that only a handful of veterans in relative terms have qualified in the first four months of its operation. Again, those criteria must be reviewed. It is a commitment of the coalition's fair go policy for veterans that it will review the criteria for the granting of the extreme disability adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> I roll forward to the Federal Budget of 1986. What happened in that Budget? War widows were eliminated from the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. On this day across the nation chemists have closed for two hours. For the first time in the history of this nation they have closed down as a reflection of their protest at what the Government has been doing to pharmaceutical benefits not only in the broader national health sphere but also in the repatriation sphere. That cutback was introduced and it has been in existence ever since. The war widows' social security component was frozen at $60.05. It had no consumer price index loading on it and has remained frozen ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also took that opportunity to break its contract with former service personnel and impose a further 2 per cent cutback, which we campaigned against. To give credit where credit is due, I am pleased to say that that was reversed in the economic statement of two weeks ago. It is a matter of record that that economic statement merely began to address and rectify the raft of cutbacks and complex changes imposed by this Government. If it was otherwise, a crowd of 2,000 would not have been attracted to the Sydney Town Hall two weeks after the economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to list a number of other areas of cutbacks but I will not go through them all because I know my colleagues supporting me will concentrate on ex-prisoners of war. I acknowledge that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) has spoken very well on that subject in recent weeks. He has been forced to because of a lack of action. Let us turn to what happened with regard to Defence service homes. I remember a headline in a Townsville newspaper which read `Minister Vague about Changes on Defence Service Homes'. It refers to this Minister in his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with this matter of the consultant. It goes to the heart of the matter. I now know why no Government representative turned up at the Town Hall. It is because he or she would not have been game enough to face the music if I revealed that the Government paid a part-time consultant $215,000 to assist with the transfer of the Defence Service Home Loans Corporation from the Minister's portfolio to the Westpac Banking Corporation. How would that have gone down? I would not have been safe because they would have been so upset about the situation that they would have rocked the floor and the roof would have come down. That is the score. An amount of $215,000 was paid. There were no complaints about the Minister employing a consultant. There were no complaints about the consultant he employed. He is a man of recognised ability. I acknowledge that but that is not the issue. The issues are, firstly, that the Minister knew about it last Tuesday and, secondly, the amount of $215,000. In the official documents we turned up late yesterday, after our prodding in Senate Estimates and the eventual response, we found that the consultant undertook preliminary negotiations. He interceded on major points of issue and he provided general oversight to the project. More particularly, his period of consultancy was officially for six months from January to June 1988, with a five month informal extension on the basis of a diminishing work-load. </PARA>
<PARA> We should tell the war veterans and war widows that this Government found $215,000 and agreed to that payment whilst at the same time maintaining a $300 limit on four categories of dental treatment and, more recently, imposing a $5,000 statutory patient contribution on veterans in nursing homes for war related conditions, including World War I veterans and TPI veterans. The honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), who has taken a deep interest in the plight of World War I veterans, has highlighted the real hardship that has caused. I am proud to be able to tell the House that, in accordance with the coalition policy in respect of veterans' affairs, on gaining government there is a black and white absolute commitment that we will abolish that statutory patient contribution on World War I veterans, TPI veterans and those in that category who are ex-prisoners of war. That is in our policy. It is a clear cut reversal of the Minister's and the Government's decision to impose a statutory patient contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will no doubt say, `What did we do when we were in Government?'. He will say that it has boosted overall expenditure from $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. That masks the real situation. He knows that half of that amount-$2 billion-relates to service pensions. The majority of that $2 billion is the equivalent of the aged pension and will be paid for by the Government in that category anyway. If we take that away we get down to the nitty gritty of what this Government is spending on veterans' affairs. Of course there is not an unlimited chest of Government money to spend on veterans' affairs. But we have to maximise that dollar, bring compassion to the administration of veterans' affairs, boost the payments as is appropriate where responsible Government can afford to do so, because we are aware of the decline in their standard of living under this Government, and provide above all a fair go for those who served their country in time of war. One war widow said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke won his seat in Parliament on the promises that he would help the poor including pensioners but to me he failed woefully . . . I would like to know how the men in power would like to be a pensioner-</PARA>
<PARA>or war widows, or veterans-</PARA>
<PARA>and then be asked to pay everything when all concessions are taken away. It leaves us well below the bread and dripping line. </PARA>
<PARA>That sums up the plight of veterans and war widows under the six years of this Government and, more particularly, since May 1985. I say of this Minister, good chap as he may well be regarded and no doubt is, that I proffer no personal reflections but I do object strongly to his decisions in respect of gold embossed calling cards and gold embossed consultants. Where is the gold, silver and bronze for those who served their country in time of war?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) has misrepresented the facts, as he always does. Once again he used the typical old Liberal-National Party scaremongering tactics against those poor and infirmed veterans and aged persons whom we look after. That is his trait all the time-scaremongering, running around the country and misrepresenting me. I will put a few facts straight. He was talking about the cutbacks in the Department of Veterans' Affairs but spent most of his time denigrating Mr Uhrig and saying why I was not at this so-called veterans' rally in Sydney, where there were supposedly 2,000 veterans. When Sir Colin Hines asked for a show of hands of how many people were from rent-a-crowd, they were not game to put their hands up. The honourable member knows that. He also knows that Sir Colin Hines only turned up; he was not invited. He decided to go because the whole thing was set up to try to get Sir Colin to come. The honourable member knows that. He took part in that. I am sure Sir Colin will be interested in the fact that the honourable member took part in a rally that was not even organised by any veterans' organisation.

I will not turn up to any rally that is not organised by a legitimate veterans' organisation. The honourable member would turn up to any show or fun fair to misrepresent the facts, as he has always done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member is saying that there should be a fair go for the veterans and that the Liberal and National parties are all about a fair go for veterans. What happened when the Business Council of Australia made its recommendations that there were not enough cuts by this Government and the first thing that we should do was to do away with the Department of Veterans' Affairs? Who does the honourable member think agreed with that and said that the Business Council of Australia did not go far enough? It was the new Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). He said it did not go far enough and that it was right in what it said. He said we should do away with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. What about the acting shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson)? Do honourable members want me to remind them of what he said in an interview? He said that he lived in fear of being the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. We have two senior shadow Ministers in the Opposition, one saying that we should do away with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the other one saying that he lives in fear. That is what the Opposition thinks of the veterans' community. The honourable member knows that as well as I do. I know he has had a tough job and he is going to have a tougher job staying on the front bench with this new team. I know he cares for veterans but he is misrepresenting the facts again. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer says that there have been cutbacks. Let me tell him about a couple of those cutbacks. He said that we have a $300 limit on certain types of dental treatment. There are no financial limits on any dental treatment required for war caused disabilities or on treatment required for cancer. This includes approved specialist dental treatment and the provision of full and partial acrylic dentures. The honourable member for Farrer knows all this, but he again misrepresents the facts and refers to the $300 limit. The $300 limit applies only to certain special dental treatments-gold fillings and other special treatments. But any veteran who is in need of treatment is entitled to get it, as long as he gets approval. The honourable member knows that that is the case, but once again he wants to scare the veterans and those in need, the people that the honourable member is supposed to be representing in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to refer to total and permanent incapacity (TPI) eligibility. Once again, the honourable member for Farrer knows full well what the TPI eligibility is. He knows that originally it was for totally and permanently incapacitated veterans who came back from the war with bad injuries. The TPI was introduced some 60 years ago. The honourable member knows that the legislation was changed to provide that the TPI payment would not be made once a person reached the age of 65 years unless that person could show a loss of earnings or income. The honourable member knows all this, and his policy does not indicate that a government of which he would be a part would reintro- duce it. I will refer to the Opposition's policy and the flaws that are in it. Would the honourable member advocate the reintro- duction of TPI for people over 65 years of age? He would not be prepared to do that at all, but he is in here again misrepresenting the facts, saying that we have cut out the TPI. The honourable member is absolutely unbelievable in the way he misrepresents the facts. He and I both know what the TPI eligibility criteria are. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer talked about the extreme disability allowance. He said that he was the one who introduced it. However, it was introduced as a result of a recommendation by the Veterans' Entitlements Act Monitoring Committee. The honourable member knew what it was all about but he jumped on the bandwagon and said that that was part of his policy. He knew that the recommendation was going to be made. Who provided this allowance for veterans? It was not honourable members opposite. What did the honourable member's colleagues do in all of the years that they were in power? I think the honourable member for Farrer's best effort in this Parliament was to hand the ex-Leader of the National Party of Australia, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), a question in relation to veterans. He will not take any more questions from the honourable member because we know where he finished up. What a question that was!</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer wanted to know what we were going to do about ex-prisoners of war. The honourable member knew full well the answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). The honourable member for Reid speaks in here from the heart about ex-prisoners of war. `Tough Tim' was up here thinking that this was his chance to hop on Tommy's coat-tails. However, for nearly two years the honourable member has paid no attention to veterans whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been two years since a matter of public importance on veterans was last debated in this place. It is on now because honourable members opposite are all in disarray. They said `We'll give poor old Tim a go today', and he is scaremongering in the veterans' community again. I find the honourable member unbelievable. I honestly thought I could talk to the honourable member and that I could trust him, but after today I know that I cannot trust him. However, I will still talk to the honourable member and try to help him whenever I can, because he is in trouble. He knows that as well as I do. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer talked about the nursing home contribution regarding veterans. He knows that the purpose of this scheme is to bring all veterans into line with one another. There could be one veteran in a nursing home who was not paying the contribution and another TPI veteran who was paying the contribution. Every veteran is treated equally in a nursing home. The honourable member knows that. The honourable member talks about some people being required to pay the nursing home fees. How many people are involved? Why does the honourable member not tell the truth? The honourable member for Farrer may be able to tell the Parliament and the veterans' community how many people he is going to look after. I ask the honourable member to get up and tell the truth about how many there are. The honourable member knows full well that that payment is the contribution that veterans make for their board and lodgings. The Government and the taxpayers of Australia contribute another $18,000 on top of that. The honourable member is misrepresenting the facts again in relation to those poor veterans, those deserving people who need special treatment. They need support and should not be subject to the scaremongering tactics that the honourable member goes on with all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member gets up and says that the war widows were taken off the repatriation and pharmaceutical benefits scheme. He knows as well as I do that the repatriation and pharmaceutical benefits scheme was introduced to help veterans who came back with war caused injuries. That was the reason for the scheme. In addition, 82 per cent of the drugs that are covered by the repatriation scheme are on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme-and that is what the war widows are entitled to. The extra drugs that are covered by the repatriation scheme-and the honourable member knows this-are for use by service men and women with special war caused injuries. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also misrepresented the facts about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. He referred to the drugs that have been taken off the list. But the honourable member knows that it is the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee-not the Government-which decides what drugs go on the list and what drugs come off in relation to the repatriation and pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is made up of eminent pharmacologists and pharmacists who determine what drugs will be affected. God help us if ever politicians and bureaucrats decide what drugs will be allowed. Some drugs are taken off the list because they have side effects or they are addictive. The honourable member tries to make out they are taken off for a special reason and that they are being taken away from the veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee contains a nominee of the Returned Services League (RSL) and nominees from other veterans organisations. None other than Major-General Digger Jones, a famous Vietnam and Korea veteran, is on the Committee. He is the representative of the veterans' community. The honourable member for Farrer will say that he is not denigrating people on the Committee, that he is not accusing them but that he is accusing me. The honourable member knows full well who is on the Committee and who determines which drugs will be on the list. Once again, the honourable member has been caught out misrepresenting the facts. All he can come up with are some incorrect facts about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, war widows and dental treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to refer to the famous policy of the Liberal and National parties. They say that they would have a separate modern Department of Veterans' Affairs. Once again, the honourable member has pinched the Australian Labor Party's policy. His policy is almost identical to ours. He could not write his own policy so he copied ours. He says that we must have a good look at a so-called modern new department. </PARA>
<PARA> Also as part of his policy, the honourable member says that a Liberal-National Party government would further improve the repatriation hospital system throughout Australia. How much do members opposite think that taxpayers and the Department of Veterans' Affairs had to pay to tidy up the mess that they left in the rehabilitation hospitals? We have spent over $100m on refurbishing and putting new equipment into those repatriation hospitals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the comments already made in this chamber today by my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). I assure listeners in this House and in the outside world that I have seen him in action at my own Returned Services League (RSL) club at Ringwood in Victoria. I emphatically assert that he sticks to the facts and represents only National or Liberal Party policy. I am happy to have him in my RSL club at any time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are talking here today about repaying a debt so enormous that perhaps it can never be sufficiently repaid. Sadly, we are talking about the fact that this Government has stepped back from its responsibilities and obligations to people to whom we all owe so much, the men and women who have served in our defence forces during times of conflict, and their dependants who were called upon to share the sacrifices made by their loved ones. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, there are past and present members on both sides of both Houses of this Parliament who have first hand experience of what I am talking about. Two who come immediately to mind are my geographically, if not ideologically, close colleague, the honourable member for Streeton (Mr Lamb) whose father died as a prisoner of war working on the construction of the notorious Burma railway, and my South Australian colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), whose father-a former member of this House and Minister during the Menzies years and then High Commissioner in London-was also taken prisoner by the Japanese. I understand that he was a prisoner in Changi at the same time as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and that they were good friends. I use these two examples to illustrate that the effects and legacies of war cross all political boundaries, as should our attitudes towards the treatment and compensation of war veterans and their dependants. If ever their was an issue calling for bipartisan consideration and action, this is one. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I want to pay a very sincere if inadequate tribute to a man who throughout his 30 years in this Parliament has continued to campaign for fair and adequate compensation for former prisoners of war, in particular those who suffered imprisonment by the Japanese Imperial Army during the Second World War. I mentioned his name just a few moments ago. I refer, of course, to the honourable member for Reid. Yesterday in this House the honourable member for Reid delivered one of the most moving, graphic, compassionate and convincing speeches I have ever heard, and I would urge members of the Parliament and of the community generally who did not hear the honourable member's speech to make sure they obtain a copy of Hansard and read it for themselves-read it and think about it. I ask the House to consider the almost indescribable hardships, the horrifying deprivations and the extent of the courage shown and sacrifices made by these men and women, and then to consider the manner in which a supposedly grateful nation is compensating them for the way in which they suffered and endured, and in many cases are still suffering and enduring.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has its priorities all wrong. It can and definitely does find money to fund all sorts of ineffective and inefficient projects. The list is far too long to quote here, but many examples will readily spring to the minds of all honourable members, but the Government cannot find sufficient funds to properly compensate and care for our veterans, our former prisoners of war, and our war widows. What a disgraceful and unacceptable state of affairs. The cutbacks and complex changes introduced by successive Ministers of Veterans' Affairs during the Hawke administration have created disbelief, hurt and confusion amongst the veteran community, and those depending on the Department of Veterans' Affairs for assistance and support. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in this House during Question Time last week said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government looks after the veterans of this nation more than anybody else in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is a most questionable one. It is also insulting to those groups and organisations such as Legacy and the RSL, which are dedicated to and actively involved in serving and caring for veterans and their dependants and families, often providing far more in the way of practical assistance and moral support than this Government could or would ever do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to say that he and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) were obliged to give consideration to the important and urgent matters regarding former prisoners of war of the Japanese, that were raised the day before in a question from the honourable member for Reid. Again I quote the Minister's words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . all the consideration for which the honourable member for Reid has asked. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely, after 44 years, the time for consideration is over and the time for action has arrived. As the honourable member for Reid said in his speech yesterday, `Action not taken immediately will prove too late for the ever dwindling survivors of the Japanese prison camps of the Second World War'. The same is true of all veterans, prisoners of war and their dependants. If the Government waits long enough before taking the action it is morally obliged to take there will not be many left to receive the benefits and entitlements which are unarguably their due. </PARA>
<PARA> A case in point was a veteran I was proud to number amongst my constituents. I refer to the late Bill Elliott, a First World War veteran who served in the Gallipoli campaign and later in the muddy trenches in France. Bill Elliott was badly gassed whilst serving in France. He suffered from the physical effects of this dreadful experience for the rest of his life. When he returned from the war, he worked as a coal miner. Nothing could be worse. </PARA>
<PARA> He fought a continuing battle against the Department of Veterans' Affairs in a vain endeavour to gain recognition for the fact that his serious respiratory problems were attributable, at least in part, to his war service. He took his case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and then to court. He died before his claim could be finalised. He believed the Department was playing a waiting game, and I am afraid that I agree with him. The amount of compensation being sought was relatively small, but to Bill Elliott it was the principle that was most important. He was a fine old man-a proud and honest man-and until the day he died he believed he was being unfairly deprived of something that was rightfully his, and he could not understand why. </PARA>
<PARA> Although he kept fighting for proper recognition and compensation, the odds were against him because of his health and his age. The Turks and the Germans could not beat him or break his spirit, but the Department of Veterans' Affairs could, and did. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Bill Elliott's experience sums up the saddest aspect of this whole issue. Men and women put their lives on the line for freedom and democracy and for the protection and preservation of the Australian way of life we hold so dear. Their loved ones kept the home fires burning and took on all the other responsibilities and challenges of the home front. They simply cannot comprehend why they have to fight so hard to achieve fair, just and reasonable recognition of, and compensation for, their efforts and sacrifices. </PARA>
<PARA> They do not understand the reasoning behind, or justification for, the fact that they are increasingly the targets for penny-pinching, pettifogging, cost-saving measures introduced by an uncaring and unsympathetic Government. Such measures-and these are just a few examples-the halving of assistance for country veterans who must travel long distances to obtain necessary health care; the exclusion of war widows from the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme; a $300 per year limit on the cost of dental treatment; and the imposition of a yearly $5,000 statutory patient contribution on veterans in nursing homes, particularly when they require this level of care because of war related conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate here that the coalition is committed to abolishing the statutory patient contribution for World War I and totally and permanently incapacitated veterans immediately we are returned to government. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these measures are only saving a few hundred thousand dollars, but they are causing untold hardship and heartbreak. I ask the Minister and the Government: What price the life of a husband and father who died in the service of his country? What price the sadness and suffering of the widow and children he left behind? What price the horrifying physical and emotional experiences of those who served as prisoners of war, particularly in Japan? What price the lives of young men and women which have been ruined forever because of the terrible experiences of war? I refer to people who left our shores as confident, fit 17- and 18-year-olds, and who returned broken in health and sometimes even in spirit, those who have had to cope on a daily basis for years and years with the ghastly legacy of permanent physical or mental damage. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that no price is too great-and I am confident that this belief is shared by the vast majority of Australians. I am confident that most people are appalled when they discover that our veterans are not receiving the same level of government care and consideration as are their counterparts in, for example, Canada or the United States. I share the sentiments of the honourable member for Reid when he said, as only he can, is his Grievance Debate speech of 20 October 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>It is about time that all the penny-pinching, miser- able and narrow-minded people with cash register hearts had some compassion for some of the conditions of these ex-servicemen. </PARA>

The rate of service pension has increased from 22 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1983 to its current level of 24.9 per cent. These facts are indisputable and acknowledge the fact that veterans within our community need financial support. This Government is prepared to make that kind of financial commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the honourable member for Farrer of the 23 years in which the Opposition was in government and the kinds of financial outlays which were made to veterans in our community. We have expanded the financial commitment of government to our veteran community. In the last April statement the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced that indexation would be brought forward and put into play for our service pensioners. Earlier, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs outlined the need for $114m worth of expenditure to upgrade, expand, modernise and improve the repatriation facilities system and our hospital system, which will ensure the delivery of quality health care to the veteran community. As the Minister outlined-and I reiterate-the fact is that those services had been allowed to run down. </PARA>
<PARA> What we see now is a government committed to the health care of our veterans and prepared to spend money on them. We have replaced the operating theatre and support facilities at the Concord Repatriation Hospital. We have replaced six wards in the outpatients department of the Heidelberg Hospital. In my own State of Queensland the support facilities and operating theatres at the Greenslopes Hospital have been replaced and modernised. Operating theatres have been replaced and refurbished at the Daw Park Hospital and at the repatriation hospital in Western Australia. In fact, in every State of Australia we have seen an upgrading of operating facilities for our veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> This surely shows care and concern for our veterans and their health, to ensure that they get the very best of medical treatment and hospital care. The Government has spent a further $58m on buying specialised equipment to put into the repatriation health care system. Why? Because we acknowledge that those veterans have very special health needs. It is only through acknowledging this fact and acting upon it by the purchase of specialised equipment that these needs can be met. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1988 the Commonwealth announced that it would negotiate with State Governments for the integration of the repatriation general hospitals into the State health systems. Why would it do this? It did this to provide the ageing population with care closer to home, family and friends; to ensure that our veterans can go to the hospital closest to them and be treated in the best possible way; and to enable us to attract the very best of staff to look after our veterans because hospitals which have a mix of patients and illnesses attract staff and retain them. It meant also that repatriation hospitals are part of our regional health networks in each State, forcing States to acknowledge that repatriation hospitals and the care of our veterans must be central and an integral part of any health program and of any health system in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer says that none of this counts and that this shows an uncaring and ungenerous government. That is simply nonsense. We have the unambiguous guarantees given by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that integration will not proceed until such time as veterans can be guaranteed priority of access. That priority is essentially what we are about. It is important to acknowledge that what we want and what we must ensure always is first class attention for our veterans.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the programs of which I am particularly proud is the Joint Venture Scheme. It has received a total of $2m from the Government since its introduction in October 1985-not in 1965 or 1955, when the Opposition was in Government and supposedly caring for our veterans, but in 1985, when we were in Government. The objective of this scheme is to provide services to veterans within their own homes and to ensure that they get good home care. The two schemes of which I have intimate knowledge provide lawn mowing and companionship services to veterans to enable them to live in their own homes and in their own community, to maintain their friends and also to attend their local Returned Services League club, where they can reminisce and feel part of the veteran community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Venture Scheme stands as one of the things of which our veterans are very proud and, in fact, proud to participate in. Let me say as a member of this Government that I am very proud to be associated with a scheme which acknowledges that people have different needs and treats people as individuals, caring for them not just on a simpering level but in a very real and caring way. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot of discussion today about totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pensions. Of course, nobody has acknowledged that this Government has amended the Veteran's Entitlements Act to ensure that TPI pensions are paid for life, clarifying an adverse Federal Court judgment concerning that eligibility. There has been no acknowledgment of that fact by members of the Opposition. The reforms that have been inculcated with the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1987 give an overall perspective of the care and concern for veterans in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the 1987-88 Budget, prisoners of war (POWs) in Nazi camps became entitled to a one-off grant of $10,000. There has been no acknowledgment of that. We have heard lots of discussions about prisoners of war and the trials and hardships they endured-and nobody in the community would not acknowledge that-but it was not until 1987 that that was acknowledged in a visible and practical way by a payment to veterans. It is easy to have rhetoric, but this Government has made the rhetoric reality. It has ensured that veterans in the community will get quality health care, that POWs in Nazi camps are acknowledged and that their service pensions are expanded and are at a higher proportion of average weekly earnings now than they were during the whole period the Opposition was in Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also set up a monitoring committee to examine the operation of veterans' entitlements, to ensure that those entitlements continue to meet the needs of the veterans in our community. Also, this Government acknowledges that it is very important to make sure always that the contribution of veterans to our community is maintained and acknowledged. In fact, we do this in a number of ways, such as the Gardens of Remembrance and the Australian War Memorial, which was allocated $4.5m in the 1988-89 Budget for the improvement of its collections, research and ceremonial functions. We have also expanded the Memorial's exhibition area. All of these things acknowledge the role played by veterans and the important contribution they have made to this great country. It is simply not true to say that we are not concerned with veterans. In fact, the changes which this Government has brought in, in a mere six years, have ensured that the veteran community acknowledges it is cared for. The Department of Veterans' Affairs, in this, its seventieth anniversary year, will continue to fulfil the Government's commitment to care for our war-injured and those who have suffered the effects of war. I am very proud to be part of a government whose commitment to the veteran community is such that it is unequivocal. We are prepared to acknowledge the very generous contribution of those veterans to our community.</PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of the radio and orchestra project, Southbank, Melbourne, for the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposed public work for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) is to be on a site at Southbank Boulevarde in South Melbourne. My colleague Senator Gareth Evans, as the then Minister for Transport and Communications, approved the purchase of this Southbank site in August 1988. Currently, the ABC operates from eight separate premises around Melbourne. Of these, only one was purpose-designed, the remainder having been adapted from commercial offices, factories and a cinema. Three of the properties, Broadcast House, Waverley Theatre, and East Burwood, are owned by the ABC. The ABC has advised that rental and operational savings likely to be achieved by this project will be approximately $2.4m per year. Funding will be achieved from the sale of the three ABC owned properties, plus borrowings of approximately $25m to be paid back with interest over 15 years. The borrowing obligations will be met by way of identified savings of $2.4m in operation of the ABC in Melbourne and of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, as well as from rental income of approximately $1m a year. Budget funding is not envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal is for the construction of approximately 16,800 square metres of accommodation over six levels plus a basement. It will comprise offices, studios, production suites and recording studios plus public and support facilities. The feature of the building will be the incorporation of studio-capable zones on two levels to accommodate current studios and provide for future needs. On-air studios will have views over the city and Southbank cultural areas. The building will include all normal engineering services. It will also incorporate features to ensure an appropriate acoustic environment in all studio production recording and rehearsal areas and to maintain essential power supplies in the event of mains failure. Because of the importance of radio services in times of emergency, special attention will be given to building security without compromising public access. ABC radio and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra will occupy three and one half levels initially, with the remaining levels generating rental income and providing for future growth. The forecast annual revenue of $1m is based on current rentals being achieved in the area. Design is being undertaken by consultants and further design documentation and construction will be undertaken on a project management basis with construction packages to be tendered publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> It is planned that demolition and site works will take place over May-June this year. The building construction is scheduled to be completed by December 1990. The estimated capital cost of this project is $39.418m at November 1988 prices. This is a significant public work and one which will materially improve the economies of operation of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. I believe it is expedient that this major work be carried out. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words on behalf of the Opposition on the proposal for the construction of a radio and orchestra project at Southbank in Melbourne. On the face of it, this project sounds very impressive: 16,800 square metres; lovely views over the city of Melbourne and the river; and some internal financing, including some borrowings which do not require any additional budgetary outlays. Prima facie, this sounds like a very sensible project as well as being very extensive and attractive. However, when one looks more deeply into the project, as I have done today, one realises that it turns out to be extraordinarily controversial. I will take a little time this afternoon to draw the attention of the House to some of the controversy and some of the problems associated with this project. First of all, it is worth remembering that between three and four years ago, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) planned to move altogether to East Burwood, which was the reason land was originally obtained by the ABC at Burwood: land which is now being sold in order to help pay for the Southbank project. The Burwood site was, by all accounts, a very good site: a site well-served by public transport so that employees of the ABC could easily get there. It was a site which could house all of the three ABC mediums; that is, television, radio and, if necessary, the orchestra and it was a site where a greater degree of rationalisation would have been possible than will be possible with this particular Southbank operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) in his statement argues that there is a degree of rationalisation because all of the radio facilities would be put together-radio studios and so on with the orchestra-and would be operating out of the one site. But the question is: Is this degree of rationalisation anything like as cost-efficient as the original proposal to move to Burwood? The answer is that it is definitely not. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me use one little example. The ABC in Melbourne has a helicopter in order that it can compete with the commercial television stations in the filming of television news from all over the city. The trouble is that the ABC helicopter is based at Port Melbourne from where it takes off and lands. It takes the ABC staff about three-quarters of an hour to get from the current television studios at Ripponlea to the helicopter. That presents substantial problems. If the Government had ensured the ABC move to the Burwood site, then there would not have been a problem with the helicopter, because the helicopter simply could have been based at Burwood, along with the rest of the ABC facilities, including television. But the fact is that apparently the ABC has decided to forgo that particular advantage and abandon the Burwood site altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth remembering that many employees of the ABC anticipated that they would be moving to the Burwood site and consequently bought or rented residences down in that area. Now they find a sudden bolt fast by the ABC, supported by the Government, to move part of project to Southbank. Therefore, those employees working particularly in radio, or who are associated with the orchestra, will have to commute to Southbank or sell their houses and move somewhere else. This decision to abandon the Burwood site and to go ahead with the Southbank project is really a very curious one. One of the concerns that we have is that no-one knows why the original decision to go to Burwood was reversed-it remains a mystery-although there are some who argue that this volte-face was prompted by middle and upper management who took the view that they would rather continue living in the area surrounding a central business district of Melbourne rather than moving themselves to Burwood or commute to Burwood on a daily basis. We do not know what that explanation is; nor does the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are a member of the Public Works Committee. I also know that-and I do not infer any criticism in saying this-you were not able to visit the site at Southbank. There were only two members of the Public Works Committee who were able to do that. </PARA>

The interesting point is that they come from both sides of this House and they both oppose the Southbank project and the abandonment of the Burwood site. I agree with many of the concerns that they have expressed to me during the course of this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is also worth reflecting on one point that we often make on this side of the House: with public projects, including statutory authority projects, of this kind, organisations such as the ABC should not target central business district sites because of the much greater expense involved. The Opposition expresses great concern about the way this project has evolved; about the additional costs which will ultimately be involved with this project than would have resulted from the concentration of ABC resources at Burwood; and about the fact that no explanation has ever been given to the satisfaction of most honourable member on this side of the House for the abandonment of the Burwood site and the partial relocation at Southbank in Melbourne. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill 1989 will give effect to my announcement of 12 March this year that the Government would repeal the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act 1978. It will also make a number of consequential amendments to the income tax law to dismantle the mechanisms that authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to administer State income tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation we are acting to repeal today constitutes the last relic of the Fraser Government's ill-fated `New Federalism'. This legislation enabled each State, if it so chose, to legislate to increase personal income taxes or to give-at a cost to that State-a rebate on personal income tax to its own residents. No one would be surprised to learn that no State has taken up the option of imposing its own separate income tax. The reality has been that none has been prepared to risk the political odium of doing so. To all intents and purposes `New Federalism' was dead long ago. However, recently the Federal Opposition took steps to revive it. Two months ago, the then shadow Finance minister, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson)-in remarks consistent with the policy outlined in the Opposition's Future Directions manifesto-foreshadowed his intention of encouraging the States to impose their own income taxes. In the event, he was overruled by the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). However, given recent changes in the Opposition's leadership, the Government's determination to repeal this law has re-doubled. Already the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has appointed the former finance spokesman as acting shadow Treasurer. From such a position it is reasonable to conclude he will return to his agenda of double income taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern has also been heightened by the Opposition Leader's unambiguous endorsement of the Future Directions document at his Tuesday press conference following his election. That endorsement leaves up in the air the former Opposition Leader's repudiation of the double taxing proposal incorporated in that document. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is determined to remove this legislation from the statute books to ensure that no backdoor method be left which would enable a future administration to impose a second layer of personal income tax upon the people of Australia. If any future Government wishes to pursue this course it will now have to do it out in the open-not by reactivating a relic of the Fraser years. We are strongly of the view that, far from being a step toward more responsible Government, States' income tax powers would instead threaten the entire thrust of macroeconomic reform in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has already made enormous progress in cutting back government spending and reducing the size of the public sector. Commonwealth outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product have been reduced from more than 30 per cent of GDP in 1984-85 to about 25 per cent this financial year. Further reductions in the outlays ratio are already cemented into place for future years. The forward estimates show that by 1991-92 Commonwealth outlays will have fallen to 23 1/2 per cent of GDP-or in terms comparable with the period before the basic health cover was switched from the private to the public sectors; a ratio of 22 1/2 per cent. This represents a significant turnaround from the trend of the 1970s and early 1980s when the government sector claimed an ever-increasing share of national income. What is more, this declining share of Government outlays has paved the way for the real tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that this is the first Australian Government ever to have paid tax cuts from a Budget surplus. All our predecessors have paid tax cuts by borrowing more money. We have paid for them by cutting outlays in real terms. Compare that to the coalition Government which in 1982 ran up a $9.6 billion Budget deficit after paying irresponsible, unfunded tax cuts in that year. In contrast, this Government in 1989 has found room for responsible tax cuts of $4.9 billion while retaining a Budget surplus of at least $5.5 billion. We have paid for tax cuts by cutting and better targeting Government spending and delivering the proceeds back to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In the years ahead-as the ratio of Commonwealth spending to the size of the economy continues to fall-likewise the amount of revenue needed to finance that spending will also fall. In other words, as economic conditions allow, there will be continued scope for further affordable personal income tax cuts. It is a simple equation, never understood by the Liberals. Lower government spending equals lower government taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from being a step towards smaller government, the Opposition's proposal to give the States greater taxing powers would put all that achievement at risk. Handing the States taxing powers would merely provide them with the wherewithal to fund increased expenditures, claiming back to the public sector the area vacated by the Commonwealth. Australia just cannot risk leaving this act on the books. </PARA>
<PARA> The double taxing legislation we are repealing was in fact the second part of the Fraser Government's `new federalism' policy. The first part was equally misconceived. Introduced in 1976, it provided for the States to receive as general revenue assistance a designated proportion of Commonwealth tax revenue, initially a certain share of income tax revenue, initially a certain share of income tax revenue, but from 1982-83 to 1984-85, a smaller share of total Commonwealth tax revenue. In fact, these tax sharing arrangements were topped up by various funding `guarantees', such that in every year but 1982-83 the States received more than their fixed share of taxation revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> From an economic policy-making perspective, the main fault in these arrangements was that, as grants were linked to revenue collections in the previous year, no account was taken of the emerging budget and economic position in the current year. In other words, flexibility to adjust fiscal policy settings in the national interest was severely constrained. For a relatively small country such as Australia-heavily dependent on often rapidly changing international circumstances for our economic well being-this was a risky situation in which to place ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth must be in a position to act decisively and with substantial influence if it is to fulfil its macro-economic responsibilities. The so-called new federalism denied the Commonwealth that ability. The Hawke Government acted to remove the shackles of new federalism by replacing the tax sharing grants with financial assistance grants in 1985-86. Our aim has been to bring the growth in assistance to the States back under control and to help reduce the growth in public spending. The States, of course, have resisted the large and sustained reductions in general purpose payments that the Commonwealth has imposed. Similarly, I expect they will complain when, as I foreshadowed in the April statement, we maintain that restraint at the 1989 Premiers Conference next week. But the ritual complaints of State Premiers have worn thin. They too must play their part in economic adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no debate about the crucial need for continued public sector spending restraint. Reduced public sector spending makes an important contribution to providing scope for the increased private sector investment in new export and import replacing industries that is now taking place. Of course, the need for all levels of Government in Australia to play their role in this has been made all the more urgent by the recent deterioration in Australia's external accounts. It needs to be clearly understood by everyone in our community that each month's balance of payments figure is not a statistic in isolation. To the contrary, each month's figure amounts to a further loss on our external accounts which must be covered by borrowing. In other words, each month's figures adds more to our external debt and to our national interest bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, Australia just cannot afford to go on accumulating debt at the rate it is at present. We simply cannot afford the luxury of different levels of Government squabbling about how to divide up a pool of revenue when the overwhelming economic requirement is that all governments recognise the need to keep their financial demands in check. Australia's future economic security demands that we have the full support of the States in this endeavour. This year, more than in any other recent period, strong economic growth has ensured that the States have the financial capacity to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have had a revenue bonanza in recent years because very strong growth in stamp duty revenue generated by the share market and property market booms has added enormously to their revenues. State stamp duty revenue alone last year rose by over 50 per cent. In recent years State finances have also benefited considerably from the Commonwealth's accord with the trade union movement. Since wage costs represent a major proportion of the States' costs in providing services such as education, health and police, wage restraint flowing from the accord has helped increase the effective level of resources at the disposal of the States. In view of these trends in the States' finances, it has been essential for the Commonwealth to significantly cut payments to the States to encourage them to restrain their spending. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, the States have simply spent all the revenue that has come their way. Not to have cut back on Commonwealth payments to the States in current circumstances would have been economically irresponsible. The alternative would have been to allow the States to increase their own outlays, offsetting the work the Commonwealth has undertaken in reducing Commonwealth spending. </PARA>
<PARA> Some States seek to confuse this issue by producing a plethora of statistics comparing growth rates in outlays and revenue. Their favourite is to complain that the cuts in Commonwealth payments have exceeded the cuts in the Commonwealth's own outlays and that they are therefore bearing an unfair share of the burden of fiscal restraint. Such comparisons are simply irrelevant. The fact is that if the Commonwealth had not cut grants by the degree it has it is likely the States would have shown no spending restraint at all. The most appropriate measure of the relative fiscal restraint of the Commonwealth and the States is growth in each sector's own purpose outlays-in other words, comparing apples with apples. </PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, since 1986-87 the Commonwealth's own general purpose government outlays-that is, excluding public trading enterprises such as Telecom Australia and Qantas Airways Ltd-have fallen by 5 per cent in real terms. On the other hand, and despite the cuts in Commonwealth payments to the States, comparable State outlays have increased by around 2 per cent in real terms. This growth reflects, in part, the continued strong growth in the States' current expenditures on goods and services. These grew by nearly 4 1/2 per cent in real terms in 1987-88, and looks set to grow at about the same rate this year. </PARA>
<PARA> None of this is to suggest that the Commonwealth is seeking to impose draconian spending cuts on the States. We fully recognise that public services must be adequately funded. But by the same token, by cutting out waste and inefficiency and better targeting assistance, there is further scope for the States to curtail spending. They must continue to make a contribution to national economic adjustment in proportion to their importance in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now from expenditure and taxation to policies towards Government borrowing, where it has also been necessary for the Government to diverge sharply from the policies of the previous Government so as to restore order in national public finances. When the Fraser Government came to office, borrowings by State authorities were effectively controlled by the Loan Council, under what was known as the gentlemen's agreement dating from 1936. These arrangements were allowed to fall into severe disrepair by the Fraser Government. Indeed, at times State authorities were encouraged to increase their borrowings, including from overseas. These increased borrowings were purportedly to be used to fund infrastructure for the much touted resources boom of the early 1980s. However, they also enabled some States to squirrel away substantial cash balances which they could later spend, thwarting national fiscal policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Proper oversight of public sector borrowing under the Liberals was weakened in three ways: Loan Council failed to extend its oversight under the gentlemen's agreement to new non-conventional forms of borrowing such as financial leases and deferred payment schemes; from 1977-78, Loan Council agreed to a wave of special additions to State authority borrowing programs for major infrastructure projects; and from 1982-83, all domestic borrowings by State electricity authorities were excluded from control altogether. By 1983-84, when this Government came to office, over 75 per cent of State authority borrowings were outside Loan Council control, and the net public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) had grown from 1.7 per cent of GDP at the end of the 1970s, to 2.9 per cent of GDP in 1982-83, the highest level since the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> While there was much worthwhile public sector capital investment in the early 1980s, there was a significant component that could not be properly justified on any reasonable basis. Further, the concentration of infrastructure spending in that period added enormously to our foreign debt burden and contributed to the wages blow-out and high inflation that marked the period. The present Government, when it came to office, was faced with the task of re-establishing national control over the net PSBR through Loan Council. Accordingly, Loan Council's acceptance from 1984-85 of the global approach to authority borrowings was secured. This approach reasserted Loan Council's responsibility for control over all forms of financing by Governments at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early period the global limits did not bite as much as they should have because of the cushion left from the Fraser mismanagement of borrowings. Increasingly, however, the global limits have become a useful tool of fiscal responsibility. Even so, the States' net borrowing requirement has declined from only 2.3 per cent of GDP in 1983-84, to an estimated 1.2 per cent in 1988-89. In the same period, by contrast, the Commonwealth Government's net borrowing requirement has been cut from a 4.5 per cent deficit to a surplus of 0.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The stabilisation policy issues I have raised serve to highlight the role the States have to play in improving Australia's economic performance. But just as the States can impact-for better or worse-on broader fiscal policy settings, so they can have an important part in either promoting or frustrating necessary structural reforms. Regrettably, the States are frequently to be found dragging their feet when it comes to structural reform. Each State's financial position is affected by the expenditure consequences of its infrastructure and industry policies. It is of no use the States crying poor while, at the same time, their profligacy is revealed in continuing explicit or implicit industry subsidies and by subeconomic pricing of key resources, such as for outmoded rail services. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part the Commonwealth has matched its success in fiscal management with a broad ranging program of micro-economic reform. We demonstrated our determination to progress in this area by overriding restrictive State provisions in order to accelerate the essential deregulation of wheat transport and marketing. Earlier this week, further reforms in the area of science and technology were announced, while later this month a major statement will be made on coastal shipping and the waterfront. But we have to recognise that many of the structural rigidities and impediments to growth are rooted in State practices-particularly in the important area of transport. It is crucial to the objective of improving waterfront efficiency that State port authorities reduce their costs, charge economically sensible prices for their services and become more active in encouraging competition within ports. Where States have taken steps towards reform they need to be rigorously followed through. Most States have not even begun the reform process-they need to lift their game. The State railways are another area crying out for reform. They largely account for State enterprise subsidies of some $2.3 billion per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> In the skies Commonwealth deregulation of domestic trunk passenger aviation will begin in 1990, and the hard but correct decision was taken on the third runway at Sydney Airport. But most States seem reluctant to give up their detailed regulation of intrastate air services, even though this will frustrate the full benefits for customers of the Commonwealth's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that progress made by the Commonwealth towards a stronger industry structure is not dissipated by inappropriate state policies. There is a complex web of State incentives, taxes or charges and unnecessary and inconsistent regulation within and between States. Regrettably, one area where our Federal system has been all too productive is in the generation of unnecessary regulations; packaging and labelling regulations, occupational licensing, and the disparate regulation of companies and the securities and futures industries are cases in point. </PARA>
<PARA> We look to the States to play their part in helping to remove such impediments and structural rigidities. It is for all these reasons that we repeal the last relic of the Liberal Party's new federalism. I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains an explanation of the provisions of this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill amends a number of Acts administered within the Attorney-General's portfolio. Some parts of the Bill contain minor amendments designed to correct or update existing legislation. Other parts of the Bill contain more significant amendments designed to implement new policy and ensure that existing legislation is able to deal effectively with sophisticated crime. A detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I propose to address only the more significant aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Crimes Act 1914</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. There are significant amendments dealing with computer crime and fines under the Act are to be substantially increased. The Bill also inserts a new part into the Crimes Act that will provide for a scheme that will permit old convictions for minor offences to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA>Computer Crime</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in the Bill relating to computer offences follow, substantially, the recommendations of the committee reviewing Commonwealth criminal law, chaired by the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Harry Gibbs. The Committee was asked to report specifically on the need for new legislation in this area, and its report was presented and released last November and tabled in Parliament on 12 April 1989. The need for new legislation arises out of three main considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the possible vulnerability of information in computer systems, by comparison with paper records. Unauthorised access to paper files can be prevented by relatively simple security measures, and when such measures fail it is usually because an offence or at least a breach of duty has been committed by a person with authorised access. Not so with computer records, where access to restricted information by unauthorised persons can in many cases be obtained simply by ingenuity in overcoming technical barriers. Such access might be obtained from inside an organisation by persons prepared to exceed a limited access authority, or through the telephone communication system by external `hackers'. Vulnerability does not relate only to access. Computer information can be exposed to risk of damage, destruction or alteration from a large number of sources within or outside the computer-using organisation. Such conduct could have a variety of motives. It might be for gain, as in the case of traditional embezzlement; it might be a malicious desire to cause damage or create confusion or disruption in an organisation; or it might be simple unauthorised experimentation. All such conduct is socially undesirable and its consequences can be disastrous, as reports of damage from so-called computer viruses have shown. </PARA>
<PARA> The second consideration is the widespread and growing reliance of modern society on computer systems and communications systems that depend on computers. We need to foster confidence in the security and reliability of such systems not only from the point of view of governments and businesses that use them but from the point of view of individuals whose private information might be contained in them. </PARA>
<PARA> The third consideration is the need for the law to be relevant to modern technology. Our criminal law relating to forgery, uttering, fraud and false pretences was framed with people, pens and paper in mind. Now we have machines, magnetic memories and electronic impulses. How traditional offences can be applied in the setting of new technology can be very uncertain. We should not leave this situation to be tested in the trial courts and the appeal process when it is possible to create new offences directed at unauthorised and deliberate acts of misconduct done with, or aimed at, computers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill creates a series of offences involving either deliberate unauthorised access to data, or more serious offences where such access is gained and the offender either, gained that access with intent to defraud or, knew or ought reasonably to have known that the data was of a specified type which is considered particularly sensitive. It is not intended that the question whether the person ought reasonably to have known involve an objective test but rather that the court be able to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence including the characteristics, knowledge, skills and attributes of the particular offender when determining this question. The amendments do not seek to cover computer crime generally. There is no need for such an approach as many situations can be more appropriately dealt with by State laws and law enforcement authorities. Instead, the provisions in this Bill are directed at two classes of situation where Commonwealth provisions are either necessary or useful. </PARA>
<PARA> The first relates to the protection of Commonwealth computers and data in them. This is clearly a proper function of Commonwealth criminal law. The second kind of situation is where the misconduct-that is, the unauthorised access, interference or damage-takes place by means of a Commonwealth facility, whether or not the victimised computer system is a Commonwealth one. We have here in mind particularly the Telecom Australia communication system through which all major computer networks, and many smaller systems, will be linked. One of the advantages of covering such situations by Commonwealth legislation is that a common offence will apply across all Australian jurisdictions-thus enabling a prosecution to be brought in the most convenient venue when the elements occur in two or more States or Territories. It is not intended that this offence of computer misconduct through use of Telecom and such facilities will displace any State or Territory offences that may also have been committed. One or other offence or both could be charged, subject to the usual rules against double jeopardy. It will, of course, be a matter for each jurisdiction to decide whether to enact specific computer legislation, and two have already done so. </PARA>
<PARA> In accepting the Gibbs Committee's recommendation for new offences involving use of Commonwealth communications facilities the Government is taking account of not only possible frauds and other offences that might be committed across boundaries but also the potential use of such facilities for hacking and for the deliberate causing of computer malfunctions through viruses or other means. I wish to make it clear that these new offence provisions are intended to protect information while it is in a computer system. They are not intended to give that information a special character so that after it has been obtained from a computer special penalties attach to its unauthorised use. Thus the ordinary law about unauthorised disclosure would apply in relation to a third party receiving the information. No new offence is brought into existence in relation to a third party except where that party is an accessory to the computer-related misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA>Penalty Provisions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes two general changes to the penalty provisions of the Crimes Act. First, it will increase the maximum fine that may be imposed for certain Commonwealth offences-that is, for most offences in the Crimes Act and those other offences for which no fine is expressly specified. The relativities between imprisonment and maximum fines were last adjusted in 1982. When I speak of relativities, I should stress that specified maximum fines are not to be regarded in any sense as substituteable for, or to be served instead of, the corresponding period of imprisonment. As the review committee points out, maximum fines should have regard to the worst kind of breach that is appropriate for a fine rather than imprisonment. Therefore it is not possible to equate a fine with a particular period of imprisonment, for example by having regard to weekly earnings. Also, periods of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine are a quite separate matter. The new scale will be given effect by a simplified formula in place of a table. Some examples of the effect of the increased maximum penalties are:</PARA>
<PARA>6 months</PARA>
<PARA>imprisonment</PARA>
<PARA>$3,000 fine instead of $1,000</PARA>
<PARA>3 years</PARA>
<PARA>imprisonment</PARA>
<PARA>$18,000 fine instead of $10,000</PARA>
<PARA>20 years</PARA>
<PARA>imprisonment</PARA>
<PARA>$120,000 fine instead of $20,000</PARA>
<PARA>An offence punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment would become punishable by a fine of up to $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> While the new relativities now provided for will be made generally applicable, through this Bill and future legislation directed to other offence provisions, the relativities will not be followed universally. Where a different relativity is justified as a matter of policy, special provision will be made for this. In cases where a fine would be imposed on a corporation a multiplier of five will continue to be used. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is intended to follow the practice for new offences in recent years by providing in relation to the Crimes Act, and elsewhere where not otherwise specified, that a fine may be imposed additionally as well as alternatively to imprisonment. The aim of this approach is to make available to the court the greatest possible range of sentencing within the limits of the maximum prison term and the maximum fine. For example, it would be possible to impose a short or suspended prison term together with a fine. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the changes I have described are intended to be steps towards adoption of a more uniform and rational scheme of penalties for all Commonwealth offences. Further steps in that process will be taken in the light of recommendations to be made by the committee reviewing Commonwealth criminal law. </PARA>
<PARA>Spent Convictions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The question of spent convictions has been the subject of a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and extensive discussions in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG). Queensland has had legislation dealing with the rehabilitation of offenders since 1986 which is more limited in scope than the ALRC proposals. As an exercise in uniformity agreement was reached in SCAG that all jurisdictions would enact legislation dealing with spent convictions broadly along the lines of the Queensland model. The spent convictions scheme is designed to give people a chance to live down a minor criminal conviction. Clearly it is in the best interests of society, and the person involved, that where the person has been convicted of a minor offence, has paid the penalty and subsequently been of good behaviour for an extended period then he should be protected from those who might discriminate against him. The scheme is rehabilitative and will contribute to the Government's efforts to reduce crime. The Government's perspective of the benefits of the scheme is supported by experience with similar schemes in operation in the United States, most European countries and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now briefly outline the details of the scheme. The legislation will prohibit disclosure of, or discrimination against a person on the basis of, a conviction for a minor offence where the person has been of good behaviour for 10 years after conviction. A minor offence is one where an actual sentence of 30 months' imprisonment or less was imposed. The prohibitions on disclosure and discrimination will apply generally to Commonwealth employment and in the non-self governing territories in respect of all convictions, Commonwealth, State and foreign. The prohibitions are a consequence of conviction of a Commonwealth offence and therefore will apply throughout Australia in respect of convictions for Commonwealth offences. </PARA>
<PARA> Having established a general rule, there will inevitably be circumstances to which that general rule should not apply. To this end the legislation provides a scheme of exemptions. Some of these are spelt out specifically in the legislation. Clearly a court or a prosecuting body should be able to take spent convictions into account when sentencing or deciding whether to prosecute. Certain types of employment require, for public policy reasons, full disclosure of any convictions. Persons employed in law enforcement and national security will therefore be exempt from the scheme and have to disclose spent convictions. In other types of employment certain convictions will always be relevant. An example of this is where a person has been convicted of a sexual offence involving children and seeks employment caring for children or as a teacher. In addition to these statutory exemptions it will be open to government to make regulations exempting persons, or classes of persons, from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism contained in the legislation is that an application may be made to the Privacy Commissioner for exemption. The Privacy Commissioner will then make a recommendation to government on whether regulations should be made to exempt the applicant, or the class of which the applicant is a member. Rather than create a range of offences to enforce the scheme the Privacy Commissioner will be given conciliation and civil remedies powers, similar to those conferred by the Privacy Act, to resolve breaches of the legislation. The amendments will change the common law which provides that a pardon only relieves a person from the consequences of a conviction. If it is subsequently found that a person was wrongly convicted and a pardon is granted on that basis, justice requires that the person should be put in the same position as if he or she had never been convicted at all. </PARA>
<PARA>Customs Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 the Parliament passed legislation designed to strike at the heart of major organised crime by depriving persons involved of the proceeds of their criminal endeavours. That legislation, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, was a major advance on existing legislation which dealt with the forfeiture of property and the imposition and recovery of pecuniary penalties such as Part XIII, Division 3, of the Customs Act 1901. Part XIII, Division 3, of the Customs Act was inserted in 1979. It was stated during the second reading debate at the time that the objective of the legislation was to facilitate the imposition of `a pecuniary penalty equivalent to the benefit derived from dealing in illicit drugs'. Section 243b therefore provided for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty, to be assessed in accordance with section 243c. Quite properly, section 243c provided that the court, when assessing the value of the benefit derived by a person from dealing with illicit drugs, could have regard to property acquired by reason of dealing in narcotics, that had been diverted by the dealer into the possession of a person other than the drug dealer. Most commonly, this might be property which is disguised as the property of a company controlled by the drug dealer. </PARA>
<PARA> However it is a striking flaw in the legislative scheme of Part XIII, Division 3, that, when it comes to satisfying the pecuniary penalty, no provision was made for applying that other property in satisfaction of the penalty. That defect was cured in the Proceeds of Crime Act by the `effective control' provision-section 9-and the power to lift the corporate veil, section 28. Part 5 of the Bill now before the House will remove this defect from the Customs Act by inserting new provisions modelled upon the provisions of the Proceeds Act. Part 5 of the Bill makes a number of other amendments to Part XIII, Division 3, of the Customs Act with a view to harmonising its provisions with those of the Proceeds Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part 6 of the Bill proposes two amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Act. The first, confers a general power on the Director to file an ex officio indictment. This general power will not be delegable and a related amendment ensures that the general ex officio power must be exercised personally by the Director. This will put the Commonwealth DPP in the same position as his counterparts in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The second enlarges the power of the Director to give an indemnity. At present the Director may give a use indemnity which is an undertaking that evidence given by a person in specified Commonwealth proceedings will not be used in evidence against the person in any civil or criminal proceedings, other than proceedings for perjury. The Act is to be amended to provide for full use derivative use indemnity. That is, the undertaking will extend to the use of evidence which is obtained as a direct or indirect result of the primary evidence given by the witness. This adopts a recommendation made by the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on the National Crime Authority Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A new power to give an indemnity against prosecution, to be known as a transactional indemnity, is also to be conferred upon the Director. Again, it is proposed that this power be exercised personally by the Director. </PARA>
<PARA>National Crime Authority Act</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for some fine tuning of the National Crime Authority (NCA) Act. The inter-governmental committee on the National Crime Authority has recently concluded that there is a need to clearly establish the management responsibility of the Chairman, while preserving the inquiry powers of other members. The Act is to be amended to make the Chairman responsible for the day-to-day management of the Authority with the power to make or delegate decisions in appropriate circumstances, give directions and undertake activities that are required to perform the functions of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain Commonwealth agencies which are currently subject to section 19a of the National Crime Authority Act, which provides certain bodies with a discretion to provide information to the Authority upon request, will be made subject to sections 28 and 29 which enable the Authority to require the furnishing of information or production of documents at hearings. These agencies are operating as financial or quasi-commercial enterprises in the private sector and will be accorded similar status under the Act to private organisations in those fields. This is consistent with the Government's policy with regard to Government business enterprises. It is also proposed to amend section 19a to ensure that it provides sufficient protection for the requested agency from liability for breach of confidentiality. It is intended to insert a clause providing the requested agency with the appropriate protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a number of minor changes to the Act to streamline the Authority's day to day operations by reducing the need for meetings of the Authority wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The measures outlined above have minimal financial impact. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission will require one extra person to handle workload generated for the Privacy Commissioner under the spent convictions scheme. While the amendments to the Customs Act will not require additional resources, there is an expectation that the revision of part XIII division 3 will result in extra revenue to the Commonwealth. The other amendments have no financial impact. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to remove section 41 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which exempts from the operation of the Act discrimination in superannuation on the ground of sex or marital status and to insert a number of more limited exemptions dealing with superannuation practices. As section 41 also provides an exemption in regard to the terms on which insurance may be offered, the amendments have necessitated that the insurance exemption be rewritten and reinserted. </PARA>
<PARA> The process which has led to the Bill dates back to the preparation of a report by the Human Rights Commission titled Superannuation and Insurance and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 Part 1-Superannuation. That report was prepared in response to a request by the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, and was tabled in Parliament on 25 November 1986. The report was considered by the Government and the Government decided to remove the exemption and to insert into the Act certain more limited exemptions for particular practices in superannuation. Following the Government's decision, consultations on the proposed exemptions were held with the superannuation industry, employer groups, State and Territory governments and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, as indicated in its National Agenda for Women, is committed to the objective of removing discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy. The major effect of the Bill is to remove most forms of direct discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status in superannuation practices for new schemes. Where funds are unable to comply with the new obligations under the legislation, the reasonable expectations of the members will be maintained and the discriminatory fund will be allowed to continue. However, such funds will not be entitled to admit new members. Further, members of such discriminatory schemes will generally have to be given an option to obtain `non-discriminatory superannuation benefits'. The proposed continuing exemptions, shortly stated, deal with the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA>the inclusion in fund conditions of a provision which is based upon reasonable actuarial data upon which it is reasonable to reply;</PARA>
<PARA>the current practices whereby lesser death and disability benefits are provided to members who are single, that is members who do not have a spouse or a de facto spouse or to members who do not have a child; and</PARA>
<PARA>the possibly discriminatory effect of current vesting, preservation and portability arrangements in funds' conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of the Bill has been delayed to date pending the reappraisal by the Government of a proposed exemption which would have allowed funds to confine the provision of superannuation benefits to permanent and full time employees. In January 1989 the Government decided not to proceed with this exemption. Following that decision a further round of consultations on the issue was held with the superannuation industry, peak employer bodies, State Governments and the National Women's Consultative Council. Those consultations have only recently been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a brief description of the proposed limited exemptions to be inserted in the Act. Because, statistically, women live longer than men, the actuarial exemption covers the resulting difference in costs of providing a pension for women. Schemes will be able to continue to offer optional conversions between lump sums and pensions which differ by sex, so long as the difference is based on reliable actuarial data. As many superannuation benefits are provided via insurance this exemption is interlinked with the insurance exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is currently preparing a report on the exemption of insurance from the Sex Discrimination Act. The need for the actuarial exemption for superannuation will be reviewed in light of the Commission's recommendations concerning the insurance exemption.</PARA>
<PARA> The exemption for dependant superannuation benefits is designed to allow schemes to continue current practices, whereby upon a member's death or disability no benefits are payable to a member who does not have a spouse or children. In the absence of this kind of exemption it may have been possible for a member who was single to succeed in a complaint of marital status discrimination. There are a number of reasons for maintaining this exemption. As the former Human Rights Commission noted in its report, the exemption reflects the community's attitude that it is appropriate to make special provision for persons who have a spouse or who have children in the event of the death, or physical or mental incapacity, of members of superannuation funds. As was noted by the Commission, to provide benefits to all dependants of members on proof of financial dependency, would create difficulties both in administration and in finding a suitable objective test of dependency. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the exemptions dealing with vesting, preservation and portability, the issue of discrimination arises because there is evidence that women statistically do not remain in continuous employment for the same length of time as men. Matters such as vesting, preservation and portability fall within the area of the operating standards for superannuation funds administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Regulations made under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 impose a number of operating standards with which superannuation funds must comply in order to be eligible for taxation concessions. I am advised that current vesting standards require a superannuation fund to vest in full in a member all benefits arising from contributions made by the member and earnings thereon. The effect of this is that all member-financed benefits are fully vested. </PARA>
<PARA> The preservation standards which require benefits to be preserved generally until retirement at or after the age of 55 apply to the following benefits, except for amounts less than $500:</PARA>
<PARA>any vested employer-financed benefits arising from employer contributions made in accordance with an agreement or award certified or made by an industrial authority-that is, the 3 per cent award based superannuation; and</PARA>
<PARA>any new or improved vested employer-financed benefits arising from any arrangements entered into after 21 December 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>The preservation standards do not extend to vested employer-financed benefits flowing from ongoing superannuation arrangements which were in place prior to 22 December 1986. They also do not extend to member-financed benefits arising from member contributions which are non-tax deductable made to employer sponsored funds. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of its review of retirement income policy, the Government is looking at the question of whether improved vesting and preservation standards should be developed in respect of superannuation funds. The issues are discussed in Social Security Review Issues Paper No. 6, Towards a National Retirement Income Policy, which was released for public comment last year. Submissions and comments on the paper are currently in the process of being assessed by the Government. It is to be noted that any improvements that are introduced would have the effect of reducing any indirect discrimination in vesting and preservation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In order for funds to obtain the benefits of the proposed exemptions under section 41a, it will be necessary for the funds to amend their rules to ensure that the trustees do not exercise their discretions in a discriminatory way. Clearly, trustees are entitled to exercise their discretions as they believe appropriate. The proposed requirement in section 41a (3) only requires that a trustee, in exercising his or her discretion, not exercise it in a discriminatory manner by reason only of a person's sex or marital status. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the provisions of the Bill which are designed to protect the existing expectations of members in superannuation schemes. Proposed section 41b will enable schemes which cannot or do not wish to comply with the new requirements of section 41a to continue to provide benefits for existing members, providing that members of these funds have the option to obtain non-discriminatory superannuation benefits. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may, however, grant an exemption from this requirement pursuant to section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. This will enable trustees or employers to apply for an exemption where it is clear that it would not be beneficial for members to join a new scheme or obtain non-discriminatory benefits. It will not be necessary that members actually be offered the opportunity to join a new scheme, as it will be sufficient for the purposes of the option, that existing members be offered the option to obtain benefits which would comply with proposed section 41a. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed section 41c will enable regulations to be made to repeal section 41a or 41b. This provision reflects the Government's commitment to progressively moving to a truly non-discriminatory superannuation industry. This provision continues the status of existing subsection (1) of section 41 of the Act which could be repealed by regulation. The Government believes that this provision will encourage the superannuation industry to progressively remove discrimination in the terms upon which superannuation is offered. Regulations under section 41c will only be able to be made after consultation with industry and will not come into operation until one year after their making. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals put forward in this Bill should not impact upon Government expenditure. However, it is anticipated that Commonwealth schemes will be amended in separate legislation to comply with the Act by the time of the commencement of the amending Act. These changes may have some affect on Commonwealth expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation is a very technical area of the law and the issues of discrimination which may arise may vary from case to case and industry to industry. I have therefore written to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner requesting that guidelines be published on issues which have not been specifically addressed in these amendments. Where trustees or employers feel that they should be exempted from a particular requirements of the Act that may apply to the Commission for an administrative exemption under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. Decisions by the Commission under section 44 are reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the amendments outlined above represent a significant reform. While I am informed that most schemes will be able to comply with the new amendments, with only minor adaptations to their existing conditions, the amendments will require schemes which have not yet improved their benefits to do so over the next two years, or to close off their membership. Further, the amendments are likely to increase the opportunity for part-time employees to gain access to superannuation. This will significantly improve the opportunities for women to build up a worthwhile superannuation entitlement over their working lives. A large majority of part-time employees are women, and it is clear that women tend to return from child rearing to part-time employment. Where part-time employees are performing the same duties as their full-time counterparts and the full-time counterparts receive superannuation, it is likely that a court would find that a failure to provide access to superannuation to such part-time employees unlawfully discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments should therefore be viewed in the light of the Government's commitment to increasing superannuation coverage for the Australian work force. Arbitrated superannuation awards are providing increasing superannuation coverage. These amendments will not only encourage this development and help Australia make appropriate provisions for its ageing population, but the benefits which will be offered will be fairer and more equitable, and in line with the Government's commitments under the National Agenda for Women. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this portfolio Bill is to amend the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) Act 1970. The amendments to the AIDC Act represent another step in the Government's ongoing reform of the AIDC by further freeing the Corporation from the burden of unnecessary bureaucratic procedures while maintaining appropriate strategic controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government the AIDC has already been the subject of a number of reform measures which have allowed the Corporation to expand its role. These reforms have let AIDC provide finance for the restructuring of Australian industry and included relieving the restrictions on the use of its capital and removing Loan Council's controls on its borrowings. The AIDC responded well to these initiatives: the focus of its investment activities altered dramatically and the AIDC has made a significant contribution towards the Government's industry policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983, the AIDC has experienced very strong growth. As at 30 June 1988, AIDC total assets stood at $2,488m compared with $963m at 30 June 1983, an increase of over 250 per cent. However, during 1987 a restricted capital base emerged as a factor that could have jeopardised the AIDC's future contribution to industry development especially in regard to its equity investment program.</PARA>
<PARA> Confronted with the capital problem, the Government examined a number of options before deciding to allow the AIDC to raise equity capital from the private sector. The AIDC is now in the process of establishing a listed subsidiary company that will conduct most of the loan and investment business of the AIDC, with up to 30 per cent of the equity being offered to the public. The necessary amendments to the AIDC Act clear the way for the establishment of the listed subsidiary, which measure passed through Parliament in the Budget sittings last year. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the changes implemented since 1983, the AIDC already conforms to a significant degree with the Policy Guidelines for Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises. However, many of the reforms were introduced prior to the issuing of the guidelines. Consequently, some modifications are required and in some cases the guidelines are inappropriate given the AIDC's unique role. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government has taken the view that AIDC should, to the maximum extent possible, comply with the government business enterprise (GBE) guidelines. To this end a number of reforms, such as the remuneration of the Chief Executive and dividend payments which bring AIDC in line with other GBEs, were contained in the legislation establishing the subsidiary. In regard to the listed subsidiary company, a balance has to be struck between allowing the subsidiary to operate as a commercial entity in the same environment as any other publicly listed company while having sufficient accountability befitting the Government's majority shareholding. The intention of the GBE reforms is to improve the efficiency of GBEs by placing them on, or at least approximating, a commercial footing. The listed subsidiary will be a fully commercial operation directed towards AIDC's statutory charter, especially AIDC's important role in developing a more internationally competitive industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be totally inappropriate for the Government unilaterally to impose, as part of a reform package, financial or strategic controls on the subsidiary. This would undermine the commercial nature of the company, jeopardise success of the company's public flotation, lower the price of the company's shares and run the real risk of negating the purpose of allowing AIDC to establish a listed subsidiary company. The Government believes the board of the subsidiary is the appropriate body to determine the company's corporate plan, set financial targets and declare any dividends after paying due regard to market conditions and the wishes of shareholders, of which the government is the largest. Part 2 of the Bill therefore concentrates on the reform measures for AIDC itself and not on the soon to be established subsidiary. To remove an unnecessary administrative burden and promote efficiency, board members of AIDC are now to be appointed and subject to dismissal by the portfolio Minister. The grounds for dismissal have been expanded to include ongoing under-performance. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the GBE policy guidelines, AIDC must now provide the portfolio Minister with a three-yearly corporate plan commencing on 1 July 1989. Each plan will set out the objectives of the corporation and address the overall strategies and policies that are to be followed in order to achieve the objectives. Each corporate plan is to contain a financial target which will outline overall financial strategies and include a forecast of revenue and expenditure. The target is to be agreed to in advance by the portfolio Minister. The Bill contains the scope for variations to both the overall corporate plan and the financial target should circumstances warrant any changes. The provision of a corporate plan and financial target replaces the annual general policy statement the corporation currently supplies to the portfolio Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the Government's May 1988 economic statement on reform of taxation of GBE's, this Bill removes AIDC's exemption from State and territory stamp duty effective from 1 July 1989. However, this applies only to a transaction entered into, or a document executed, on or after 1 July 1989. An advance made on or after 1 July 1989 under a document executed before that date will continue to be exempt from stamp duty. AIDC operates on commercial principles. To put AIDC on the same footing as its competitors, the Bill will allow the board to recommend to the portfolio Minister an auditor of its own choice. This will have effect from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> With AIDC having to work to a corporate plan and a financial target, this Bill formalises AIDC's annual reporting requirements, which will now include performance indicators against established targets. The Bill also corrects a definitional problem that occurred in last year's amendments to the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970 which cleared the way for establishment of the subsidiary company. The problem involved defining the value of assets being transferred to the subsidiary for the purpose of calculating any capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of this Bill amends the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985. The proposed amendment to increase the number of government members from one to two on the board of the Australian Trade Commission recognises that a single government member cannot adequately represent cross-portfolio interests and concerns impacting on the Commission. In particular, the amendment will provide the opportunity to balance government representation between domestic industry and foreign policy and trade orientations. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 of the Bill involves a minor amendment to the National Measurement Act 1960 which is being made to include a definition of `measuring instrument'. This is necessary because the uniform trade measurement legislation is to be enacted in the States and Territories and it refers to this definition. The present definition of `instrument' is inadequate. It has been redefined to cover all measuring instruments. Consequent to this, it has been necessary to define the word `component' wider than its natural meaning. So that there is consistency between the National Measurement Act and the uniform trade measurement, the definition of `use for trade' had to be amended in the former. The opportunity has also been taken to insert the definition for a `standard of measurement' which in turn requires the definition of `material measure'. This is needed to remove the possible confusion between written standards and standards of measurement. The penalties imposed under the National Measurement Act are being increased to keep pace with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the amendments of the patents, trade marks and designs Acts made by Part 5 of the Bill is to enable the Commissioner of Patents and registrars of trade marks and designs to delegate statutory powers and functions to the appropriate levels of responsibility within the patent, trade marks and designs offices. The amendments will also bring the three Acts into conformity in this regard and provide simpler and more flexible administration of various statutory functions of the offices. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 6 of the Bill will repeal a number of unproclaimed amendments of the Patents Act which provide for the lodgment and preparation of abstracts of patent specifications. While there is merit in applicants for patents being required to provide abstracts in plain English of their patent specifications, the Government's main priority for use of Patent Office resources has been focused, since 1986, on reducing the Office's backlog of unexamined patent applications. New provisions will be introduced when appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The primary purpose of the Higher Education Funding Amendments Bill 1989 is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to provide increased funding to higher education institutions over the 1989-91 triennium. The additional funding will total some $24m in 1989. The increased funding is being provided in accordance with well established government procedures for the cost supplementation of higher education grants. Under these arrangements provision is made for the additional costs of increased salaries of higher education staff and for increases in other costs such as equipment and building costs that are incurred up to the start of the program year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a reduction in operating grants for 1990-1991 to take into account the Government's decision to phase out the subsidised overseas student program. The amounts involved are $23m in 1990 and $43m in 1991. These funds will be used instead to finance scholarships to enable overseas students to obtain full fee places in Australian higher education institutions. The new arrangements therefore will not reduce the total level of funding available for institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision for self-government in the Australian Capital Territory. Under the amended Act the Signadou College of Education will receive its grant payments through the ACT Treasury on the same basis as payments are made to institutions in the States and the Northern Territory. The Australian National University, the Canberra College of Advanced Education and the Canberra Institute of the Arts remain as Commonwealth institutions and accordingly will be funded through appropriations as at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). In his contribution last evening, the right honourable member pointed out that the Resource Assessment Commission Bill 1989 seeks to set up a new body which will be called the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC). However, this body would be a totally inappropriate and unnecessary addition to the bureaucracy in Australia. We simply do not need such a body in order to be able to make proper assessments of the way in which Australia's resources should be developed. This legislation is an indication of the fact that this Government is effectively devoid of any new initiatives. It is devoid of ideas as to how Australia's resources should be developed properly. By introducing this Bill the Government is clutching at straws in an attempt to get itself off the political hook because it has run out of ideas. It has been caught effectively with its pants down with new resource developments coming forward such as the Wesley Vale proposal. The Government is caught in a political bind by lobby groups such as the conservation movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is being brought forward as a so-called initiative because, in political terms, the Government simply does not know where to move. It is buying time and in the process it is setting up a totally new and unnecessary addition to the bureaucracy that will do no more than retard any new additions to our resource development. I hope that, when the Liberal-National party government comes into office after the next election, this will be one of the first bodies to be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> In reading through the Bill and the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), it is quite clear that this legislation attempts to take over from the State governments significant powers that traditionally have been exercised by the States. Since the inception of Federation, it has always been assumed that issues such as land management will be exercised by the States. But this Bill entrenches in Commonwealth legislation the right of the Commonwealth to be able to usurp those powers from the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Any person in this country who believes in the rights of the States and the Federation of Australia could not possibly support this measure because, to a large degree, it makes redundant the powers that have traditionally been exercised by the States. It is clear that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wants to establish this new Commission, which he will control, so that he can have a mechanism to control his Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson). It is clear that in some of the debates that have ensued in recent times, such as the debates on Wesley Vale and the management of forest areas and other national park areas, it is Senator Richardson who is running the Government, and that the Prime Minister does not have a mechanism to be able to control him. The Prime Minister is seeking to establish this Commission as a means of controlling his environment Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will be very detrimental to the development of Australia because it seeks to establish another bureaucratic body to which any proposer of a new industry or a new resource development must justify any proposal. Already we have in place the requirement for any proposer to prepare an environmental impact statement which points out the impact on the environment or on the local community. That will still be required. But this proposal means that in addition to all of the other requirements, a proposer must also go through Resource Assessment Commission which is just another bureaucratic body that will be put in the way of proper and sensible resource development in Australia. The sooner this body can be abolished, the better it will be for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is genuinely seeking to have a proper assessment made of Australia's resources and how those resources should be managed and developed, it already has at its disposal quite adequate resource facilities. Already we have the Industries Assistance Commission, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. We also have the massive resources of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Those bodies are available to make technical assessments of how our resources should be developed. If that is not adequate for the Government and it needs more research facilities, I remind the House that we have available the very adequate research facilities of universities. There is no need to have a new body called the Resource Assessment Commission. It is not necessary. The establishment of this Commission is a political gimmick which the Government is using because it is in political trouble with the environmental movement and because the Prime Minister is in political trouble as a result of the actions of his Minister for environment. I cannot see any justification for establishing this body. As I said earlier, I hope it will be abolished at a very early stage by an incoming conservative government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister made the point in his second reading speech that the first matter to be referred to this new Commission would be an extensive inquiry into the forest industries in Australia. I question the legitimacy of putting such a reference to this new Commission because already the Government has made decisions which have a long term impact and involvement with the forest industries in Australia. My colleague from Bass would be well aware that not so long ago the Federal Government established the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests to inquire into the forest industries in Tasmania, which it did. It reported extensively on its views of the forest industries in Tasmania. But, when the Helsham Commission presented its report, the Federal Government would not accept its recommendations. It overrode them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it cost $3m to conduct that inquiry and when the recommendations were presented the Federal Government simply would not accept them and it overruled the Commission. So, if that is the track record of the Federal Government, I question what might happen to the recommendations made by this Resource Assessment Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the House that, in addition to the Helsham inquiry into the forest industries in Tasmania, over the past 25 years there have been about 15 inquiries into the forest industries in Tasmania. We pointed out at the time the Helsham inquiry was established that it simply was not necessary to have another inquiry because all of the research was done and all of the information was already available for assessment. But the Federal Government did establish that inquiry, and now it is proceeding to establish yet another inquiry into the forest industries. Perhaps it anticipates inquiring into other forest areas of Australia, such as the north Queensland rainforests. But it is quite apparent that this Federal Government has already made up its mind what it will do about them-it has locked them all up in national parks. So, I question why the Federal Government would want to conduct such an inquiry when clearly it has already made its decisions on that issue. It would seem that putting forward such a reference to this Commission to conduct an inquiry into the forest industries is nothing more than a whitewash to cover up decisions and actions that have already been taken by this Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk at some length of my objections to the establishment of this Resource Assessment Commission; but I do not intend to delay the House, because, as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has already pointed out, we have considerable business to be concluded in the House tonight. I simply conclude my remarks by saying that this Commission is unnecessary; this Bill establishes a new bureaucracy; it will delay resource development; it will put another impediment in the way of industry being able to develop Australia's resources and thereby create new economic opportunities; and I hope at the earliest opportunity an incoming conservative Liberal and National Party government will abolish this new Resource Assessment Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Resource Assessment Commission, which will be established as a result of this Resource Assessment Commission Bill, is an important part of a package of measures which will resolve future conservation and development issues. Other aspects of the package announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 18 November last year were: a strengthening of the role and a streamlining of the operation of the Australian Heritage Commission; the negotiation of a forest accord; the development of a national forest inventory; the identification of gaps in existing environmental databases through review; the enhancement of the environmental expertise of the various industry councils; and the creation of greater community awareness of conservation issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's future requires-in fact demands-that this generation of Australians reconcile the requirements of development and of conservation of our environment. The Australian Labor Party is acutely aware of this. The introduction to chapter 9 of the Party platform-the section on the environment-states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor believes that-</PARA>
<PARA> Environmental objectives will be integrated in a co-operative way into the government's overall economic strategies and industry development policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Environment and development must be planned in the light of the other. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be sustained, environmentally sound, humane development, planned within the constraints of, and in harmony with, the natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The restoration of full employment and environmental protection are compatible, rather than conflicting, objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>It is in this context that the three policy principles which are to be used to guide Commonwealth Ministers should be seen. These principles, which were yet again outlined by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in his second reading speech are:</PARA>
<PARA> there should be an integrated approach to conservation and development by taking both conservation and development aspects into account at an early stage;</PARA>
<PARA> resource use decisions should seek to optimise the net benefits to the community from the nation's resources, having regard to efficiency of resource use, environmental considerations and an equitable distribution of the return on resources; and</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth decisions, policies and management regimes may provide for additional uses that are compatible with the primary purpose values of the area, recognising that in some cases both conservation and development interests can be accommodated concurrently or sequentially, and, in other cases, choices must be made between alternative uses or combinations of uses. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, this process is an attempt to move away from the ad hoc approach to resource development in Australia. It is intended to get in place a system whereby we can weigh up the competing and conflicting conservation and resource development aspects. That is important. If we look at some of the examples raised by honourable members opposite, we can see that in the past what we have had is an approach to resource development based on the bringing forward of single projects. Never before have we sat down and consciously tried to put in place a system whereby we could have an orderly development of resources. I think that is quite important. The Minister, in his second reading speech, indicated that Justice Stewart would be appointed as the first Chairperson of the Commission. No doubt all honourable members who have taken some interest in the way in which Justice Stewart was able to put in place the National Crime Authority as its original Chairman will realise that he has the attributes required to set in place this unique process which will be very important. That is a pleasing aspect of the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the Opposition's position. As my colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) outlined last night, it is a bit hard to follow the Opposition's position on this type of legislation. Whilst we all now realise that it is opposing the legislation and has put forward a second reading amendment, as the honourable member for Dunkley mentioned last night, back in November the then shadow environment spokesman, Senator Puplick-I am not too sure whether he is still the shadow spokesman; everything with the coalition front bench is so fluid this week-welcomed the Government's announcement of the decision to establish the new Resource Assessment Commission. In fact, he claimed that it represented a major triumph for the Federal coalition. In his press release he said:</PARA>
<PARA> For months the Opposition has been calling for the development of a process along the lines now foreshadowed by the proposed RAC. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) is to follow me in this debate. I hope that he will be able to explain to me something which has been a bit of a quandary. When debating a motion about Wesley Vale last week-on 4 May-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Look at what happened in this place yesterday. The Government introduced the Resource Assessment Commission Bill. I cannot pre-empt debate on this matter, but this Commission recognises that there was a failure at Wesley Vale. It recognises that the Federal Government failed to publish guidelines in advance. It recognises that people were going in a hundred different directions. This Bill may be an advance-it recognises a glaring gap in the development of balanced resources in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>He having said that last week, it will be interesting to see what he has to say today. I agree with him that, if we are to have a balanced development of resources, we should have the guidelines. Let us look at what happened in the case of Wesley Vale: at the last moment the Tasmanian Government decided that it would change its environmental guidelines-environmental guidelines that were completely unacceptable to the Commonwealth Government. That was the real reason that that development did not go ahead. Let us not kid ourselves, even if we are in the run-up to a State election in Tasmania. What happened in relation to Wesley Vale, and the fact that the project did not proceed, lies in the hands of the Gray Government in Tasmania. It lies in their hands because they were not willing to sit down and take seriously the environmental consequences of the mill that was proposed. If we have an investigation into the forest industry and the use of forest resources overall, as has been outlined, without having to look at specific projects, it will be for the better because the type of guidelines that are required will come out of such discussions. I refer to the second reading amendment and a number of the matters which were raised. The second part of the amendment proposes that the Government should be condemned for:</PARA>
<PARA>Its failure to recognise land use as properly the responsibility of the State and Northern Territory Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>We are really talking about resource management. This is not some sort of town planning exercise, a normal run-of-the-mill land use requirement. We are talking about resource development. The Commonwealth Government has a major role to play in resource development-and that is recognised. If we look at past actions of coalition governments we will see that they understood that they had powers in this direction. We only have to look at the appropriate action taken by the Fraser Government in relation to sand mining. Now, we have this suggestion in a second reading amendment that suddenly the Commonwealth Government should walk away from this exercise. I reject completely that notion. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish quickly to turn to some earlier criticism by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) which was made soon after the announcement of the Resources Assessment Commission. The foundation contended that what was being put in place was very much a sop for resource developers. It contended that not enough recognition was taken of the importance of conservation considerations. I would like to think that there will be the appropriate consideration of those wider aspects of this legislation. One of the concerns that has been raised-and which has not been really addressed or amended in the legislation before us-is the fact that the recommendation to appoint additional commissioners will be made after consultation with the presiding members of the Australian Science and Technology Council and the Industries Assistance Commission. I know that those organisations have put to government that perhaps bodies such as the Australian Heritage Commission are appropriate to consult. In the perception of the way this commission will work I think this is very important. I would be interested if the Minister at a later stage could outline to the House why the Government has not been able to come to any agreement about the point put forward by the ACF. It is very important that the Government consciously goes back to conservation bodies such as the ACF, which have been quite responsible in recognising the need to reconcile economic considerations as well as the environmental considerations of many projects. So, they are not just ratbag type organisations which should not be listened to. I think that the Government should go back and allay the fears of the ACF. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding my remarks, I wish to raise two other aspects of the Bill. The first relates to section 20 which provides that at least two special commissioners will be appointed `unless the Minister otherwise directs'. Section 32 provides that the draft report will be prepared for public consideration, again with the proviso `unless the Minister otherwise directs'. I hope that where, in what I consider will be rare cases, the Minister will otherwise direct about those two aspects, that there will be a public announcement and that the public will be able to look at the reasons why the Minister so directed. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many of my colleagues would have liked to have spoken in the debate on this legislation. But it is important in the bipartisan nature of the way we are seeking cooperation tonight to have this legislation proceed expeditiously through the House; so I will round off my contribution. As part of the second reading speech, the Minister also indicated that the Government will have the capacity under the Act to commission small-scale inquiries which might include only the chairperson. The worry about this is that people have thought, `How can we reconcile the notion of a small-scale inquiry with the fact that we have said that under the environmental protection and impact proposals there will still be the ability to look at small-scale proposals?' I hope that when applying this aspect of the legislation the Government will recognise that there is a fear that in some way we will subvert the environmental impact statement (EIS) procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many of my colleagues wish Justice Stewart and the commission all the best in the quite demanding task, but in doing so serve notice that the true test of the commission's value will be its ability to ensure that the community and especially the responsible members of the conservation movement perceive that it truly balances the expectations of conservationists as well as developers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, this debate is truncated again and I think that is to be regretted. The Resource Assessment Commission Bill was brought on last night at a very late hour and was again unable to proceed. I do not think that the very important issues raised here-given that the Opposition opposes this Bill-will get a proper airing. I think that is to be very much regretted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This proposal is to establish a Resource Assessment Commission to inquire into and report on the environmental, cultural, social, industrial, economic and other aspects of resources and their uses. It does not substitute for any existing legislation, such as the requirement for any environmental impact statement, and inquiries will be initiated and the terms of reference set by the Government. Several speakers have gone through this Bill. It is interesting to note that the Government's proposal is born out of conflict. There has been a great deal of conflict within the Government about this proposal. The most interesting first report that I saw about this matter was on 16 December in the Australian Financial Review in an item entitled `Ministers divided over handling land conflict'. At that stage it was revealed that the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) were in extreme conflict over the direction the Government should take to deal with developmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has done effectively is to place between itself and the decision a new bureaucratic mechanism. In the Opposition's view, this bureaucratic mechanism is not necessary and only tries to delay and isolate Ministers from their allotted tasks of making decisions about the vital developmental issues of this nation. Of course, the Wesley Vale decision heightened the problem faced by the Government in this area. I refer to the statement made by the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) about my remarks the other day. I think he took some liberty in that he took them out of context because what I was saying was that there is a problem here and that the Government's inability to make those tough decisions now means that it is looking for a mechanism to find its way through these issues. So, it has imposed this bureaucratic mechanism in a sense to let the commission be the lightning rod to draw the flak and the attention, so that the Government can sit back and say that it is acting on advice when it knows that this will add further to delays, which is something that the industry does not want and does not appreciate. We can see from the Wesley Vale decision that when we have delays, as we have had, ultimately projects will fall and fail. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see the reaction by Labor members of parliament to this proposal. I quote from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 24 November in which the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) said, `. . . the Government will lose votes as a result . . .'. Mr Milton is a member of the Government's environment committee and the environmental groups around this nation support Mr Milton and say that they do not want this Resource Assessment Commission. One of the reasons for this is that if the environmental movement does not want it, and those concerned with environment in the Labor Party Caucus led by Peter Milton and others do not want it, there is a great division within the Government. More and more the radical greenies seem to be saying that they want to have control of the total agenda. So, perhaps this commission is more about trying to control the conflicting views about land use policy within the Australian Labor Party than it is about trying to put something in place to address these very complex issues to which the nation and industry want and need answers. It comes back to the fundamental point I was making about the need to have a balance between environmental concerns and developmental needs. My point is that this Commission is born out of conflict within the Government, its inability to make decisions, and it is not the right sort of mechanism. It might, with its language, address the issues correctly but the mechanism which the Government is trying to put in place is not the correct way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the Government's past record, the Bill is an admission of the ad hoc and confrontationist approach of the Government with regard to resource and land use issues. The Government's policy on these matters has been largely linked to the environment public relations machine, and an anti-development government department. This proposal is trying to offset that. It has been pushed very hard in the Cabinet, I understand, by Mr Kerin and Senator Cook, and it would appear that they have won. It is not a genuine attempt to address these issues. When one looks very carefully at what this Commission is empowered to do, one sees that in a sense it only sets up a formal mechanism of a Helsham inquiry. It does not have an ongoing staff. It has about three people, I believe, in the secretariat to be reposed in the Prime Minister's Department. It has a full time chairman. Justice Stewart had to be found a job somewhere and it seems to me that the Government is creating another Commission and putting him in there. That, I might say by way of an aside, is something we should be careful about in this Parliament. We keep putting judges into areas where they are not involved with the law per se. Now we have a judge in charge of a developmental, environmental assessment mechanism, and I do not know whether that is the best thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the point I keep making about the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial and Research Organisation (CSIRO) and whether we ought to have a retired politician as chairman of it, or whether we should return to what we had in the CSIRO's heyday, when we had a leading scientist, David Rivett. We got far better value because those people had a detailed knowledge of what they were trying to do. We will see how Mr Justice Stewart performs in this role. </PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the inquiry is an interesting point which needs to be made. This body is required to inquire into and report on the environmental, cultural, social, industrial, economic or other aspects of resources and their uses. That is of concern on a number of counts. I have mentioned the problems we had with the Helsham inquiry which, as the member for Lyons (Mr Burr) indicated cost $3m. The scope suggested by this Bill is huge if one takes account of all the issues I have just mentioned. How far down the track do we go? Do we go to processing or assessment of marketing? For example, the Independents in Tasmania are promoting the idea of unbleached pulp. Where are the markets? One imagines that the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) would encompass all aspects from the resource end to the marketing end of any such inquiry. It might be a mammoth task. </PARA>
<PARA> To obtain the knowledge thought necessary on which to base a decision could be years in the making, putting us way behind our competitors. That is a point that needs to be made. It emphasises again the point that I make, in opposition to this proposal, about time constraints. We should not walk away from the difficulties which industry faces with ever-increasing competitive markets and time constraints. While we might be well-intentioned with the bureaucracies we put in the way, we need to look not at fast track systems that ignore issues, but at systems that certainly recognise issues and do not delay things. The second reading speech refers to `our incomplete understanding of complex resource issues', and the fact that we can rarely foresee all the consequences of the impact of human activity or their extent. </PARA>
<PARA> Forests and forest based industries have already been the subject of lengthy and detailed inquiries by the States and the Commonwealth. The first inquiry of the RAC is to be the forests and timber resources. We already have at the Federal level a Senate Standing Committee on Australia's Forestry and Forest Product Industries; and Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) report on pulp and paper, paper products and printing industries; and, of course, the Helsham inquiry. Only today we had Senator Sanders's proposal for a Senate inquiry into pulp mills, which has now been delayed because there is a CSIRO team which has just headed overseas to get such information. How many more inquiries are we going to be required to set up to be funded by the taxpayer to deal with some of those basic issues?</PARA>
<PARA> Taxation, royalties and pricing policies are key policy principles which need to be looked at to guide the Commission in resolving competing resource use claims. I quote from the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA>Resource use decisions should seek to optimise the net benefits to the community from the nation's resources, having regard to efficiency of resource use, environmental considerations and an equitable distribution of the return on resources. </PARA>
<PARA>The latter surely involves a consideration of issues such as royalties, resource rent tax in the petroleum area-will it apply to fishing, will it apply to access to timber resources-all of which will now fall into the RAC inquiry. Its terms have not been properly described within the Bill. That gives me some concern and it ought to give industry concern as well. In some quarters industry has welcomed this Bill, but it has accepted it as a fait accompli. I do not think this proposal has been subject to sufficient debate or sufficient scrutiny by all those who will be subject to its inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> The point we make in our amendment concerns the State's responsibilities. That issue has been canvassed widely. One would expect that in a Federation the roles and concerns of the States about land use policy ought to be considered. We do not say there is no role at all for the Federal Government on major land use issues. That is certainly my own personal view. This Bill does not recognise the role of the States and, being a Tasmanian in this place, everybody would expect me to draw attention to and give specific examples if that was necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a comparison that this Bill is very tame, like the IAC legislation. Members will remember that the IAC grew out of debates years ago on the tariff industries, and has done very useful work. The Bill gives the RAC the power to determine whether a submission should remain commercial-in-confidence. By contrast, the IAC legislation gives the option to those making the confidential submission. Hence, again, the amendment that has been moved by my colleague the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) which I support. It is vital to the efficacy of the Commission that governments and industries are assured of confidentiality. It will have only a small permanent secretariat, and there will be no on-going analytical capacity or consistency. It will just be an inquiry mechanism. It will do an inquiry here and an inquiry there. All it does, as I said, is formalise the Helsham inquiry system. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is necessary to talk about the Chairperson and the Special Commissioners, although I do have some concern about what evidence can be taken, and the long-term appointment of the Chairperson. Given that they will only be doing one or two inquiries here and there, it seems to me all that this is doing is setting up a full time Chairperson with a couple of secretaries, and an ability for him, whenever there is an inquiry, to bring on board special consultants. I do not know whether that will achieve anything. Surely if there is an issue to be assessed then an expert panel is immediately set up to address a specific issue, report and then fold up. I do not see any reason for these appointments other than the point I made earlier-that it is an effort to resolve internal conflicts within the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make is about striking a balance. Some things need to be remembered. The National Conservation Strategy for Australia (NCSA) states:</PARA>
<PARA>It follows that the strategy must have regard for the general economic climate, which has an important bearing on the speed with which the strategy can be implemented, and for the inability of Australia to isolate itself from the world economic system. It also requires a proper accounting of the costs and benefits to society. </PARA>
<PARA>The point is that much land has been locked up for conservation and other purposes without a proper accounting of costs and benefits to society. It should be beholden on governments who wish to alienate land, as it is on industry to develop land, to assess the impact of these proposals in the fullest possible way. In order to tackle the big environmental issues, the Government needs the money to fund a range of research. Australia's continued economic and social well-being depends on its ability to trade profitably with other nations, and in the long term our capacity to conserve our natural and cultural heritage will depend on our economic performance. Environmental issues relate not only to heritage, wilderness and quality of life, but also to standards of living, which depend on wealth generation. Those in the Labor Party Caucus ought to remember that, and those in the environmental movement ought to remember that. We are trying to strike a balance. For some time the balance between conservation and development has been steadily tipped in favour of preservation, and it is time for a balance to be struck. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think this proposal does anything other than set up a bureaucratic mechanism. That does not answer the issues. It is an ad hoc approach. It puts in place another mechanism which industry will regret has been set up. As my other colleagues have said, we are opposing it because we do not think it does anything other than formalise some Helsham-type inquiries. The role of the States has been ignored, and another layer of bureaucracy has been set up. I think the ultimate political aim of this body is to put controls on the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mr Richardson), that born-again greenie who is chasing votes in capital cities, who ignores regional Australia, who ignores the development and downsteam processing of the comparative advantages Australia has in minerals, in agricultural products and forestry products, and I think that is to be regretted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs to address these issues in a more meaningful way. There are mechanisms already in place. I find it interesting that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, for example, could be doing much of the work that is proposed in this Bill. This is just a lot of flowery language that sets up something that is very small. It is nice rhetoric, but it does not address the issue. There are existing mechanisms. Why does the Government not utilise the CSIRO more to undertake these types of inquiries? The Government used the CSIRO at the last moment with the Wesley Vale proposal. Why is it necessary to set up this Commission? The Government is trying to put in place a bureaucratic mechanism to protect itself from making the hard decisions. There is no escape for anyone in this place from making hard decisions. The sooner honourable members on the Government side of the House recognise that they were elected to make the tough decisions as well as make good fellows of themselves, then the better off we will all be in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) suggested that the truncation of this debate was in some way going to affect Opposition speakers, but those who have had an opportunity to look at the speakers list will notice that four speakers from the Government side who put their names down to speak on the Resource Assessment Commission Bill, and none from the Opposition side, will miss out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to establish the Resource Assessment Commission, which will inquire into and report on the environmental, cultural, social, industrial, economic and other aspects of resources and their uses. Three principles are outlined in the second reading speech. The first is that the approach to the issues of conservation and development should occur in the early stages of development. The second is that it is important to optimise the net benefits of efficient resource usage with regard to environmental considerations and an equitable distribution of returns. The third principle is that Commonwealth decisions, policies and management regimes should provide for additional uses of resources. It may be that environmental and developmental interests can occur concurrently or sequentially. In some cases, alternative uses or combinations of uses may be required. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to understand how assessments will be made. The commissioners will have the prerogative and will be left to determine how assessments are made. Clause 8 of the legislation empowers the Commission to do these things as far as is practicable. Understanding that there are some very complex issues involved in resource recognition and usage, it is important to understand the limitations of our knowledge. We try wherever possible to increase our knowledge, and certainly it is to be hoped that the views of the Resource Assessment Commission will do that. Individual projects will still require an environmental impact study. Indeed, the specific project purpose and the specifics of any project will require that study to oversee it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Resource Assessment Commission will be able to look at industries, regions and issues as a whole. The debate on energy usage in this country concerns not just exploration for oil but public transport and its availability, the amount of energy used by public transport vis-a-vis private transport, car design, engine design, road construction and alternative transport opportunities. All sorts of other issues are involved, not just exploration for oil. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the position of the Opposition? As pointed out by the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), it has done a backflip on this issue. In November 1988 the Opposition spokesman in this area, Senator Puplick, was saying that this represented a triumph and a victory for the coalition because the Australian Labor Party was endorsing a policy that they endorsed. Last night the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) came into this place, bounced up on the back bench and moved that the House decline to give the Bill its second reading. We expect this sort of yo-yo tactic from our opponents. Indeed, they have had a number of changes in leadership. But what do we find? Under the dry Howard leadership of two or three days ago, we found a pro-conservation position. Under the wet Peacock leadership, we find that this legislation is opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The criticisms directed at the legislation, principally by the right honourable member for New England in his speech last night, were, firstly, that the Government is doing this to avoid making difficult decisions; and, secondly, the old perennial that the States were not being consulted and that this legislation would, in some way, cut across the rights of the States. He suggested, in some sort of a plea for more mining and exploration, that his would have a terrible impact on our balance of payments. Just for good measure, he put in a criticism of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and the Government's commitment to science and technology. Indeed, the historic commitment of $1 billion that was announced earlier this week is a matter of some concern. I have been in this place asking questions on science and technology over the last five or six years. Every time I ask a question on science and technology and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) comes to the dispatch box to answer, honourable members opposite turn around and talk; they are uninterested. They do not have a sincere interest in science and technology and never have. When we make this historic commitment, we find them crying crocodile tears. The tragedy of the coalition's position, illustrated by the speech of the right honourable member for New England last night, is that it is so one dimensional and so conceptually flawed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad you are listening so intently Madam Deputy Speaker. I cannot imagine why the right honourable member for New England, who is in here at the moment and sitting on the front bench, is not taking notice of what I am saying. The Opposition says that its concern is that the Government does not want to make decisions, but its principal concern is that the Government does not make decisions that it wants the Government to make. We can look at the monumental Franklin decision of 1983. It has now been shown that had the Franklin River been dammed it would have been environmentally negligent and economically unnecessary. We look at rainforests in north Queensland and find worldwide acclaim for that decision. We look at the decision concerning the pulp mill recently in Tasmania. How can one justify the environmental impact of 13 tonnes of dioxin a day going into the ocean? The Opposition is concerned because the decisions the Government makes are not the decisions it wants. Indeed, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said at the time, the joint partners in the proposal for the pulp mill in Tasmania believed that they could fulfil the environmental conditions, but they did not want to be required to fulfil those conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It makes me very angry to look at land degradation, which is perhaps the greatest environmental problem in this country at the moment. The Liberal-National Party governments played a significant part in that development. For 20 years there were all sorts of incentives in Western Australia to clear trees. The experience in the eastern States could have told us very simply that that was the wrong philosophy. The problems at Jerramungup in the south-west of Western Australia are wind, water erosion, water logging and salination. All of those things have been brought about by clearing, which was encouraged by previous coalition governments. The information was available, we knew the effects, we had the experience overseas and in the eastern States, yet Western Australia went ahead with those proposals. They resulted in an environmental disaster. There is no point apportioning blame now, I understand that. What we have to do is get something in place to sort out the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue is that of States' rights. The Opposition has said that the States were not being consulted. No statement damns the position of the Opposition more than this one. It shows how completely bereft of philosophy it is and how lacking it is in the concept of conservation. This is everybody's problem. It is not just a regional or a local problem, it is the whole of Australia's problem. However, conservation and resource management goes beyond that. It is something that goes over oceans, beyond regional and national boundaries and over continents. Everybody on earth is involved in this issue. It is an issue that the citizens of this planet need to be concerned about. I really believe that the pettiness of the Opposition is indicated by its objection which says that the States will not get a chance. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the greenhouse effect, and at the way in which debate on that issue is gaining momentum, one finds that it is something of immense consequence. The climatic change will impact on everybody's life if and when it occurs. How does one effect political change? There are very many obstacles in the way of political change and it is necessary that those barriers to action be broken down. The Resource Assessment Commission is one means by which that can occur. There is uncertainty about the greenhouse effect. Consider some of the scientific data. </PARA>
<PARA> As is the way with human nature, we think that, because it is uncertain and because we are unsure about it, perhaps it will go away. There is an unwillingness to believe that the worst will happen. The consequences are like something out of a science fiction movie. It is something far beyond our imagination, and there is no historical precedent, so we tend to deny that it will happen. Others say that we will adapt to the change when it occurs. But that will be too late. Yet others just want to be ignorant; they just do not want to hear about it. Then there are those for whom the problems are so alarmingly difficult that they shy away from them. </PARA>
<PARA> The greenhouse effect is just one example. Let me give an example of what is happening in Western Australia, the State that I come from. The State Government has introduced the Tree Trust. It is talking about the largest reafforestation program ever initiated in this country. One hundred and five million trees are going to be planted on cleared farmland. We will have integration of commercial tree cropping and existing farming for the first time; voluntary participation by farmers; the production of high-quality raw materials, and their export. What are the benefits of the Tree Trust going to be? They are going to be a large number of jobs in the south west of Western Australia; a new resource for the State's timber industry; the rebirth of water and soil resources in the south-west; and-perhaps the most important benefit-a dramatic decline in Western Australia's contribution to carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect. But it will not matter a hoot what we do in Western Australia if the rest of Australia or the rest of the world or other areas do not follow suit. If trees continue to be cut down in Brazil and in Malaysia, it will not matter a hoot. </PARA>
<PARA> The Resource Assessment Commission is something that is beyond yesterday's men and beyond yesterday's views. I suggest it is something that looks to the future and that it looks at the big picture. Indeed, I believe that it is an approach which should make use of the scientific knowledge that we have. It needs to balance conservation and development, but it needs also to take a global perspective, not just a local or regional perspective, and it needs to plan long-term. This legislation should be supported by every honourable member. If Opposition members cannot support it they remain the spoilers and the destroyers. They remain the spoilers of rational conservation and development in this country. Indeed, they have no conservation credentials at all</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summing up the debate, I thank honourable members for their contributions. A number of points were made during the debate. Again the position of the Opposition is that of a negative spoiler. We have heard no positive contribution from it. Honourable members opposite know, as we know, that there are very considerable arguments going on right across the length and breadth of Australia as to the way in which our natural resources ought to be developed. Those members are perfectly happy that these continue to be areas of confrontation and antagonism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They are perfectly happy to see the kind of situation that developed at Wesley Vale in Tasmania. There, the responsibility was left to the State but finally, the Commonwealth, on the basis on scientific information provided by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said that a situation could not be permitted in which, by virtue of a development which everyone conceded was important economically, 13 tonnes of organic chlorides would be pumped into Bass Strait every day. The effect of dioxin in Bass Strait, not just on the environment but also on the commercial fishing industry, was not a matter of concern to honourable gentlemen opposite. But the Commonwealth-not on the basis of some odd thought dragged out in the middle of a cabinet meeting, but on the basis of scientific evidence-said, `You will not do this to our environment'. </PARA>
<PARA> At that stage, partners to the consortium walked away. Why? Because they knew that if they accepted those standards in Australia they would have to accept them in other parts of the world. Of course, what we have here are apologists for the Tasmanian Government saying that any kind of economic resource development, no matter what it does to the environment, is good enough for them so long as there is a dollar in it somewhere along the lines. It may be good enough for them, but it is not good enough for this Government, and it is not good enough for the average right-thinking Australian, who is becoming increasingly concerned-this is true at every level of our society-at the way in which our environment is being despoiled. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman opposite knows-it has been pointed out by my colleague-that the question of land use and land degredation is costing average Australian taxpayers $600m a year. In many of the most fertile regions of Australia the salt table is rising. Is that not a matter for concern? Is that not a matter that needs investigation? Is that not a matter that strikes at the very heart of our primary industries and of our capacity to continue to trade in areas that are so important to us? Of course, to the honourable gentlemen opposite-this apology for an Opposition-these are not matters of immediate concern. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the heart of this proposal that has caused such a stir in the mind of the former leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)? Is there anything basically wrong with the creation of a structure which makes the proper development and use of our resources a subject of inquiry, rather than a subject of continual confrontation as one resource proposal follows another? It does not matter whether we are talking about the forests of Tasmania or the forests of East Gippsland. Is it not more appropriate in our society that the relevant interest groups be able to put their arguments before an independent body, which will have available to it a range of expertise and capacity so that all the arguments, including arguments that may come from the State Government or from the local region, can be examined? On the basis of the evidence, and calling upon the resources of our scientific institutions, that body will be able to point out to the community not merely the problems but, hopefully, the solutions. That is what this proposal is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) has pointed out, this Opposition is not merely incapable of making an independent assessment of the issue; it has two positions. When this matter was first announced, it was welcomed by the relevant shadow Minister. Let me quote his words. He not only endorsed the proposal; he claimed that the credit for it lay with the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA> What are the arguments? All we are told is that this proposition imposes another level of bureaucracy. Another level of bureaucracy! Can a State obtain the services of a distinguished judge, someone who has established a reputation and a capacity not merely for judicial impartiality but also the ability to weigh evidence and produce an objective assessment, give him a small unit where he has available to him all the best resources within the Commonwealth and ask him to invite comment from industry and conservationists and produce a report? To the dullards opposite that is another level of bureaucracy. Honourable members opposite prefer the confrontationist approach. They prefer to see people chained to trees and society in torment. That approach is easier for them than to try to move to a positive resolution of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Bill will not delay proposals that must be considered. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) suggested that this is seen as an opportunity for the Government not to take hard decisions. Honourable members opposite may not like all the decisions taken by this Government from time to time, but the reality is that this Government not only takes hard decisions but also takes correct decisions. The only decision that the mob opposite is capable of taking on important issues is one on which leader it will knife at any particular time. That is its only capacity for decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA> The other argument brought forward is that we are interfering with the role of the States. Does anyone believe that the potential to pollute Bass Strait or the potential to destroy the Great Barrier Reef or some of the important wetlands throughout Australia is simply a matter for the State parliaments? Only these backwoodsmen opposite would argue that. We have long passed that situation. Of course the States do not have an explicit role. Their role is like the role of any other interest group that comes to this body and says that it either supports or opposes a particular proposal. They should then put all their arguments and use the resources available to them to support their proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the States have been consulted on this proposition and, basically, they support it. The States were informed of this process when it was first conceived and they were provided with good opportunities to be involved and to have all their views, whatever they might be, taken fully into account. Obviously, given the importance of their capacity to influence those decisions, their contributions will be of significant importance. This is not another layer of bureaucracy: it is the Government trying to reduce the area of conflict and tension in our society. They are not simple issues of black and white. If one visits a community where people have made their living by felling trees, one can understand the anguish and concern when they see their jobs in jeopardy and they see that they have no prospect of future employment. That must be a matter of concern. Equally it is a matter of concern to see that our forest resources are usefully and positively used. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a duty not merely to take hard decisions but also to look at what decisions are made and how they will affect the quality of the lives of people who work in the industry. That is being responsible. That is essentially the underlying philosophy in this proposition. The fact is that we have a negative Opposition which simply tells us that it is all too hard and produces these odd arguments telling us what it is against, but it never tells us what it is for. Honourable members opposite are for stabbing each other as hard as they can to see which particular member can obtain the most prominent position on the Opposition benches. That is what they are about. We watch with interest. They are here today and gone tomorrow. Some have been recycled and others hope to be recycled, but that is a matter about which I do not feel that I should delay the House at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House are interested spectators. Nevertheless, I ask honourable members opposite to spare us of their mediocrity, the boorishness of their comments and the speciousness of arguments which do not go to the heart of this matter and do not seize upon the great issues which are involved in the examination of environmental issues in this community. Spare us that and get on with the knife stabbing. If honourable members opposite cannot make any decent contributions to this debate, it is better that they say nothing at all. We reject the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While we have already expressed our opposition to what we see as this additional layer of bureaucracy and when in Government we will be determined to see the Resource Assessment Commission terminated, we recognise that there may well be support from this Parliament for the concept of the Bill. Therefore, I have moved four amendments. It might be that the Resource Assessment Commission can take account of some of the land use responsibilities that we believe are the responsibility of the States. It is for that reason that I have moved the first two amendments. Each amendment seeks a reference to the States before the Bill can proceed. For example, in clause 14, which relates to the selection of special commissioners, it is proposed that there should be consultation with the chairperson-or Mr Justice Stewart in this instance-of the Resource Assessment Commission. Clause 14 (b) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the presiding members (however described) of the Australian Science and Technology Council-</PARA>
<PARA>or ASTEC-</PARA>
<PARA>and the Industries Assistance Commission;</PARA>
<PARA>It is also proposed that there should be consultation with the State or States relevant to the subject matter of inquiry. In other words, because the States have prime responsibility, as is the case in the first proposed reference on the forest industry, we believe it essential that the States should be consulted about the appointment of special commissioners. So too in clause 16 on page 5 of the Bill, where there is reference to the holding of an inquiry, we believe that it is not only a matter of the Government taking the decision but also of the States, whose interests are so vitally affected, being consulted-hence the second amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment, which is made to clause 29, relates to the question of confidentiality. We believe it necessary that a person giving oral or written evidence that he believes to be of a commercial or confidential nature, should have the capacity to determine whether that confidentiality should be protected. What we seek to do in amendment (3) is to insert a specific provision which will say, instead of the present subclause (2):</PARA>
<PARA> Where a person appearing to give evidence at a hearing objects to doing so in public because the evidence is of a confidential nature, the Commission shall take the evidence in private. </PARA>
<PARA>We see that amendment as being one which will allow a commercial enterprise, believing the evidence to be confidential, itself to claim that confidentiality and then it will not be subject to the other provisions of this clause, which say that the evidence can subsequently be published. I believe that this is appropriate. It is important that there be an ability for industry, if there is a matter which affects the investors in the stock market or which for any other reason might affect the value of the company's shares, to have that confidentiality protected. Therefore, I suggest that this amendment to clause 29 should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in relation to clause 30, where we are referring to written evidence, the words `the Commission' should be omitted, because we are quite sure the position should be that, if the person who seeks to have the evidence removed believes that it should be so removed, then of course the evidence is given, it is given in private and there is no suggestion subsequently that the matter can then be published. I believe that that is only appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> These several amendments are designed to ensure, in the first instance, that the States' interests are protected. Let no-one make any mistake: the States and the Northern Territory do have prime responsibility for land use. We see no reason for the Commonwealth to usurp that responsibility. It is for that very reason that in that second reading amendment, on which we voted a moment ago, we referred to our concern that that indeed was part of the purpose of this Bill. The second two provide an opportunity for the declaration of commercial confidentiality. Again, we believe that they are appropriate in the nature of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite contrary to the assertion by the Minister at the table, the objective of the coalition parties in this measure is to try to ensure that developments will proceed. We do not believe that this device is the appropriate way to act. We see it rather as a device by the Government to avoid taking responsibility. We see it as an attempt by the Government to intrude upon the normal mechanisms yet another layer of bureaucracy. As I explained last night, it is in that climate that we believe that the Bill should not be supported. It would be our intention in government to revoke the legislation and to proceed to the proper course, where environmental impact statements, which are still required under this legislation, proceed according to that legislation, and then the development project can be allowed to be processed with expedition, without the considerable delay that we believe will be the product of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We do understand why industry, in a climate where the Government has delayed so many projects, seeks the measure. But we believe that it is better for the Government to change its own approach than to have yet another layer of bureaucracy inserted. It is for that reason that I strongly urge this Committee to accept the four amendments which I propose on behalf of the coalition parties. </PARA>

These amendments constitute his thinking and the thinking of the Opposition on this matter. We do not agree with that thinking. He referred to the clauses in respect of the States. The States have a full capacity at any stage to be involved in this process. I have no doubt that they will be involved and that they will influence it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the question of confidentiality, when it has been decided that any kind of tribunal is going to hear evidence in public, there are very few tribunals-certainly not in our court system-which would, simply on the basis of one person averring that in fact what he has to say is of a confidential nature, say that that is the conclusion of the matter. The process that is set out in the Bill establishes the availability of that person establishing it to the satisfaction of the Commission. If the nature of the confidentiality outweighs the public interest in the hearing of that information and it being averred to in public, then the Commission will decide that on the basis of the prima facie evidence that is before it. That is part of the due process of our legal system. It is part of the due process of our quasi-judicial tribunals. The Opposition certainly has not made a case why that general principle ought to be abandoned in this instance. For those reasons, we reject the amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we have yet another leg down the path of this long day, looking at defence or veterans' matters-on this occasion the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, or the Nambia Bill as it might well be termed, and the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill. After this legislation is dealt with the House will deal with the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill. This follows on the response to the Cross report, which we heard today, and the debate on that, as well as the now famous matter of public importance debate which took place earlier this afternoon in relation to veterans, war widows and ex-prisoners of war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposed to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill; indeed, we support the Namibia component of that legislation which, of course, provides repatriation cover for our defence forces, now committed to and now in Namibia, carrying out their duties on behalf of this nation. I think it behoves the House to pause for a moment and dwell on the fact that there are Australians not only on the African continent but also in the Middle East and elsewhere carrying out their duties in relation to their service with the Australian armed forces, primarily in the peacekeeping role beyond Australian shores, and doing their work proudly, efficiently and effectively and at some risk to their lives. Last year a captain was killed in the Middle East in tragic circumstances. It is a risky business to be involved with peacekeeping forces. The Parliament should not underestimate that risk, and that is why there is clearly a need for the passage of the relevant requirements for repatriation cover, as provided for in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not dwell on this particular aspect of the legislation at any length-the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who has so recently retired from the Navy, will carry that burden in the debate-because I want to focus on one or two of the other areas. But in so doing, I am reminded that Namibia is and has been a commitment which has evolved over many years. It is some 10 years since planning commenced for an Australian peacekeeping force to go to Namibia. Certainly, once the General Assembly approved without vote the spending of some $416m for the Namibia independence operation and the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG), the momentum sped up greatly for the forces to take up their positions in Namibia. Again it was not an overnight decision. Again it was developed over many months, if not years, in a situation of an early warning order circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has known about it for a long time yet the forces actually left Australia without repatriation cover in place. It is regrettable that, while there is bipartisan support for that force and bipartisan support for the repatriation cover, the force was sent from Australia without that repatriation cover in place. It does not speak well for the planning of the Government and its legislative program that this has been the case in respect of this legislation, but certainly it now makes amends. I have double checked the fact that the repatriation cover is being backdated to the relevant dates in February to ensure that the coverage is from the date of commencement of the UNTAG operation and the Australian involvement with that operation in Namibia. So that backdating is particularly welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move on to other sections of the legislation. There are technical and administrative adjustments to align the Australian War Memorial with other Commonwealth statutory bodies in relation to powers to make investments without ministerial approval and a series of other minor adjustments which were explained in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). The Opposition has no objection to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to clause 11 (c) in the broader context of discussing it in the second reading debate. I want to spend some little time on it because it is a clause that really should not be in this Bill. It suits the Government's convenience to try to lock it in with the Namibia provisions, because the Namibia provisions will have a momentum of their own, and hope that the Parliament will blink and the Bill will pass through both Houses and, in it, clause 11 (c). What does clause 11 (c) do? It deals with the service pension eligibility of British or Commonwealth veterans who have come to Australia, have lived in Australia for at least 10 years and one day and have exercised their right to apply for a service pension. That circumstance was created incidentally by a previous coalition government, and it is interesting to reflect on a number of initiatives taken by the previous coalition government in repatriation, such as the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service and the creation of the modern Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 (c) seeks to clarify the definition of eligibility of British or Commonwealth veterans by focusing specifically on the minimum condition of an award, that being a campaign medal, as opposed to the slightly broader definition of the Defence Service Medal, which would pick up many British veterans who in fact never left the shores of Britain until after the war when they came to Australia and may now have an eligibility following the ruling of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) quite recently. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe in legislation by stealth. I do not believe that this matter should be tucked away and not given any publicity for fear that more people will apply. The determining system has to face up to the responsibility of dealing with those applications. The Government must face up to the responsibility and the position does need to be clarified. That is the point of this clause. We have to realise-I have discussed this at length with veterans' organisations-that on any objective assessment of the circumstance arising after the AAT ruling there would be a more generous availability of service pensions for British veterans paid by the Australian Government than for Australian servicemen, should clause 11 (c) be deleted from the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very conscious, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you are one who falls in the category of having served his country in a time of war. Having served in the theatre of war in the northern parts of Australia, in fact you do not have an eligibility for a service pension. There are many people in that category. I know that it would be improper for me to dwell on the personal circumstances of Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA> There are thousands of Australians who served their country in World War II but who have not qualified for a service pension. It is often listed on various priority requests. It is a matter which, in a perfect situation, the Government of this day and the coalition government of the next day would very much like to address. But in the situation facing this Parliament this night, the objective assessment has to be that the deletion of clause 11 (c) from the Bill would in fact create a circumstance which has not existed in the main in the past because the parent Act refers to campaign medals. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not delay the House by going into specific definitions but this is something that I have no hesitation in highlighting to the House because, right at this moment, the McGirr inquiry, which was appointed by this Minister and this Government, is looking into the entitlements of allied veterans, Commonwealth veterans and merchant marine personnel, many of whom are ex-prisoners of war and are yet to get coverage under the Veteran's Entitlements Act. That inquiry is due to report, under the official terms of reference, by 1 September this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with that in mind that the coalition has circulated an amendment to clause 11 (c) to provide simply a slight alteration not to the fundamental dynamics of the clause but to its commencement date to provide that it cannot be proclaimed in effect to a date some time after 1 January 1990, that is, after we have the benefit of the McGirr report. While McGirr has, in her role as the officer conducting that inquiry, given an indication in a letter, which was kindly made available by the Minister, that her inquiry may not deal with this particular aspect in any detailed way, she has given a further indication in relation to the possible contents of her report. We still do not have the benefit of that report. We still do not have the benefit of those recommendations. I feel quite strongly about this, and the coalition, having weighed this matter, feels that to provide this new tight definition in respect of a service pension, when the Government has its own official inquiry proceeding at this time, is an unwise approach, an unfair approach and, at the very least, the Government should accept our amendment so that the same Bill can go through the Senate without delay so that the Namibia repatriation cover will be adopted. It is a minor amendment in one sense. It merely alters the commencement date. I shall speak to it in a little more detail at the committee stage but, in the broad sense, that is what we are all about. We want the Government to give us the benefit of its report and the recommendations under the McGirr inquiry. This Parliament, this nation, deserve that much. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other aspect of clause 11 (c) and I am wondering whether I can draw this to the Minister's attention. It relates to the provisions whereby, under the commencement date, the Commission and the Department of Veterans' Affairs cannot go back and take a service pension away from a British or Commonwealth veteran by virtue of the provisions of this legislation. What I invite the Minister to do is provide an assurance in response that not only is that not the intention of the Government but also in fact that there is no provision for the Minister to do that by virtue of the commencement date of the provisions of this legislation. That would help address our concerns in relation to the more detailed aspects of clause 11 (c). This is a tiny clause, tucked away in the small print of this Bill, but one which I quite properly draw attention to as this Parliament considers this legislation tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill being dealt with tonight in this cognate debate, which the Opposition helped facilitate, is the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill. This relates to the defence service home loans scheme which received a fair jolt this afternoon when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) responded to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on personnel wastage in the Defence Force-the Cross report. Those who have the benefit of printed copies of the Minister's response and the creation of a new post-May 1985 defence service home loans scheme for enlistees ought to be aware at the outset that there is a typing error on page 8 of the report that was made available to the House as the official response. At first this created some confusion. The error is in the fourth paragraph under the heading `Post May 1985 Housing Assistance'. I raised it with the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). He kindly pointed out that that has now been corrected. I quote the paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> For example, a 16 per cent market rate would mean a subsidised loan interest rate of 9.6 per cent. Loan subsidies will be available for a maximum of 25 years. The maximum subsidy period is 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly in conflict. The word `subsidies' should have been deleted so that it read:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Loans will be available for a maximum of 25 years. The maximum subsidy period is 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that because there has been a lot of confusion about the defence service home loans scheme. We have had $215,000 paid to just one consultant. I acknowledge the Government's right to appoint a consultant and I acknowledge the capability of the consultant. But equally I query the size of the amount paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill will ensure that the portability provisions of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Act 1988 do not inadvertently include eligible veterans who have previously discharged their loans. In effect it will tighten up on double dipping. It will fix up problems relating to certain estate circumstances. It will broaden the definition of the term `annual report' so that the Defence Service Homes Corporation's reporting procedures are in line with other Commonwealth government procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition unreservedly supports the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill but, as I mentioned, we will move an amendment to clause 11 (c) of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill during the Committee stage. We wish our Namibia United Nations Transitional Assistance Group troops every onward success in their important and dangerous work on behalf of this nation and the world. We commend the fact that the repatriation cover provisions have been backdated to the date of commencement of Australia's involvement in Namibia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before calling the honourable member for Burke, the Chair will steal a moment of the House's time to make an observation, perhaps a plaintive observation. There was a time when the Chair would have been obliged to rule an honourable member out of order when the honourable member, in the course of his remarks, made specific reference to clauses and features of the Bill as distinct from making general comments on it. I make the observation simply to put it on record that the Chair is not being consciously derelict. The fact is that because of the insidious process of gradualness the practice has developed, both in Ministers' second reading speeches to Bills and, possibly as a consequence, in speeches by other honourable members of the House. Standing Orders in fact do not permit it but it has become practice. I just draw the attention of the House to that particular point without wishing to be critical of any particular honourable member.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer to the particular clause as we go along. I welcome the contribution of the shadow spokesman for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). I accept the spirit in which he made his contribution and the spirit in which the Opposition on the whole is supporting the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill. It is pleasing to see a joint approach, particularly in sensitive areas such as the entitlements of our defence forces when they perform these roles overseas. There are a couple of comments made by the honourable member for Farrer that I want to pick up and correct. Before doing so I make the point that the role of our peacekeeping force in Namibia is not only an important one but also one that all Australians should understand is fraught with difficulty. Our troops in Namibia will have to carry out their task with professionalism and sensitivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) said in his second reading speech, recent events in Namibia indicate that the transition to independence will remain fraught with difficulty. There have been armed clashes in the early stages of the implementation of the United Nations plan and some members of the Australian contingent have been called on short notice to man assembly points on the border. So there is a continuing danger. It is in that context that I want to make some comments, brief though they will be, on this Bill tonight. </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer, in his contribution, picked up the fact that there are components of the legislation that have a retrospective application to the date when the forces set forth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend knows, it happens from time to time. One has to remember that on the other side of the House there is often a deliberate obstructive process. This makes it difficult not only in the House of Representatives but also in the other place. We are seeing this occur again tonight. Last night we were here until midnight dealing with a whole lot of amendments. I have no doubt that this will go on. If the Opposition is going to come into the House-I do not in any way say that this is relevant in this particular case-and continually bring forward often spurious amendments, and also do so in the Senate, of course the Government's legislative program will be set back. So of course we will have situations where very sensitive legislation has to have retrospective application. To the Minister's credit, he has foreseen this situation. He has ensured that the operative date of the legislation guarantees those entitlements to the forces in Namibia. I commend him for this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer mentioned his concern about clause 11 (c). I will not go into this in any detail because I know that the Minister will do so in his summing up and in later debate. It ought to be self-evident that at the moment we have a potential anomaly. Until the inquiry is completed there is doubt about the interpretation of these clauses. Therefore, it is appropriate that, at its earliest opportunity, the Government bring forward some definitions and incorporate them in this Bill. I have no difficulty in supporting clause 11 (c) as it appears in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to make a passing comment-again, I would not have mentioned this except for the fact that it was raised by the honourable member for Farrer in his comments-about the cost to the Government of the consultant to do the analysis of the transition of the defence services home loans scheme. The process that was gone through in transferring that operation to the banking sector had to be done professionally by the Government, and it had to be done and, more importantly, be seen to be done, without favour. We went through an analysis and a comprehensive program. I tell the honourable member for Farrer this: before entering this place I had quite some experience in the banking sector. When one gets professionals in the field, no matter where they are from, to do assessments of major corporate portfolios-we are talking here about $200m to $300m worth of portfolios-one's professional assessment fees can run to several million dollars. The fee that the Government has paid is, I understand, in the vicinity of $210,000. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says that it is $215,000. I commend the Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for going out and making a good bargain. I do not have any difficulty with that point. It is not really relevant to this debate but I understand the context in which the honourable member for Farrer raised it. I do not want to appear in my support of the Bill to be carping or narkish about the contribution of the honourable member for Farrer. I respect his involvement in these areas. I make reference to a task that I have just completed with the honourable member. We worked together and I found his assistance and approach valuable and understanding. The task relates very much to what the Minister has done in this legislation in giving appropriate recognition in the formal sense and in the sense of entitlements to the forces in Namibia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of the recent inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the services required to provide ongoing support to Vietnam veterans and veterans of other conflicts post-World War II, which has led to our report After The March, we found a very real feeling about government promises, appropriate recognition and being looked after down the track. I well realise that the sorts of undertakings that were given to Vietnam veterans and veterans of Korea, Malaya and other places were not given by Labor governments. It was before our time, but it does not matter. The fact of the matter is that when our defence forces participate in these exercises, governments of all persuasions make guarantees. Having made those guarantees, all of us in this place have an obligation to make sure they are carried through, that they are recognised, with no argument, as first cab off the rank. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Minister on having got this legislation into the House. In the context of our other studies and the things that we now know, it is an important part of the morale process that our peacekeeping forces and the members of the Services performing these functions know that they are getting appropriate recognition and guarantees of support. It is even more important that future governments and future members of this House realise that down the road at some stage there will be a tab to be picked up as a result of this legislation. No government in the future should shirk that or try to back away from it. To the credit of our Government, the Minister is facing up to those responsibilities from previous conflicts. I commend the Minister on the way that he is doing that. I also signal in the House tonight that, certainly for the time that I am in this place, our forces in Namibia will receive ongoing recognition in terms of support in the public sense as well as in the form of the entitlements that this Bill bestows, and they will be guaranteed those entitlements down the road. </PARA>
<PARA> In winding up, I give my personal assurance and request that all members of this House understand that when we bring legislation like this into the House and when we make the undertakings that are given in these Bills, we must be prepared to carry them through and make sure they happen. I am sure that that is something that all members of the House are happy to guarantee tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), I welcome the opportunity to provide a very large measure of bipartisan support to this legislation. I say at the outset that I agree entirely with the comment of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in his second reading speech on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 that the Government has a responsibility to ensure that its service men and women, who will bear the brunt of the country's commitment, are provided with repatriation benefits appropriate to the dangers they are likely to encounter and the tasks they clearly will have to perform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is, of course, the situation in Namibia today. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) team is in the middle of that country's difficult transition to independence and has already had to negotiate a difficult operational situation with South African forces. Minefields on the Angolan borders now pose and, will continue to create, substantial personal danger. The Opposition, therefore, strongly supports the provisions of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill whereby Namibia and specified surrounding regions are declared operational areas for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 and, housing assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 is provided to ADF members who serve with the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG) in these operational areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction, these Bills will provide disability pensions on the same basis as for other war veterans; age service pensions; free repatriation medical treatment; family cover in the case of resultant illness or death; and subsidised low interest housing loans and insurance. The Opposition particularly welcomes the starting date of 18 February 1989 for all benefits, as it was the day on which the first Australian representatives arrived in country. </PARA>
<PARA> That said, I must admit some disappointment that when the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill, covering certain entitled persons, was introduced into this place on 5 April it made no provision for our Namibian force, despite the fact that a substantial element of that force had already been in the country for some weeks. We had to wait another month for the introduction of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill before we saw evidence of the statutory coverage of benefits for the force. I accept that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) gave undertakings early in March that members of the ADF would be provided with those benefits. However, like the earlier comments of the honourable member for Farrer on these points, those undertakings are no substitute for provisions given legal effect in both Houses before the force departed. For practical reasons that may not have been possible in this case. Nevertheless, such casual treatment is indicative of a government that pays lip service to many veterans' benefits, as my colleagues the honourable member for Farrer and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) put so well in this place earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's record in those matters is poor, full of broken promises and adhockery. Bearing in mind the late hour and the need to complete today's heavy business program, I do not wish to delay the House unnecessarily. However, I must say that we see further evidence of what the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) referred to as penny pinching, miserable and narrow minded people with cash register hearts in the rhetorical, evasive and bureaucratic statement of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) earlier today in which he responded, very inadequately, in my view, to the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, tabled in this place in November last year. In particular, I refer the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), who are at the table, to pages 17 and 18 of the detailed response to specific recommendations on service housing of that report which, in part, state:</PARA>
<PARA> After considering a number of options for home ownership assistance for post-May 1985 entrants to the ADF, the Government has endorsed the introduction of a new housing loan interest subsidy scheme. This scheme has been designed to assist in retention, and give members freedom of choice in their housing needs by enhancing opportunities to buy their own homes. It will come into operation on 15 May 1991 when the first of the post May 1985 entrants reach the eligibility point of six year service. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligible members will have access to a portable subsidised housing loan of up to $40,000 with an interest subsidy to the member of 40% of the market interest rate for housing loans. For example, this would result in an interest rate of 9.6% when the market interest rate is 16%. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interest of harmony between the pre-May 1985 and post-May 1985 entrants, and to address the retention objectives, those pre-May 1985 entrants who have not yet taken up their entitlement under the existing Defence Service Homes loan scheme will be given the option of taking up the alternative assistance provided under the new scheme after 14 May 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this new scheme will provide a very strong incentive for members to remain in the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA>Bearing in mind that our Namibian force undoubtedly contains a mixture of pre- and post-1985 entrants, can the minister for Veterans' Affairs assure the House that there is no conflict between the statement made by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel on housing proposals for the Defence Force generally and the more general Namibian provisions under the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill before us this evening? If there is no conflict, I rest my case. If there is a conflict, this needs to be resolved quickly to provide an incentive the Government so rightly seeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment of the honourable member for Farrer to clause 11 (c) of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill on the commencement date of the definition of the term `service pension'. In conclusion, I join my colleague the honourable member for Farrer in wishing our Namibian force a fruitful, safe and speedy completion of its very necessary task in Namibia under the auspices of the United Nations. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on both the pieces of legislation we are dealing with tonight. The first, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, makes provision for those troops who have gone to Namibia to assist in the transition of that country to independence. They have a particularly significant task and it is gratifying to know that the Government has moved quickly to ensure that the rights of these men are upheld when it comes to matters such as defence service homes, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give some examples to the House so that honourable members know the context in which the South Africans are operating. As far back as 1957, South Africa has refused to abide by the United Nations request to allow what was then South West Africa, now Namibia, to come under the trusteeship of the United Nations. For many years the people from Namibia strove to gain independence for their nation. They formed an organisation called the South West Africa Peoples Organisation (SWAPO). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many people have died for the sake of gaining independence. We get this knee-jerk reaction from the honourable member for Gippsland that those people were terrorists. It is interesting that people who are seeking independence-freedom-in their own nation are called terrorists. There is no reference to the South Africans who, with their jack boots, have kept the Namibians in absolutely slave-like conditions. The Namibians have been in conflict since then and thousands have died-people with limited weapons against the superior weapons of the South Africans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1975, when Angola gained independence, this conflict was extended with the assistance of Cuban troops. Cuba, Angola and South Africa fortunately after many years reached an agreement in December 1988 which enabled the facilitation of the transition of Namibia to independence. The plan included a monitoring role for the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG). Australia has made its contribution which is a contingent of 305 engineers and support staff. Recent events have forced those Australian units to man assembly points along the border to enable the SWAPO irregulars to move back into Angola which has been a place of refuge. Unfortunately the South Africans have obviously been seeking them out and gunning them down as they sought to move out of Angola. This places the Australian troops in a situation of considerable peril. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been mentioned that the areas along the border are littered with mines. This imperils the lives of our troops. As we indicated, in 1979 the United Nations Security Council resolved that independence be established for Namibia. In 1979, through the Fraser Government, Australia made the initial commitment to send an Australian contingent to assist in the establishment of self-rule in Namibia. I think it is a sad commentary on the intransigence of the South African Government that it has taken so long to actually come to the table and agree that this very sad chapter in the history of the people of South West Africa, now Namibia, would be brought to a reasonably happy solution. </PARA>
<PARA> The first Australian representatives arrived in Namibia on 18 February 1989. Our responsibility is to ensure that the service men and women who will face these risks in Namibia and the environs will be provided with the repatriation benefits that are appropriate to the dangers that they are likely to encounter and the tasks that they will have to perform. These are provided under schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government for the way in which it has met the responsibility of this nation so readily. If on their return to Australia service men and women find themselves in a position of being able to qualify under the normal conditions they will receive repatriation benefits. I will make an aside on this matter while the Minister is in the chamber. I would like the Minister to take this matter on board and raise it with the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). I have received correspondence over time seeking permission for Australian troops that were in United Nations peacekeeping forces to be able to wear the medals of the United Nations. I am very happy to be able to say that that appears to have been resolved with the Sinai troops. I hope that a principle can be established whereby whenever Australian troops are involved in peacekeeping forces they will automatically be in a position to be able to wear the medallions on their return. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time that I have left I would like to make comments about the major amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act which were brought in during the last session. There have been a couple of minor anomalies. Honourable members will be aware that the new arrangements included the sale to the Westpac Banking Corporation of the defence service homes mortgage portfolio and the right to make defence service homes loans. This was worth about $1.4 billion to the Commonwealth. There are some very important aspects of this which we ought to bring to the attention of the House and to those listening to the broadcast who can take advantage of it. As we are aware, previously it took at least 10 months for someone to gain a defence service homes loan. This meant he had to take out a mortgage, which would have cost him about $2,500 then and possibly somewhat more now. This enables the transaction to be completed very rapidly, so that it is far more convenient. Not only does it save the Commonwealth money; it also saves money for those people who are seeking loans. It enables them to overcome the frustration which certainly occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The main point of the Bill is that it deals with the issue of portability. We know that those people who gained loans subsequent to 9 December 1987 had the privilege or the right to take advantage of portability of their loans so that if they moved from one house they could take that loan with them. People who had a loan prior to that period have had to seek special permission from the Minister. There are set conditions for this; it is not that simple. The portability applies to those people who have received that permission. They have to receive that permission only once. Thereafter they do not have to go back to the Minister to seek permission if they wish to take out another loan. It is somewhat similar to receiving a new loan. It is a very logical thing. It means that those people who had that transaction subsequent to 9 December 1987 will be treated on a level playing field with those people who are seeking a loan for the very first time. This is a very sensible and sound measure. I commend the Minister for it. It is to be hoped that many thousands of servicemen will take advantage of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, coming from a rural electorate there is a small source of frustration. The Westpac agencies have about 1,200 outlets throughout Australia. The post office agencies number 5,400. It certainly does cause some inconvenience to people living some distance from a Westpac bank. It can even cause problems in the cities, such as my own city of Ballarat. Certainly out on the plains and in the western districts it causes a certain amount of frustration and inconvenience. I seek the Minister's support in looking for some way to resolve that problem so that those people will not be frustrated. Most of them are aware of the fact that those people seeking home loans will be able to get a loan far more readily, which is a desirable thing. I would like to think there is some way in which we can overcome this inconvenience to people who previously had access to a post office outlet and who now do not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad to get up to speak to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill because there is a lot of agreement on them. As the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and others pointed out, there are some distressing aspects of the whole subject of veterans' affairs. It is not all entirely the fault of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). He has certainly limitations in terms of the funding that he can get. He is in a similar situation to the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), who would love to be able to put into operation the report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities and all the financial projections that are supposed to take place in the implementation of that report but cannot because he cannot get the money from Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight we are discussing the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill because the Government did not get its original legislation right. Tonight we are allocating the Parliament's scarce time-apparently it is going to be a late night, although not as late as it was going to be-to considering minor technical amendments to clarify the intention of certain provisions of the original Act. Unfortunately, as has been mentioned by others, the one amendment that might have been appropriate to this Bill, an amendment to extend home loan benefits to our soldiers serving in Namibia-the Minister is probably getting tired of hearing about that-was overlooked by the Government in the drafting of the Bill and is now dealt with in supplementary amendment legislation included in this cognate debate. This amendment Bill, nevertheless, gives us an opportunity to comment on veterans' affairs and this Government's quite shoddy treatment of these men and women who served this country in war. </PARA>
<PARA> When a schoolyard bully gets caught out terrorising a smaller child because that child has been reduced to tears the bully usually responds by trying to comfort the crying child to silence him and to ensure that the adults coming to the child's aid find on arrival a caring senior who professes to be unsure of why the little one is crying or upset. As parents we have all witnessed the guilt provoked affection of a bully. In the statement brought down in April by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) we witnessed a similar guilt provoked and sudden affection for the veteran and pensioner victims of this Government's heavy-handed economic management. Just as in the schoolyard, neither the victim nor the witnesses to the victim's distress will be fooled by the bully's sudden turnabout and concern. We all welcome the decision to bring forward the indexation of veterans' affairs pensions. We welcome the indexation of guardians' allowances and orphans' pensions. We welcome the additional pensions for children of service pensioners and increases in pensioner tax rebates. We welcome restoration of the defence force retirement and death benefits scheme cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> These decisions do not make up for the harsh treatment dished out over the last six years to veterans by this Government-not necessarily by the Minister, who, I believe, does have a compassionate heart and is trying to do his best to help the veterans. As I said earlier, he is hamstrung by the lack of commitment of the Cabinet in this regard. The Government cannot heal the deep sense of hurt and cynicism that this Government's dishonourable conduct has engendered amongst veterans. As I said on another occasion, it is that hurt and cynicism which has generated movements such as Grey Power. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me recall the litany of cutbacks which preceded the April statement's compensation for veterans and war widows. Travel allowance was reduced by half to a flat 11.6c per kilometre in 1985, particularly affecting country veterans. There has been only a small increase since then. Subsistence allowance, including meals and accommodation, was reduced substantially for veterans, resulting in less government expenditure in this area of nearly $500,000. There has not been that big a dropoff in the number of veterans who are requiring these services. Under the dental scheme, four categories of treatment have been limited to a maximum of $300 annually, with no consumer price index adjustments on which I can find any information. </PARA>
<PARA> Totally and partially incapacitated pension criteria have been tightened up and veterans in the retirement phase of their lives are no longer eligible for TPI. Provision was made for termination of dependants' allowance by commutation, albeit on a voluntary basis, and for no further increases in the dependants' allowance. War widows and their dependants, as well as service pensioners with their fringe benefits, will no longer have access to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 a 2 per cent cut in Defence Force retirement benefit pensions was imposed, along with a six-week deferment from early November 1986 of the consumer price index related increases for veterans' pensions. From 1 January 1988, a $5,000-plus statutory patient contribution was imposed on veterans in nursing homes for war-related conditions. There has been a series of cutbacks in the list of drugs available under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, along with an increase in the number of drugs requiring prior authority. This has added greatly to the administrative burden. </PARA>
<PARA> That litany of cutbacks provided the context for the April economic statement, as it affected veterans. That list is the context for considerations of veterans' affairs legislation such as the Bill before us tonight. In passing, it should also be said that the very sorry conditions in our repatriation hospitals for staff and veterans alike-I include nurses-must be seen as part of the context for the consideration of the diversion of hundreds of millions of dollars to bodies like Qantas Airways Ltd, for example, because the Government will not get its social priorities right and privatise. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding my comments, I must express my immense respect-not in a pat- ronising way; it is genuine respect-for the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) for his efforts, best reflected in his speech yesterday on veterans' affairs, to draw attention to the needs and rights of veterans and ex-prisoners of war in particular. There is not a person in this building who was not impressed with that speech. I would refer anyone who wishes to understand what the veterans' affairs policy area is all about or wants to grasp the importance of all governments giving the honour and practical support our veterans are due, to the Hansard report of the contribution made by the honourable member for Reid. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports the Bill. However, because it believes that the relationship between government and our veterans and their widows and children should be an honourable one, it takes this opportunity to stress the disappointing record of the Government in veterans' affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1989, I too take the opportunity to pay a tribute to my good friend the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) for his contribution yesterday. It was a remarkable performance which obviously affected honourable members who heard the speech in the House. Fortunately, I was able to see part of it in my room and I too was most impressed. Many members have paid tribute to the honourable member. We all realise that he is a man who over the years has been a fighter and a person who sticks by his convictions. I feel that both sides of the House have a great respect for the honourable member because of his contribution over the years to the work of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essence of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill is to replace section 19 of the principal Act. The purpose of the amendments would ensure that any previous assistance a person may have received under the Defence Service Homes Act 1988 to purchase or build a home is taken properly into consideration in determining the entitlement of that person to any further assistance under the Act for that purpose and the amounts and terms of any such assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments in the Bill are mainly of a minor cosmetic nature and tidy up the Act in line with other Commonwealth legislation. As the excellent Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) point out in his second reading speech, since 9 December 1987 veterans, members and ex-members of the Australian Defence Force have been able to receive defence service home loans which are portable from home to home. This allows people who have taken out a defence service home loan after 9 December 1987 to have any amount still owing on that loan immediately before its discharge re-loaned for the subsequent purchase of a new home. The arrangement which applied in all cases before 9 December 1987 was that the approval of the Minister had to be obtained before the balance of the defence service home loan could be re-loaned to purchase a new home. This arrangement continues to apply to borrowers who received their loans before 9 December. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued that the Act does not require that ministerial approval be obtained for the re-use of the balance of a defence service home loan where the loan was discharged before the vesting of the Defence Service Homes Corporation's assets in the Westpac Banking Corporation. Again, it would appear from the earlier Act that any person who has received ministerial approval for the re-use of the balance of a loan must seek such approval again for any subsequent use of any remaining balance of the loan for the purchase of another home. As the Minister has indicated, neither of these possible interpretations was intended; hence the necessity for the amendments outlined in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be folly for members on this side of the House to say that the defence service home loan scheme is a perfect scheme. It does have its warts. Certainly, the involvement of the Westpac Banking Corporation in the scheme has aroused the ire of many of the older ex-servicemen. They are particularly annoyed that their mortgages have been transferred without any attempt to obtain their consent to the transaction. I have taken up this matter with the Minister on a previous occasion. Whilst I have a deal of sympathy for their attitude, the legislation has been changed and for a new person seeking a defence service home loan there will be the distinct advantage of having just one loan-not two, with the second loan often being at a very high rate of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I feel that Westpac is showing less sensitivity to the individuals who apply to it for a loan than was the case under the previous scheme. I have been involved personally with one or two cases which support that view. I support the point made by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren), namely, that Westpac, with its fewer agencies, places the ex-serviceman at a greater disadvantage than was previously the case, when ex-servicemen could repay the loans at the nearest post office. Certainly, this nation has a prime responsibility for caring for those people who have served in the defence services of the Commonwealth. Recently, members of the House attended Anzac Day ceremonies, in all parts of the Commonwealth. We were able to participate in those ceremonies, to pay our respects to those people who made the final sacrifice on behalf of their country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in the light of the debt that we owe to those who served in our defence forces that I commend the recently completed report by Major-General Morrison, a repatriation commissioner. This report examines the future needs of veterans and war and defence widows who are eligible for treatment under section 5 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The main recommendations are: first, Veterans' Affairs staff should be more accessible to veterans and war widows in the community by setting up regional offices in centres with high numbers of ex-service men and women; secondly, future health care arrangements for veterans and war widows should include social support as well as medical care, particularly for clients who are entitled to treatment and may be at risk of admission to nursing homes, hostels or long term hospital care; thirdly, the Department of Veterans' Affairs should be able to arrange, if it is medically necessary, services additional to those available under the home and community care (HACC) program run by the Department of Community Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA> Major-General Morrison points out that at this time the majority of our veterans and war widows are over 65 years of age but that within the next 10 years the majority will be over 75 years of age. By the year 2000, 66 per cent of those who have a treatment entitlement will be 70 years of age or older. Many will be classified as frail aged. It is this latter group, the 70s and over, who have the greater need for health care. Major-General Morrison states that the quality of community care and other services for veterans and war widows in the community needs to be improved to meet the needs of those aged 70 years or more. Certainly as most of these veterans and war widows would be holding mortgages obtained before 9 December 1987 I trust the Minister will be sympathetic to those with a defence service home loan who wish to give up a house which has become too big for them to manage to move into a retirement village. With my knowledge of the present Minister, I am sure he will. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay a tribute to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for its encouragement and provision of seeding grants for joint ventures. There are more than 250 of these joint ventures throughout Australia. They are aimed at providing services which help veterans and war widows remain independent in their own communities. They are projects run by ex-service organisations. These projects include home and garden maintenance services, wood provision, telelinks for blinded veterans, dog clubs, transport assistance for the frail aged and a friendly visitor service. I strongly support the continued seeding by the Department of those and similar projects. They all serve to assist those aged veterans and war widows to stay in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the April economic statement included benefits for over 500,000 clients of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. These benefits include bringing forward the indexation of Veterans' Affairs pensions, introducing indexation of guardians' allowances and orphans' pensions, increasing additional pensions for children of service pensioners and increasing the pensioner tax rebate. I am also pleased to note that the 2 per cent discount on Defence Force retirement benefits and Commonwealth superannuation scheme pensions made in the 1986-87 Budget will restored to the advantage of many veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill itself, the amendments help to clarify the intention of the original Act. They are necessary to avoid the confusions that could occur if the Act was unamended. I therefore support the Bill before the House. </PARA>

Since becoming the Minister for Veterans' Affairs I have asked the Department to find out and tell me where there is a better system. There are only two countries in the world-and I am happy to admit this-where certain categories of veterans are looked after in a better way than happens here but overall these countries do not have a better system. Those categories-the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) mentioned this-are ex-prisoners of war in the United States of America and Canada and merchant mariners. Overall, our repatriation system is better. There is none better. I challenge any honourable member in this House to tell me where there is a better one. We would be happy to take any of the points they make on board. I can assure the House of that. Opposition back-benchers should be careful what they say after reading the paper the honourable member for Farrer gives them. I know they are all genuinely interested in the veterans' community, but they should be very careful what they say. I recommend that they read the speech made by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) today. She spelt out all of the things that this Government has done for the veterans' community.

He should not do that because he is a veteran himself and he should know better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take on board what the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar), who is a Deputy Speaker, told me about the second reading debate. In responding I will try not to refer specifically to clauses. The honourable member for Farrer and the National Secretary of the Returned Services League (RSL) have questioned the timeliness of certain aspects of the Bill. I refer to a clause which defines the campaign medals which would grant certain persons qualifying service and therefore render them eligible for a service pension. The Opposition has indicated that it will move an amendment to defer the date of the effect of the amendment proposed. It argues that this action is based on the fact that the findings and recommendations of the current inquiry into the needs of Commonwealth and allied veterans-the McGirr inquiry-could very well impact on the proposed operation of this clause. The RSL has claimed that the clause would remove existing entitlements. The fact of the matter is that the clause would formalise an intention based on the understanding that no allied or Commonwealth veteran would receive greater benefits than Australian veterans. Under current legislation, this situation could arise and be a genuine cause for concern among Australian veterans. I will return to this matter when the Bill is discussed in committee. I thank all honourable members for their contributions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to highlight to the committee clause 11, which relates to the meaning of `qualifying service'. The Opposition has no objection to clauses 11 (a) and 11 (b), which provide the backdating of the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG) repatriation cover to 18 February 1989. Whenever the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill is passed, that repatriation cover will be backdated to the date when Australian soldiers went from Australia to Namibia. The controversy relates to clause 11 (c). Much of it has been discussed in the second reading stage of the debate, so I will not dwell on it other than to raise three additional specific points. In his summing-up the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) said that it was not the Government's intention to take away an eligibility for service pension where already granted. I welcome that dimension of an assurance from the Minister, but it stops short of saying categorically that, in accordance with this legislation, the Government will not take away any existing service pensions granted to Commonwealth or allied veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The hour might be late, but I think the Parliament must get its legislation right and there must be a very clear cut understanding. What I invite the Minister to do, in response to these remarks, is consider tightening up that phraseology. It is a phrase that leaves a measure of doubt. On the basis of legal research and because of the way it is constructed in the parent Act, I believe that there is no problem in this area. But it would be helpful if the Minister could make a more definitive statement and not just shelter behind the phrase, `It is not the Government's intention'. I hope the Minister will pick that up, and I will not delay the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in the two page letter which the Minister sent to the Returned Services League of Australia in relation to cause 11 (c) in this quite important Bill, he said in the second paragraph on page 2:</PARA>
<PARA> There are 6,620 British Commonwealth ex-service personnel aged 60 to 64 years currently receiving service pensions. If this number was to double as a consequence of admitting all holders of a defence medal, the cost would be in the order of $60m to $70m a year in service pensions alone. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the committee that one cannot predict that that number would double in that circumstance. I could develop the reasons for saying that at some length, but I believe that that is a bold and bald statement. I highlight the statement to the committee because to put that sort of cost tag on the interpretation of the eligibility for Commonwealth service pensions may not be remotely accurate. The committee needs to know that. Finally, on the whole question of eligibility, the coalition accepts that it would be wrong to create a situation which is more generous to British veterans here in Australia than to Australian veterans. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) summed it up very well when he said that there are Australian veterans who have the return from active service badge given to them by the Government but who do not have an eligibility for a service pension. They wear the official return from active service badge, but they do not have an eligibility for a service pension. That needs to be highlighted. It is an anomalous situation. If the world were perfect and if resources were unlimited or more readily available, certainly the government of the day, whichever party was in power, would seek to redress that. But in the current circumstances the House is addressing an eligibility for British veterans and not Australian veterans, and that ought to be clearly understood in relation to clause 11 (c). It is merely British Commonwealth veterans who have come to Australia, established their 10 years residency and then applied for service pension. There is a need to clarify the definition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment to clause 11 (c) provides no interference with the Government's program and the essential thrust of what the Government is on about, but does provide a holding up of the commencement date until such time as we have the benefit of the McGirr inquiry into the whole area of Commonwealth and Allied veterans' entitlements and the Merchant Navy. I believe the amendment is sensible. It is a very responsible approach without interfering with the fundamentals of the Government legislation and the desire of all sides of Parliament to get the repatriation cover for Namibia through. So in providing for this campaign medal definition in specific terms, I believe that the Government would be wise to accept the Opposition's amendment at this eleventh hour. I commend it to the committee and formally move the amendment standing in my name:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before dealing with clause 11 (c), I do not know what the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) is concerned about, but I can state quite categorically that the Government will not take any pension entitlements established before the commencement of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite strange for the honourable member for Farrer not to understand. Once I give my word in this Parliament, the Opposition has got my word and the Government's.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government does not support the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. Now that I am allowed to refer to clause 11 (c), may I say that the purpose of this provision is to define the relevant campaign medals. These form the basis for service pension eligibility of Commonwealth veterans who rendered service in a theatre of war within the country of their enlistment during the Second World War. The effect of not defining these medals would be to grant pensions to veterans who have not satisfied the basic standards of danger that apply to all other veterans. The honourable member for Farrer knows that. This would have the effect of placing an additional burden on the already constrained resources and would reduce the Government's ability to direct benefits to new initiatives for the veterans' community. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Government's amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act has arisen because, after nearly 15 years of consistent interpretations of the qualifying service provisions, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) has recently overturned the established intention of the Act. The AAT has decided that a British defence medal constitutes a relevant campaign medal for Commonwealth veterans who served within Britain during the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of honourable members and of anyone else listening to the debate, I should like to give a brief background to the service pension. This is an income support payment to veterans, paid five years earlier than the social security age pension, in recognition of the intangible deleterious effects of a particular standard of service. For all Australian veterans, that standard requires that they have incurred danger from the hostile forces of the enemy. In 1975, when the service pension was extended to Commonwealth veterans, the requirement of incurred danger applied to those who had served outside their country of enlistment. The campaign medal criterion applied to home service was intended to imply a standard no less rigorous than incurred danger. I stress that this was a minimum standard. </PARA>
<PARA> The conditions of award of a defence medal, as the Opposition spokesman-the honourable member for Farrer-knows well, do not require the recipient to have incurred danger. There are many examples of service during the Second World War which would qualify a person for the defence medal on the basis of three years' home service in uniform. That would involve no real danger. The Government recognises that there may be deserving cases amongst defence medal holders, but that does not change the fact that the campaign medal criterion was introduced in 1975 to set a minimum requirement. The repatriation legislation then in force made it quite clear that Commonwealth veterans were to be eligible for service pensions on no less generous standards than the veterans of our own defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition spokesman is concerned about the original intention of the legislation, let him address that concern in the proper way-by a new policy measure, which the Government would consider in the usual budgetary context. Instead, the Opposition spokesman brings forward a proposal to postpone-not omit, but postpone-the definition of `campaign medal'. He does not actually oppose the provision; he merely wishes to delay its application until the McGirr inquiry into Commonwealth and allied veterans brings down its findings later this year. In short, he wants to have two bob each way. In the meantime, he is apparently relying on the Repatriation Commission to continue to apply the existing policy, which he knows perfectly well is the correct one. </PARA>
<PARA> I adjure honourable members to support the provisions of clause 11 (c). To do otherwise would be to admit to service pension cover a group which has never been entitled to that benefit and offend all those veterans who are justly entitled to it. I do not believe that the honourable member for Farrer has his heart in this amendment. I think that he is putting it forward because he made a promise to some person or persons and is trying the Government on. He complained earlier tonight that we were not doing the right thing and that we were not hurrying enough with this legislation. Once again, that was putting a slur on the officers of the Department. I thank those officers, and I thank the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and all the officers of his Department, for having this legislation before Parliament at this early time. I just want to say that the persons behind the scenes do a great job and sometimes they do not get any thanks. This legislation is introduced to protect the veterans' entitlements and I hope the honourable member for Farrer agrees to that. </PARA>

We were seeking a much tighter wording. The Minister has deleted the words `it is not the intention' and has replaced them with a categorical assurance. That much is welcomed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, at no stage-neither today nor at other times-have I reflected on the officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Nor have I reflected on the consultant who carried out the $215,000 consultancy for the transfer of the Defence Service Homes Corporation home loan to the Westpac Banking Corporation. He is a very capable person and the Government required a consultant. I make that very clear to the committee. I proffered no reflection on those officers. But, equally, I have a right to stand up here and query the timetable for this legislation when the commitment with respect to the contingent with the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group in Namibia has been known about by the Government for a lengthy period. It has been in the planning pipeline for, not weeks, not months, but years, and here we are, three months after the troops have actually left Australia for Namibia, discussing their repatriation cover. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 deals with Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI) and provides for a transitional period of six years for certain State and Territory requirements, such as land usage, dangerous goods, licensing of activities and some other minor matters. The Opposition is not opposed to this Bill and does not proffer any amendments to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I speak I am conscious that, some time ago, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) had indirect responsibility in this area in the previous coalition Government, particularly with regard to the Mulwala Explosives Factory. He was the member for the electorate in which that magnificent facility was situated and he had ministerial responsibility for it for a period. I am also conscious that today the Mulwala Explosives Factory is in the electorate of Farrer. It is the subject of a major boost from this Government with regard to the decentralisation of facilities from Melbourne to Mulwala under the rationalisation of explosive factories of Australia or REFA project. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a welcome, sensible and constructive boost to decentralisation. Not only is valuable land being released in Melbourne and not only is it classic decentralisation which will provide more jobs in the economic region based along the Murray Valley, but also it is good value in terms of explosives production as there will be more efficient, effective and cost benefit advantages, through the green fields site which exists at Mulwala, for a very big expansion of the Mulwala Explosives Factory. Construction is currently proceeding at a price of some $80m. So it is a very big project. </PARA>
<PARA> Indirectly, it relates to the Bill before the House. I will not dwell on it at length, other than to say that, clearly, Australia needs to have maximum efficiency with its defence support resources. Of course, explosives are central to defence support. Equally, many of the other facilities detailed in this legislation play their part in maintaining the viability of the defence forces of Australia. The honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) will develop some aspects of this in the course of the debate on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is food for thought that, some 101 years ago, Australia first established a colonial ammunition company. Here we are, 101 years later, fine tuning the operation of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd and providing in the legislation a sunset clause to ensure that the exemptions granted by this Bill will not run on forever but will be specifically terminated under the terms of the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, no country can take defence for granted. No country can take its security for granted. I had the privilege of serving in our armed forces between 1966 and 1969. That left me deeply conscious of the need for defence logistics, the defence support resources of Australia, to be boosted and equated to the efforts of the armed forces to provide the capability that we require for meaningful security for our great country in a region which is becoming increasingly turbulent and volatile, as we have seen in events in recent months, especially in the South West Pacific but also elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Just in passing, in that context I have to say again that I am concerned that we now have on the western edge of our region the fourth largest army in the world-the Indian army. That army had some notable successes last year against the Maldives and previously in land conquests. In fact, right now a very tense situation exists between the giant nation of India and the tiny, landlocked nation of Nepal. Honourable members might argue that that is only of passing interest to Australia and especially to this legislation. But I would say to the House that we have to take a much deeper interest in our region and in the emergence of India as a country with the fourth largest army in the world, as a military power of considerable consequence, and also in the relationship between India and its neighbours which in turn affects Australia and our relations with our neighbours. We have a situation of some delicacy between India and Nepal with the closing of trading posts and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not detain the House at this late hour, other than to say that the Opposition is not opposed to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. We support its provisions. We commend the sunset clause aspect of the matter. We know that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) has certain sensitivities with regard to components of Australian Defence Industries in his electorate and was exposed by Senator Julian McGauran, I think, to certain views about the future of that factory. We welcome the contribution which he is about to give. I know the honourable member for Casey will listen to every word that he says in that regard. I reaffirm that the Opposition does not oppose this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill which arises from the transfer of defence production facilities to Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI). The Bill is a relatively straightforward piece of legislation and it provides in simple terms for an exemption for ADI from certain State and Territory charges which might otherwise apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday in this House the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) made a detailed ministerial statement regarding Australian Defence Industries. The changeover to Australian Defence Industries represents a massive change for Australian defence production facilities. It ensures that our defence facilities will be commercially oriented and global in outlook. They are changes which seek to make our defence facilities more competitive and better able to contribute to Australia's defence and industrial efforts. It should go without saying that the more competitive and outward looking our defence industries are, clearly the better their prospects for a secure and strong future. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who believe that our defence industries should have remained in the cocoon of a heavily subsidised and protected industrial structure should carefully analyse their thinking. Defence capacity and self-reliance are closely linked to industrial capacity. The more competitive our industrial capacity, the greater the contribution which can be made to defence self-reliance. This is perhaps a truism. However, some detractors of the ADI changeover fail to understand or to recognise this fundamental fact. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Hawke Government won office in 1983, the average level of local content in new equipment acquisitions was about 30 per cent. Because of the improvements in efficiency which have already been achieved over the past six years, that figure has now reached 59 per cent. In other words, improved competitiveness has enabled our domestic defence industries to double their contribution to new equipment acquisitions and equipment. With the changes brought about through ADI, coupled with the submarine project already under way and the forthcoming frigate projects, the Government confidently expects that a figure of 70 per cent local content will be achieved by the 1990s. I believe that this is a momentous achievement and is one which unfortunately tends to be glossed over or ignored by those who oppose the transfer to Australian Defence Industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make a few brief points in tonight's debate about the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. I have been very clearly, and continue to be, a strong supporter of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. When I was elected in 1983, that factory was underequipped and heavily subsidised and it exported very little of its product. Under this Government, new equipment, facilities and technical laboratories have been provided and the factory is considerably more competitive than ever before. As to the future, I hope that the factory can become even more efficient and market oriented and that it can provide the maximum possible level of job opportunities in the Bendigo area. In my view, these two objectives are not exclusive. Indeed, to the contrary; the more efficient the factory the greater its potential to win domestic and export contracts in the future, hence to improve its work load and employment levels.</PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me greatly that, at a time when virtually every major political party and economic commentator in Australia recognises the need for our economy to become more efficient and export oriented, a National Party senator, Senator Julian McGauran, has made repeated forays into the Bendigo area to express his vehement opposition to the changeover to Australian defence industries. Senator McGauran and some other members of the National Party, I believe, apparently want to return the factory to the bad old days of under-equipment, heavy subsidies, and an inward-looking marketing strategy. There should be no doubt about this-what they want in reality is to sentence the Bendigo Ordnance Factory and other defence establishments to a slow but inevitable death. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be clearly understood that Senator McGauran's recent sojourns into Bendigo have absolutely nothing to do with a genuine interest in the welfare of workers at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. In fact, quite the opposite is true. As those who follow political events would be well aware, the good senator has been desperately scrambling to try to maintain a place on a joint Liberal-National Party Senate ticket. The support of National Party members in central Victoria has been crucial to that effort and he has been prepared to say and do just about anything in Bendigo to gain publicity. In effect, the good senator has been prepared to say anything to try to save his political neck. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, one would have to say that his efforts have been somewhat unsuccessful. The senator's prescription for the Bendigo Ordnance Factory is a recipe for certain disaster. It comes, as has been noted in debates in this House before, from a gentleman who took seven years to complete his economics degree and whose former employment before being bankrolled into this place was as a bookie's penciller. </PARA>

In his desperate splurge of publicity, Senator McGauran has recently claimed that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory would be swallowed up by the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to a question without notice which I directed to the Minister for Defence in this House on 2 May, I am pleased to say that the Minister made it absolutely and emphatically clear that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory was not about to be swallowed up by the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory. Indeed, the Minister made it clear that, under this Government, the Bendigo Ordnance Factory has a strong and secure future. When it comes to the crunch, despite all the wet-eyed rhetoric of the Opposition parties about micro-economic reform, the fact is that they are hopelessly incapable of delivering. It is no secret that the National Party is the worst offender. While its members always talk of the need for change in general, for our economy to become more efficient and for us to sell more exports, they are always hostile to change in particular. Their prescription for the Bendigo Ordnance Factory and their diagnosis that the best that can be done is to return it to the bad old days of under-equipment, heavy subsidies and an inward-looking strategy, are a certain recipe for disaster. If it were ever implemented it would mean the inevitable closure of that factory. Despite the efforts which have been made to undo the changeover to Australian Defence Industries by certain elements in the National Party, I am certainly pleased to support this legislation and the general thrust of the changeover. It will ensure that our defence facilities, our defence factories are stronger, more efficient, more outward looking and more competitive in the future than they have ever been in the past. With those attributes they will be able to make a much greater contribution to Australia's overall defence self-reliance. I support the shift and I support the legislation before the House. </PARA>

<PARA> The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill and the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill constitute yet another example of the Government's poorly disguised privatisation program. I am advised that the preferred term is `corporation', but that is really just a euphemism for privatising that one adopts when one is not meant to be in favour of such a progressive measure. </PARA>
<PARA> As Bronwyn Young observed in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 4 April 1989, in the case of the Department of Defence, ideology appears to have given way to pragmatism. In any event, I think we all recognise that corporatisation or commercialisation or privatisation-call it what one will-is a necessity if costly and inefficient government departments are to be converted into productive, commercially-oriented, enterprises. Certainly, in the case of the former Office of Defence Production-now Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI)-the Opposition welcomes this move. Any measure which has the dual purpose of improving both the cost effectiveness and the efficiency of Australia's defence industries, and which has a good prospect of achieving those admirable objectives, deserves support. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be little doubt that our government-owned defence industries should be organised and operated on a more competitive, commercial basis, and that significant cost savings through increased efficiency and greater productivity will, or should be the result. In the last week we have seen the launching of HMAS Melbourne from the former Williamstown naval dockyard as a key element in the thrust towards attaining these higher levels of productivity and efficiency. We have seen the first major warship of any significance launched in Australian waters in more than 20 years. If that is the way defence industries are going in this country, then it is a very favourable result indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Further benefits will include an improved ability and capacity for ADI to react more quickly and appropriately to the equipment and services needs and requirements of our defence forces and the creation of new and additional export opportunities. It is an unfortunate fact of life, and a major argument in favour of the privatisation process, that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for government departments to become commercially competitive. If they are to succeed in the marketplace, they must be structured and must be allowed to operate on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation now before the House is designed to assist ADI in its quest to become a commercially oriented, competitive and viable company. In fact, it gives it a six year breathing space by exempting it from certain State and Territory laws dealing with land usage, dangerous goods or licensing of activities, or which impose taxes, charges or rates-including stamp duty-and exempting ADI employees from State and Territory firearms licensing laws. Perhaps it could be argued that six years is a rather over-generous period, and ADI Pty Ltd may be spurred on to greater efforts to improve its performance if all privileges and protections were removed at an earlier date.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the task facing the new company is not a simple one. The challenges of turning part of a government department into a company are considerable and enormously complicated and there is no guarantee of success without some initial assistance. If ADI were to fail it would have serious implications and consequences in so far as Australia's defence preparedness is concerned. It must be remembered that its primary objective is to provide specialised support to the Australian Defence Force while at the same time pursuing a new approach free from excessive political control and unnecessary bureaucratic involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> However we understand that the Auditor-General has been excluded from carrying out his normal functions in respect of ADI, except where the Minister calls for his services. I do not think we are entirely happy about that. In the movement of this Bill from this place to the other place, we will re-examine our policy in this particular respect. The Opposition first indicated its support for these changes last year and nothing has occurred in the meantime that would alter our attitude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I will be very brief. I would not have intervened but I want to respond to the last comment made by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), who has just spoken. I thank those who have participated in the debate, who were necessarily brief because of the time of night, for the contributions they made. The Auditor-General will be deeply involved in the audit associated with the Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI). Effectively a dual audit will be done. The desire to use a private auditor as well as the Auditor-General emerges from a concern in the company that it get the best business orientated audit advice. It is looking for a capacity from its auditors to get advice in a way that is clearly commercially orientated. The Australian Audit Office does not provide that but at the same time the check that is provided by the Commonwealth Auditor-General will be incorporated by his extensive involvement. It was pointed out to me-I will not actually vouch for this figure because it is one of those anecdotal things that one gets from one's departmental officers from time to time which are generally valid but one would not like to be the object ultimately of a censure motion for misleading the Parliament, given that the figure never did appear before me in written form-that whereas the headquarters of ADI has been pared down from 1,000 for the Office of Defence Production-ODP-to 35, the Commonwealth Auditor-General has 40 officials working in the establishment so that currently the Auditor-General beats the headquarters establishment. As I said that is anecdotal. I would not necessarily vouch for its accuracy in all respects, but I can vouch for the fact that the Auditor-General will effectively be doing an audit over the affairs of ADI.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;India and Nepal do not actually relate terribly deeply to this Bill. Hopefully there will be no connection, direct or indirect, in any shape or form. I am not sure how it would break down to sales. I have made a number of statements recently that we need to take an interest in all military developments in our region. One of the most interesting features of the way in which capabilities are expanding in the area is that we will, at the turn of the century, confront a region in which the power balances will have changed dramatically. We will be looking at a situation not of classic east-west balance in a bipolar system, but something which is much more reflective of nineteenth century Europe in which there are a number of competing great powers. Probably one could readily discern five. The Soviet Union and the United States will still be significant. Japan, India and China and also some fairly substantial middle powers can be discerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are beginning to lose the technological edge in military terms in this region inevitably, given the changing nature of the economies and technical proficiencies of the societies. One of the most unusual features of our Air Force, for example, is that it actually has a superiority in regional air force terms emanating from numbers as much as from technology. This is an unusual position in which Australia might find itself. Certainly one of the powers which will play a very significant role in this region will be India which is emerging as a very substantial naval power. We do not take an interest from the point of view of regarding it as a potential enemy, or whatever, but simply because prudence determines that we take an interest in all military developments in the region. The growing maritime capacity of India, along with substantial maritime capacities in China and a very extensive defence budget in Japan, is a matter which these days is of as much interest to us as the current state of Soviet-American relations. This suggests to us that we should sustain a very close interest in keeping in a reasonable state of repair those good relationships which we have established with a number of South East Asian states over the past 20 or 30 years. One thinks particularly of our friends in the five-power defence arrangements who, whilst increasingly calling the shots at the Malaysian and Singaporean end of it, are at the same time looking increasingly to Australia as the principal external participant in that operation. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an enormous deviation from the subject of the legislation, made possible under Standing Orders by the fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, that your appropriate liberal chairmanship permitted the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) to digress. I hope the initial point that I made on the Commonwealth Auditor-General has been reassuring to the honourable member for Casey. If he desires further briefing on that, I am certainly prepared to have departmental officers advise him on the status of the Auditor-General's role. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr Holding</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) People are not prevented from migrating, nor from obtaining citizenship, because they are homosexual. The procedures applying to homosexuals are identical to those applying to any other applicant: that is, for migrant entry they must satisfy policy requirements for the category under which they are applying and they must meet health and character requirements; for citizenship they must meet residential and other requirements, including a good character requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> Homosexual relationships are not equated with marriages or heterosexual de facto relationships for migration purposes. An Australian citizen or resident cannot sponsor a homosexual partner under the criteria relating to spouses and heterosexual de facto partners. Nor is the homosexual partner of a principal applicant eligible for entry as the ``spouse'' of that person.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) An individual's sexual orientation is not a relevant factor in considering an application for migrant entry and hence may not be known to my Department, and is not recorded. Hence, while it is conceivable that people who are homosexual have been sponsored by Members of Parliament in accordance with normal procedures, the incidence of this occurring is not documented.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no special program through which homosexuals may enter Australia and become citizens. However, once in Australia the homosexual partners of Australian citizens or residents may apply for the grant of resident status (GORS). In answer to the specific points of the question:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Applications for GORS on strong compassionate grounds under Section 6a (1) (e) of the Migration Act 1958 may be lodged in Australia by homosexual partners of Australian residents and citizens who have entered Australia as visitors or temporary residents. Where an application for entry as a temporary resident on the basis of such a relationship is lodged overseas, it is submitted to the Minister for personal consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Applications for GORS on strong compassionate grounds based on a homosexual relationship have been considered personally by successive Ministers since September 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The first applications were considered by the Minister at the time, the Honourable Chris Hurford.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Arrangements to consider applications of this kind were discussed by Minister Hurford with a task force made up of representatives of interested groups. The Opposition has been kept advised of these arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The following table gives details of the numbers of GORS applications lodged, approved in principle subject to outstanding requirements being met, refused and lapsed or withdrawn since September 1985.</PARA>

<PARA> The country of origin of applicants year by year is not available from material at hand but a census of the nationality of applicants at the end of November 1987 gave the following results: Danish, 2; Swedish, 4; Dutch, 2; German, 11; Swiss, 2; Greek, 1; Spanish, 4; Yugoslav, 1; Canadian, 9; American, 30; Lebanese, 1; Argentinian, 1; Brazilian, 4; Chilean, 1; Colombian, 2; Venezuelan, 1; Zimbabwean, 1; South African, 6; Chinese, 3; Hong Kong, 1; Indonesian, 5; Japanese, 12; Malaysian, 30; Filipino, 16; Singaporean, 9; Sri Lankan, 3; Thai, 14; Fijian, 3; New Caledonian, 1; Papua New Guinean, 1; Vanuatuan, 1; British, 58; Irish, 4.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the Minister currently has 4 applications before him; there are a further 121 on hand being processed by his Department before submission to him for decision.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) all applications are personally considered by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) the subject has been raised previously in Parliament, in the Press and in other forums, and members of the public who have written on the subject have had full replies to their enquiries.</PARA>
<PARA> (j) members of the public who have written opposing these arrangements have generally been under the misapprehension that homosexual partners were being equated in migration policy with spouses. This is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA> (k) the small number of persons granted resident status under these arrangements has had no effect on the number of migrants approved for entry or the number of persons granted resident status on other grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> (l) these arrangements are expected to continue. The figures given in answer to (e) above indicate that the level of applications has remained constant at round 100-120 per year.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) All people applying to enter Australia as migrants or long-term temporary residents, and all persons applying for GORS, must undergo a thorough medical and radiological examination. If indicated by the doctor's examination or the applicant's history, a test for the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) which causes AIDS would be required. Evidence of AIDS or and AIDS-related condition is cause for recommending rejection of an application.</PARA>
