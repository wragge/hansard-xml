<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Monday, 20 March 1989 of the Hon. Nelson Lemmon, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Forrest from 1943 to 1949 and for the division of St George from 1954 to 1955, and a Minister of the Crown from 1946 to 1949, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to the members of his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Nelson Lemmon was born on 22 March 1908 at Williamstown, Victoria. His father, John, held the Victorian State seat of Williamstown for the unbelievably long period of 51 years until 1955. Nelson was educated at Williamstown State School and Longerenong Agricultural College. At the age of 20 he was placed in charge of the Victorian Department of Agriculture sheep stud at Werribee. He then moved to Western Australia, where he became a successful farmer, raising fat lambs and growing wheat on land which had been condemned as useless for settlement. He married Ada Mary Jackel in 1930 and they had a son and a daughter. Before entering Federal Parliament, Nelson Lemmon was active in both local council and farming activities. He was a member of the Wheat Stabilisation Board of Western Australia from 1943 to 1944. John Curtin took an interest in the young farmer, and worked to get him into Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> When Nelson Lemmon entered the Federal Parliament in 1943 Australia was still at war in Europe and the Pacific. His maiden speech reflected a vision for a better Australia, a vision that was the hallmark of the Chifley Government in the post-war reconstruction era. He had a sincere commitment to caring about the poor and unemployed. He stressed the importance of opening tertiary education opportunities to all those with the necessary ability. He saw the importance of restructuring rural industry in the aftermath of the war. </PARA>
<PARA> It was, however, in his time as a Minister in the Chifley Government that Nelson Lemmon put his mark indelibly on the history of our nation. As Minister for Works and Housing he was responsible for the commencement of that bold, imaginative and daunting engineering feat, the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. He also foresaw the importance of environmental protection long before it became a political issue, and sought to minimise ecological damage in the scheme's planning. Perhaps more than any other initiative, the Snowy Mountains scheme showed Australians and the world that we were emerging from the dark years of war not complacently but with a spirit of enthusiasm in the face of challenge. The energy and determination of Nelson Lemmon resulted in a monument worthy of the spirit of those days. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of his portfolio responsibilities, Nelson Lemmon also put into operation a plan for the construction of war service homes, again exhibiting his extraordinary organisation abilities. As well as his role as Minister for Works and Housing, Nelson Lemmon assisted the Treasurer from 1946 to 1949. These were difficult times for the Chifley Government in its work to establish a strong post-war economy. It is an indication of the regard in which Nelson Lemmon was held that he was given this important additional role. Nelson Lemmon lost his seat in 1949 when the Chifley Government was defeated. He re-entered Parliament briefly in 1954 as the member for St George, Sydney, amid press speculation that he was a likely contender for the Labor leadership. This was, of course, the period when Labor's political fortunes entered the trough they were to occupy until 1972. Lemmon lost his seat in 1955. He retired from public life at 47 and returned to his property in Robertson, New South Wales, as a horse trainer, breeder and owner. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite Nelson Lemmon's relatively short career in public life, he played a pivotal role in Australia's postwar reconstruction. Ben Chifley himself regarded his young ministerial colleague as future leadership material. He was a dedicated member of this House at a most important time in our history and was regarded as one of Labor's best debaters of the time. He was the last surviving member of the Chifley Ministry. In that sense his death marks the end of an era, but his accomplishments live on and will, I hope and trust, provide an enduring example to us. On behalf of the Government, I extend to members of his family our sincere condolences in their bereavement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Bennelong-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports this motion and in doing so I note the point on which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) concluded his speech, that the death of Nelson Lemmon does break the final link with the Chifley era of government in Australia. To current generations of Australians Nelson Lemmon was in many respects to those who observe politics one of the figures in the True Believers television program which, albeit with some criticism, has played a part in bringing before present generations some of the characters in the political experiences of the 1940s and the 1950s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister mentioned, Nelson Lemmon's greatest political contribution was the role that he played in post-war reconstruction and in particular the inauguration and the carrying forward of the Snowy Mountains scheme which, to anybody growing up immediately after World War II, represented all that was achievable and all that was right and proper in terms of national development and forward thinking in Australia. It was a scheme that captured the imagination of people on both sides of politics and, as the Prime Minister has observed, the fact that Nelson Lemmon played such a major role in the Snowy Mountains scheme and those other things associated with post-war reconstruction is a fitting reminder of the contribution that he made to Australian politics. On behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia, I join the Prime Minister in extending our sympathy to his widow and to his son and daughter, and to those in the Labor Party who knew him well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the National Party of Australia I join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in extending condolences to the family of the late Nelson Lemmon. I think those of us who are in this place often regard our position in the scheme of things as being relevant and known to everybody in the community. I doubt if many who are here knew Nelson Lemmon, yet Nelson Lemmon's career and contribution was significant, in fact more so than, I suspect, those of many Federal parliamentarians. His father certainly held the Victorian State seat of Williamstown for an incredible 51 years. As for Nelson Lemmon himself, representing at different times seats as far afield as Forrest in Western Australia and St George in New South Wales demonstrates the flexibility and perhaps the extent to which the Australian Labor Party is prepared to give endorsement on the basis of an individual rather than his place of residence and is certainly something that is worthy of note. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said, he was the last surviving member of the Chifley Cabinet. He was Minister for Works and Housing from 1946 to 1949 in an era when few of us were about, and if we were we certainly did not play too active a part in politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In reading something of him I was fascinated to see that before entering parliament at the age of 35 he was a successful wheat and fat lamb producer from Ongerup in Western Australia. He retired ultimately from Parliament in 1955 and became a horse trainer, breeder and owner, but agriculture was his major interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I was fascinated to read that he studied at Longerenong Agricultural College and then worked as a teamster in the Mallee. At the age of 20 he took charge of the Victorian Department of Agriculture sheep stud at Werribee. After his retirement at the age of 47 he said, `Politics was something I did, but farming is my life'. On hearing that I wondered whether perhaps he was not in the wrong party. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that Nelson Lemmon's main achievements in his parliamentary career involved, as has been said, both postwar reconstruction and his contribution to the Snowy Mountains hydro-electricity scheme. However, there was one other contribution related to his farming concern that is worth mentioning and that was his prime involvement in wheat distribution in Australia during the 1944-45 drought. On behalf of the members of the parliamentary National Party I extend our sympathies to his wife, son and daughter, and commend the contribution to Australia of the late Hon. Nelson Lemmon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Thursday, 23 March, I had the sad duty of representing the Government at the funeral service of the Hon. Nelson Lemmon. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) was also there representing the Opposition. As has been said by the previous speakers, his career was of some significance in Australia. On election to this Parliament in 1943, when the Second World War was at its height, Nelson Lemmon talked about this nation on the basis of what it should be able to do once it got through the war years. As has been said, he was able to carry that out, particularly with the Snowy scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is significant that he was the last surviving member of the Chifley Ministry. He was very proud of the fact, and the Australian Labor Party must be very conscious of it, that it required the Labor philosophy, the Labor organisation, and its ability to lead the nation, to get through the Second World War and the postwar development. When one speaks to his widow one can see that that is very evident today. I am delighted to say that she is in very good health and is conscious of the great effort made by her husband. The family are also very proud of their father. It was a very sad day but a happy one in the sense that one could pay tribute to a great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to be associated with the condolence motion. I had the privilege of meeting the late Nelson Lemmon on only one occasion and that was in 1947 when I was a schoolboy in Canberra. I did not know him or his family well but my wife, Marcia, attended school with his daughter, Joan, and they were very close friends during that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to talk about the public's perception of this man. Unfortunately, because of the cut and thrust of politics, the only time we tend to concentrate on the good qualities of people in this House is on occasions such as this. There should be more occasions when we concentrate on the good qualities of people and put aside the cut and thrust of politics. But, the nature of politics being what it is, that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> As one who is a very loyal member of the Liberal Party, I want to say that as a young person I admired the public and private stance of Nelson Lemmon. He was a great Australian. He was not a person who told other people what they should do. He was a person who always led by example, and that applied to both his private and his public life. He was a person who could be referred to quite genuinely as an all-weather friend. We all have good-weather friends, but Nelson Lemmon was an all-weather friend regardless of a person's political affiliation. On behalf of my wife and myself I extend to Mrs Lemmon and her family, particularly Joan, our deepest sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to associate myself with the condolence motion. As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) said, I attended with him the funeral service of the late Nelson Lemmon in Port Macquarie, which is in my electorate of Cowper. I had the privilege of representing you, Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair), and indeed this side of the House. I took the opportunity of conveying to Mrs Lemmon and her family the pride this House took in the work he had done and our very sincere sympathy. I will not repeat what other speakers have said, but anybody in this parliamentary funny farm must be impressed by the fact that he could make the switch from the State of Western Australia to the seat of St George in New South Wales. It was a remarkable move. He then went into retirement, took up the sport of kings again and was a distinguished trainer and breeder of horses. I am pleased to have had this opportunity of conveying the condolences of the House to Mrs Lemmon.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Burke for his question. The short answer is that the Government put in place the legislative changes that we could at the end of last year. That has had a particular effect with Australian National. We have also put in place all that we could possibly do constitutionally at Commonwealth level. That has had the effect in New South Wales that the New South Wales Liberal Government is effecting changes to its grain handling system. In effect, the Premier of New South Wales wants to privatise that. The main thing that is holding him up in that State is the National Party in respect of rail freights. The Government has made all the progress that it can in other areas in trying to negotiate with the States. That reached the ridiculous situation where the States were not prepared to move complementary legislation in regard to a possible legal impediment on intrastate trade. The Government is trying to improve the efficiency of the industry, we are trying to cut the industry's costs, we are trying to give the growers a choice, and we are trying to get government out of the hair of the industry eventually, somewhat akin to what is happening in the wool industry. It is all about micro-economic reform. It is about sensible deregulation. It is about not treating growers like fools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member mentioned the word `divisive'. I find it quite distressing that there is division on the other side, but I understand that honourable members opposite have come to some sort of compromise. The spineless Leader of the Opposition and the jellyfish Liberals have caved in to the National Party yet again. There is an abundance of weak leadership opposite. When those people are not engaging in dingo tactics or opportunism they are caving in to the National Party regardless of any self-styled principle of micro-economic reform or deregulation. The Liberal Party has a long history of that in this House. We really do not need any lessons in how to understand it. It always caves in. Now it wants to put up some impossible conditions as a blind to shore up the great weakness of the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, I am just building up to that. I am not sure what the Opposition has agreed to; so let us just concentrate on what the media have said. The agreement is conditional on the deregulation of handling; deregulation of storage; deregulation of rail transport; deregulation of road transport; deregulation of the waterfront; deregulation of shipping-deregulation of the world. This is a nonsense. We do not know, of course, the exact details because the Grains Council of Australia has not seen all the legislation; so it cannot tell the Opposition what to say. We are also told now that there has to be a fair burden of restructuring. If the coalition does not think that a 30 per cent cut in tariffs, the tax change in the corporate sector, what is happening in the coal industry and what is happening with award restructuring and in other parts of this economy-what is on the agenda of this Government-do not represent restructuring of the economy, I do not know what else will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's position is not a strange one. It is one that follows any objective analysis of this industry and its needs for the years ahead as indicated by the last three Industries Assistance Commission reports, the Balderstone report that the Opposition asked for itself and the royal commission. All we are trying to do is to empower the Australian Wheat Board as a catalyst for change by giving it full commercial powers on the domestic market. The Government is prepared to work with the States. As I said, we have taken action where we can properly. The New South Wales Government has taken some action. The situation was never that bad in Western Australia and South Australia. They have good Labor governments and have effected transport reform. Queensland, of course, wishes to lock it up and Victoria has a particular situation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is quite prepared to give the Wheat Board as much power as the Constitution allows on transport, but what will be the reality of this? The reality will be that the Queensland branch of the National Party will still try to lock up the whole of the State's wheat industry. The reality will be that the New South Wales branch of the National Party will try to block everything that Greiner attempts to do in that State. Today's quasi-decision of the Opposition signals that John Howard has hoisted his colours to the mast-yellow for courage; white for the Nationals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to a report in the Australian Financial Review on Friday which suggested that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia may in the next few days raise up to $375m in offshore markets. As this massive overseas debt raising is apparently intended to boost the depleted capital base of the bank and to help finance a recent acquisition in New Zealand, can the Treasurer inform the House whether the report is correct and, further, inform the House why the Government prefers to extend the country's international indebtedness rather than allow equity contributions from domestic sources, otherwise privatisation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last part of the question, of course, gives away the fact that the honourable gentleman does not understand the external account and the principal driving force in the creation of Australian debt, which is the current account deficit, and that borrowings by Australians satisfy the needs of the economy to fund that current account deficit. Whether those borrowings are made by the Commonwealth of Australia, the State governments, the Commonwealth Bank or private companies is in a sense immaterial. The nation has to borrow to fund that current account imbalance or that incapacity to cover our costs upon our external account. Those are the dynamics of the external account. I know by the bewildered look on the honourable member's face that this must be news to him but to everyone else in the country who is interested in economics it is not news at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other issue of the Commonwealth Bank, let me make one point quite clear: during all the years the coalition Government was in office there were never any capital injections for the Commonwealth Bank. The only capital injection that has ever been made is about $150m by this Government in 1983-84. But because of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development changes in relation to the Basle agreement on bank assets against liabilities, banks are being required to change in line with those prime asset ratio requirements. These arrangements were agreed at Basle and subsequently carried forward by our own central bank. Our private banks are raising subordinated equity in order to satisfy those requirements and so too is the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Forde for the question. Today is indeed a very significant day for the health portfolio because today the Minister for Community Services and Health, Neal Blewett, becomes the longest continuous serving health Minister in Australia's history. He achieves that having served six years and 24 days continuously in the portfolio. The previous record for unbroken service as Minister for Health was held by the late Sir Earle Page, who held the portfolio for six years and 23 days, between 19 December 1949 and 11 January 1956. It is not only the length of time served which makes this record significant; it is also the quality of what has been achieved in the health portfolio during this period under the outstanding direction and leadership of the present Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's record of reform in the health area is outstanding-indeed, it is unparalleled-and, without being exhaustive, I point out that it includes the introduction of Medicare, which is the most successful health insurance scheme in Australia's history and which enfranchised the two million Australians who were without health cover under the previous Government. It involves new emphasis on disease and illness prevention through programs such as the better health program, the national campaign against drug abuse, the national AIDS strategy, and the national campaign against measles. It includes the transformation of nurse education and training from the antediluvian hospital-based system to tertiary education colleges, offering improved career opportunities to nurses as well as a better trained work force for hospitals. It includes the revolutionary changes in general practice recently agreed between the Minister and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, designed to improve the quality of patient care through continuing education and vocational registration.</PARA>
<PARA> Those are but some of the important examples of the great achievements of this Government in this area under the leadership of the present Minister. All that has been contributed by the Opposition in this period has been five health spokespersons and six failed health policies to date. I am sure that all honourable members will join with me in congratulating the Minister for Community Services and Health on becoming Australia's longest continuously serving health Minister and for helping to make this country a better place to live in.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. We spoke at Tindal about security aspects of NSCA operations from RAAF bases, the more pertinent of these being Townsville, Tindal, Darwin and Williamtown. (All of these are joint civilian/military airfields.) As NSCA operated from the civil tarmac area at Townsville, they did not require entry to the RAAF areas.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. At Tindal, entry to the `domestic' area was by a long-term visitor's pass, as is the case with other civilian contractors and employees. As is normal on joint-user airfields, they had access to `Base Operations' for flight planning purposes as required, and operated from the Air Movements tarmac, both of these areas being outside the restricted 755SQN area. They did visit 75SQN facilities for briefings on SAR matters, but were escorted in areas containing classified matter. Under the contract NSCA were provided with mess accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. At Darwin, NSCA were issued with photographic passes giving entry to the base domestic area, to Flight Planning and to the RAAF helipad tarmac from which they operated. They had access to documents dealing with SAR only.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. At Williamtown, proof of identity of NSCA personnel was by the production of NSCA photographic ID cards, with NSCA providing a listing of their employees' names. This gave entry to the domestic area, including Flight Planning. NSCA operated from their own separate section of the RAAF tarmac and had access to adjacent RAAF areas only for specific purposes associated with their duties.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Mr Friedrich is not known to have visited RAAF Townsville but undoubtedly would have visited the civil facilities from which NSCA operated. He has been an infrequent visitor to the other bases with his arrival and departures being by air and with prior RAAF approval. He would have been escorted during his stay. He had been given a standard unclassified visitor tour and F/A-18 simulator visit at Williamtown. He visited Darwin at the time of Pitchblack 1988 and was at Tindal in September last year.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. In summary, NSCA personnel were treated no differently from other contractor-employed personnel. They had access to those parts of our bases they needed to conduct their legitimate tasks, none of which required access to sensitive areas or information.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the advice to me from the Chief of the Air Staff, which I table. I think there are some misnomers abroad in the general community-perhaps the honourable member shares them-that there is a total prohibition on anybody going towards any sort of sensitive area imposed by the Services unless he goes through what is rightly a very cumbersome security clearance process. The fact of the matter is that that is not so. Plenty of uncleared people have access to those areas. They are escorted when they do so. In this instance, as the Chief of the Air Staff advises me, and I can only go on the advice I get from him, this is the case. I should say that it definitely is not a unique situation. I am advised also that each month about 1,800 of these passes, at Williamtown for example, are given to contractor employees.</PARA>
<PARA> Everybody has had great memories of the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) in the last week or so and everybody is coming out with grand stories. If people seriously believe that the advice to me from the Chief of the Air Staff and the advice to me from the people who are responsible for organising all of this is incorrect, I would appreciate their presenting to the Australian Federal Police their evidence on these matters so that it can be properly investigated, instead of wandering around the place spouting off at the top of their heads as though the Royal Australian Air Force does not know a thing or two about protecting its own security requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> I might also say something about NSCA personnel. NSCA personnel, many of whom are ex-servicemen, to my knowledge have always done their task well and professionally in the very limited contracts they have had with Defence and the much more extensive contracts they have had with other State and Federal operators. As I have said, many of them are ex-service personnel and know the requirements placed on them. The fact that apparently they have been led over the last few years by an alleged embezzler does not go to question their patriotism or capacity in any way.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as I can see, from all the advice given to me, the advice I gave the media last week was sound. I repeat that if anybody has any contrary information which suggests that the advice I have received is incorrect, then I invite them to present that advice to the Federal Police or the appropriate body.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I also thank him for the great job he does on behalf of the veterans in his community. The Government's record in veterans' affairs is a very proud one. I am very proud to be the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and very proud to serve the veteran community. The Opposition is not interested in the veteran community, and I will prove that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1983, the Budget has increased from $2.5 billion, under the Government of those opposite, to $4.5 billion under this Government. Nobody can say that we are not looking after the veterans. We have also ensured that the totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pension, once granted, is payable for life. Unless the veteran gets better or fraud is proved, TPI is payable for life. That legislation was introduced by us in this Parliament. We also introduced the new defence service housing scheme on behalf of the veteran community, in cooperation with veterans' organisations throughout Australia. We stand on our record.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I was reading in the press on the weekend what the honourable member for Wentworth had to say in relation to the veteran community. He is quoted in the West Australian newspaper of 21 March as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I live in fear of some ministries; Aboriginal Affairs and Veterans' Affairs are wastes of my talents. You aspire to see your talents used in a ministerial job effectively. Ultimately, I would like to be the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the honourable member for Wentworth believes that to be given the responsibility of looking after veterans and their interests-those Australians who fought for this country-is beneath him. I certainly hope that the Leader of the Opposition will rap the honourable member's knuckles once again, as he has done previously. It is not the first time that members of the Opposition have said that they do not care about the veteran community. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong, is also on record as saying that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, again, is directed to the Minister for Defence. In view of the Minister's confirmation that Mr Friedrich was not subject to any security clearance, despite the warnings that the Minister was given over a number of years, will the Minister explain how a document-this document-entitled `Counter Terrorism Capabilities in Australia', a confidential government report detailing Australia's anti-terrorist capabilities, came to be in the possession of Mr Friedrich?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no idea whether that document is in the hands of Mr Friedrich, what its classification is or how it was produced. If, as I said in my answer to the previous question, somebody has reason to say that the advice that we have on these matters is incorrect, that person has an obligation, and should feel absolutely free, to hand that in to the appropriate authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the alleged warnings that I have received over the years from time to time according to the honourable member. The only extensive presentation of a problem to me was put in the middle of 1986 by the Director of Skywest, Bill Meeke, in which he basically expressed the view that it seemed to him that in some way or other the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) was receiving covert funding support from intelligence agencies and/or the Department of Defence and that this was placing it in a position where it had a competitive advantage in other areas. It was also claimed that the organisation had a paramilitary quality to it. So I made some inquiries as far as that was concerned of my Department at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department advised me on 18 July 1986 that no funding was provided to the Victorian Division by the National Disasters Organisation or by any defence intelligence agency and that the director of security consulted the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), which advised that it had made some inquiries and had no reason to believe that any of the activities of the Victorian Division were untoward.</PARA>
<PARA> My office also approached ASIO directly to inquire whether anything was known against the Victorian Division of the NSCA. ASIO responded that there were insufficient grounds for an ASIO investigation of the organisation. Mr Meeke was advised of these outcomes by a member of my staff. He was further advised that the most promising avenues for further examination of the Victorian Division's finances would be through the Australian Taxation Office and through members of the NSCA board. He then professed himself satisfied to my staff about those conclusions and, in subsequent conversations with me, whilst he again referred to the Victorian Division of NSCA, he raised no new questions which required further investigation by Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> So a huge number of propositions were not put to me. Plenty of people are now saying that they had tremendously good ideas about this and that we or somebody else ought to have done something about it-that the Department of Defence ought to set up a giant accountancy system and start investigating absolutely everybody who had anything to do with it--</PARA>

<PARA>The Opposition spokesman has 20 : 20 vision at the moment on these matters as he perambulates around the country making allegations about security concerns or whatever, and alleging that I have been given repeated presentations on these matters. That is nonsense. The Opposition spokesman knows it is nonsense. If he had that sort of information presented to him, he certainly made no effort to get in contact with me about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my belief-I hope it is shared by all members of the House-that there is at this time an historic opportunity presenting itself for a breakthrough in the longstanding Middle East dispute. A number of factors justify that statement being made. Firstly, most obviously and most importantly, there is the easing of tensions between the superpowers. Secondly, there are the significant concessions by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in accepting the existence of Israel and in declaring its rejection and condemnation of terrorism. Thirdly, and importantly, there is the renewed activity by the United States Administration in the Middle East peace process, highlighted by the visits to Washington this week by President Mubarak and Prime Minister Shamir. Fourthly, and also very importantly, there is the increased evidence of the willingness of the Soviet Union to play a more constructive role in the search for Middle East peace. All of those developments-each one singly and certainly taking them all together-are important, and the Government welcomes them. At the same time we recognise, as must any reasonable person, the dangers and the difficulties ahead. It needs to be said that the PLO is not homogeneous. It is undoubtedly true that some elements linked with the PLO hold extremist views and continue to favour the use of violence as a means to achieve their goals. We say of the PLO that it must be in a position, as far as we and reasonable people around the world are concerned, to have its words tested against deeds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government hopes that the new government in Israel will recognise the significance of the recent developments to which I have alluded and will address itself with renewed courage and imagination to the task of coming to terms with its adversaries. A positive response by Israel to the PLO's recent moves would serve to encourage Palestinian moderates, thus promoting Israel's long-term interests. In particular, we endorse President Bush's call for Israel to acknowledge the Palestinians' basic political rights. This has for too long now been an area of tragedy for those immediately and directly involved and a continuing source of potential conflict on a global scale. All men and women of goodwill will recognise the significance of those factors to which I have alluded and will join with me in expressing the hope that all those directly concerned-Israel, the Palestinians and the Arab states-with the more congenial environment in which they now operate, with reduced superpower tension, will pick up the initiatives, will show the courage that in previous and more belligerent circumstances they have shown.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have had cause to say, the challenges and the dangers of peace are often in a sense greater than the challenges and the dangers of war. I think that this is the case on this occasion. We hope that all those with responsibility will rise to this occasion so that in the event we can see the emergence of a constructive and durable peace in the region and consequently a reduction in the danger of global conflict which has always been attendant on this long, simmering and dangerous dispute.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Saving the Ozone Layer conference in London was an excellent conference. Full marks should be accorded to Mrs Thatcher for having had the initiative to call it. There were 118 nations present. Its significance was to indicate how far the world had gone since 31 or 32 nations attended the Montreal Convention in 1987. There is universal recognition that the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is now inadequate and, although it is incorporated in our recent ozone protection legislation, Australia will be one of those countries meeting in Helsinki in a couple of months to say that the timetable set at Montreal is now quite inadequate. The nations at the London conference were looking not for a cut by 50 per cent by the end of the 1990s, but at a total elimination by 1998 or 1999 of the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most interesting things about the conference I thought was the very frank response from industry. For example, Du Pont Petrochemicals, the biggest producer of CFCs, was there. Du Pont indicated that it was looking for certainty in directions from the international community. If the governments of the world say, `Right, there is to be a total elimination and the development of new substances by 1 January 1993', Du Pont says that industry will be able to meet that. The last thing it wants is a kind of hand wringing exercise where it is told, `Well, try to do the best you can and see how you go'. Industry wants a degree of certainty.</PARA>
<PARA> The other encouraging thing about the London conference was the number of nations attending which had not been at Montreal, particularly China, India, Brazil, the Republic of Korea and Thailand-the last two because they see themselves potentially as being both major exporters and very significant users of CFCs. I said in my London speech that we had to recognise that if the ozone problem was to be dealt with internationally it could not be done without pain, particularly as there was a strong risk of appearing to be hypocritical if in Australia, with four million households and four million refrigerators, we are saying to China, India and Brazil, `We think that refrigeration and air-conditioning are excellent for us but we think they would be an environmental disaster for you'. There was a recognition that among the advanced nations of the world there would have to be a very significant contribution in technology transfer in assisting the countries of the Third World to acquire the facilities so that they could have alternatives for packaging, refrigeration, air-conditioning, solvents, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a growing recognition, and the evidence is ever stronger, of the impact of depletion of the ozone layer for skin cancers, cataracts, breakdowns in the immune systems and, very significantly, the reduction in crop yield in a number of very important crops such as soya beans. Certainly, the conference provided the most heartening evidence, outside the experience of the Antarctic Treaty, in getting a global response to a global problem. That said, it must be admitted that solving the problems of ozone depletion is really a bit of a doddle compared with the much more complex problems of coming to grips with the greenhouse phenomenon. The hope is that if we can get that unanimity on ozone to start with it is a very good base to build for then approaching the problems of the greenhouse effect.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter the Minister for Trade Negotiations was referring to with respect to American imports of sugar has been around for quite some time. The tonnages being imported into the United States under quota have gone down. What the Minister for Trade Negotiations was referring to particularly was the Gibbons Bill, which would make what has been ongoing in the United States for quite some time even more difficult. It has got to the situation now where the amount of imports going into the United States from Australia is getting down to a ship load or two. So that has been around for quite a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality with the world sugar market is that in 1977, under the last Government, we entered into an international sugar agreement with economic provisions. That held us right back. Of course, in our wisdom we would not have the European Community in there. So it went on and now it is exporting about 11 million tonnes of sugar a year. Australia produces about 3 per cent of the world's sugar. We face a situation where the going price on the world market is one that any country can enter into. The industry in Australia lived through prices at one stage down to US2.3c a pound. We lived through that because we have a very resilient and efficient industry. All that holds back the extra efficiency of that industry is the Queensland National Party regulations. The industry could earn, potentially, another half a billion dollars a year if those regulations were lifted from it.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman asked whether we intend to allow dumping. The short answer to that is no. With the world sugar market we have a better idea of the parameters of various sugar prices. The special Lome arrangements and the Caribbean arrangements, all the various subsidies that apply to European sugar, the new anti-dumping provisions we have in place and what we may be able to get additionally, and the fact that farmers and workers affected can now take out a case if there is any threat of dumping, lead us to believe that there will be no dumping of sugar. Possibly the sugar industry faces, with the elimination of the embargo, a similar situation that the rice industry in this country faces.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. I have seen some comments in that regard by the Opposition spokesman on defence, that he believes the chiefs of the Defence Force have started to play a political role that is unacceptable and that they should be removed-or, if the Opposition got into office, they would be removed. So far as we are concerned, those are non-political positions. The holders of those positions are persons of the highest integrity and of long service to this nation. They have served this nation very well, most of them in war and in peace. Over the last year or so they have been the subject of quite vehement political attack by the Opposition shadow spokespeople on defence matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The latest has been an indication a week or so ago by the spokesman for the Opposition that in some way or other the chiefs and the civilian heads would find themselves on the chopping block when those opposite came into office. Invited to respond to that, the Opposition spokesman fudged about when that issue was raised. If he wants to take the opportunity to make a personal explanation and make clear-cut in this House that he supports the view that the chiefs have conducted themselves with total integrity, nobody in this House will be happier than me. The fact is that he has not made that clear, and I invite him when the time comes for personal explanations later in the day to go on record as accepting the integrity of the people who lead the defence forces in this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that we have estimated that the environmental impact study will take of the order of 18 months. Of course, it is in our interests to try to accelerate the environmental impact study as much as possible so that we can resolve the issue whether a third runway can be built there. Assuming that we also want to give adequate opportunity for everyone to make an appropriate contribution to that study, it is obvious that to do that study correctly, and in accordance with the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, we estimate that we will need to take something in the order of 18 months. The environmental impact study for Badgerys Creek conducted in 1984-85 took 21 months. We expect that this study-not involving the selection of an airport site but being in a more confined area-will involve a shorter time frame. Something in the order of 18 months is our best estimate. If we can shorten that time frame while still giving adequate opportunity for everyone to make a proper input into the study, so much the better. But the prime emphasis in setting the timetable will be to ensure that the EIS is properly done and that everyone who has an interest in making an input to that EIS has the opportunity to do so. Our estimate of 18 months allows for that full involvement of everyone with an interest.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="860" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only and single criterion used by this Government in making such appointments is competence. But, despite that fact, the appointments-particularly in my portfolio area; not just those referred to by the Minister for Defence and others-of the heads of the department and other organisations within my portfolio, who have been appointed on that basis of competence, have been attacked systematically by the Opposition. We have seen repeated attacks on the Commissioner of Taxation, the Australian Statistician, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and, now, the Secretary to the Treasury. We have seen a conscious and deliberate strategy of vilification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987 the Commissioner of Taxation was described by the Leader of the Opposition as `the Treasurer's poodle' and last year was attacked as being political for his support for the upgraded tax file number. The Statistician has been dragged into political debate over the household expenditure survey. The Governor of the Reserve Bank was accused last year by the shadow finance Minister of politicising interest rates and the Governor made an unprecedented public rebuttal of those remarks. Now the Opposition mounts a personal attack upon the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Fraser, and then tries to do a Pontius Pilate to escape from the odium of that attack. In each and every case, these attacks are upon career public servants, people who have given their lives in public service and in all cases have been appointed to senior positions by a coalition government. Because there is an inability on that side of the House to debate major economic issues, it starts attacking the personalities.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the recent attack upon the Secretary to the Treasury by the shadow finance spokesman. Because he believed in speculation that I might consider recommending Mr Fraser's appointment as Governor of the Reserve Bank on the retirement of Mr Johnston, he said in a press statement the other day:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Treasurer's reported inclination to appoint one of his political mates as Bob Johnston's replacement should be a matter of considerable concern.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the kind of tawdry remark which has been made. When it is reported, he then rings and attacks journalists for having dared to report it and then puts out a statement.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then, in a statement released by the shadow finance spokesman two days later, on 2 April, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Contrary to what was implied by Mr Keating, I have not attacked Bernie Fraser as an individual.</PARA>
<PARA>He just sought to destroy Mr Fraser's reputation as a career bureaucrat capable of independent thought and action. Let me refer to a speech he made to the Urban Institute on 8 March. Speaking of me, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> He remains a total captive of his politicised Department and their jargon.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the attacks made upon the Treasury and its Secretary by the shadow finance spokesman.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to his remarks about the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Last week he had the temerity to put out a statement saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Governor Johnston's honesty is a refreshing change from Keating's disinformation.</PARA>
<PARA>He tried to suggest that some remarks by the Governor were in contrast to what I had said and were a mark of refreshing honesty by him. This occurred after the shadow finance spokesman had written a letter to the editor of the Australian Financial Review on 7 October 1988 about the Reserve Bank, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Reserve Bank has, in the past, responded to political direction as in the case of the August bank holiday situation in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Again, interestingly, monetary policy was tightened in April of this year following the NSW election held on 19 March.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same letter he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I was interested to see that the Governor of the Reserve Bank came out from behind closed doors to defend himself last Thursday on the `Business Today' program . . . None that I saw actually scrutinised what the Governor said on that occasion. None questioned whether he had done so of his own accord, or in response to suggestions by others.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, that he was manipulated by me to appear. He went on to say-and listen to the arrogance of this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The thing that particularly struck me about the Governor's performance last week was that he provided no real evidence in his defence.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, that the Governor is a politically manipulated person. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . his explanation was only a diversionary tactic and loaded with semantics rather than substance.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in the same letter the honourable member stated:</PARA>
<PARA>First, the Reserve Bank was more or less `leant on' by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Reserve Bank Governor is manipulated by me in the interests of tricking up interest rates in election campaigns. That is the charge made against him. But then, on 2 April, the honourable member said that he found the Governor's honesty `a refreshing change'. The Governor came out on television and, in response to that letter to which I have just referred, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I find it a very severe slur not only on the Board but also on the staff of the Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he would have nothing of that from the shadow finance spokesman, who has no respect for his position even though the Governor was appointed by the former Treasurer, the present Leader of the Opposition, and has served governments of both sides well. Finally, we have the honourable member's remarks. Having had his attacks on Mr Fraser and the Governor reported by the press, he made these remarks to journalists at an Institute of Chartered Accountants seminar in Sydney held yesterday and reported in today's Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA>For the journalists present, in view of some recent experiences of mine, might I suggest that you go and sit in the corner and write a thousand times, `I will not misquote John Hewson, I will not misquote John Hewson, I will not misquote John Hewson . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>Really! Then we come to the Leader of the Opposition. He said on AM on 26 October:</PARA>
<PARA>I think one of the mistakes of the Tax Commissioner is that he buys into political debates.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commissioner of Taxation is stigmatised as well. Then today on the radio he made the most unbelievable statement about Bernie Fraser. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am not playing the man, I am playing the issue.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Liberals will attack Mr Fraser as being a person who is a political mate of the Treasurer even though he also served their Government well. They will attack him on the basis that he should not be appointed to the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia-whether the Government intends to appoint him or not. Then there followed a totally fraudulent line, that the stream of advice that should come to the Government from the Reserve Bank should be different advice from that which should come from the Treasury Secretary; yet, in the same breath, the Leader of the Opposition said that we could have some outsider, some person who has been playing the money market game for a merchant bank or some other financial institution and generally making money at the expense of the public purse by speculating in the system. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that such a person could be appointed to the Reserve Bank, but not a person who had served Australia in the high position of Secretary to the Australian Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA> What disingenuousness this all is. It simply boils down to the fact that no public servant is now free from attack by the Opposition; not the Commissioner of Taxation, who presided over a clean up of the tax system which was left to fall into disrepute by the former Treasurer; not the Governor of the central bank, who has presided over the most major reformation ever of a financial system and a terms of trade and currency collapse to boot. He is attacked and called a political stoolie. The Secretary to the Treasury, who has served governments of both sides well, is called a political mate of the Treasurer's.</PARA>
<PARA> Then the Leader of the Opposition, instead of having the decency to retract those comments and chastise his shadow spokesman who makes these comments continually about career public servants for whom he has no regard or respect, goes on radio and says, `I am not playing the man; I am playing the issue'. This was on the pathetic defence that the Government of Australia should have a line of advice from the Reserve Bank of Australia which in some way is so vastly different from the Treasury that no Secretary to the Treasury could ever be appointed but some hustler from a merchant bank could, or some hustler from the financial markets could-as if they would know what is fit, proper and right about economic advice, having never given any advice to any government in the past-despite the fact that, on a number of occasions, former coalition governments have appointed Treasury secretaries to the Reserve Bank. There is a most insidious and disturbing trend of attacks on people who serve the public interest in career positions and who cannot defend themselves, by people who have no regard for their independence and their personal and career integrity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During an extraordinarily long answer the Treasurer (Mr Keating) totally misrepresented my position regarding some comments that I have made in recent weeks about the identity of the next Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The point that I have made, which the Treasurer deliberately distorted, is that although I have no lack of confidence in Mr Bernie Fraser's ability as Secretary to the Treasury-I do not in that context mind saying that, if I had been in a position to do so after Mr Stone's departure as Secretary to the Treasury, I would probably have recommended Mr Fraser to the former Government-I also say in the same context that, contrary to what the Treasurer said at the commencement of his answer, it was I and not he who recommended to the former Government Mr Johnston's appointment as the Governor of the Reserve Bank. So I do not come to this matter in any way lacking confidence in either Mr Johnston or Mr Fraser. The first point that I make-it is a very simple and very valid point-is that the culture of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank is different and it is in the interests of maintaining an independent stream of advice over appropriate market sensitivities in the Reserve Bank that the Governor of the Bank not be somebody who has come straight from being Secretary to the Treasury to the position of Governor of the Reserve Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point that I make is in relation to the Commissioner of Taxation where, once again, the Treasurer has misrepresented my position. Mr Boucher served the former Government and, as First Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, he had a lot to do with me in the time that I was Treasurer in the former Government. I had a high regard for the work he did then and I made that known to him and to the Treasurer when he was appointed Commissioner of Taxation. The only occasion that I have attacked Mr Boucher-and I would do it again if the circumstances arose-was when Mr Boucher made the mistake of buying into political debate. While he continues to perform the job of Commissioner of Taxation within his statutory responsibilities he will draw no rebuke or remonstrance from the Opposition, but when he strays into the political arena, as he did in the identity card debate when he bought into that debate at a very critical and sensitive stage, he cannot hide behind the immunity of being a neutral public servant. The Public Service carries with it enormous responsibilities and enormous privileges. One of those responsibilities is to stay out of political debate. </PARA>

Last week the Governor of the Reserve Bank-and I have just one newspaper reporting it-in an almost unprecedented set of actions within 24 hours gave two warnings, as the Australian says, that financial markets and the entire economy are `heading for more turbulence and higher interest rates'. The Governor is quoted in a report written by Laura Tingle, and as a substantiation of this discussion of the matter of public importance I will read what he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The so-called micro policies of reform-of work practices and the established ways of doing things-have a major role to play in raising productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> These are more-not less-urgent when all is not going smoothly at the macro level. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the second of the warnings. Regarding the statement that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is to bring down on 12 April, we were told some months ago that it would be just a wage-tax trade-off. Then we were going to have the blueprint for micro-economic reform, which has been delayed since the election of 1987. Then we got another change. The statement was degutted. It was to be simply a wage-tax deal with some dollops-justifiably-for pensioners, some changes in family assistance, and that was it. Why? Because not only has this Government given up on fiscal policy and sold out on wages policy, but also it has been utterly unable to perform on micro-economic policy and turn around the fundamental imbalances that are strangling this economy at present. There is no doubt that the Government members have failed as economic managers, failed on inflation, failed on interest rates, failed on the balance of payments and debt, and failed on living standards-macro policy out, and no micro policy. Those failures are a failure for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the national accounts came out. The Government's economic mismanagement was highlighted yet again with the release of the national accounts for the December quarter. The figures depict an economy ridden with high inflation. Indeed, on a measurement that the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), constantly focuses on, the implicit price deflator, which I spent hours talking with him about-a broader measure, as he is aware, of inflation than the consumer price index-inflation increased by almost 9 per cent in the year to December 1988. The Treasurer, in his speech last September to the Economic Planning Advisory Council, claimed:</PARA>
<PARA>The wage tax trade-off we will implement will secure a further fall in inflation to around 3 to 4 per cent in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, that cannot be delivered-any more than the extent of our balance of payments was to improve. The reality is that the Budget strategy, which within seven weeks the Opposition said was wrong and that we would need a major statement dealing with both macro and micro policies-deferred, however-was predicated on an inflation rate of 4.5 per cent, and it is nearly 8 per cent-if one takes the broader measurement yesterday, it is 9 per cent-on an improving balance of payments situation, which has worsened, and on the continual predictions of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others that interest rates would go down, and they have gone up. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons that the Governor of the Reserve Bank was moved in this unprecedented way to issue the warnings he did last week was that he recognises that he is trapped at the Reserve Bank viewing a government that is pursuing a one-dimensional policy. This one-dimensional policy means continued high interest rates, which not only cast doubt on the sustainability of the recent pick-up in investment, but also savagely attack Australian living standards. I have said it before: Low to middle income Australian families have been taking a hammering under six years of Labor. Yet the Government prefers to jack up interest rates rather than use a more balanced policy mix. </PARA>
<PARA> It will dribble out advice from time to time that interest rates will go down. The Treasurer was asked by me today about Westpac's move on its lending rate, lifting it to 18.75 per cent. I asked what the consequence was for the mortgage rate. He said, `This is the prime rate used through the corporate sector' and abused me for linking it in that manner. The only reason in my view-challenge it if you will-why Westpac would not raise its home loan rate after this rise would be political. It is true that the prime lending rate is the rate which applies to corporate enterprises, but if there is upward pressure on the prime rate there will also be upward pressure on home loan rates. To say that those rates are independent defies logic. In short, it is apparent that the prime rate is the leading interest rate and others follow, albeit with a lag. The conditions which are driving the prime rate are quite clearly also driving home loan rates. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one on this side of the House has gone around the country talking interest rates up or down. It is the Government side of politics that gets into it, but it will not deal with the conditions that have brought the crippling interest rates in the country today. To plead ignorance or use personal abuse to get out of it does not seem to add up. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has made a public plea. Can anyone in this House recall any previous occasion on which a Governor of the Reserve Bank on two occasions in 24 hours has called into question the policy of the Australian Government?</PARA>

<PARA>said nothing that I don't agree with. </PARA>
<PARA>That is having a bob each way. How could anyone agree with the sort of criticism that the Governor of the Reserve Bank made and take no action in a major statement to be brought down in the course of the next 10 days or so? Only early last month the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) claimed:</PARA>
<PARA>A lot of people were thinking that it-</PARA>
<PARA>the April statement-</PARA>
<PARA>was just going to be an announcement of tax cuts. I think you'll find there'll be more in it than that. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet on 22 March the Treasurer announced tht the micro-economic reform had been moved off the agenda. I urge honourable members to note the confluence of dates, to note the message, to note the plea from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, but the Treasurer still announced that microreform had been moved off the agenda. Before the week was out, on two occasions in less than 24 hours the Governor of the Reserve Bank, no less, slated the programs and the policies of the Government. We have listened to the facades, the jargon and the platitudes. This Government strokes its platitudes about the state of the economy until they purr. Not even the Governor of the Reserve Bank will let the Government go with its forthcoming April statement without attacking it in advance, and justifiably so. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House will at least go to the people of Australia with a wide, coordinated agenda for economic reform. The Treasurer screams and tries to say that our fiscal policy is the same as that of the Government; it is not. It will be tighter, and we make no pretence about that. We will also relate wage increases to productivity. With those settings in place we will be able to have a steady monetary policy. We will then have the push on deregulation that the Government has not had the guts to tackle. We can spell out the areas and the changes on microreform, whether it be on the waterfront or in coastal shipping, that the Government has ducked again. It will not mention such changes in its April statement. On top of that, we have produced a schedule of 12 government bodies to privatise. The Government wants to privatise those bodies, but it cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government comes in here with a one-dimensional policy, namely, screwing money supply-which has the effect of screwing living standards down for the majority of the Australian people. I do not care what jargon and platitudes are purred out in here. The Government claims it is rethinking and creating a greater and freer Australian economy, but its actions make it abundantly clear that it is only rearranging its prejudices. It will not carry out the reforms that are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple test for the future conduct of the economy is who can push on further with deregulation. Can the Government handle labour market deregulation? It cannot. Can it carry out privatisation of government bodies, bearing in mind that Australia has one of the highest proportions of government-owned enterprises competing in the private sector in the whole of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development? The answer is no. </PARA>

It is a bit like the Treasurer standing on the 30th floor of a building and saying to a fellow who has fallen off the 50th floor, as he goes past, `So far you're all right'. There is a certain inevitability in certain indices locked into this economy, just as there is a certain inevitability in the analogy I just used. No amount of smooth talking about the state of the economy will override the reality that the Government is just not able to pursue the reforms that are necessary in this country now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not care whether it is the privatisation program that the shadow Minister for business and consumer affairs has put around this country so successfully, and I do not care whether it involves the tying up of labour market deregulation through preferential share ownership schemes that offer employees a stake in their own enterprises or whether it involves the contracting out of programs that we have. All of them lead within our coordinated economic programs to giving the taxpayer value for money in the delivery of services. Beyond it all, through the fiscal, wages and monetary settings and the other micro-elements that I have mentioned there is a real ability to get inflation and interest rates down. The Government has given up on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that, on taxation, we have been able to illustrate the sort of real relief and bias towards families that will be given. I have said in here time and again-and the Treasurer has been unable to deny the figure; he tried on one occasion to play with it but that is all he ended up doing-that if we wanted to give back to a person on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children the same amount of disposable income he had in March of 1983, when the honourable member for Blaxland became Treasurer, we would have to give him $58 a week. That is the measure of the task. We would have to give such people a tax cut of $58 a week just to put them back to where they were in March of 1983. </PARA>

At present, if that scheduling is right, people will be $38 a week worse off even after the tax cuts. It matters not whether we are discussing macropolicy, micropolicy or all those areas of privatisation that the economy desperately needs. It is not now just the Opposition that is calling and pleading for changes and that has pledged to implement them; in the very week that the Treasurer said he had given up on microreform in his April statement the Governor of the Reserve Bank has come out and, in the words of the headline, said, `Reserve warns economy at risk'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a change of tune for the Opposition. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia is now put on some pedestal in this debate while for the last two years Opposition spokespersons have attacked him as being a political toady of the Government. The shadow finance spokesman, in particular, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has attacked him repeatedly and consistently as having politicised the Reserve Bank and the setting of interest rates. Apparently the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), now says people who ignore the warnings of the Reserve Bank Governor will do so at their peril, while week in week out, month in month out, Opposition members have suggested that the whole apparatus of the Reserve Bank is a politicised one which is governed by the Treasurer-me in this case-and that the Governor conspires with me to trick up interest rates in election campaigns. That is the charge against him. Now the disingenuous claim is that his word is holy writ and therefore things which he said last week have to be taken grave notice of. The fact is that things the Governor said last week are entirely in accordance with policy. I endorse everything that he said last week, which the Governor well knows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most extraordinary thing about raising the question of micro-economic reform today is that it is the very day that the Liberal Party of Australia has once again been boxed in on a key micro-economic issue; that is, that under a coalition government wheat deregulation is to be held hostage to the National Party of Australia, a repeat of the years of the Fraser Government. The single greatest impediment to sensible economic reform in this country since 1949 has been the Country Party, now the National Party of Australia. What we have seen is a sham, a shambles, a ruse coming from members of the Opposition today that they will not support wheat deregulation unless there is a concomitant change apparently in a whole range of sectors by the Government. In other words, they do not have the guts to adopt a bit of the deregulation they are actually suggesting the Government ought to adopt itself. When we put it up to them in the area of wheat marketing they run away as they have on each and every occasion. It simply confirms that a coalition government would not be capable of delivering real economic reform to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Malcolm Fraser's Prime Ministership and John Howard's Treasurership it was proved that they could not change the financial market structure of this country, they could not deregulate the financial system, they could not float the exchange rate, they could not run a decent monetary policy and they could not have a coherent fiscal policy. This was all vetoed by the National Party. That veto is still there today. In fact, the shadow finance spokesman, the honourable member for Wentworth, has said as much. In commenting on the former Treasurer, he said that he could not get anything through the Cabinet, he was always run over by the farmers. The fact is that members of the Opposition will always be run over by the farmers because they do not have any policy structure. They would not have known what the term `miro-economic reform' was until we started using it in economic debate, and certainly they did none of it. Yet today the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong, talks about more deregulation and the Government adopting a micro-agenda. Apparently he says all this because he believes that the Opposition cannot compete with the Government in micro-economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, a day after the national accounts have been published, the debate is not about macro-economics; it is about micro-economics. It is not only the very day that those opposite cannot face up to a substantial micro-economic issue on wheat deregulation, but the day after the national accounts they cannot come to the macro-economic agenda. In the last sittings of parliament the shadow Treasurer told us that he would adopt the same fiscal policy as the Government. He is now saying today, in what he thinks will be understood as a hairy-chested performance, that he will have a tighter fiscal policy. That means one or two things: that he would not give the tax cuts which the Government is intending to give, that he would hang onto the money and increase the surplus, in which case, all these crocodile tears about living standards are just so much nonsense, or if he gives tax cuts he would have to cut public outlays substantially. Let him say where those public outlays cuts will be. Let him tell us which areas of public policy, whether it is pensions, support for veterans, payments to schools, payments for health or payments to the aged. Let him tell us where the dramatic reduction in public spending is to be to make that fiscal policy tighter. He will not. He has never shown any inclination to do that. The shadow finance spokesman has one job in life; that is to detail cuts in government spending under a coalition government. He has singularly failed to do so. We can only come to the conclusion that on macro-economic policy members of the Opposition are not game to outline an alternative policy, so today they are up to the question of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> On the way through this collage of views that the shadow Treasurer assembled in the discussion, he started talking about labour market deregulation. We have just been through, and probably are still in, the conditions where, when we last saw these conditions in Australia in 1980-81, the terms of trade rose and economic activity and demand rose. Under a coalition government wages went up by about 16 per cent in nominal terms. That then gave us a wage explosion, double digit inflation, tight interest rates, a recession and high unemployment. Those opposite have not done one bit of conceptual thinking which would change that outcome today. They could not run wages if it were the last thing they were required to do. It is a fact of life that the only political party in this country which can run wages policy is the Australian Labor Party. The party which can run wages policy is the only party which can claim to be able to run the national economy. In this country if a government cannot run the issue, which is wages policy, the principal determinant of costs, it cannot run Australia. We have found that those opposite do not have an incomes policy or a wages policy. If we were to supposedly `adopt' their deregulation of the labour market-that is a free for all where the unions fought it out with companies on an enterprise company by company basis-they know what would happen: companies' profit share would be massacred, there would be lay-offs, we would have high unemployment and very quickly thereafter a recession. That is what would happen. That is why Bert Evans from the Metal Trades Industry Association (MTIA) said last week and on television over the weekend, `We don't want a return to these sorts of policies. We don't want a free for all. We want an income; we want an orderly structure'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact of life that the only party in Australia capable of providing an orderly, reasoned wages and cost structure for the economy is the Australian Labor Party under its relationship with the accord, in the accord with the Australian trade union movement and, hence, the work force. According to yesterday's national accounts we have had moderate wages growth. I think we have had 0.1 per cent for the September quarter rise, virtually no drift in face of the tightest labour market conditions in six or seven years and then moderate outcomes over the course of the year which, under a coalition government, would be just skyrocketing wage increases and not bringing any comfort to anybody. What would happen to people is that we would just rip them off in higher double digit inflation which would follow a few months later. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition have sat there now for six years, going to their seventh year, and not once have they ever thought, `Maybe we have to develop a policy in this area'. The most important area in the micro-economy is wages policy. They do not even have a policy. They are no better equipped today than they were in 1983-84 and yet they come in here talking about the micro-agenda. But then they have this totally phoney appeal on living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard the shadow Treasurer get up and talk about living standards and interest rates. Members of the Opposition have opposed every wage increase since 1983-84. Thirty-four per cent of the wages of average weekly earnings would not be there had they had their way. That being the case, on one hand they are crying about payments in interest rates for houses and on the other hand they would rip away 34 per cent of the wages of the average Australian. That is what they have advocated. They advocate this and at the same time they talk about living standards. The fact of the matter is that paying high wage increases-increases that the economy could not afford-would just disrupt the cost structure, lead to double digit inflation and many people would simply be out of work. But they have no basic remedy for that policy. To disguise the fact that they have opposed every wage increase since 1983-84, they are now saying, `We will now have a sort of softer, kinder industrial relations policy. We will now pay on the basis of productivity'. They expect people to say, `Oh well, that is reasonable, yes. If you are productive you get paid, if you are not productive you are not paid. That is fair enough'. What is the trend with productivity in Australia? It is 1 1/2 per cent a year. </PARA>

Those opposite will have nothing to do with that. What they will do is go back to the bread line policy if they can. They will make people work for a 1 1/2 per cent wage increase. When we decode productivity-based increases, what that means is an increase that no labour force would accept and there would then be a wages breakout and with it a wage explosion. In other words, those opposite are propagating a policy that they know is completely unachievable and unworkable. Yet they persist with the fiction, the dishonesty and the ruse of suggesting that this is an alternative wages policy. Not one industrial grouping of companies in this country would cop a bar of it-not the Confederation of Australian Industry, not the Business Council of Australia, not the MTIA or the Chambers of Commerce. None of them would have any confidence in the Opposition running the economy. Not one of them would entrust wages growth to the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition thinks it can rattle along saying, `Look, we have much the same sort of macropolicy as the Government and we are looking to the future by steering back to the 1950s with Future Directions. We will just waddle to the poll and people will not know the difference'. Let me tell the Opposition that before it gets to that poll people are going to know one thing, and that is that only Labor can run wages and the economy. Only the Australian Labor Party has a structure for government in Australia. The people will make a choice between a reasoned, orderly structure and the wage chaos and confrontation that the Opposition gave us in the 1970s. The previous Government had a mandate, as no other government had a mandate, in 1975 and 1977, with control of both Houses of Parliament, to reform the Australian economy and it failed singularly, through either ineptitude or downright cowardice. It gave us a wage explosion because it had no wages policy. The confrontation, the industrial disputation, the pitting of employer against employee-all of that strife and upheaval which was a characteristic of the Howard years as Treasurer in the 1970s-would be simply repeated by those opposite in another government. That is why the Opposition has no policy and no structure and why the Labor Party is the only party which can provide certainty, order and continuing structural change in the economy and wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is talking about micro-economic policy. In the most important area it does not have a policy. In other areas, such as that of tax reform, it has attacked all the things we have done. When we put one thing on its plate and say, `Make a decision about wheat deregulation'-that is a pretty reasonable proposition in a domestic market-what does the Liberal Party do? It runs around like a chook with its head cut off because the National Party is squeezing it again and showing how weak it is. The National Party says `We won't have a bar of it. We will block all sensible economic reform', just as it did through all the years of Fadden, McEwen-particularly McEwen-and then Anthony. All of that thuggery which the National Party brought to economic decision making and which the Liberal Party cowered under would be repeated were those opposite to come to office. They think that somehow demand is higher than it ought to be and that that is spilling over into imports. They say, `Here's our chance, we'll break through here'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of satisfaction to be able to second the matter of public importance put forward by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). I am very surprised that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is leaving the chamber. I would have liked to say a few words to him. I agree with the Treasurer that it is only the Australian Labor Party that can be run by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). We have seen that happen with wages policy. In fact, whenever there is anything to be done by the Government the first thing it does is get on the phone to the ACTU saying, `Is that all right? Can we do this?'. Whatever the issue is-the MX missile test, uranium mining, wages policy or fiscal policy-the Treasurer gets on the phone to the ACTU. We are used to that situation, but it is not doing the country much good. I will say a little more about that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer remarked on how farmers run over the Liberal Party and the National Party. I say to him that farms produce most of this country's wealth today and without farmers we would all be shot. I think it would pay the Government, in its own interests, to take heed of what the farmers say, because without farmers this country would be in a sorry state. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Opposition has opposed wage increases. It has done so on a number of occasions because it knows that with the Government's taxation policy a wage increase is not worth anything to an average family man. The taxation policy does not just take back the wage increase; it does a lot more than that. As the shadow Treasurer said, the income of an average family with two children has dropped by about $58 to $60. If the Government gives a tax cut it will have to go to the people-have an election-because there is no way it can sustain it. Much as the people of Australia require a tax cut because of what has happened, no government could sustain it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak because I get sick and tired of sitting here in the Parliament listening to Government members airing their concerns about people suffering poverty, about the elderly, the Aborigines, the ethnic community, homeless youth as I do not believe they understand the problems confronting those people. If they do understand, they certainly do not have the intestinal fortitude to make the decisions that will assist the poor unfortunates whom they allege they represent. Many of the groups I have mentioned, I must admit, at least obtain lip service from the Government, but the groups whose concern I wish to bring to the Government's attention today comprise the building blocks of this nation-Australian families. Many are middle and low income families. Where do they stand while the Government fiddles about the edges, afraid to make the micro-economic decisions that have to be made to keep this nation and its families together?</PARA>
<PARA> The irony of the situation is that, as honourable members may recall, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in his 1984 election policy speech that what concerns the ordinary Australian family is that there should be jobs available for parents and in the future for their children; that they are able to purchase their own homes at a reasonable cost and not have to face crippling interest payments; that their children receive an education which equips them in the best possible ways for their lives ahead; and, above all, that every Australian family should have the opportunity to maintain and improve its standard of living. We all recall the Prime Minister's statement in the 1987 election speech when he said, `By 1990, no Australian child will be living in poverty'. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable members are aware that during its six years in office the Hawke Labor Government has failed abysmally to live up to is commitments to the Australian family. Through its high taxing policies, its continued support for high inflation and high interest rates and its attack on traditional values, the Federal Labor Government has actively jeopardised the continued viability and stability of many families. Those of us who have been married and supported families on low to middle incomes, living only from pay to pay, know how difficult it is to make up a few dollars to try to support the family. We also know the pressures that are placed on families due to money difficulties and worries. No doubt, today, that is partly reflected in the high divorce and separation rates that add further costs to government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened to Australian families since this Government came to office. As I have just said, the Prime Minister stated in 1984 that there should be jobs available for parents and in the future for their children. The Government has failed to help the young unemployed of this country. The figures for January 1989 show a continuing and unacceptably high level of youth unemployment. The overall unemployment rate for January was 7.4 per cent, the highest level since May 1988. The unemployment rate for 15- to 19-year-olds remains at an appalling level. At January 1989 it stood at 19.8 per cent, the same level as it was in March 1988. Of the 477,500 registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service in January 1989, 70,000 were people aged between 15 and 19 looking for their first job. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important areas in which the Government has failed in economic reform and, therefore, failed to assist the unemployed is in the area of industrial relations. It is not surprising that the youth of today are finding extreme difficulty in obtaining jobs, with our highly centralised, rigid wage fixing system. Only by deregulating the wage fixing system and increasing productivity will employers be able to afford to hire apprentices and young people in general. We know how difficult it is for young people to get jobs. Anyone who has been an apprentice would know the time and effort it takes for a tradesman to teach an apprentice. Most tradesmen today do not have the time or money to teach apprentices. The Government's refusal to make reforms in this area is forcing young people to remain on the unemployment benefit, to live below the poverty line, and it is hampering Australia's ability to increase its productivity and economic prosperity through increased exports. It is not surprising that the unemployment rate in each year of the Hawke Government has exceeded the rate for any other year in Australia's postwar history, apart from the drought year of 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government argues that job opportunities have increased, but the interesting thing is that half of the jobs have been taken up by married women. Among couples with dependent children, the proportion where the mother works has risen from 46 per cent to 55 per cent. Why is this? Certainly there are many women who wish to leave the home for their own fulfilment or for other reasons, but there are also many situations where mothers wish to stay at home and care for their children but are forced into the work force because they find they cannot survive financially unless they join it. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the Prime Minister's statement that Australian children should receive an education which equips them in the best possible ways for their lives ahead? The Government certainly has a long way to go on this one with its cut backs to State governments which have forced the States in turn, particularly New South Wales, to prune their educational expenses. People in rural New South Wales are certainly being discriminated against with the assets test being related to the Austudy payments, but we in rural Australia, while producing most of Australia's wealth, are used to this Government's continued attacks on the bush. We all know that there is no such thing as free education, and the monetary policy presently being practised by the Federal Government, particularly in its cut-backs to the States, will preclude many children from even finishing their secondary education, let alone getting into the tertiary area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the private education sector, it is interesting to note that, according to a report to Australia's bishops from a Melbourne parish, Catholic education is now out of the reach of large families. But the greatest let-down for struggling families from the Prime Minister's 1984 policy speech is that, above all, every Australian family should have the opportunity to maintain and improve its standard of living. What a joke that would be if it did not entail so much suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the standard of living of Australian families. Most Australians, even those most supportive of the Government, are now realising that they have suffered a drop in living standards since this Government came to office. The tax taken from the people has increased from $40.8 billion in 1982-83 to a massive estimated $82.3 billion in 1988-89, with personal income tax in that year rising 13.8 per cent to be the highest ever. Inflation is now running at 9 per cent. Interest rates are skyrocketing. The Treasurer's macro-economic policies are failing. </PARA>
<PARA> But many of these large figures do not mean much to struggling families. Figures that do mean something are in relation to things like family allowances. I can recall being the breadwinner in a single income family trying to make ends meet, like everyone in the neighbourhood and most of Australia at that time. Even though the family allowance was not much then, it was eagerly awaited so that it could buy some shoes, singlets or small clothing items for the children. Since that time the family allowance has declined to less than half the value of that obtained when I was raising a family. In May 1983, the family allowance supplement helped low income families who were not in receipt of a social security pension benefit. It was replaced by the family allowance supplement from December 1987. While the supplement has helped low income families, it has not noticeably reduced poverty levels and does not help average families. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the cost of interest payments. We hear today that the Westpac Banking Corporation has put up its interest rate to 18.75 per cent, so we can now expect further increases in home loan interest rates. But what did the Government do to overcome the problem? It once again called a talkfest. Why? Because it has learned through experience that perceptions are important because it does not want to do anything to upset its mates. This Government decided to abolish negative gearing right at the time the housing industry was starting to slump, making the situation even worse. Then it decided to bring back negative gearing at a time when the housing industry was starting to pick up. This has now resulted in tremendous pressures on the housing market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What do we have again today from Opposition members but crocodile tears about living standards and their concern about families. No government would sensibly pursue a policy of high interest rates and increasing inflation, except when there was an economic necessity for doing so. Indeed, it seems that at present there is considerable concern among Opposition members about living standards. We hear this day after day. These are the same people who year after year and time after time opposed wage increases for ordinary Australian workers. They are the same people who left Labor an inheritance in the year before we took government of 250,000 Australians losing their jobs. They are the same people who brought industrial disputes to an art form. They are the same people who left us with a retention rate in the schools of 36 per cent, a rate which in our six years of government is now close to 60 per cent. They are the same people who in seven years gave us five health schemes and left two million people uncovered for health care. During our six years of office the Opposition has given the nation five health spokesmen and as many proposals for a health scheme, but nothing concrete. They are the same people who during their time in government presided over a fall in the real rate of pension. And they are the same people who are concerned about living standards in families!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was interesting to note in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald a report under the heading `The facts of life behind our white picket fences'. The article suggests that the structure of a family in Australia is changing significantly. I quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Party has renewed recently its `back-to-the-future' message to the electorate but the Census figures show that only 36 per cent of Australia's family homes are occupied by a traditional nuclear family. </PARA>
<PARA>That figure is only 36 per cent, and indeed a very significant demographic change is occurring in this country. In considering policies for the future we need also to consider the demographic changes which are occurring. For instance, the number of single parent families is increasing. They are the people who are most at risk when one talks about living standards. They are the people to whom we should be giving most attention, because it is the children of those single parent families who suffer the most. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Liberal Party's record on single parent families. Let us take the example of a sole parent family with two children aged 13 and 8. In 1976 when the Liberal Party was in government that family received $57.75. In 1983 when that Government went out of office that family received $103.25. In December 1988 that family received $191.25. So one sees that under the previous Government the single parent family with two children-those who are the subject of most concern when we consider families-suffered a 7.76 per cent drop in real terms in their standard of living as a result of the coalition's time in government. Under Labor the same family has received a real increase of 24.1 per cent. We find in respect of pensioners a real increase in pension of 10 per cent over the time that we have been in government. Yet Opposition members in this place cry crocodile tears about living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter of public importance relates to the:</PARA>
<PARA>need to implement microeconomic policies to prevent the high rate of inflation and high interest rates further undermining living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet in the areas of education, health and the provision of jobs, Opposition members during their time in government failed completely. What is worse, and what is most disturbing from this side of the House, is that Opposition members are not providing any alternative suggestion. The big panacea today is that micro-economic reform should be introduced. That is the bandaid for this week. It is the thing that will solve the problem all of a sudden! The shadow Treasurer has got into his mind the idea that micro-economic reform is the way to go and that it will suddenly change the position. When we ask Opposition members about their macro-economic policy, we find very little difference between the policy pursued by Labor and that which would be pursued by the Opposition. Opposition members say that they will cut spending but they will not tell us where or how that would impact on living standards. We want to know, as the people of this country deserve to know. Opposition members say that they intend to deregulate wages. They should tell us what they intend to do and how they will do it and what changes will be wrought as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at what this Government in- herited from the coalition Government, we learn some salutary lessons. That Government gave Labor a deficit of nearly $10 billion. Now in this Budget year we are facing a surplus of nearly $5 billion or more-$6 billion perhaps. We do not know the actual figures, but there will be a substantial surplus. For the second time in 35 years we have a surplus on our domestic Budget. Yet Opposition members are trying to tell us that Labor cannot manage the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the topic of tax evasion. It was a royal commissioner appointed by the Liberal-National Party coalition who said that Australia's fastest growing industry was that of tax evasion, at a cost of billions of dollars to ordinary Australians. Yet when we came to government we had to pick up a tax system which was in pieces and through which one could drive a truck-there were holes everywhere. There was double taxation on dividends, which hardly encouraged enterprise and profit. Also in existence were the free lunch and fringe benefits available to those who were able to take advantage of them; but nothing for ordinary workers. There were distortions in investment which made speculation popular but gave no inducement for productive investment. We had marginal tax rates which are oppressive. The 60c in the dollar rate had been with us for more than 30 years. Where was the incentive in the taxation policy that the Opposition left us? Who has gone about reforming that system? This Government has. Who overcame the deficit? This Government did. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition talks about inflation in this motion. We have inflation running at 7 per cent. When we took over it was at 11 per cent or more. The Opposition hardly has the credentials to talk about overcoming inflation. We had an overvalued dollar. We had an unregulated financial structure. Indeed, in many areas this Government has created, through its farsighted macro-economic policies, an environment in which micro-economic reform can take place and in which the substantial micro-economic reforms it has put in place can grow and develop. There have already been many reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord, while many on the other side would dispute its success, has been flexible. It is historic that the accord has broken down the automatic cost of living adjustments that were part of our structure previously. Indeed, we have now productive trade-offs and we have award restructuring occurring. These are significant changes which are an incentive to produce and to make a profit rather than the incentive to speculate that previously existed. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at tariffs. We can look at some of the particular industries about which we have been wanting to hear about tariff reform from our opponents. During the Opposition's time in government the tariffs on motor vehicles increased. It is this Government that has cut tariffs. It is this Government that in May cut tariffs on average by 20 per cent in manufacturing areas. If we look at clothing and footwear we find that during the Opposition's time in government clothing and footwear protection increased 1 1/2 times. It is this Government that has turned that around. If we look at the steel industry we again find a consistent approach by this Government to restructuring and applying those criteria that will give that industry the possibility of being successful again. </PARA>
<PARA> We can talk about railways. There is concern about the way railways function in this country. If we look at the Federal Government's jurisdiction-at Australian National-we find that for the first time we have a break-even position in freight carriage in this country. So there have been successes. Yet when we talk to the Opposition about deregulating wheat marketing, suddenly we find the Country Party, the National Party of Australia or whatever one wants to call it acting in the old way with all the cloak and dagger stuff in the party room. We find it saying, `Unfortunately we cannot go ahead with deregulation there because it will affect our constituency'. We hear talk about privatisation and what we are going to do about Telecom Australia. We have hairy-chested statements from members of the Opposition time and time again, but when it comes down to the crunch the National Party says, `No, we don't want to cross-subsidise in the country; we have to be careful about what we do with Telecom'. There are many reforms that have already occurred in Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear talk about Australian Airlines. What was the legacy of the previous Government? It was the two-airline agreement which will be in place until next year. My goodness! The record of the Government has been outstanding in this area. We have started to put in place all of those changes that are necessary. We are not suggesting that there is a short term solution, which this motion suggests. We are suggesting that we have put in place things that in the long term will provide for the prosperity of this country. The Opposition's record is one of failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise three separate misrepresentations, if I may. The first of these relates to a letter that has been circulated by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) in his capacity as Chairman of the Caucus Economic and Industrial Relations Committee. So far I have seen this letter appear in the Yorke Peninsula Country Times, the Liverpool Leader, the Stirling Times, the Albany Advertiser, the Adelaide Sunday Mail, the Morning Bulletin  and the Gold Coast Bulletin. In that letter, the honourable member suggests that I have been arguing for increased interest rates. He has based his case on a quote from a recent speech of mine. The misrepresentation is that this is a deliberate misquote by the honourable member. He lifted the quote from a series of paragraphs in which I was pointing out the consequences of the Government's sole reliance on high interest rates. He is wrong in claiming that I have been arguing for higher interest rates. Rather, I have been expressing concern that the Government is locked into higher interest rates as its sole response to our balance of payments, inflation and debt problems. I also mention that I made a similar personal explanation on 8 March in relation to the same paragraph, which was a repeat from an earlier speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second misrepresentation occurred in Question Time today when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) claimed to quote from the West Australian of Tuesday, 21 March when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I live in fear of some ministries: Aboriginal Affairs and Veterans' Affairs are wastes of my talents. You aspire to see your talents used in a ministerial job effectively. Ultimately, I would like to be the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that that was repeated in the West Australian of 21 March 1989, but it is one of a list of earlier comments I had made. I actually made that comment before I was elected to Parliament. It was reported on 28 June 1987 in the Times on Sunday. The misrepresentation was the impression that was left in the minds of, I believe, members of the Parliament that I made that statement on 21 March. </PARA>
<PARA> The third misrepresentation occurred today in some statements made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in answer to the final question of the day on the issue of the likely appointment of the new Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The misrepresentation there is that I have consistently argued the case for an independent Reserve Bank. I have done nothing different in this case. Indeed, I published a paper on this subject as early as 1980. I have simply been repeating the arguments that I put in that paper on the important need for an independent Reserve Bank. In those terms, I believe a replacement from the bank itself or from the financial community would be better than a shift from the Treasury. I believe in competition in economic advice, not a monopoly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The reports I have tabled relate to three projects considered by the Committee in December 1988 and bring the number of reports already presented by the Committee this year to six.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the proposal to redevelop facilities at the CSIRO North Ryde site, the Committee has concluded that to support Australia's research performance in the areas of biotechnology, mining and minerals, and energy there is a need to construct new research facilities and to replace existing inadequate structures. The cost of the work is estimated to be $18.5m at August 1988 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO informed the Committee that the current proposal is the first stage of the redevelopment of the North Ryde site. Future works are expected for the divisions of exploration, geoscience and coal technology and include progressive demolition of 1500 square metres of substandard buildings; refurbishment of 2,000 square metres of existing accommodation; construction of 8,500 square metres of new accommodation; and improvements to roads, site entry, car parks and landscaping. These works are expected to be undertaken over coming years at an estimated cost of some $40m at current prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's final report in relation to the National Biological Standards Laboratory is for the construction of a laboratory complex of some 17,900 square metres and the conversion of an existing laboratory at Symonston, Australian Capital Territory, at an estimated cost of $51.4m at July 1988 prices. The Committee tabled an interim report relating to this project on 30 November 1988 indicating that it would be recommending in its final report the construction of the works in this particular reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's inquiry into the NBSL project is the second time that a proposal to upgrade NBSL accommodation has been examined by the Committee. In its ninth report of 1979 the Committee recommended the construction of a purpose-designed complex for the NBSL at an estimated cost of $26m at June 1979 prices. Preliminary site works were completed but the project did not proceed beyond that stage due to a series of reviews and inquiries into Commonwealth functions, including the NBSL. </PARA>
<PARA> Having examined a number of the laboratories occupied by the NBSL in the Canberra area, the Committee has concluded that there is an urgent need for the construction of a single purpose-built complex for the NBSL. The Committee believes that the work is necessary to overcome the problems caused by the poor state of much of NBSL's present accommodation and its dispersed distribution over many sites and buildings which has resulted in a number of operational, managerial and scientific inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The final report I have tabled refers to the construction of a shell filling facility for St Marys Munitions Filling Factory, New South Wales, at an estimated cost of $7.7m at April 1988 prices. The new facility will replace facilities which have been operating since 1958 and have now reached the end of their economic life due to high usage and general wear and corrosion. In addition, fume, dust and noise levels exceed current regulatory standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing facility also fails to meet North Atlantic Treaty Organisation safety principles, particularly in respect to safety distances to inhabited buildings. The Department of Defence advised the Committee that it expected that urban encroachment in the longer term-that is, beyond 25 years-would require the transfer of the munitions filling factory to another location. This, when it occurs, is estimated to cost about half a billion dollars. Following assurances from the Department of Defence and in view of the excellent safety record of the St Marys Munitions Filling Factory, the Committee is satisfied that safety risks posed by the proposed facility are minimal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1989 and oppose the amendment moved by the Opposition. While the Opposition does not decline to give the Bill passage through the House, it makes two claims. One claim is that the Government is not able to appreciate the special needs for assistance for students from rural areas, and the second claim concerns the so-called turmoil caused by the Government's policies on and administration of assistance for students in higher education institutions. Those two points alone show the barrenness of the Opposition's position in relation to education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a member from part of rural Australia-the electorate of McMillan, in Victoria, takes in a large section of that State-I do not believe it could be argued in that part of the world that this Government's policies do not take account of the special needs for assistance for students from rural areas. We have in my electorate the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education which, under the policies of this Government and the initiatives of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), has in the last three months negotiated an affiliation with Monash University. So Government policies have developed to the point where people in that rural area have a direct link and contact with one of the major universities in Melbourne. Prior to that the Gippsland Institute was, of its own volition, one of the leading institutions in Australia for external studies for students from many parts of rural Victoria and rural Australia. I am positive and very confident that after the final announcements are made this week in relation to this affiliation my electorate, Victoria and Australia will be well serviced by the Gippsland education facility in conjunction with Monash University. It is something that I have been very proud to be associated with. Whilst members of the Opposition may come into this House and talk about this Government not appreciating the special needs for assistance, they are ignoring the reality of what is happening in the real world, and that is that our policies are working and working very effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The second of the Opposition's arguments suggests that our administration of assistance to students is causing turmoil. I question how members of the Opposition would judge turmoil because this was not explained by the shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale), in his speech. Not having heard the speech, I read the Hansard to see what he had to say. He certainly did not develop any evidence of any turmoil or of the problem of administration of students in higher education. He ignored what has happened as a result of Federal Labor Government policies in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy is one of the platforms of the Australian Labor Party which has been developed over the past four or five years to the point where-and I will just cite some of the figures-the number of students receiving Austudy has increased markedly, from 187,000 in 1986 to 336,000 this year. The only turmoil that could be suggested in relation to that would be that there has perhaps been a lot of paperwork required in bringing this assistance to so many extra students. </PARA>
<PARA> This is part of the approach that the Federal Government has adopted in order to turn around the tragic retention rates that existed in Australia upon our coming to government in 1983. About 36 per cent of high school students were continuing to year 12. Today we are aiming at a target of 65 per cent and the retention rate at the present time is well in excess of 50 per cent. Austudy alone has been one of the great methods of assistance to families all over Australia, and students today have a clear choice as opposed to the lack of choices in the policies that we inherited. Under those policies young people who left school could get the unemployment benefit, but if they stayed on at school they could get nothing. That one item alone demonstrated the obvious policy vacuum in the nation's education system under the previous Government, which did not face up to the real issue-that there were problems in relation to keeping our young people on at school, not just educational problems but also economic problems, which had to be tackled very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has aimed its first effort at the secondary schools. Having succeeded dramatically in lifting the participation rate at the high school level, we now have to move on and create more places in tertiary education, more places and opportunities in technical and further education colleges and in all those areas for these extra students who have been encouraged to stay at school. These students and their families have an expectation that they will be able to go on and obtain that extra education. That does not happen by chance. It will only occur if those extra places are made available. The Government's policy on this matter has been very good. Austudy was designed basically to help lower income families and to keep their children in education. </PARA>
<PARA> I will detail some of the changes which will operate in 1989. We are increasing the living allowance rates. We have higher living allowances aligned with unemployment benefit rates, particularly for disadvantaged people aged 21 years and over and for students with dependants. We have reached that point now where there is no disincentive to stay in education, and there is no positive incentive for one to leave education and take one's chances in a work force in which educated people are required. In the past many ex-students found themselves unable to get jobs because of that disincentive. We have changed the living away from home allowances. The maximum living allowance in 1989 ranges from $53.55 a week for students aged between 16 and 17 years and living at home to $116 a week for a special category of students aged 21 years or over, living away from home or independent. As I said earlier, the result of the Government's policies is that we have this massive lift in the number of students eligible for and receiving Austudy, from 187,000 in 1986 to 336,000 this year. Of course, the spending on Austudy in that time has risen from $438m to $840m this year. From the beginning of 1989 an assets test on Austudy recipients will make sure that the neediest students receive assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has been raised in the debate on this issue by our opponents on the other side of the House. A couple of speakers-the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) in particular-seemed to target in on the fact that it was a tragedy that people with great assets would no longer have the freedom to obtain Austudy payments. That may be the position of honourable members opposite but I am sure that, if they were to speak to high school students around Australia, they would find that there has been a deep resentment in the past by many families in Australia which, because of the means test on their incomes, were not eligible for Austudy yet they would see students whom they knew came from wealthy family backgrounds receiving Austudy because their taxation returns, clearly after genuine accounting, were not showing income at the levels related to the assets those families were working with. That measure has been put into place, along with other measures, which has made the system much fairer for those receiving Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take a long time debating this matter. But I believe that education is the major issue in relation to where we are going as a nation. We had those tragic seven years where I believe we did not develop the policies that should have been developed at that time. We are starting from behind now. We are behind the rest of the world in relation to what we are doing in education. That has been accepted because other nations have had much higher retention rates for a longer time. We are moving towards that. As we start to reach the point of matching the position with similar nations we will certainly see the benefit of that in our industries and in our economy. We will certainly see the benefit of that not just in the cities but also in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has put in place policies at the tertiary level. Whilst there has been a lot of discussion of white papers and green papers and comments made by people of different political persuasions, the initiative of the Minister has certainly livened up the debate on education. Amalgamations of many tertiary organisations are taking place now right across Australia. I am very pleased with what has occurred in my part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity publicly to put on the record my appreciation and the appreciation of every person who lives in my electorate of those people who took the initiative in relation to the opportunities offered by the policies of this Government. People from Monash University and from the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education immediately sat down and talked constructively to each other. People from Monash University came to the Latrobe Valley area where a task force which I established over two years ago is working for the good of the area. Some of the leading people in my community were able to take representatives from Monash University to companies such as the Australian Paper Manufacturers Maryvale mill. At this stage that company has research facilities with Monash University and with rural Australia. We were able to do this with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria which has the same facilities in our area. The Coal Corporation of Victoria and all these bodies were able to see the immediate benefits of the opportunities being put forward by this Government's policies and they publicly reacted positively to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased to be involved in a series of meetings which took place. People such as Tom Kennedy, the Director of the Gippsland Institute, Crofton Hatswell, the Chairman of the Gippsland Council and Phil Shanahan who is the Regional Commission Director, all put in an enormous amount of work and effort along with the Chancellor of Monash University, Mal Logan, and his people to bring about an affiliation. We had a big day at the Gippsland Institute some weeks ago where that affiliation took place. I was pleased to be able to invite the Minister to come to witness that affiliation. Of course, this week we are expecting announcements in relation to distance education and I am quietly confident that we have done our homework and done it well. </PARA>
<PARA> We have put forward our case in relation to what will be happening with this affiliated Gippsland and Monash education structure that we now have. It can only benefit my part of the world, it can be of great benefit to Victorians, but with the new policies I think it can be of great benefit to people all over Australia. I am very proud to have been part of what has taken place in that area and I look forward to the results. To me those results will be clearly seen by our young students-those young people who, had they been in the system 10 years ago under the previous Administration, certainly would not have had anything like the opportunities that they will have today under this Government. I am sure that those people will fully appreciate for many years to come in their working lives that the opportunity that they have had was well worth the effort that has gone into it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a lot about the so-called graduate tax; there has been a lot of debate in relation to it. As of today young people can confidently look forward to going into tertiary institutions with no up front costs, other than their own personal costs and their student union costs. No doubt, if they are fortunate enough to benefit from that education and move into the top one-third of income earners in this country they will be asked to contribute to that education. The figures that I have for school retention rates and for people coming back into education institutions show a big growth in the numbers who want to go to the Gippsland Institute and to other education organisations. This clearly indicates that the customers themselves appreciate this Government's policy. They are not boycotting it by any means. They appreciate the fact that they have a great opportunity to reach those higher income levels. That means that they will be able to afford to pay the 20 per cent that is expected and the community and the taxpayers will continue to spend their 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonsense has prevailed in this area. I believe that the public of Australia appreciates that. Looking back through the speeches of previous honourable members, in particular the Opposition spokesperson on graduate tax in the education area, the honourable member for Deakin, we see that he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We would abolish . . . indexed graduate tax, and replace it with an annual tuition charge of $600 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That will certainly be rejected by those in the community who today can go into those facilities without having to pay money up front, without having to prove their worth and then pay, as against the Liberal policy which is demanding that everybody other than scholarship holders-and we do not know who they will be-will have to fork out $600 the day they walk into a tertiary institution. I strongly support the legislation before the House. I reject the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. I appreciate having had the opportunity to speak in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1989 and an amendment, which has just been mentioned by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), proposed by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale), the very capable shadow spokesman on education for the Opposition. Prior to speaking in this debate I would just like to read out his amendment. The honourable member for Deakin moved:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) its inability to appreciate the special needs for assistance for students from rural areas; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the turmoil caused by its policies on, and administration of, assistance for students in higher education institutions'. </PARA>
<PARA>Student assistance was one of those 16 areas of commitment made by the coalition in the higher education policy released recently by the honourable member for Deakin on behalf of the coalition. In that policy the coalition commits itself to improving the support given to needy students through Austudy and Abstudy within the budgetary and debt handicaps that we know will be left to us by the Hawke Government. The coalition commits itself to reviewing thoroughly the rules and administration of Austudy to ensure consistent fairness and operational smoothness. These are things that Austudy is not renowned for under this Government. The coalition also commits itself particularly to the needs of the regional and rural students who have to travel long distances or be accommodated away from home to attend a university or a college. The commitment in the area of Austudy was but one of 16 commitments to assist young Australians into, and through, higher education. Everyone with a concern for this country's future, in terms of its institutions of learning and research and in terms of its young people, knows that this Government's policies have created turmoil in higher education in many areas. As the coalition policy document states:</PARA>
<PARA> Plans for forced amalgamation of institutions, required educational profiles, specific directions of research, `corporate-state' centralised control and taxes on students have all led to a less effective system and a loss of morale by administrators, academics and students. </PARA>
<PARA>All the student assistance in the world will not be much use if the teaching and research institutions are run down or are unable to offer places to students. Every time the Government brings in legislation such as this, we on this side have to ask the question: Why has the Government missed another opportunity to get its higher education policy and legislative framework into order? The answer is obvious: the Government is the prisoner of the conceptual and ideological constraints of the discredited higher education White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite properly, the previous debate on this Bill covered the question of income assistance for students; the question of student fees or-under this Government-taxes; the question of financial and academic autonomy for universities and colleges; and the question of expansion of student places to meet existing and future demand. Notwithstanding the noise of a few self-appointed student spokespersons and their sympathisers in some sections of the media, there is, I believe, a consensus in the community on the question of student assistance and student fees. That consensus is based on a number of views. The first is that any capable person should have the opportunity to go on to higher education, irrespective of socioeconomic background. Second, Australia benefits when its young people and workers go on to higher education. Third, individuals benefit personally and significantly from the community's investment in their intellectual and professional development via a higher degree. Fourth, most of the beneficiaries of this investment have already been beneficiaries of an upbringing in the higher socioeconomic sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point of consensus is that Australia faces severe economic restraints. There are competing social and welfare programs of importance and urgency which are just as great as the provision and expansion of publicly subsidised higher education. Sixth, given those restraints and competing needs and given the salary, status and life opportunity benefits accruing to graduates, there should be some contribution by a student to higher education costs over and above normal tax paid by all citizens. Seventh, in recognition of the benefits to the community, as a result of the skills formation and higher taxation paid from degree-related incomes, the community should contribute the bulk of funds towards higher education. Eighth, scholarships and income assistance are justified in terms of equal opportunity and incentive to study. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the consensus which I believe exists today in our community. The problem for the Government has been its inability to embody these principles in legislation in a clear, competent and productive way. The Government's approach has reflected its centralist and levelling philosophies. It has produced unnecessarily high contribution rates for students, a bureaucratic monstrosity to collect that contribution, a reduction in institutional autonomy within the system, and no resources for the current backlog of demand. The coalition policy approach does the exact opposite. It will minimise the student contribution; it will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy; it will maximise institutional freedom and diversity; it will nurture excellence; and it will provide funding for an immediate expansion of higher education places. </PARA>
<PARA> The question may well be asked: How will the coalition Government of the Leader of the Opposition do this? His Government will restore autonomy to all higher education institutions and dismantle the centralised bureaucracy and the unified national system. It will abolish the system of Commonwealth-imposed educational profiles and it will withdraw the arbitrary requirements for amalgamations imposed by the present Government. It will stimulate healthy competition among institutions which will promote excellence of achievement amongst students, staff and institutions. It will modify the Labor Government's policy guidelines for the Australian Research Council to ensure excellence and reduce bureaucratic interference, which is an element that has set the Council back. It will allow State governments more responsibility in planning the future development of higher education in their States. It will maintain, through the rolling 1989-1991 triennial system, the number of places projected in the 1988 Budget by granting national education awards. It will provide institutions with funds to allow the grant of national education scholarships, or free places, to a level no less than 25 per cent of the holders of national education awards. It will abolish the Labor Party's $1,800 indexed higher education contribution scheme, known as the graduate tax, and replace it with a $600 annual tuition charge to be paid by non-scholarship students directly or through a loan scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> A Howard government will permit institutions to offer additional places on any basis they see fit. It will facilitate, by government guarantee or other means, commercial loan arrangements for those students who wish to borrow the amount of their obligations to institutions so as to make the payment. It will encourage institutions, corporations, State and local governments, voluntary organisations, statutory authorities, business and individual donors, to provide funds for scholarships and additional places. It will allow institutions to develop new sources of revenue to supplement government funds. It will encourage the establishment of non-government higher education institutions. It will conduct an independent inquiry to ensure that the post-graduate awards system is adequate and it will thoroughly review the rules and administration of Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has no major objection to this Bill. However, its comprehensive alternative policy approach and the amendment moved by the honourable member for Deakin highlight the lost opportunity truly to reform our higher education system in the interests of the nation and in particular of the young people whom this Bill represents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in support of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1989. Although, with regard to the Bill's financial impact, the proposed amendments have no financial implications other than some minor administrative savings, the very fact that we are looking at different aspects of Austudy and policies introduced by this Government puts this Bill in context with an overall forward thrust by the Hawke Government to ensure that there is a linking of economic output with educational outcomes in a program of social reform which I believe is the best program the people of Australia have ever seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very proud to be part of the Government which implemented that program. Because of that, I am rather concerned at the tenor of the amendment put forward by the members of the Opposition. One aspect, the need for special assistance to students from rural areas, has been capably addressed by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham). He is very involved with the rural sector and goes out of his way, in Caucus, in Government meetings, and in every forum, to see that those students' interests are represented, particularly in the areas of employment, education and training. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect I view as extremely irresponsible, in the context of the serious change which Government members are trying to introduce to the benefit of Australians, is the Opposition's amendment condemning the Government for `the turmoil caused by its policies on, and administration of, assistance for students in higher education institutions'. I reject the implications of the Opposition's amendment, for it is just such irresponsible statements which paint an altogether incorrect picture in the eyes of members of the public, and particularly our student body or some sectors of it. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been unfair and ill-based criticisms distorting the Hawke Government's record in supporting Australian students. I would like to put that record straight. I do not know what the root of this distortion is, although the amendment gives me a very good idea, but it is certainly not supported by fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts show, for example, that since coming to office the Labor Government has more than tripled funding for student income support and more than doubled, in six years, the number of students assisted by the Liberals in their last year of office. I believe that part of the problem has arisen as a result of a distortion or misunderstanding of the factors underlying the imposition of the higher education contribution scheme, the so-called graduate tax. I do not attack our student body for this. I have great admiration for the quality of young Australians, both within the student body and without. There may be students who have not at this stage thought the issue through. I support the contribution scheme because I would rather see more young Australians desirous of gaining education within the student body. I know that I am not alone in this. There are many students like Michelle Healy from Bracken Ridge in my electorate who are willing to meet and desirous of meeting part of the cost of their tertiary education once they are in a decently remunerated job if it means that others can enjoy the same opportunity. I mention Michelle because she is one member of the student body who has publicly stated this opinion in Brisbane newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the desire of people to retain the benefits of a free education. I certainly give education funding high priority. It is money well spent, money which will come back to the community in a variety of ways, providing higher standards of living for all Australians. But I find no conflict between this stance and the record of my Government in providing education facilities-to the contrary. A government has at last had the fortitude to tackle a domestic deficit and an international debt which has been allowed to burgeon by governments more interested in buying their way into power through the vote than in providing a stable economy for the long term advantage of all Australians. Any commentator or observer who looks at the history of the voting pattern and of promises made at election time would have to agree with that statement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that the Government accepted the Wran recommendations on higher education. In doing so, doors have been closed on no-one. Everyone in Australia who is desirous of entering higher education and who meets certain qualifications can now enter the doors of opportunity to higher education. The number of tertiary education students will increase as a result of the imposition of the higher education contribution scheme. The resultant broadening of access to education will be entirely in keeping with this Government's record in employment, education and training. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite all Australians interested in basing their judgment and opinions on factual data to consider some key indicators of just what this Government is about. I refer firstly to our support for schools. Education is mainly a State responsibility. The States are responsible for 80 per cent of education funding. But the Federal Government is able, by targeting funding to schools, to assist in raising the quality of education offered to Australians. In this context, the general recurrent grants program is a crucial part of the national effort to strengthen Australian schools. The program aims better to prepare the nation's young people to undertake education and training after they finish school, to participate successfully in the labour market, and to contribute to and benefit from Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985, for the first time, the Labor Government started an eight-year funding plan for schools with real annual increases guaranteed in legislation. At the end of the eight-year funding period, 1985 to 1992, per capita grants to government schools will have increased in real terms by 34 per cent for each primary student and by 102 per cent for each secondary student. That is a very large increase, and it is in real terms. Grants to non-government schools will have increased in real terms by up to 40 per cent for each primary student and up to 30 per cent for each secondary student. These facts speak for themselves. They can be checked. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to touch specifically on the way in which this Government has sought and acted to protect Australian students and how we have shown our support in a tangible way. In 1982, under the Fraser Government, less than $200m was expended on student income support-$188.3m, to be exact. Since coming to office, the Labor Government has more than tripled this figure, assisting students in 1988 at a cost of over $720m. Under the Liberals, less than 116 students were assisted in 1982. In only six years the Hawke Government has more than doubled this figure, assisting over 285,000 young people to the end of 1988. Particular attention has been paid to retention rates, that is, encouraging young people to remain in school. School retention rates to year 12 increased from 36 per cent in 1983 to 58 per cent in 1988. These are just figures, but they show the manner in which this Government's policies have succeeded in tapping the great pool of young people who in the past were not staying on at school and who were not able to go on to higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> I am somewhat puzzled as to why some people should be opposing, as they are in these stringent economic times, a scheme whereby our young Australians, our young students, are given every opportunity to undertake higher education, which was not free or accessible to them at all under the National-Liberal Government, and why they feel that it will harm not only young people but people of all ages to repay part of the cost to the taxpayer of their education after they have been placed in decently remunerated positions. Certainly, recalling the time when my parents struggled and saved to be able to keep their children at school-I will always appreciate the sacrifices made by them-I cannot see what is so inherently wrong with asking our young Australians to play their part by repaying a portion of their education costs after they have received their qualifications and, hopefully, more highly remunerated jobs-after the taxpayer has paid the $10,000 to $70,000 which is the cost of the degree courses offered in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have come across many young people-I would say that this would be a majority feeling-people of strong character, who are very happy to be able to repay some of this cost, given the circumstances of the Government wishing to assist in the payment of Australia's international debt and reduce our domestic deficit, as we have done, rather than have that burden fall on their parents. I am proud of the fact that so many young people feel that way. Having received my schooling at a time when a Labor government was not in power and so many people, myself included, were not able to consider going on to tertiary education, I maintain my support for the provision and maintenance of quality education-a high standard of education-in Australia. I can maintain that belief and very easily link it to the higher education contribution scheme. The concept has been much abused in discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has shown its support for young people in education in a tangible manner. I point again to the Austudy rate. The difference between the Austudy rate and the unemployment benefit is a serious anomaly, considered by the Government to be a disincentive to continuing education. The difference is being addressed progressively. From 1989 Austudy and Abstudy rates for special disadvantaged groups have increased to the equivalent of the single rate unemployment benefit. The special groups include long-term pensioners and people who have been beneficiaries for six out of the last nine months. Aborigines and migrants undertaking special English courses have also benefited. The Government is committed to increasing gradually the level of the Austudy grant until it reaches the level of the unemployment benefit, applying to all students as Budget circumstances permit. This is very much welcomed by me and other members of the Government because we can recall the days when many parents could not afford to keep their children at high school. Austudy had not then been introduced. Those parents allowed their children to leave school to try for jobs that did not exist. That was at a time when employment, education and training programs such as those we are introducing did not exist, either. The unemployment benefit paid to such children enabled those families to meet day to day expenses. I most certainly support the goal to increase gradually the level of the Austudy grant to that of the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Budget the Government lifted the parental income threshold from $16,000 to $16,950 and the personal income threshold from $2,000 to $3,000 so that more students could take advantage of maximum benefits. Since the introduction of these changes in the last Budget, there has been an increase of around 27 per cent in the number of recipients of Austudy and 24 per cent more applications were received in 1988 than in 1987. So we are getting there. Decentralisation of Austudy administration to Commonwealth Employment Service offices around the country will ensure greater access to information and assistance, particularly for those living in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention a couple of other areas in which the Government has been particularly active. One is the special assistance for students program. Under the program, funds are provided to help educational institutions assist needy students who might face financial difficulties while studying. The institutions are responsible for the administration of funds which are distributed to students as low cost loans and grants. Assistance is available to students who demonstrate a genuine need, particularly those who require assistance for accommodation or for other circumstances which may place their continued study in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint and integrated programs covering employment, education and training are also starting to bear fruit. The Government has been very concerned about the incidence of teenage unemployment. My home State of Queensland has a particularly bad record in this respect. The proportion of the teenage population looking for full-time work has dropped from 12.2 per cent in 1983 to 6.6 per cent in December 1988. We welcome that drop, but we will not be satisfied until the figure goes right down and all teenagers wanting work are able to get jobs. Meanwhile, we are pleased to see the teenage unemployment rate going in the right direction. In March 1989 the unemployment rate for teenagers descended to its lowest level for more than 10 years. I say that with profound relief. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased with what the Government has done for people with specific difficulties. I am referring now to the Aboriginal unemployment, education and training programs. Aboriginal participation in post-compulsory education reflects considerable inequity between Aboriginal people and other Australians. This just is not right in a free country, a democracy. Aboriginal participation in years 11 and 12, technical and further education (TAFE) and higher education is only about one-third of the corresponding participation rates for the community as a whole. However, there have been considerable improvements in recent years. The retention rate of Aboriginal students until year 12 has increased significantly, from about 11 per cent in 1982 to nearly 20 per cent in 1987. Similarly, Aboriginal enrolments in higher education increased from about 700 to 2,400 between 1983 and 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal education policy task force found in 1988 that education participation and retention rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students were still proportionately well below those of their non-Aboriginal counterparts. The Government cannot accept these inequities. Of course they are just some of the general inequities suffered by the Aboriginal population over many years. The Government, when looking at employment, education and training policies, will make a special effort to target these injustices to see that they are rectified. Technical and further education is another area in which the Federal Government is supporting the States. The Federal Labor Government is providing more than $180m in direct grants to the States to expand the capacity of TAFE colleges so that they will be able to accept more people for training, particularly in areas of skill shortages, and to strengthen training in areas of new industrial developments. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to outline some of the areas in which the real concern of members of the Hawke Government has been translated into a tangible effort, by the Government's putting its money where its mouth is in its desire to bring into operation in Australia employment, education and training policies which will bring up to the optimum level the potential of our young Australians, who will be the leaders of the future. I entirely support the efforts of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan). I am very happy to take this opportunity to support publicly our integrated programs of social reform in the areas of employment, education and training. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) has ranged far and wide, canvassing a variety of issues; so, in coming back to the Student Assistance Amendment Bill, I note that it proposes a number of changes to the Student Assistance Act, which gives the statutory basis for Austudy and postgraduate awards. As noted in one part of our recently released and widely acclaimed higher education policy, Austudy has been bedevilled by administrative deficiencies and suffers from continuing allegations of unfairness in the award of benefits. It is a mess, a disgrace, bedevilled by inefficiencies, abuses and inequities. These proposed changes will effect some improvement, but they are by no means far-reaching enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to point to this contrast: here we have a Bill before us amending arrangements with respect to Austudy, streamlining it somewhat and, hopefully therefore, improving assistance to students, while on the other hand the Government has just introduced a punitive graduate tax, to which the honourable member for Lilley referred, which will do anything but assist students and particularly will discourage-is discouraging-postgraduate work, postgraduate students. I will come back to that. </PARA>
<PARA> More generally, I want to contrast the Government's approach to student assistance and a more effective development of higher education with the Opposition's approach in the recently released policy that I referred to. As I said, even with this Bill the Government has not addressed some of the major difficulties with Austudy and certainly not the difficulties with the funding of postgraduate students and research. We have a government that has little faith in educational institutions, in our leading academics or, for that matter, in our students. Reflecting that, we have a Government which thinks, in a typically socialist approach, that the only way we can run and reform higher education is to centralise control in a Canberra bureaucracy. Particularly in this higher education field it would force institutions to a significant extent to teach what it, the Government, wants them to teach through Commonwealth imposed educational profiles. It is a Government which attempts to amalgamate institutions under the threat and coercion of loss of funds, in the pursuit of some notion of efficiency. It has the effect, of course, that there are fewer of them to deal with, and to manipulate. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Government has thought it necessary to siphon off research funds and then allocate them via the Australian Research Council in accordance with some inevitably nebulous and rapidly changing Government perception of the national interest-potentially at the cost of excellence and of the flourishing of postgraduate research and, indeed, of the development, nurture, of the next generation of front rank scientists in this country. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to contrast that with our Liberal and National Party policy aimed at fostering a strong, dynamic and, in the interest of assisting students, expanding, forward-looking higher education system. Central to that policy is to open up the system and to allow it to react to market forces, with productive competition between institutions and corresponding greater excellence of achievement. We will implement-I am assuming that the election is already over and won-a system of student driven enrolments that gives choice for the student and competition between institutions. As I said, we are aiming at fostering a strong, dynamic, expanding, forward-looking higher education system to the greater benefit of and assistance to students-a system firmly founded on the principles of excellence in academic standards, opportunity on the basis of merit, healthy competition-I stress that again-and responsible autonomy for universities and colleges of advanced education. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context a student contribution or a student charge inevitably plays a role. The beginning argument for that is that students who benefit from higher education should be required to make some contribution towards the additional employability and earning power that they have as a result of their higher education. That is a reasonable argument. I believe that most people accept that. I stress that that much at least is common ground between the Government and the Opposition. But a student contribution is important from another standpoint. As the noted commentator Mr P. P. McGuinness once put it:</PARA>
<PARA>Pay peanuts, get monkeys. </PARA>
<PARA>Or, changing the metaphor and still quoting Mr McGuinness:</PARA>
<PARA>If you make education available for nothing, it will be fed to pigs. Moreover, if the producers are paid regardless of quality and know that their product is going to be cast before swine, they will produce a product which is fit for pigs. </PARA>
<PARA>In a sense that is putting it a bit strongly, but what is important, looking at the matter from this standpoint, is to ensure, firstly, that higher education is valued by those who receive it and, secondly, that the quality of higher education offered is worthwhile. I submit that that is why, in addition to the beginning argument that I referred to a moment ago, some form of student charge is important. It means that a school leaver or other prospective student looking to tertiary study will have cause to think closely and seriously about what the study is worth, be it in the form of future income or in terms of self-improvement. There is an incentive to study and work hard, complete the course and get an adequate return for the cost. Further, where the student knows that he or she will be paying some significant sum there will also be incentive to seek out an institution and within that institution a course of study and group of lecturers and professors which offer value for money. It is this that promotes the competition between institutions that in our view fosters performance and excellence on their part but, indeed, with responsible autonomy and the minimum of central control. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context the Government has come up with the infamous graduate tax, the higher education contribution scheme (HECS), whereas we in the coalition propose a system of awards, scholarships, charges and loans more favourable both to students and institutions and certainly more efficacious in the incentive and competition stimulating role that I have just described. The system we propose is of a student contribution or tuition charge of a much lesser order per annum than the $1,800 or up-front $1,530 of the Labor Party, a student contribution we propose to be paid at the time, of $600 per annum. Such a procedure certainly, I suggest, gives the right signals in the context to which I have been referring. The difficulty with the graduate tax from that standpoint is that while it also is put forward in part with the same objectives, the signals it gives will be muffled and distorted and a poor substitute indeed. In making that point, it is not the only objection to the graduate tax. An important one in my book is the totally obnoxious situation that the student under the graduate tax system becomes in a sense an object of pursuit, via the tax file number, for many years until that tax is paid. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certainly other objections, in particular that it provides a very significant disincentive to students particularly from low income families and otherwise disadvantaged backgrounds to enter higher education. A further objection is that that graduate tax burden will in most cases strike graduates when they face the burdens of home purchase and family support. A very important objection is that it will greatly inhibit post-graduate study and research, the scientific research which is so essential in the long run to the economic growth and prosperity of this country. What I have in mind there is the number of years it takes a higher education student to get through to the postgraduate and research level. The obligation that students build up over that period may be as much as $10,000 or $15,000. That will discourage students from going on to postgraduate work and engaging in the research which is so vital to the country and to the training of the next generation of front rank Australian scientists. That is a very important objection, and there are others. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus the graduate tax gives no incentive to the individual institutions providing tuition. The money goes to the Government and, therefore, the institution derives no discretionary spending money from it. Further, there is no direct link between the proceeds of the tax and higher education funding in total. Although nominally earmarked in a trust fund, the proceeds form only a small part of total higher education funding, subject to government decision. So on those grounds the so-called graduate tax is not appropriate. I say then that it is proper and appropriate that there be a student contribution, a student charge, and this is best done by way of our suggested procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast the whole Government approach with what the coalition will do, as the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale), set out in his speech. In addition to thoroughly recasting Austudy, the coalition, when in government, will restore responsible autonomy to all higher education institutions. We will dismantle the centralised bureaucracy of the so-called unified national system. We will abolish the system of Commonwealth-imposed educational profiles. We will withdraw the requirements for arbitrary amalgamation. As I have suggested, and this is central to our approach, we will stimulate healthy competition between institutions. We will modify the policy of concentrating research funding with the Australian Research Council and we will modify the policy guidelines of the Australian Research Council so as to ensure excellence and reduce bureaucratic interference. Through the 1989-1991 triennial system we will maintain the number of places provided for in the 1988 Budget, involving of the order of 400,000 places. Under our policy these `national education awards' will be made essentially on the basis of merit. </PARA>
<PARA> Very importantly in the context of student assistance, which is the issue before the House, we will provide the institutions with funds to allow the grant of `national education scholarships' to no fewer than 25 per cent of the holders of the awards. I would stress in that context that these free places, which will not attract the $600 charge, will be awarded by the institutions themselves on the basis of merit and need as they see fit. In other words, the 25 per cent will be allocated across the institutions and they will award them as they see fit. This is done basically to ensure that all the institutions will have an opportunity to participate in the process of scholarship awards. Otherwise the danger is that the top Higher School Certificate prospective medical and legal students who apply to enter universities in Sydney and Melbourne will tend to win them all. To repeat then, we will abolish the Labor Party's $1,800 a year indexed graduate tax and replace it with an annual student contribution or tuition charge of $600 to be paid by the non-scholarship student directly or through a loans scheme. I quote from page 4 of our policy:</PARA>
<PARA> The next Liberal/National Government will facilitate, by Government guarantee or other means, commercial loan arrangements with generous repayment periods for those students who wish to borrow the $600 in order that payment can be made to the institution. This will ensure that no prospective student is denied access to higher education through inability to meet their contribution towards tuition costs. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to stress that. Further, we will permit institutions to offer additional places on any basis they see fit. In sharp contrast to what the Government is doing in terms of discouraging very low income and postgraduate students and centralising control of the higher education system through the unified national system, we would open out the whole system so that there would be broader choice for students, greater excellence in the system, and wider diversity and competition between institutions, leading to the development of the more effective, expanding, dynamic, forward looking higher education system this country needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate to make just a few comments and to point out that I usually follow the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) when we are considering economic matters. I must compliment him once again. Usually he gives a great amount of detail and specific information to the House and to the electorate about the matter before the House. In contrast, however, when the Student Assistance Amendment Bill was last before the House on 9 March, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) spent a great deal of time on irrelevant material and made a weak attempt at political point scoring. Perhaps it was because the honourable member for Deakin had very little of substance to say or was, in fact, unprepared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I read the honourable member's speech in detail. He admitted that he had spoken for 12 minutes before he really got into it. On at least six occasions he was pulled up by the Deputy Speaker for being irrelevant to the Bill. One speaker in the debate described his contribution as `brave but revealing his inability to comprehend the complexities of higher education in our nation'. Another speaker said that it was `amusing but erroneous'. I point this out because the honourable member for Deakin is the Opposition spokesman on education and so his speech should be analysed and commented upon. People, students, expect far better than the honourable member for Deakin contributed that night. I suppose he could be excused as it was delivered at 8 o'clock, just after the resumption of the sitting after dinner, and that may have upset his continuity of thought. The amendment he placed before the House was not circulated before the dinner break and maybe he spent that time putting it together. However, on reading the amendment one saw that it suggested no alternative; it suggested nothing specific in its place. The honourable member laboured mightily to produce very little. </PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member talked about the proposed amalgamations of higher education institutions-or, shall we say, further amalgamation, because these did take place under the Fraser Government-he took a very elitist view of tertiary education and dismissed amalgamations as `pedantic and churlish'. I suspect that this elitist view of higher education may come from his own experience, having gone only to universities-Sydney University and Harvard, a private university in the United States. I should put it on record that I have attended a college of advanced education-the Pharmacy College in Melbourne which, incidentally, is soon to be amalgamated with the Melbourne University-and I am a graduate of Melbourne and Monash universities. So I have had experience of both sides of the binary system. The binary system has come under a cloud because it has been overtaken by many developments. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition, such as the honourable member for Deakin, still think of the colleges of advanced education-the CAEs-as advanced technical schools, forgetting or ignorant of the fact that time and development have led to their having nurse education, economics degrees, arts degrees, engineering, legal studies and so on. It still remains true, as it was in the early days for products of the early CAEs, that employers greatly prefer students who are graduates of CAEs. The CAE students should feel very proud of their achievements and not feel denigrated by deprecatory comments such as those made by the honourable member for Deakin. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal in a little more detail with the amalgamations themselves. To me, they can make a lot of sense. There should be some questioning as to whether particular amalgamations are proper. However, amalgamations signal the end of the strict binary system. They acknowledge that research is valuable in its pure or applied form. They recognise that some overlapping can be dispensed with. Furthermore, they will ease the transfer between those who have undertaken CAE courses to university courses and vice versa. We should have greater flexibility and interchanges between the different institutions. This will come about more readily through amalgamations, and it is in recognition of the greater equality in the standard of the many courses of the CAEs and universities. When we introduce legislation at State level or Territory level we should be clear that if we are to bring about amalgamation we should protect the unique features of both the CAEs and the universities which are worth protecting. I signal that in a debate later in this House that will become clear when we talk about amalgamations in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Deakin pointed out that I was spending a bit more time in the House than he had noticed before. He called it `a concertina of experience'. I would inform the honourable member that I have always been most interested in higher education and in education generally, having been the secretary of a higher education union for five years. However, I point out that since redistribution in Victoria, the honourable member's electorate of Deakin has become a notional Labor seat. Therefore, the squeeze is now on the honourable member for Deakin. One has noticed the troubled music produced by this squeeze box. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also talked about abolishing the assets test for isolated students. He said, `We will establish a realistic assets test, including a hardship test'. The electorate becomes very confused because, although Opposition members say that they oppose the assets test which this Government has brought in and they would bring in another, they give not details. There has been not a refutation of what the Government has done, but only wordy rhetoric-just words, but no details. I point out to the electorate and to the House that if there are to be pretenders to government and pretenders to the position of Minister of Education, they should give information, details and a clearly enunciated policy to allow people to make their own judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) pointed out, isolated students, students in the country, will not suffer because of the assets test. It will mean that more funds will be made available to go to those who need financial assistance to leave the country and to come to universities and CAEs, or to the amalgamated bodies which are largely based in the cities but which are increasingly in provincial towns and cities throughout Australia. Through the distance education courses which are being developed through cooperation such as that which has taken place between Monash University and the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education, under the vibrant leadership of the Vice-Chancellor of Monash, Mal Logan, far more educational opportunities will be given to students in the country who cannot attend the institutes of learning. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Deakin attacked Austudy yet failed to point out that under the Liberal Government only 116,000 students were assisted in this way, whereas last year under the present Government 285,000 students were so assisted. Opposition members are never specific on details, or on matters of real political significance. They are always saying that they will produce policies on important matters such as taxation, but as month after month rolls by, we hear nothing from the Opposition. Education is no exception. In this specific case the amendment moved by the honourable member is a mishmash of generalities; it is so vague as to be utterly meaningless. In regard to Austudy the honourable member for Deakin said, `The Liberal and National parties will in government thoroughly review the rules and administration of Austudy to ensure that they are fair to all and that the scheme runs smoothly', but again the Opposition gives no details. This Government is in government because it is prepared to make the system run smoothly and to make it fairer, and it has brought in this legislation to ensure that that happens.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has backed up the system with money. It has tripled the amount of income support for students. Under the Liberal Government in 1982 Austudy was funded at around $188m, and Labor has increased that figure to $840m. Why should the Government increase that amount? It has done so not only to make higher education more accessible, but because more and more secondary students are qualifying for higher education and need to be assisted. In 1983 just over one in three students completed year 12 or secondary school, but now almost 60 per cent finish year 12 successfully and would be able to take up the opportunities of higher education. So Austudy not only has to be more extensive; it is of a higher quality and is better targeted than ever before. I would point to the fact that 42 per cent of tertiary students now get Austudy and 40 per cent of secondary students aged 16 and over also benefit in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> The contribution to the debate by the honourable member for Berowra related to the introduction of the higher education contribution scheme, under which students will be required to repay $1,800 a year should they complete a full time year based on their future income and an indexed arrangement will apply. The Opposition would introduce, so it says, a $600 fee. Students would pay this whether or not they could afford to do so. Let us contrast the two systems, and as I have only a minute or so left of my speaking time I shall attempt to put the matter in a nutshell. The Liberals' charge would be on anyone and there is no guarantee of a limit. It is an open-ended policy which could quickly inflate well over the $600 figure, and could well exceed the Government's proposed $1,800. On the other hand, the Government will ask only for those fees or for that charge to be repaid should a student's income rise above $22,000. This does not penalise those who study for self-fulfilment rather than income. It does not penalise pensioners who wish to study, and it does not put off those marginal students who are weighing up whether a decision should be made involving immediate income versus a study outlay. Any student who undertakes higher education under a Liberal coalition, if one can call it that, would pay a minimum of $600 and that could blow out. If Opposition members believe that there has been some outrage over the higher education contribution scheme, then that will pale in comparison with the tumultuous uproar that would ensue over the open-ended Liberal fees to be charged. I reject the amendment and support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate has ranged wide and far, and the further we have got into the debate the more that has been true. I wish to remind the House and those who are interested in this debate that the substance of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill is Austudy and student assistance-not the plethora of other educational issues that were raised in the debate. This is a small Bill which is designed to bring about a number of technical drafting reforms. One is to make changes to ensure that the regulations under the legislation can be changed appropriately to simplify the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted a couple of matters that I thought were appropriate for me to respond to. I heard a great deal said by individual members on the other side about anomalies in the Austudy scheme, what a shambles it was, et cetera. I reject all of that sort of wide-ranging but unsubstantiated allegation. The fact is that under the previous Fraser-Howard regime only 116,000 students were receiving the then income support under the range of income support for students schemes it had operating. Under Austudy we have seen an absolute explosion of eligible young people. This year the estimate is that there will be approximately 340,000 young people benefiting from Austudy. We have seen an enormous expansion of the system since Austudy was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> It is designed, of course, to ensure that no young person should have to leave school or further education because of financial difficulties. Certainly the scheme has been an outstanding success in ensuring that. The evidence for that is that we have seen the retention rates in our school system go up from the quite disgraceful 36 per cent retention to year 12 rate in the last year of the Fraser-Howard Government to the quite encouraging level of 58 per cent last year. We are aiming to see retention rates increase to 65 per cent by 1992. We are well on target to do that. I have every confidence that we will see that target met. As I have said, one of the principal reasons why that target is being met and why we are being so successful is that the Austudy scheme we have operating assists and enables many young people who otherwise would be forced out of education to remain to get qualifications which will be of benefit to them and to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The one other matter I refer to which has been raised is the impact of the assets test. It is being paraded by many people on the other side as a matter of grave concern or gloom and doom to them. I simply tell the House that early figures, to the end of February 1989, indicate that 348 Austudy applicants were ruled ineligible because of the assets test across the nation. That figure was out of a total of 152,000 applications that had been processed at that point. Under the aid for isolated children scheme, 67 applicants had been ruled ineligible because of the income test. The assets test, of course, does not affect students' right to the income test free component. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At that stage 5,000 applications had been processed. That gives the House some indication of the impact of the assets test on those who have applied this year. There would be other people, no doubt, who have not applied, who would not be included in those statistics. But, even so, it indicates that the test has not had the dramatic impact that some honourable members opposite had alleged. Having dealt with those two points, I do not think there is any point in my continuing to go over the wide-ranging issues which were dealt with and in respect of which this Bill was used as the peg on which to hang them. Accordingly, I simply recommend the legislation to the House and to the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill before the House amends the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980 and has other related purposes. The Bill, by way of clause 3, increases the duty on exported uranium concentrate mined in the Alligator Rivers region from $1.02 a kilogram to $1.15 a kilogram. The principal Act was last amended in the 1987 Budget, when the duty was lifted from 80c to $1.02 per kilogram. Between 1980 and 1987, the duty was 11c per kilogram. Allow me to restate those figures because I will be referring to them again during the course of my address. Between 1980 and 1987 the Federal Government imposed a duty of 11c per kilogram on exported uranium concentrate mined in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory-better known as the Ranger mine. Then in the 1987 Budget the duty was lifted from 80c to $1.02 a kilogram. Now the Government intends to lift it yet again, to $1.15 a kilogram.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`About time' interjects the honourable member for Dunkley. That sort of trite, superficial interjection shows up the ideological bent of this Government. It is going to tax out of existence one of our most important export oriented industries. I will come quickly to the point that I wish to make. This duty now forms about 5 per cent of the operating costs of Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA), the operators of the Ranger mine. This duty meets the bulk of the costs borne by the Commonwealth Government for its environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region. These research activities are carried out by the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers region, better known as OSS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The financial impact of the proposed duty is that it is expected to raise an additional $800,000 during the 1988-89 financial year. The anticipated recovery for the financial year 1988-89 is $4.5m. The duty is indicative of the Government's strategy of discriminating against productive industries which are struggling to maintain a competitive edge in the world market. How many times does this Government introduce legislation in this House which discriminates against our export oriented industries, whether they be in primary industry or mineral extraction? The fact is that in corrupt world markets our exporters cannot compete because they have one hand tied behind their backs. They are being crushed by heavy government costs and charges. Not only is the duty a heavy disincentive to our uranium export market but also it is discriminatory in that its application falls disproportionately upon one company alone. It is a duty or a levy upon ERA alone. It is even more absurd when it is considered that the levy is imposed on an industry which would undoubtedly contribute to this country's economic well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy on uranium oxide is a further example of the Government's damaging and confusing policy approach to uranium as a whole. It is a policy which is founded on the ideological rifts and intraparty fighting within the Australian Labor Party (ALP). It is a policy which makes no good economic sense and one which expresses interests of the Labor Party ahead of and above those of the nation as a whole. Strictly speaking, the purpose of the Bill is to increase the duty on exported uranium concentrate, but the truth is it is a tax raising revenue which may well satisfy some sections of the Government's secret agenda-which is to wipe out the uranium export industry. If the Government cannot do that because of political realities, then it will make sure that the industry slowly bleeds to death. Honourable members should bear in mind that when the previous coalition Government imposed the levy in 1980, as part of the principal Act which is being amended, the duty stood at 11c a kilogram. Now, it is a whopping $1.15 a kilogram. The justification for this price hike, according to the Government's rhetoric in the second reading speech, is to offset the costs of the Commonwealth-funded environmental monitoring and reporting procedures which operate in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Though, in the past, the Government has claimed that the levy is designed to fund increasingly greater proportions of the operating research costs of the OSS, the pattern of government charges is clear enough. The objective of this levy is to add to Consolidated Revenue. It is an instrument of the Australian Taxation Office used in an arbitrary manner. By and large the levy falls upon the shoulders of one company alone-Energy Resources of Australia, operators of the Ranger mine. It is therefore discriminatory. As the Nabarlek mine owned by Queensland Mines Ltd, also based in the Alligator Rivers region, ceased production as of last year and is now only fulfilling its contracts and dispersing its store of uranium oxide, the present and future burden of the tax falls upon the Ranger mine alone. The tax is clearly punitive upon Ranger.</PARA>
<PARA> Between 1980 and 1986, when the levy amounted to 11c per kilogram of uranium export, Ranger paid on average $270,000 during these years, while Nabarlek, the lesser of the two producers in the region, averaged a payment of $93,000 for the same period. So the levy imposed by a coalition government remained at 11c between 1980 and 1986. It is important to remember the drastic price hike that has occurred since 1986. The Government now intends imposing a $1.15 levy on every kilogram. Across 1986-87, when the levy jumped from 11c to 80c per kilogram, Ranger paid $2.237m while Nabarlek was required to hand over to the Government some $1.2m. With the levy at $1.02 since 1987-it jumped from 80c to $1.02 within 12 months-Ranger was taxed $3.7m and Nabarlek $1.2m. The latest increase in the levy to $1.15 will bring the Government over $4 1/2m from Ranger and this is set to rise again in July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Budget Paper No. 1 tells us that the levy will be increased yet again to $1.30 per kilogram which will require Ranger to hand over more than $10m between July this year and June 1991. By contrast, as Nabarlek's stockpile of uranium oxide is depleted by 1990, it will pay only $2.9m-and all of this on the spurious claim that the funding of the OSS at its present exorbitant levels is vital and necessary to the environmental protection of the Alligator Rivers region. Utter bunkum! Anybody who has been up to that area would know that about 50 members of the OSS are standing around with nothing to do. The biggest event for some of them is to go out to the Alligator Rivers, collect some water and test it. It is an absurdity to be maintaining people with such excellent qualifications in such a useless task. The truth of the matter is that the taxation and charges regime under which the uranium industry attempts to operate in the international market is already a sufficient disincentive to international competitiveness by itself without the extra burden of this levy.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the tax regime affecting Ranger in 1988. Provision for current income tax was $60.4m-49 per cent on an operating profit of $123m. Twelve million dollars went to Aboriginal interests; $5.3m for rehabilitation fund trust payments; and $3.5m for royalties. All up, Ranger paid roughly $86m in taxes and charges in the last financial year. The levy is even more unreasonable given that Ranger, in effect, is directly subsidising research in the Alligator Rivers region. Ranger has developed its own research laboratories in parallel with those of the OSS. Ranger attempts to carry out that research upon which practical sets of standards might be based. This is the down-to-earth research which can give rise to guidelines which can be applied to the industry in the environmentally sensitive wetland area of the Alligator Rivers region of Kakadu Park. It is also the research that the OSS has failed to come up with. </PARA>
<PARA> The extended studies into baseline research by the OSS has its merits but those merits do not extend to practical applications for the industry. Ranger's own environmental department consists of 40 professional, technical and support personnel working within high quality laboratories. For this reason it would be a better idea by far and in the context of the coalition's science policy-the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) who is present for this debate, having been a shadow Minister for science, knows better than anybody else that it is a far better idea-if the more esoteric research functions of the OSS were to be transferred to the Northern Territory college; and Ranger, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Northern Territory Government were left with the prime, although not the sole, responsibility for the oversight of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> It is duplication and, at its worst, at a bureaucratic level which can only harm an industry, to maintain the OSS in its present form. The duplication of research which is currently a concern to all parties would also be finally overcome if such a reallocation of research efforts were to be implemented. This is despite the recent disparaging and ill-founded remarks by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) regarding the harmless overspill from the Ranger waste site. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987-88 the research cost to the OSS was $4.7m-75 per cent of its $6m budget. In addition to funding the research not effectively carried out by the OSS, Ranger also subsidises the operations of the OSS as they are applied to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd gold mine at Coronation Hill. Coronation Hill is not subject to a levy, even though the waste of any sort of mining in a fragile environment can be detrimental to tourism and the environment. Of course, the ecosystem can so easily be affected from the waste from any mining operation. The discriminatory nature of the levy is made clearer in a broader context. The Roxby Downs Olympic Dam mine, although in a dry yet fragile environment, is not subject to any duty on its exports, nor is it intended to impose a duty on the Kintyre mine should the Government have the good sense to allow it to develop. Kintyre, owned by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd (CRA), is located in the Rudall River National Park on the fringe of Western Australia's Great Sandy Desert. Generally, the reason for these inconsistencies is that the duty is a political decision designed solely to relieve the guilt-ridden consciences of the Left of the ALP. Like the three-mine policy it lacks good economic sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel very strongly that the levy is inappropriately high and that the role and functions of the OSS have to be called into question, looked at and restructured. Moreover, I believe that the inconsistencies lead to a discriminatory burden being placed upon ERA. I hasten to add that neither I nor any member of the coalition parties would argue for extending the levy to some of the uranium or other mining ventures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the three-mine policy. The market for uranium is set to expand in the 1990s. Australia has the largest reserves of low to medium cost recoverable uranium reserves in the world. It also has mines, such as Jabiluka, which are yet to be permitted to come on stream which have been described by internationally recognised authorities as not just world class mines but mines which are the best in the world. A number of studies show that, although prices for uranium on the international market are depressed for the moment, they are set to peak in the late 1990s. There is then the necessity to move quickly to take advantage of international demand which is now upon us and which is referred to by the Chairman of CRA, Mr John Uhrig, in a recent speech as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe the international uranium market is about to undergo a critical transition which presents Australia with a rare opportunity. The current policy of allowing some mines, while disallowing others will cause us to miss that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>We have missed opportunities in the past. Slowness in capitalising on our natural uranium advantage in the 1970s and 1980s enabled the Canadian uranium mines to develop their operational effectiveness and become a dominant supplier of uranium in the world today. In effect, we have subsidised Canadian living standards at the expense of our own. </PARA>
<PARA> Let the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) tell that to the people of Australia. Let his Government explain to them why other countries in the world are growing rich at our expense. Would anybody deny that the Australian standard of living has plummeted in recent years? Let the Minister tell the Australian people why, with only 10 per cent of the world's reserves, Canada has been able to supply 30 per cent of the world's demand. Let him also tell them how it is that Australia possesses 30 per cent of the world's reserves, but the three-mine policy has restricted us to meeting only 10 per cent of the world demand. </PARA>
<PARA> We know we are being given another opportunity in the 1990s. The critical time in which to move is now. In 1992-93 the Japanese contracts with the major Ontario buyers will expire. This will mean that if Australian producers are to enter into contract negotiations they must be able to present their tenders as soon as possible. Deliveries will have to start in 1995. The Canadian producers are set to reap the profits once again because of the political paralysis of the ALP. There is demand in the world for uranium. The Energy 2000 report indicates this. The industry is telling us this and is hankering to be let of the leash. It is only the Government which refuses to listen for fear of unleashing the contending forces within its own ranks. It is scared to move for fear of splitting the Party right down the middle; it is prepared to sacrifice the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Though world prices are currently low, future exports will be written with regard to the then prevailing spot price. In fact, most long-term contracts now being completed are set at between $US20 and $US30 per pound. Even though the current spot price is low, hovering between $US10 and $US11, only about 10 per cent of all contracts are negotiated on this basis. The vast majority of contracts are written on a long-term basis-I stress that-which varies markedly from the more volatile spot price. The only impediment to pricing mechanisms is the Government's retention of a floor price, a protection measure implemented in an earlier period by the coalition to enable the then fledgling Ranger project to raise loans in order to commence production. The floor price has served its useful life and now only puts us at a commercial disadvantage to the Canadians, who are operating within a much freer, less regulated pricing system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has justified the Government's position on the basis of market limitations on uranium demand. If this is so, then let us deregulate the market, expose it to the international market, and let us see whether only three mines survive. Nobody has to help Pancontinental Mining Ltd, itching to get into the marketplace; nor does anybody have to have regard to CRA. Let them get in. Let them spend their money. Let them be accountable to their shareholders. But let us not cut them out by the Government's economically nonsensical policy. It must be remembered that the international market operates in quite lengthy time frames. New long-term contracts are entered into many years before the actual period of utilisation. The rate at which the utilities consume is no indicator of what the level of demand might be at any point. Demand is also influenced by political and strategic factors on the part of foreign governments. The West German initiative in buying large stocks of uranium from the Russians, not for its own needs but to exploit market conditions with United States buyers, is a dangerous omen. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding these market characteristics, which the Government overlooks or wishes would go away, Pancontinental has gone to extremes in order to accommodate the Government. It has offered to reshape the Jabiluka project and reduce its capacity of 3,000 tonnes of export per annum to 1,500 tonnes per annum in order not to create imbalances in what some perceive to be a tight international market at this time. All of this is to enable it to lock into the opportunities of the next decade. They are looking ahead. Under the present policy of restricted production we can produce only up to 7,500 to 8,000 tonnes of uranium by the year 2000. According to the latest Red Book and industry figures, uranium demand will reach between 53,000 and 61,000 tonnes in the year 2000. Some industry statistics even suggest that the cumulative gap between production and demand could be as great as 100,000 tonnes between 1989 and 1996. </PARA>
<PARA> Global demand for nuclear-powered electricity generation continues to grow. By the year 2000 nuclear power plants will generate 20 per cent of the world's electricity needs. If unleashed, the Australian industry could produce up to 20,000 tonnes at the critical moment, but if it is to seize the opportunity presented by increased demand and higher prices in the 1990s, industry must be given the go ahead now to enter into long-term contracts with the international marketplace. Nuexco, in its recent publication Prospects for Australian Uranium, indicated that by the late 1990s there will have been an increase of 50 per cent over the current long-term prices. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the first blows to the industry's international credibility was the coming to power of the Hawke Labor Government. In March 1983 it stripped such mines as Pancontinental's Jabiluka of its letters of determination, hence stopping it from entering into any negotiations with potential buyers. This was at a time when Jabiluka had already signed up 50 per cent of its annual production for sale. If the industry is going to capitalise on the window of opportunity opening up in the 1990s it must have its letters of determination renewed. If the Government were to unshackle the industry, by the year 2000 we would see up to 20,000 tonnes of uranium exported. This would amount to direct mining sales of $1.6 billion per year. If we were to move into the front end of the fuel cycle, we could earn between $3.7 and $7.6 billion per year for conversion and enrichment, storage and transport, disposal and treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the world demand for uranium, which in the words of the chairman of Pancontinental, Mr Tony Grey, is `marching ahead at a vigorous pace', is seeking out Australia as a supplier. South African and Namibian suppliers are being shunned for political reasons and the market is suspicious of the cartel-like overtones of the present sources of supply. The majority of world supply is tied up by three companies. There is demand for diversification of sources of supply. The failure to bring on stream such deposits as Koongarra and Jabiluka in the Northern Territory alone has already cost us $1.1 billion in lost rent. However, imagine the multiplier effect if we brought on stream such deposits as Jabiluka and Koongarra in the Northern Territory; Yeelirrie, Kintyre and Lake Way in Western Australia; Ben Lomond in Queensland, and Beverley and Honeymoon in South Australia. This would create roughly 5,000 direct and permanent jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Government has abdicated its responsibilities in this area. At its last national conference in June 1988 in Hobart, it formed a uranium review committee. Even though this committee was officially formed last December, there was a six-month delay until it got the factional balance right. Now we are told that it will not report to the Labor Party until December of this year. </PARA>

<PARA> The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious. I have set out the figures showing the importance to Australia of a sensible, rational, economically based uranium export policy. We should bear in mind that if we lose contracts today, as we are doing, we lose them for many years because our competitors are able to develop as a result. By not being in the market we are allowing our competitors to establish new mining operations which could last for 20 years. We are harming Australia for 20 years by giving our competitors a head start. We have done it in the past and South Africa and Canada have profited as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of tremendous concern to the Opposition and to the Australian people at large that the Hawke Labor Government would so stupidly sell our interests down the drain. For this reason, I move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) imposing a discriminatory levy upon one operation alone at a time when Australia's uranium exporters are struggling to remain competitive in the international market and are already overburdened by excessive taxes and charges; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) its ideological approach to the development of Australia's uranium industry which has resulted in an economically absurd `three mine policy'. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment incorporates the two bases of the coalition's opposition to the Government's handling of the uranium policy. We will not be opposing this legislation, for it falls within a Budget measure, but we have made known loud and clear our opposition to every aspect of the Government's handling of uranium, not only because Australia's national interests are being sold down the drain, but also because the two mines that are still operating-bear in mind that Nabarlek has more or less ceased to operate as it once did-are being tied down severely by unnecessary costs and charges. In this instance it is poor old Ranger that suffers. It suffers because the Office of the Supervising Scientist has gathered unto itself a vast and unnecessary bureaucracy which duplicates much of the research and development undertaken by Ranger and monitored by the Northern Territory Government and a plethora of other government agencies. Does the Government really think that if it did away with the OSS, Ranger could get away with anything?-not that it would want to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only five minutes before dinner for my 20-minute speech. I would like to spend that five minutes having a go at the Opposition spokesman for science and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). We have witnessed a theatrical, angry performance by him. He had his angry voice on this evening. He was firing away there, thumping the box, et cetera. It was typical of the honourable member for Gippsland. He will go outside and he will probably forget what he has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member said that the staff of the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS) stationed at Jabiru stand around all day, and then go out and collect water from the river and test it. I would have thought that was a pretty important part of their job. Those people should be commended for the work they do. They have to put up with living in a harsh climate, as do the workers at the mine and the people of Jabiru. Those scientists should be commended for the work they are doing in protecting and looking after our environment. Their work has been circumvented and dodged around. They cannot do a proper job because of the attitudes of Ranger, the Opposition, and the Northern Territory Government in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland has just put offside hundreds of scientists who work for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Office of the Supervising Scientist who spend a long time in the field under harsh conditions making certain that their skills are practised and that what they do is put on paper and fed back to the Government or the nation. Through their work they improve and look after the environment. However, the honourable member for Gippsland disregards that. He seems to think that all scientists, no matter who they work for-OSS, CSIRO or even private industry-drink cups of tea and talk all day, and now and again wander off to a river somewhere or to their laboratories, put on their coats, do a bit of work, collect their money and go home. That is not correct. </PARA>
<PARA> The OSS was set up as a monitoring organisation, to make certain that the Ranger and Nabarlek mines did not impinge on or affect the environment in any way. It has done a fairly good job. I have criticised it. In about May last year I flew over Ranger and noted that the tailings dam was exposed; it was not covered in water. One of the original conditions was that it be covered. When I rang the OSS an officer said `Yes. It is a new idea we will have wet tailings. It will be okay'. When I pointed out the fact that birds often land in those radioactive tailings and then wander off to their nests and that the radioactivity can build up, the OSS said that it had not done any studies on that. I pointed out that the wind could dry out the slurry in the tailings dam which could then blow all over the park. The OSS answered that it was looking at that and that it was quite okay. </PARA>
<PARA> I also pointed out that I had been up there some years ago and had seen a trial plot through which were tracks of some sort of animal. Possibly a dingo had walked through the tailings. I have not found out the latest information but the practice of not putting any more water over the top of the tailings probably still exists. I do not believe that this is the right way to go about things. </PARA>

Under some circumstances it could direct the OSS away from particular areas of research which may not be to Ranger's liking. I point out that Ranger does not own the OSS. It may pay for some of its operations but it does not own it, so it should not have any say in what areas the OSS does its research. The OSS should be free to do whatever research it wants. This is particularly important in relation to looking after the environment and making certain that these areas are not abused by a company which is well known for abusing and not practising proper engineering principles. I have talked about Ranger before in this place. I have pointed out the broken pipes, and the other things that it does wrong. We are talking about what is supposed to be a responsible firm.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner I was discussing the lack of ability of Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA), as shown by some of the things it has done in the past. The honourable member for Gippsland said that the company was very responsible and could look after its own research and development and its own checking in relation to uranium mining. One would have expected that the company, after working for many years in the Kakadu National Park, would be very environmentally conscious. However, late last year 500,000 tonnes of mineralised material containing uranium ore above the prescribed limit was wrongly placed in a rock waste dump outside the mine's restricted release zone. The Northern Territory Government described the incident as trivial. One would have to question the company's reputation as a responsible organisation after it made the mistake of putting in the wrong place 500,000 tonnes of rocks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland said it was a shame that the company had to pay this tax for the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region and that it would affect Ranger's profit and decrease its sales overseas. He and many on the other side fail to mention the profits that ERA has made. In 1984, it made $57m; in 1985, $56m; in 1986, $50m; in 1987, $58m; and in 1988, $63m. That is not a bad sort of bonus from which to pay $4m for an organisation to supervise the company's spewing out of mine water. The people of Australia are entitled to receive such an amount from companies that take our mineral resources from the ground and make profits on them year after year. It is also interesting to note that last year a French nuclear fuel company, Cogema, bought into ERA. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual report of Energy Resources of Australia shows how safety conscious the company is. It received an above average grading for a five-star health and safety management system, awarded by an organisation called the National Safety Council of Australia. It is interesting that ERA should get an award from an organisation which just recently has got some adverse publicity. I just wonder how much the award cost the company. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been well documented in papers all over Australia that the Ranger mine has released water on quite a few occasions. I think it is still releasing water at present. According to Mr Coulter, the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy, the water from retention ponds at the Ranger mine is that good he would drink it. Another member of this House actually drank 2,4,5-T. I do not know how he is feeling these days; he does not come in here too often. I think he is a bit crook. If Mr Coulter reckons the water is so good, he is welcome to drink it. Senator Richardson has already spoken out loudly against this discharge of water. Ranger, with the cooperation and collusion of the Northern Territory Government, instead of releasing the water through a pipe into Magela Creek just releases it over the spillway. I am no scientist; I am only a practical turner and fitter. However, I imagine that the effect of releasing the water over the spillway into the creek instead of through a pipe would enable the company, if any adverse contaminants were found, to say that they came from the creek rather than from the mine. The company is treating the Australian population as fools. That is why I am glad that we are increasing the levy on the company to pay for the Office of the Supervising Scientist. We should increase it even more. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the company set aside $5,288,000 for rehabilitation of the mine, and in 1987 it set aside $5,724,000. If the cost of rehabilitating the area is anything like the cost of rehabilitating the Rum Jungle area, for which taxpayers paid, it will be horrendous. We are not looking at a small hole in the ground or a small tailings dump. The area is huge and it will be radioactive and bad for the environment for years to come. We should up the amount of money the company puts aside for rehabilitation to make certain that we have in that trust fund an amount large enough to cover all the costs that will go into rehabilitating the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary OSS tests of the water being discharged from the Ranger mine into the Kakadu National Park indicate that there have been some toxic effects. Senator Richardson said on 4 March that he expected more definitive advice within the next few weeks. I have not seen such advice, but his office may have received it. Perhaps in the next day or so we will get a few more answers in relation to the problem with the water that is being released. One of the methods Ranger is using to get rid of excess water is spray irrigation. The company has published a document called Ranger and the Environment: An Update, in which it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In a further effort to minimize the volume of water held in RP2 before the wet season commences a method of spray irrigation was introduced a few years ago using water from this pond. A trial to investigate the environmental impact was carried out in 1985 and subsequently approval was given by the Supervising Authorities to extend the 1.8 hectare trial area to 35 hectares. Spray irrigation is now an integral part of the water management system. At present this is the only approved method of reducing the amount of excess water within the system and may only be carried out during the dry season. </PARA>
<PARA>In a Supervising Scientist paper called Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute Annual Research Summary for 1987-88 there is a section entitled `Land application of Retention Pond water'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Ranger has been disposing of water from Retention Pond No. 2-</PARA>
<PARA>it was also mentioned in the ERA document-</PARA>
<PARA>by spray irrigating a 33ha site between the mine and Magela Creek. The adoption of spray irrigation as a method of disposal of excess water is based on the proposition that the soil will retain the solutes in the applied water . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on then with a fairly scientific explanation of the various minerals involved. Later the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Field measurements of hydraulic conductivity indicated that the soils are highly permeable and that lateral flow of . . . Magela Creek could take as little as 9 months-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the water being sprayed on this 33 hectares takes nine months to filter through the ground, instead of going straight in through the pipe or over the spillway-</PARA>
<PARA>(in the case of the minimum distance of 100 m from the irrigation area to Magela Creek-assuming a depth of the permeable aquifer of 80 m, a saturated volumetric water content of 0.25, the rate of arrival of water at the water table of 7.4 mm day-1, and water moving without any preferential pathways). </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, it takes just nine months for water to move from the irrigation area through the soil to Magela Creek. Another paper has been produced by the Supervising Scientist. It is called `Distribution and Genesis of Acid Sulphate Soils in the Magela Backwater Plains'. This deals with another area, but it is still in the same locality. If the ground in this area is opened up for mining, which is possible-I think Jabiluka is trying to open up this new mine-it will create cracks in the soil and clay alluvium in the dry season. The water on that will allow some strongly acidic compounds to run into the actual flood plain. If Jabiluka went ahead and opened up this new mine, and if there is a wet season, highly acidic water would be running into the flood plains further down the road. Who knows what it will do. </PARA>
<PARA> At present several compounds are actually going into the Magela Creek such as magnesium, sodium, calcium, manganese and sulphate. They are average sorts of chemicals and they do not cause too much harm, but they do alter the consistency of the water in the Magela Creek. These things must be looked at, but not by me. All I am trying to do is point the direction the scientific people should take in order to alleviate the problem. The uranium that goes into the soil from the spray irrigated area is taken up by the trees and bushes, et cetera. The radioactivity is also taken up by them. It is burned off every year. I do not know whether this is correct or whether it has been proven, but once this radioactivity gets into the trees and plants and if they are burned off, does it get into the smoke and is that transported all over the Kakadu National Park? I do not know. These are the matters that the scientists, especially the Office of the Supervising Scientist, should be looking at very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that concerns me in this whole uranium debate is the waste problem. About a year ago I was in the United Kingdom. I went to Wylfa, an atomic power station over there. Because I had never seen one and since I complain enough about it, I thought that I had better go and have a look at one of these stations. It is one of the oldest atomic power stations in North Wales and they want to close it down, but they do not know how to go about it. There are huge problems over there in that they do not know whether to dig the waste up, shift it or bury the whole lot under a pile of concrete. An organisation in the United Kingdom called Nirex is looking for places to dispose of nuclear waste. Naturally no-one wants it in his backyard and Nirex has a great problem trying to decide what it will do with this waste. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole uranium cycle has to be looked at closely. The people who dig it out of the ground must make certain that environmental controls are put in place by the Office of the Supervising Scientist, that the scientists are given enough money to carry out their job and that they are not under any threat of fear or favour from the Ranger uranium mine, or whoever pays that levy into the Government account, to actually pay the scientists. This matter has definitely got to be put aside so that the Supervising Scientist can have a say as to what direction the research takes and how the scientists are directed in relation to the projects they carry out. Ranger uranium mine should not have any say in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It goes without saying that I do not support the amendment which is proposed by the Opposition, but I do very strongly support the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989, which increases the export duty on uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory from $1.02 per kilogram to $1.15 per kilogram.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) has pointed out that the increased rate recognises the view of the Government and indeed my own strong view that the costs associated with protecting the environment from the adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne by the industry carrying on that mining activity and not by the Australian taxpayer. In my view the House could not be considering at a more appropriate time the need for the monitoring of the effects of uranium mining on the environment of Kakadu National Park. Let me also make it very clear that I am not talking about an activity with which I am unfamiliar. I have visited Kakadu National Park on a number of occasions in the past 8 1/2 years since I have been the member for La Trobe. Members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, of which I am Chairman-the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who made a very good speech before me, is also a member-deal with the protection of the environment. We have all visited the Ranger uranium mine operated by Energy Resources of Australia on at least one occasion in an official capacity and on numerous unofficial occasions. I have also visited the proposed Pancontinental Mining Ltd site of the Jabiluka mine which is situated adjacent to the wetlands of the Alligator Rivers region. Of course, the honourable member for Dunkley referred to that too. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I say that this is a most appropriate time to consider the Bill is that the Ranger uranium mine, which is surrounded by Kakadu National Park, has recently released toxic water into a billabong in complete disregard of appropriate environment safeguards. I will quote from the Age newspaper of 4 March which indicates the seriousness of the situation. The quote is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson said the Office of the Supervising Scientist at Jabiru and the traditional owners of the site had not been informed of the release of water from retention pond four over a spillway into Djalkmara billabong until a few hours beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Preliminary laboratory biological tests by the OSS indicate that there have been some toxic effects. I expect more definitive advice from them within the next week or so,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The release of this water . . . was authorised by the relevant Northern Territory authorities, but advice from the Office of the Supervising Scientist on the best method of release was ignored.''</PARA>
<PARA> He said the office had advised the mine operators that releasing water over the spillway was not acceptable because it allowed less control of the pollution and made it difficult to test the resulting toxicity levels. </PARA>
<PARA> ``It is disturbing, it is strange, and remains unexplained why both the company and the Northern Territory authorities have suddenly decided to depart from this established procedure,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``I am also concerned that the company is planning further releases from retention pond four via the spillway. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The supervising scientists have advised me that if this process continues, the high standards of environmental protection in the Alligator Rivers region are threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The Commonwealth will take whatever action is necessary to prevent that heritage from being threatened. The wetlands of Kakadu will not be allowed to become a drain to be used at the convenience of either the company or the Northern Territory Government.''</PARA>
<PARA>I have quoted in full from the newspaper article because I view this matter with the utmost seriousness. In October 1986 as Chairman of the then House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, I tabled a report in the House on the Ranger uranium water management system. I will quote from the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Land Council and the Northern Territory Environment Centre in discussions with the Committee were critical of the number of tailings line failures. The NLC expressed concern about `gross carelessness in areas where the Company should be most careful'. Both the NLC and the Environment Centre considered that the frequent spillages were in part due to Company attitudes and the lack of supervision and penalties. The Environment Centre argued that mine management has a poor attitude to environment protection and continually seeks least cost solutions and that after two or three spillages Ranger should have been required to close its operations and replace the pipeline. According to the Environment Centre the argument used by mine management that spillages of this nature happen in all mines is an argument for closure of the mine because of its location in a world heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA>I will give another quote here too which is very relevant. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Ranger considered all the accidental releases to be minor and had caused no environmental damage. The Company advised that it had been quick to respond and none of the releases had reached Kakadu National Park and only a few had escaped from the restricted release zone. The company stated that spillages of this nature happened in all mines and are only reported because of the unique regulatory regime established for the operations of the project. </PARA>
<PARA>The Supervising Scientist commented in his 1984-85 annual report that no effects of the mining operations beyond the immediate mining site area at Ranger had been observable. The report noted that there have been occurrences within the mine site over the years which have indicated some laxity in operational control and have given rise to regulatory concern, but most incidents have been minor and have not resulted in adverse impacts on humans or the environment beyond the mine site. </PARA>
<PARA> I am trying to provide to the House a balance on these reports of accidental releases. It is true that the Office of the Supervising Scientist commented in the 1984-85 report that the accidental releases had no adverse impact on humans or on the environment beyond the mine site. However, it is clear to me that the Ranger uranium mine was operating in a fashion which presented grave dangers to the environment of Kakadu National Park, particularly as the Supervising Scientist had also commented that technical mishaps within the mine site over the years indicated some laxity in operational control. If anything, I think the Office of the Supervisory Scientist should have been much stronger in its criticisms. I think it has let the Ranger mine off very lightly in its reports over the years. As I will go on to say a little later, it has suffered for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time similar spillages and other technical mishaps have occurred at the mine, and now that has been capped by the deliberate release of toxic water from the Ranger mine into a billabong, with the approval of the Northern Territory Government. I find it quite surprising that the Northern Territory Government is prepared to allow the Ranger uranium mine to pollute Kakadu National Park in this way. It seems that the Northern Territory Government is more concerned with the profits obtained from uranium mining than it is with the profits which could be earned from tourist operations in Kakadu National Park. That is a short-sighted policy. Indeed, it indicates an ignorance of the great value of tourism to the Northern Territory. As was pointed out in the 1986-87 annual report of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, the number of visitors to Kakadu National Park continues to grow rapidly. In 1986 some 131,000 people visited the park and in 1987 the figure was estimated to reach 220,000. That represents a remarkable increase of 52 per cent, with visitors' comments indicating a very high level of satisfaction with the natural beauties of the park. The National Parks and Wildlife Service was commended on its management of the park, despite a lack of resources. There is an increasing demand from visitors for information about the park. Park visitors are encouraged to join ranger-guided tours of the main art sites and many visitors have indicated on the visitors' survey forms and in letters of appreciation that the tours were among the most memorable and satisfying of their experiences. It is in those circumstances that I find it particularly disgraceful that the Northern Territory Government is prepared to allow the Ranger uranium mine to pollute the park with toxic waste from the mine operations. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned briefly at the beginning of my speech and detailed by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, the increased levy imposed by the Bill will partially offset the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities carried out by the Office of the Supervising Scientist, other Commonwealth agencies and agencies of the Northern Territory Government acting on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. At this point I would like to quote from the 1987-88 report of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, which indicates the duplicity and deliberate misrepresentations the Ranger uranium mine management and the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy are prepared to engage in in order to discredit the Office of the Supervising Scientist:</PARA>
<PARA> Remarks critical of OSS operations-particularly relating to the cost and relevance of its research program-have been made in a number of public forums during 1987-88. ERA/Ranger in particular has developed an aggressive policy to discredit the OSS and seek its disbandment. The intensity of this campaign seems to mount as the Government's export levy on uranium exports from the Region increases-</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it will increase again now-</PARA>
<PARA>Much of Ranger's critical comment has been repeated by the Northern Territory, most notably by the Minister for Mines and Energy in an opening speech to the Mining, Petroleum and Suppliers' Conference, in Darwin in May 1988. The NT Minister echoed a number of the Ranger initiated arguments critical of the effectiveness of the Office, added a few of his own that had no more substance or cogency, and claimed that the OSS was not carrying out its designated functions and proposed `the disbandment of the largely negative and costly Office of the Supervising Scientist and its incorporation instead into a properly established (NT) academic institution to involve itself in complete nuclear studies'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. Just imagine how neutral that would be. The report continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would not be appropriate in this Report to counter such assertions in detail but some comment is warranted, not only because of the serious misrepresentations of fact, but also because of the confusion they engender in the community about the role of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the criticism-e.g. claims that the OSS largely duplicates work that is or could be done by the Northern Territory and that there is little benefit to the uranium industry from the research carried out by OSS-reflects a continuing misunderstanding of the functions of the OSS. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory, though carrying out the day-to-day licensing of the mining operations, has not established the scientific resources necessary to ensure comprehensive protection of the environment of the Region to the standard required by the Commonwealth. It has no expertise in aquatic environmental toxicity and cannot, at present, credibly control the release of mine waste water to the environment without access to the competence existing within the ARRRI. Nor has it established an environmental protection agency independent of the regulating Department of Mines and Energy which has as a major objective the promotion of mining. </PARA>
<PARA>The most important environmental research and monitoring work in the Alligator Rivers Region has been carried out by the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute of the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the region. Incidentally, it is worth reminding honourable members that the Alligator Rivers region comprises an area of approximately 28,000 square kilometres, containing the catchments of the East, South and West Alligator Rivers, east of Darwin. So it is a very important area to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The area is of outstanding interest because of its unusual combination of largely uninhabited wilderness areas with attractive wild scenery and abundant flora and fauna incorporating many unique features. The region also contains a very large concentration of Aboriginal rock art of international significance. It is for those reasons that the Kakadu National Park gained its World Heritage listing. The Research Institute has now built up a significant databank of information about the flora and fauna of the region as a result of the 10 years of research work undertaken by the Institute staff. The honourable member for Dunkley indicated some of the valuable work that has been done and in previous speeches I have detailed the valuable research work undertaken by the Institute, which goes far beyond the immediate need to monitor and study the operations of uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. Moreover, since I last spoke on these matters there has been a systematic campaign by the mining industry to denigrate the work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist in an attempt to reduce the funding provided to the office and thus bring about a reduction in the export duty. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time in this speech to deal with all the research work undertaken in the programs of environmental radioactivity, chemistry, biological testing, biological monitoring, plant ecology, geomorphology and environmental modelling of the Ranger uranium site and the Magela Creek system, but I would like to cite one area of research which is indicative of the extreme importance of the work of the Institute. I refer to the geomorphology program, the research objective of which is to identify and quantify the geomorphological processes relevant to the siting and engineering design of tailings improvements and rock structures in order to minimise the long-term impact on the environment. The cost of that has been mentioned by the honourable member for Dunkley. </PARA>
<PARA> The mill tailings and waste rock of the Ranger uranium mine which will be left over from the extended life of the mine will contain most of the radioactivity of the original ore body. The longer lived major residual isotope has a half life of about 80,000 years. That is how long this radioactivity will last: 80,000 years. Of course, it is true that because of the low radioactivity level of tailings they do not constitute an acute radiological risk. However, no individual would be able to live on a uranium mine site because exposure over a number of years would produce health risks. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances it is imperative that the proposed tailings dump, which will be five square kilometres in area and 20 metres high, must be constructed in a manner which will not cause harm to the environment, particularly the environment of a World Heritage park-Kakadu. The large volume of the dump, the possibility of movement of the tailings into the adjacent national park through wind force or flowing water, and the long term radioactive risk, mean that the dump must be isolated and prolonged human contact prevented. In the past tailings piles at other mines have not been protected, but fortunately such practices are no longer acceptable. I wish to quote from the 1987-88 annual research summary of the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute which indicates the vital importance of the work of the Institute and the Office of the Supervising Scientist which manages the research work of the Institute:</PARA>
<PARA>The requirement to contain tailings for periods of the order of a thousand years, necessitates the documentation of any future processes, as well as contemporary processes, that will affect the stability of containment structures. A structure with an engineer design life of 200 years must be interpreted, in the real world, as having a low, rather than zero, probability of failure over the 200 years following its construction. To achieve this satisfactorily, the design would have to be proof against rare extreme destabilising events having a recurrence interval very much longer than 200 years. Thus, a structure that is to have a probability of failure of, for example, 2% over 200 years must be designed to withstand an extreme event (a storm and consequent flood, for example) expected to recur only once every 10 000 years-</PARA>
<PARA>perhaps a cyclone-</PARA>
<PARA>The objectives of the program are, therefore: 1) to identify and quantify processes that could affect tailings impoundments and other earthen mine-related structures in the long-term, and 2) to devise criteria and designs to optimise the rehabilitation of these structures so that potential detrimental effects associated with their degradation are such that public health and the environment suffer minimal detriment over some thousands of years. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the whole point of the work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the research institute which provides the research capabilities for the Office. The point of this Bill is to provide sufficient funds to enable the Office of the Supervising Scientist to continue its valuable work. The mining industry, the Ranger uranium mine and the Northern Territory Government are attempting to denigrate the work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist in order to ensure that it does not have this watchdog capability of ensuring that mines such as the Ranger uranium mine do not continue, as they are at present, to pollute the environment. </PARA>

One of those mines is the site at Ja Ja, that is the Jabiluka mine, which is adjacent to the wetlands of Kakadu. I can only say that if an underground mine such as that were to be opened up, it would constitute very grave threats to the future of the Kakadu National Park. In these circumstances, it behoves us all in this House to draw attention to these potential dangers and to ensure that the Office of the Supervising Scientist has continual funding to carry out its very worthwhile operations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to a number of points raised by the now absent, and almost habitually absent, honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). He painted such an optimistic picture of the prospects for uranium that I wonder what monks' retreat he lives in. Has he talked to nobody in the industry about the spot price for uranium in the past few months? Does he really see uranium as a nuclear El Dorado, to mix a metaphor? He seemed to call-but it could have been only his confusion-for an increase in the number of uranium mines, currently three. Has he spoken to the operators of these three mines? Are they enthusiasts for bringing new mines on stream?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some news for him. In February this year I was in the Northern Territory with the honourable member for that distinguished electorate. I had an opportunity to go back to Kakadu National Park to visit the Office of the Supervising Scientist, to visit the Ranger uranium mine to see what was happening there in regard to research work, and also to look at the other points that have been raised. I took the opportunity to visit the Coronation Hill site, which is currently the subject of an environmental impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government rejects the amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland. I want to repeat more or less what I said in my second reading speech. The levy, which applies only to exports of uranium concentrate produced in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory, is imposed to partially offset the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities undertaken by the Commonwealth to protect the Alligator Rivers region. The increase in the level of the levy reflects the Government's position that the costs associated with protecting the delicate environment of the Alligator Rivers region from the potential adverse effects of uranium mining should be borne as far as practicable by the industry carrying out those operations, and not by the ordinary taxpayer. It is a manifestation of a user pays philosophy.</PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the comments made by the honourable member for Gippsland, I think that the correct rationale for the three mines policy was contained in a statement made by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in this House on 23 February 1988, which canvassed the Government's current view on the matter-as he said quite correctly, a view that is being reviewed by the uranium review committee of the Australian Labor Party that should report late this year. The international community, through the World Heritage Commission, listed Kakadu National Park and it is, of course, a protected area. The Government is determined to ensure the highest standard of protection of that region, including the Kakadu National Park, and to be confident in the assurances it gives to the world that the whole region is being protected. Accordingly, some form of independent, credible scientific advice is required. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that the honourable member for Gippsland is generous enough to concede that the research work could perhaps be done, although obviously he thinks that there are too many people around monitoring the water and so on, but that somehow it could be done if two preconditions are met. The first is that it is scattered and that it is done somewhere else, somewhere off-site; and, secondly, that it should be carried out by a whole collection of other entities without something that has international standing and has the credibility that is required and the backing of the Commonwealth Government. I find that position quite absurd. We believe that the legislative functions and responsibilities of the Office of the Supervising Scientist are a necessary corollary to its listing as part of the World Heritage catalogue. It is to this end that the moneys raised by the levy are aimed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several examples of research programs where the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the mining companies do collaborate. For example, in identifying and quantifying geomorphological processes relevant to the siting of tailings, impoundments-a technical word that is not mine-and other stabilised earth and rock structures. Given the long-80,000-year-half-life of residual isotopes, it will be necessary to stabilise these for hundreds of years. That is when long term geomorphological processes become relevant. The atmospheric transport of radon and radon daughters in the vicinity of the mine is another example. Very sophisticated techniques have been developed to assess the impact of mining on radon and radon daughter levels and public exposure in Jabiru. Other prominent areas of research include: background biological research to assess the effects of mining on the Magela Creek system; the development of creekside and in situ monitoring systems; and biological testing to develop prospective methods of assessing the toxic risks of mine waste water to aquatic organisms in order to specify safe dilution levels of these waters for discharge into streams. Once more I commend the Bill to the House and ask the House to reject the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, I did not. I said that the Labor Party did not have the courage to do what needed to be done. I thought that at some stage the mighty right wing would stand up for its so-called commitment to micro-economic reform, but nothing has happened. The left wing has totally hijacked Qantas. We will see a succession of Bills such as this before this Parliament over the coming months because Qantas has an expansion program which will cost between $6 billion and $10 billion, depending on what it finally decides to buy and what is the value of the Australian dollar. Qantas does not have any more capital of its own to do it. It cannot finance it from its own internally generated cash flows; so it needs to borrow. Because Qantas is a public company in which the Commonwealth of Australia is the only shareholder-I make the point that it is a public company and not a statutory authority, as some members of the Labor Government seem to think it is-there is a need to facilitate that debt raising. It is done by virtue of a Commonwealth guarantee. This Bill seeks to provide that guarantee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Qantas is going to spend $6 billion and if it is all to be raised by debt, we will see a succession of these Bills. Every time one of these Bills comes in it will make a complete mockery of this Government's so-called commitment to micro-economic reform. They are empty words which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is not capable of moving upon. This is despite the fact that he recognises the need to do it: the Treasurer (Mr Keating) knows it has to be done; the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) knows it has to be done; and, I dare say, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table, knows it has to be done. Had the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) been successful in becoming the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support when the job was available the other night, he would have been a strong advocate of privatisation. I know that the honourable member went very close indeed. Such are the benefits of the factional system that the best man got the job in spite of where he lives!</PARA>
<PARA> I return to the subject before the House, which is a very serious issue. The Government has said for some time that it is totally committed to micro-economic reform and that it will do everything it can to encourage and develop Qantas as a commercially viable organisation. Let us go back to May of last year. In the May statement the Government made great play about how it was going to restructure the economy and how various things were going to be done. As a result of that May statement, Qantas was subjected to further controls. I remind honourable members that Qantas is a public company, not a statutory authority. It could be listed on the stock exchange if the Government wanted to address the rightful issue. The further controls that were applied to Qantas related specifically to industrial relations and the coordination there. I will have more to say about the consequences of that in terms of the operations and safety standards that Qantas is able to maintain. More controls were imposed on its financial targets. There was, of course, a control imposed on the appointment of its chief executive officer. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this was done in the name of deregulation, micro-economic reform and making the operation more commercial. The net result was the imposition of more restrictions and regulations. We can go back even further to 1984 and actions of the then Minister for Transport. There has been a virtual parade of Ministers for transport around here. I remind the honourable member for Macarthur that his time will probably come because the current Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support is the fourth in a very short period of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope so; I have some good questions for her. Her predecessor was, of course, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch). Before him there was a former Attorney-General from South Australia. He had the job for a while. Before that there was a former full blown Cabinet Minister who was given the job for a while as a junior Minister. We have had a succession of Ministers. That probably explains why there is no coherent and comprehensive aviation policy. I know that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) is preoccupied with lots of other issues. These include how he can stop the proposals of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for radical reform of communications and how he can achieve micro-economic reform on the waterfront without actually doing anything. It is no wonder that there has been very little attention given to aviation and, of course, this important issue of Qantas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It amazes me that the Government does not attach more importance to aviation. I am told, using the figures of Qantas, that it is one of Australia's largest earners of foreign exchange. Last time I saw any balance of payments figures we had a problem there. It is fairly significant and is likely to continue for some time. I would have thought that this Government would be very keen to do anything that it could to increase the capacity of an Australian enterprise to earn more foreign exchange and more dollars to help finance that deficit for us. All the Government does is place more and more impediments in the way of the operations of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current calendar year Australian airlines will spend about $2 billion on new aircraft. This is associated with the expansion of air travel in this country. Basically, that expansion, although in some ways domestically generated-Expo undoubtedly had an impact on that-has resulted from a major growth in international tourism involving this country. To that extent, Qantas has on order some six Boeing 747-400s and a Boeing 767-300. I am told that if the Boeing aircraft company can deliver on time these aircraft will be delivered this calendar year. There is some doubt about whether they will be delivered on time. The cost of those aircraft is $1.62 billion. It will all be financed by debt. It will all have Commonwealth guarantees on it. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have not mentioned in terms of the restrictions imposed on Qantas is that it is now subject to Loan Council approval. If that is not a double standard, I do not know what is. The Government talks about commercial terms for Qantas. Do honourable members think that Alan Bond would be asked to go before the Loan Council? Maybe he is a bit closer to some members of the Labor Party than others. If the Government expects Qantas to get out and mix it with 36 other airlines-that is how many other airlines fly into this country-does it not think that it should untie the hands of Qantas and level up the playing field? Does the Government not think that the airlines should, at least, trade on the same basis as the other airlines? Let me say to the Government that it is actually building a disaster. Just as this Government for six years did nothing about Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and, in fact, decided to reverse the decision to build another runway, let the crisis build and sat on its hands, it has been sitting on its hands for six years in terms of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been letting the debt levels rise. Honourable members do not have to take my word for it. Listen to the words of the Chairman of Qantas, Mr Jim Leslie. Last year, when announcing Qantas's record profit level-the highest profit in the 68 years of the company's operations-he said that the airline's debt was reaching an unacceptably high level, which would `place the company at risk if a downturn occurred in the market'. Since that statement was made, how much more money has Qantas borrowed? This is the second Bill we have dealt with in this place this year. This Bill is for several hundred million dollars, as was the previous Bill. Yet last year, prior to those loan raisings, the Chairman said that the debt was too high and the company was at risk. What is the Government going to do about it?</PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Leslie was announcing that profit he went on to say that eight out of 10 of Qantas's competitors flying into this country were privatised wholly or partially. If one looks at those which are not, one will probably find that they come from communist or socialist countries. In recent years increasingly governments around the world have come to understand that there is a need to get out of the airline business, to sell off their shareholding in the national flag carrier. But of course this Government, which is reactionary when it comes to micro-economic reform, has done nothing. Right now is the best time to privatise Qantas. There are no objections to it. It is the Opposition's policy to privatise Qantas. It is the policy of Cabinet to do it, but it is scared of the ALP Caucus. Qantas staff are in favour of it, as is the Australian public. If one intends to float a company one should do so while that company is trading well. Qantas has high profit levels. If the Government floated the shares now it would get a substantial premium and maximise the capital raisings available from the float. That would mean that capital would be raised in the cheapest possible way for Qantas. The timing is right now. If the Government procrastinates and dallies, it may miss the opportunity, just as it will probably look at selling off Australian Airlines at the worst possible time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the majority of clear thinkers in the Labor Party, who unfortunately are at the mercy of a ragtag mob in Caucus, do not have the political guts to push this issue through which they have to do. Look how they procrastinated and mucked around on the question of Sydney Airport. Just look at how that decision was taken. There was meeting after meeting. First of all there was to be a decision before Christmas, then it was to happen in February. Then we had several meetings and more submissions. We sat all night and we tied our stomachs in knots while the whole country sat around waiting for this Government to decide where it was going to pour some concrete. That is what it came down to. The Government could not take that decision in spite of the fact that the overwhelming weight of objective and expert advice was saying `build the third runway'. Look at the trauma the Government went through. This is the best Labor front bench since the war yet it could not decide where to pour a slab of concrete. No wonder it is having problems with Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Australian Labor Party's National Conference in Hobart, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans-another person I missed out on the earlier list-spoke about the realities of Qantas in the Australian air traffic market. He pointed out that without additional investment Qantas's market share would drop to 28 per cent. Currently it is 44 per cent. He went on to say that it needed about $600m by way of a capital injection. These are direct quotes; they are probably in the transcript of the conference proceedings that were handed out to industry, because at that stage the Government was determined to prove to industry and business leaders around the country that it was made of the right stuff and would take the right decision. Since then we have seen nothing of any right decision. Senator Evans said, and it is absolutely appropriate today:</PARA>
<PARA> There is Buckley's chance of the Government providing that $600m. </PARA>
<PARA>Buckley's; and that is as true today as it was then. He went on to say that every 5 per cent loss in market share suffered by Qantas-say from around 44 per cent to 28 per cent-represents a $100m loss in our foreign exchange earnings. As I said, we have a major problem. What will our deficit be this year? Twelve billion dollars? Can we afford to hand away $100m every time Qantas's market share drops because the Government will not challenge the left wing on what is essentially a rational and correct position? It is essential that the Government come to grips with this problem because if it does not, Qantas will be put in a very precarious situation and Australia will suffer as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the beginning of my remarks that this Government does not have the capacity to deal with a commercial enterprise such as Qantas operating in an extremely competitive and rapidly growing section of the world economy. I pointed out that as a result of the so-called liberalisation of the Government's approach to business enterprises, Qantas had been placed under even more restrictions in terms of industrial relations. The consequences of this Government's wages policy have been a disaster for Qantas and Qantas passengers. It has become so bad that the Chief Executive of Qantas wrote to his major business travellers to apologise for the problems that Qantas was having, saying, `If you experienced difficulties and delays on Qantas flights in recent months, it was not all our fault. All we can do is tell the Government what the problem is and hope and pray that it will do something about it'. </PARA>
<PARA> But, of course, the Government is not prepared to do anything about it. The Chief Executive of Qantas was alluding firstly to the problems of Kingsford-Smith Airport and the lack of capacity there. I have already referred to the sort of trauma the Government went through in taking that decision. It is not over yet. I think it would be appropriate to mention the nice little charade that the Government is involved in at the present time-an 18-month timetable for the development of the environmental impact statement. Today in this very place the Minister for Transport and Communications said:</PARA>
<PARA>We need to take our time on this environmental impact study to ensure that there is every opportunity for the public to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA>What he forgot to say when he was providing that answer was that the study will be on public exhibition for one month only. The honourable member for Macarthur is shaking his head. Is that time period to be changed then?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point that this legislation is raising money for Qantas. Qantas loses a lot of money because it has to operate out of a congested airport. Since that loss of money has a direct impact on additional funding, I think that it is entirely relevant. As every member of this House knows, the Qantas base is Sydney Airport. We are talking about the need for reform and, as honourable members will be aware, an amendment has been circulated in my name. I think it is relevant to read it for the benefit of the House. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to recognise the urgent need to provide additional capital resources for Qantas and overcome ideological objections to the sale of shares in the airline to its staff and the Australian public'. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is entirely relevant to the whole question of aviation policy in Australia. But as I said, the Chief Executive of Qantas wrote to its best customers and apologised by saying, `It is not our fault, it is the Government's aviation policy'. As I have said, there is a need to recognise that Qantas is a public company, it should be treated as such and it should be allowed to trade as a public company. </PARA>
<PARA> I began my remarks by talking about the wages policy and the impact that it had. The wages policy has meant that Qantas has not been able to employ an appropriate number of skilled metal trades workers because it is uncompetitive in the marketplace. It has been forced to jump through more hoops over its wages policy than could possibly be imagined. Some of the correspondence that has flowed between the Minister's office and Qantas would make very interesting reading on the front page of a newspaper one day-and it will probably end up there-because it makes a complete mockery of this Government's so-called commitment to micro- economic reform in allowing Qantas to trade in a flexible manner in commercially competitive terms. It is a complete joke. </PARA>
<PARA> But the consequence of that has been very serious for this airline. It is cancelling flights at present. There is a lack of equipment and a lack of serviced planes. It is sending its aircraft overseas to be serviced because it does not have the staff to do it here in Australia. The standard of that service is not up to the standards that Qantas has prided itself on for years. As an aside: recently certain members of this place travelled overseas on a Qantas flight. Do honourable member know why that flight was delayed 24 hours? Do they know that the official reason given by Qantas for that delay was that the airline had had the aircraft serviced by another company-and I will not mention that company-and it was not satisfied with the standard of that service; therefore it was not prepared to fly it. Why was Qantas having it serviced overseas? It was because of the wages policy, the industrial relations restrictions that have been imposed upon it. Those restrictions have been imposed irrespective of the consequences for Australian travellers and the standards of that airline. No doubt all honourable members in this House would be aware that recently Qantas had an aircraft on approach to Cairns that lost the leading edge of a flap. That substantial piece of metal fell off and landed on the ground. Thankfully it was in a fairly sparsely populated area approaching Cairns. Had it happened on approach to Sydney it could have had a serious consequence. That aircraft had also recently been serviced by someone other than Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's approach to Qantas and its refusal to overcome this stupid ideological objection to privatising it is throwing it on the mercy of whatever deals it can do around the international marketplace. As a result, an airline that we are all proud of, an airline that has an international reputation second to none in terms of safety, is encountering difficulties and maintaining that record and that standard of service that we should all reasonably expect it to continue to provide into the future and that is a direct result of this Government's non-existent policies on aviation and the privatisation of the airline. I think this Government really stands condemned. But the point of this debate here tonight is to highlight the absolute necessity to provide a sound and commercially viable capital base for this great Australian enterprise, an enterprise that has the complete support of every Australian. Australians would all genuinely like to be shareholders in Qantas and they should have the opportunity to buy shares in it. </PARA>

Would honourable members opposite like me to talk about the Chief Executive of Qantas because the same thing applies? Honourable members opposite know what this Government has done to Qantas. It has imposed further restrictions on the ability of the Board of a public company to hire a chief executive. The question that must be asked is: Who is ultimately responsible for Qantas? Is the board of directors responsible for Qantas's operations, or does the Minister assume full responsibility? If the Government is to impose restrictions it implies that the Minister is to assume full responsibility. So, heaven forbid, when we have a crisis with Qantas is the same Minister who reserves the right and the power to determine who the Chief Executive of Qantas is going to walk into this House and say, `I am responsible'? Of course he is not. It is a total double standard. The Government wants its cake and it wants to eat it too, but it will pay a high price for it. Unless something is done about Qantas it will lose the market share and the company will be put in a very precarious position, as the Chairman has said.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> For the benefit of everybody in the chamber at present let me also say that the options are to increase taxes, to reduce expenditure, or to privatise. So where will the cuts be? Tell us where the cuts will be to finance Qantas. Is the answer that this Government will not finance Qantas? Is the answer that this Government will deregulate international air travel into Australia because the demand for seats into Australia will continue to increase? If this Government does not do something about it, through providing capital for Qantas to expand its equipment so that it can provide more seats, we will have an increasing demand and there will be a need to have more flights into Australia. Will we have more foreign carriers coming into Australia, or will we build a wall around Australia, which is a classic response from the left wing, and say, `There are only so many thousands of seats available into this country. We will not have any more capacity. If Qantas cannot have it under our restrictive policies no-one is coming in. You cannot come here and spend your foreign exchange because we cannot come to grips with a basic decision in Caucus'?</PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members opposite thought that the runway decision at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport was difficult for this Government I would really like to be a fly on the wall when it finally gets round to talking about this one. I just think that the Government is incapable of addressing the realities of commercial life in Australia today. Honourable members opposite think that they can wheel out the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), that he will say, `Everything will be fine, trust me', and Qantas's problem will be fixed. But, unfortunately, Qantas trades in the real world. It is for that reason that we, on this side of the chamber, have an unequivocal commitment to providing for the privatisation of Qantas, to selling shares in Qantas to its staff and to the Australian public and to letting it trade with both hands untied, competitively, in a growing international market. The Government has really been revealed as the laughing stock for its total and continuing failure to come to grips with a pressing problem. For six years this Government has been in power and for six years it has done nothing on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a little tempted to read back into Hansard my contribution to the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1988, dated 12 October 1988, because it simply followed the speech made at the time by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) on a similar proposition; that is, that the Government go guarantor for the purchase of aircraft by Qantas Airways Ltd. However, as my prior contribution would certainly address all the issues the honourable member for Richmond has raised tonight-he did not go to anything different, except the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport decision-I will refrain from doing that. However, I refer him to my previous speech on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to raise some other issues. First, in his contribution the honourable member for Richmond started at, and came back to, the proposition that Qantas should be privatised, with shares sold to the public and indeed to those people who worked in Qantas. He was suggesting therefore that Qantas was by no means a public company. I suggest to him, as I have done in the past, that it is a public company; it is owned and operated on behalf of the people of Australia. They are the shareholders now. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor is that there seems to be a view within the Opposition that because a government enterprise is making a profit and is being run well, it should not reside with government. I think there can be absolutely no argument that Qantas is being run well. I refer again to some figures on that aspect of Qantas's operation so that honourable members might reflect on them. The Qantas annual report 1977-88 offers some very interesting reading for those who have the opportunity to look through it. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point that needs to be made-and, to his credit, the honourable member for Richmond did refer to the excellent profit recorded by Qantas last year-relates to that profit figure. On operations for 12 months in 1988 its profit was $153.3m. For a company that is supposedly in dire straits, in need of massive capital injections, that is not a bad starting point. One should consider the figures over a longer period. Let me take the year 1982, about which I reminded the honourable gentleman last year in this debate. If one looks at the profit from about 1982, and then works one's way through, one finds that in 1982 there was no profit for Qantas, in fact, there was a loss of $20.2m. In 1983 there was a loss of $47.4m. Suddenly an amazing thing happened in Australia: there was a change of government. Immediately in 1984 the profit for Qantas was $58.3m. Qantas went from a loss of $47.4m in 1983 to a profit of $58.3m in 1984. The profit continued to rise, and in 1987 it reached $104.3m. As I have indicated, in 1988 for the 12-month period it was $153.3m</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest, and I hope that even the honourable member for Richmond and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) would agree with me, that Qantas has done an excellent job in turning an untenable situation around. It has done so without necessarily relying on massive injections of funds, either from the Government or from the private sector. I am on the Caucus transport and communications committee and I have no doubt that the Opposition has similar policy committees. I have no doubt that Qantas representatives have been along and spoken to them about its capital needs, its debt-equity ratios, and so on. We have all heard the same points. My colleague the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) will talk at some length on that issue shortly. Interestingly, we have seen Qantas continuing to make these great profits and at the same time expanding its operations in this area. For example, last year we saw a bid to purchase some 25 per cent of Air New Zealand, a bid which has been successful. For a company that someone on the other side might suggest is going to the wall, I would say that that clearly demonstrates just the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the Sydney decision was raised by the honourable member for Richmond, who made one or two points about it. I remind him that the environmental impact statement (EIS) procedure is going to be controlled by the Government in terms of what has to be done. The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) will be putting forward the guidelines for that. I also remind the honourable gentleman that for the Badgerys Creek environmental impact statement, when consideration was given to alternative sites-one of which we all remember was Wilton in my electorate, which some still suggest should have been the chosen site for a second airport-part of that examination also looked at Badgerys Creek once it was chosen as the appropriate location. It took 21 months to gather information. </PARA>
<PARA> Having worked with the New South Wales Department of the Environment and Planning for eight years, having been involved in the preparation and examination of a number of environmental impact statements, I can say that despite the assertion by the New South Wales Premier, Nick Greiner, that three months is an adequate period to deal with something as complex as an EIS for a third runway at Mascot, that is simply not feasible. One has to consider the collection of fill and where it is to come from; the environmental damage that could result from taking sand out of the Botany Bay bed or from further out to sea. One has to consider the implications of a major traffic study in that area. One has to consider the implications in a socio-economic sense. These procedures take time. I am sorry to say to Mr Greiner and to those on the other side of the House that the period this Government has identified as necessary really is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue relating to the EIS is that the timetable for public scrutiny, with great respect to the honourable member for Richmond, did not say that it would allow one month alone for public comment on the EIS or for public participation in the decision-making process. Rather, it said there would be a minimum of one month. Certainly, as I understand it this Government will be guaranteeing that there will be much more than one month for the consideration of objections and for the EIS process for the third runway at Mascot. I would be most surprised if it is anything less than three months. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I heed the warning you gave to the honourable member in his contribution that the focus of this Bill is not on these extraneous matters but on the fact that we are endeavouring to authorise the Treasurer (Mr Keating), on behalf of the Commonwealth, to guarantee the repayment of loans and interest on funds raised by Qantas to purchase three Boeing 747-400 aircraft and associated spare parts and equipment. As we are aware, this is a new series of aircraft utilising new technology. Its strategic value lies in the flexibility and competitive advantage inherent in the extra long-range capability. Therefore, the aircraft are going to operate essentially on two of our most relevant tourist markets: the kangaroo route, that is, Sydney-Singapore-London; and the Pacific route between Sydney and Los Angeles.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Richmond indicated the importance of tourism, in an economic sense, to the future growth of Australia and, indeed, to Mascot and the Sydney region generally. He is absolutely correct. The information that I have suggests that inbound tourism, as measured by short term visitor arrivals, reached almost 2.22 million in the year ending November 1988. That is a substantial number of visitors coming into Sydney. It is an increase of almost 28 per cent over the previous 12 months. We all know that Australia is now a tourist destination for many people. We have encouraged that. I have heard the Opposition spokesman on tourism, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), commenting on how the cost of hotel rooms in Sydney is now starting to bite and frighten people away. I do not think that is necessarily reflected by the figures at this stage, although I have some sympathy for his views. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is when one is working on committees as a humble backbencher. The figures certainly indicate that Sydney is the destination preferred by most people coming into this country. Therefore, we have to provide for that. We must provide the infrastructure for Australia's national carrier, Qantas, to ensure that people are able to come here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, Qantas is not the only company that is going to purchase these sorts of modern generation aircraft. Its major competitors will be doing the same. Therefore, we cannot afford to be left behind. Our Government, through this Bill, will guarantee the borrowings. But we will limit that guarantee of borrowings for three aircraft to $US385m, or its equivalent in foreign currencies, which represents 85 per cent of the total project cost. It is important to have it understood that we are guaranteeing that purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises another issue which the honourable member for Richmond noted-the balance of payments problem. As we have seen, a great contribution to Australia's balance of payments problem has been the purchase of capital equipment like these new generation jets. By adding $US385m to our current account deficit, it obviously does something which is not in Australia's interest other than providing an opportunity for more tourists to be brought into this country, and hopefully offsetting the deficit problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I wanted to concentrate on tonight in regard to this Bill is something which my colleague on the other side of the House did not raise-the method of acquiring these aircraft. I raised this in the debate last year on the purchase of other aircraft by Qantas. I am Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. We are presently investigating the use by Australian companies of tax havens to minimise tax responsibilities in Australia. Last year I commented on an article in the Sydney Morning Herald which was the subject of some consideration at the time. The article was entitled `You own the airline, Japanese own the Jumbos'. To refresh the minds of honourable members on the issue, the article described how Qantas uses a very complex arrangement whereby it buys aircraft from Boeing, sells the aircraft to Japan and buys the aircraft back from Japan through banks in tax havens. That in no way minimises the tax requirement in Australia, but it takes advantage of tax laws in Japan, to Australia's benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue has been raised in our Committee and has been the subject of answers to questions by no less a person than the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Trevor Boucher. He clearly indicated to our Committee that this process is a matter for the Japanese revenue people and not for Australia, because no tax minimisation is associated with the process in Australia. There is nothing legally wrong with the process. But it raises the issue once again of the use of tax havens for operations involving a quasi-government enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the degree of concern in the community now about tax haven uses by private organisations and public companies listed on the stock exchange, I suspect that this issue will receive some airing. But I point out that this arrangement is commonplace in the world of transport. I repeat that it does not in any way impinge upon Australian taxation laws. If there is a problem with it, it is up to the Japanese Government to worry about it. It is a minimisation process in Japan's tax laws. As I have indicated, the Australian Taxation Office does not believe that it is an appropriate matter for Australia. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has also investigated this matter and concurs with the statement I have just made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that this legislation be supported by the Parliament. As I have indicated, I do not think that the second reading amendment is appropriate, given the circumstances. Speakers from the other side will follow me in this debate and will go to the basic premise that Qantas is a company that is ripe for privatisation simply because it is successful. Every public company that is successful is in the sights particularly of the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who has put his Party's position on this matter very clearly. We on this side of the House reject such propositions-in deference to the left, right and centre left wings of the Party, I might say to the honourable member for Richmond. </PARA>
<PARA> As was the case with the legislation last year, this legislation is important in that it allows Qantas to continue to compete effectively in a very important tourist market for Australia. It will enable us to buy new generation jet aircraft and the equipment that goes with them. It will enable us to continue to receive a very large influx of tourists from an important market segment, both Europe and the United States. I welcome the fact that Qantas is taking that initiative and is competing very hard out there in the marketplace. Qantas is to be congratulated. As I have indicated, the method of acquiring those aircraft is something with which no one in this place should unduly concern himself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments made by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt). I cannot help being fascinated by some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). It is a great learning curve for members of the socialist parties to think in terms of private enterprise and how one might run a corporation. It is quite clear that the company wants to be privatised, that the staff want it to be privatised and that the fliers want to see it privatised. Yet a Government member stands up and says, `Qantas is making profits, so it should not be sold' and all the rest of it. I quote the comments of the Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd in the annual report this year. One cannot do any better than that. The Chairman says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Although Qantas is able to borrow and repay the huge sums of money that are required to be more competitive and take advantage of important foreign currency opportunities, the Board believes it is essential that the problem of the Qantas debt/equity ratio should be addressed. The level of debt is reaching an unacceptable level which will place the Company at risk if a major future downturn occurs in the market. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead of walking out the door, the honourable member for Macarthur ought to sit down and listen because I will touch on the points he raised. The honourable member asked why the Government should sell a company when it is doing well. The Chairman of Qantas has provided the reason. He says there is no such thing as continuous profitability in any enterprise including Qantas. </PARA>

If it is not moved then, the Government is stuck with the profit record of the company when it deteriorates. In 1979 Qantas had a net income of $5.7m; in 1980 it lost $15.5m; and in 1981 it lost $17.5m.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1982 it made a profit of $1.6m. As the honourable member made a comment about who was in government, I point out that in 1983 the company lost $71m. The honourable member drew attention to it, so he fell into it. In 1984, the company turned around the loss and has made significant profits. It did so because of the tourist boom, not because of the mugs opposite who would not know how to run any company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was fascinated by some of the comments from those opposite and also by the lame duck excuse about the use of tax havens off-shore. We have heard ranting and raving from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about tax cheats. One of the Government's own operations, Qantas, is also doing the cheating. I have no objection to people using the tax legislation, but we should not be hypocritical. The honourable member for Macarthur and the Treasurer object to it, yet as chairman of one of these famous committees the honourable member for Macarthur defends it tonight. He displays double standards. He should be straightforward in these matters. He is either for it or against it, and he must stand in the marketplace and take his position on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Richmond said, the Bill proposes to finance further acquisitions to fill in the Qantas fleet. In the last couple of years Qantas has had a remarkable history of achievements, but they have taken place as a result of the tourist boom in Australia and the world. We expect a huge growth factor in world tourism in the next few years, which will obviously mean that substantial additional funds will need to be taken up. Therefore, we need to look at how Qantas will be funded in the future-not through lease-back deals through Japan via the Cayman Islands or the Dutch Antilles, but in relation to the actual amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody can buy things on a rising market. They can expand their stock, their playing surfaces and the like in a rising market, but come the crunch, the downturn, those companies must be appropriately capitalised to sustain their positions. This company is not in that position. I ask why it is not. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has woken up. He has had a few phone calls from Sir Peter Abeles. Nevertheless, he now realises that we must capitalise Qantas and Australian Airlines and if we do not they will not be in a position to compete appropriately and so keep their trading position in the markets. Therefore, the Prime Minister says that a committee is looking at these matters and will report back. The committee has met only twice since the famous Australian Labor Party conference held many years ago. It will be speeded up to provide a report. People will hustle about and the committee will meet two or three times in April and make a determination. But the determination will be made too late for the next Budget and we will again dip out on a capital contribution to Qantas and Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> The end of the year will then be close. The capital program of Qantas will build up and more planes will come on stream. Those planes are hard to get. At the same time, the staff of the airline are anxious for privatisation. Anyone who flies will have been told by the staff that they want privatisation. They come along to the honourable member for Richmond and me and say `Please privatise the airline because then you will have appropriately paid engineers to get the planes into the air on time'. How many people tell honourable members that Qantas services run behind time because their engineering facilities are not in place? Qantas has to go offshore and use Aer Lingus, United Airlines and others because in Australia the company cannot meet the market in relation to its employees. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a vast infrastructure has to be paid for. Something like $1.4 billion will go into infrastructure. The money has to be borrowed because according to the Qantas accounts retained earnings are just not there. Thus the gearing goes on in relation to this company. In a rising market, no-one could want for more. In a falling market, no-one wants to be overgeared. Honourable members need only look at Mr Holmes a Court and Mr Bond to see the problems of overgeared companies in falling markets. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon I did an analysis of accounts from the balance sheet of Qantas. Such a thing would not be done much by this famous Government committee looking into financing government assets. It would tell the committee that the Government has either to sell equity in Qantas and Australian Airlines to make them profitable or enable them to sustain their positions in the next few years, or accept higher levels of debt and greater risk to those companies in any future economic downturn. If the Government keeps interest rates going up every day, of course there will be an economic downturn. That will affect tourism more than most other areas of economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the debt position, but will now quote other figures to clarify the situation. In 1986 Qantas's total assets were of the order of $1.6 billion. In 1987 they rose to $2 billion and in the reporting period of 1988, 15 months, they were $2.7 billion. Net income rose from $23m to $172m. The returns on assets were, 1.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent, rising to 6.3 per cent. What an appalling performance!</PARA>

They run around in a little socialist pool over there thinking that because Qantas made a few quid this year it must be good. The returns on the assets of public corporations average out at between 2 per cent and 5 per cent. The average in corporate Australia is between 12 per cent and 16 per cent, depending on the various economic activities that are used as a basis for calculation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next interesting area for consideration is non-recurrent debt; in other words, the total debt that Qantas carries every year in relation to its activities. The debt will have to be repaid. We will take the year 1984 as a random figure-the Government cannot blanch from that-when the debt was $205m. It is now $558m. That is not bad in four years and the Government would have kicked it along quite well. Qantas's debt to equity ratio has fallen under one per cent. We must look at the consequences of that and weigh them up in relation to what the company will face if there is an economic downturn. As I said before to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur, we do not all live in up periods. I only have to quote the years 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983 in which the company made very small profits or substantial losses. Those times will return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not for you, Keith. I do not think that I will bother. The next matter that has to be addressed in relation to the year's accounts, and this always has to be borne in mind, is that while revenue has risen considerably since 1984 from $1.4 billion to just on $3.8 billion, Qantas's profit to sales ratio-this is what has been talked about in relation to Woolworths and Coles, but not in relation to assets-went roughly from minus 5 per cent in 1983 to 4 per cent, one per cent, 2 per cent, 4 per cent and 4 per cent. So Qantas has been averaging less than 4 per cent over the last five years as a profit on sales. I have not got comparative figures with other international airlines, but that is a rather trim figure on a turnover of $3.8 billion in relation to profit on sales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having put that to one side, let me just go quietly across to what has happened to Japan Air Lines (JAL) since it moved from a government operation to a private enterprise. I will quote from an article in Euromoney of February 1989. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The complete privatisation of Japan Air Lines in November 1987 was a mixed blessing for the company's finance department. JAL no longer carries a government guarantee when it raises funds, and its rating has consequently slipped from triple-A to double-A. </PARA>
<PARA> But the company was also released from the requirement of seeking approval from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transport every time it borrows money. Sometimes the bureaucracy involved was stifling, according to Kazuhiko Fujiyama, staff vice-president at JAL's finance department. Anything new, such as a convertible mortgage arrangement with a US bank to finance a real-estate acquisition, might take at least six months to be cleared by the MoF. </PARA>
<PARA> JAL's new-found freedom will be valuable. ``Over the coming three years we need to raise a tremendous amount, so we will have to a look at every corner of the capital markets . . . JAL plans to invest some . . . ($5.6 billion) over that period. Of that total, around . . . ($3.4 billion) will be raised from the capital markets, and around . . . ($1.6 billion) of that overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice between domestic and international borrowings will be made, as a rule, according to the proposed use of the funds. Cargo and airport facilities at Narita and Osaka will be financed with domestic borrowings . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Japanese yen financing is best for airport facilities that don't produce direct income-</PARA>
<PARA>that is another speciality of this Government-</PARA>
<PARA> They need stable long-term money . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On it goes about JAL's financial commitments. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Eight months after privatisation, the airline successfully issued additional stock, and more recently it raised . . . ($1.6 billion) in the domestic commercial paper market in two tranches. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what has happened to JAL, which is a very direct and very important competitor of Qantas, every day of the week in Australia. It shows what it has been able to do since it has moved away from the clutches of government. It has been able to go out and raise money, buy its aircraft, expand its services and meet the requirements. No-one in the world today will deny that JAL is a very competitive and good airline to be on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a highly profitable airline, as the honourable member for Fadden has said. That in itself stands in my mind as a very stark reminder of what we must be doing in Australia in addressing the position of Qantas. It is a company which has enormous potential and is one which we are all intensely proud of. It is a company which, over the years, has made a dramatic contribution to the whole of Australia and in current times is a very big earner of foreign exchange. It has representation across the world. Because of those facts alone it should be given a fair go. A fair go is certainly not a part of the anti-privatisation push within the Labor Party. Unless Qantas is given access to the capital markets of the world it will certainly perish in an economic decline. It cannot take full advantage of its recent associations with Air New Zealand and other airlines around the world unless it is given the appropriate amount of money to do so. Quite clearly that is not going to come from this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We, in government, make quite a clear commitment to it. We will privatise Qantas, let there be no doubt about that. It is something which is desired by the company. We will do that for a number of reasons: because it is better for the consumer as he will get a better deal, it is better for the company employees because they will be shareholders in that company, they will have a pride in that company and they will know what they are doing. They will be involved in the management of that company which will be properly financed. It will not be answerable to the Department of Finance in Canberra, it will be answerable to the shareholders of that company, the citizens of Australia and the citizens who are taking a role in it. More importantly than anything else, it will be secured in its capital base against the fall of any future economic regime within the world. Its equity to debt relationship will be addressed. Its return on equity will become a significant factor. Its profit on sales will become measured, from which Qantas will grow. Its interest cover will be known and its return on assets will become a significant factor in the future. Indeed, given a fair go, Qantas will become one of the great airlines of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who has just resumed his seat, presented what to many would seem a very credible argument as he pursued his ideological position of privatisation.

<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading--</PARA>

<PARA>. . . sale of shares in the airline to its staff and the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA>People who have been listening to the economic assessments of our country keep telling us and will know that one of the troubles in this country is that we do not have the savings, we do not have money in the bank, in the Australians' bank. That is one of the reasons we have an international problem. Of the $100 billion that this nation owes internationally over 60 per cent is owed by the private sector. The Bonds of this world borrowed billions of dollars overseas for takeover purposes. If we had the savings, if the money were in this country, there might be some value in selling certain aspects of the private sector industry to the staff. But that is not what the amendment is about. The honourable member for Ryan is really saying that he would sell the shares in the airline to its staff and to the Australian public, the Japanese, the Americans, the Swiss, the Germans and the Arabs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Richmond knows that the Opposition's policy is to do away with the Foreign Investment Review Board. It has said so; it is emphatic; and its Leader has admitted it. That is the Opposition's stated policy-to remove totally any inhibition, deterrent, or fetter on foreign moneys coming into this country. I know what would happen if we moved down the track put forward by the honourable member for Ryan. We would be Elderising Qantas Airways Ltd and, using another term, placing the airline in Bondage. Elders and Bond are the Australians, the types, the people who stand by the Liberal and National parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously there is a need to ensure that additional capital is available to Qantas to enable it to expand, but that is what the Bill before the House is all about. The purpose of the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer (Mr Keating), on behalf of the Government, to guarantee the repayment of loans borrowed by Qantas for the purchase of new aircraft-in this instance three Boeing 747-400 aircraft, new technology aircraft. I admit that the purchase of these aircraft is vitally important to maintain Qantas's dynamic expansion program. Recently I had the pleasure of meeting Roger Robertson, the director of corporate planning in Australia, who came to Rockhampton to talk about promoting our region through Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas has an exciting story to tell. It is certainly a great emblem for development and advancement in this country. There has been an almost 28 per cent increase in inbound traffic and Qantas is taking on a $5 billion to $6 billion fleet expansion program over the next five years. It plans to increase that fleet from 33 to 50. That is a massive expenditure program in anyone's mind. During the last financial year-the honourable member for Ryan talked about a 15-month period, and that is correct-Qantas carried 4.3 million passengers. To November 1988 inbound tourism reached 2,220,000 people. Its earnings during that period were $3.8 billion. When one sees what Qantas does for our country one starts to realise what a major contributor it is to Australia's balance of payments. Its net earnings in foreign currency during that period were $1.2 billion-that is, $1,200m. By way of comparison, the figure for the previous financial year was $444m. The increase was almost threefold; yet the Liberal and National parties say, `Sell it up. Sell up a great contributor to this country's balance of payments. Sell up an enterprise that is booming'. The time it did not boom was between 1978 and 1982, under the Liberal-National coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas is now Australia's No. 2 exporter. Looking at the top 500 across this country, it rates No. 2. Its overseas revenue for the 15-month period was $2.5 billion. We are talking about a massive industry-a massive earner of foreign moneys. It employs directly 15,000 people and tens of thousands of other people are employed indirectly or get their income from working in and around its activities. It is a great spender in promoting our country. If one adds the wages, office facilities and all the activities in which Qantas is involved in promotion internationally, one finds that it spends $300m a year promoting Australia. It has 80 sales offices in 30 different countries. It is targeting the issues. It realises the expansion that is taking place in the Japanese and Asian markets. It is spending $6m on an Asian language program. Most people would not even be aware of the sort of contribution that Qantas makes. Five million dollars is being spent on upgrading the language skills of Qantas staff, particularly Asian languages, and another $1m is being spent in Australian schools to get our young students to learn foreign languages. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas is heavily involved in all sorts of skills training areas, including the hospitality and catering industry and the engineering industry. It has apprenticeships galore throughout that 15,000 work force. One knows the advantages of having worked in the management area of Qantas, of how that finds one well for other activities in the private sector. Qantas is the leader in tourism, both wholesaling and retailing. It has a well recognised reputation that has been built up over many years-not by idiots who do not know how to run a company-for safety and standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Most members of parliament have the privilege of travelling, as many other Australians do, and when they travel they hear people praise Qantas for its safety, and service standards. It has a wonderful reputation and it is important that that reputation be maintained. As the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) said, it is important that it is able to compete through its aircraft quality. We know that other carriers that serve Australia are also introducing the Boeing 747-400s. So Qantas must maintain its share of the market. It must have aircraft with that extra long range capability to service Europe, the London-Australia trip, and the Los Angeles-Sydney trip. It must spend money doing that. I believe that all honourable members, regardless of their ideology, will say that the $US385m, which is what those aircraft will cost is money well spent, because it will maintain Qantas's competitive base. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas is working for Australia and it should be allowed to continue to do so. It ought not to be allowed to fall into the hands of some foreign interests. One hears the National Party in Queensland expressing concern because the Japanese are moving in and taking over aspects of the beef industry. This industry, this company, this firm, Qantas, would be grabbed up by the private sector, and why? It would be grabbed up not only because of its potential but also because of what it is achieving right now. We all understand that there can be the tough times. There certainly were under the Liberals and Nationals between 1978 and 1982. But there are also the good times, and this country needs to gain the maximum benefit from those good times. It should have a national carrier. It ought to have an aircraft industry that works for Australia and promotes it. That is exactly what Qantas is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas is sophisticated in its activities, monitoring tourist demand changes and understanding that people want lengthened holiday times and more than one destination. Qantas is in there doing it. As I said, recently Roger Robertson, the director of corporate planning for Australia, came to central Queensland with Ray Jeppson, the State Manager of Qantas. The head of the Asian desk has also been because Qantas is looking for new destinations. It realises that the Asians and the Japanese want to see more than just Sydney and Ayers Rock: they want new experiences. Qantas heads of management travel around this country working with local entrepreneurs, sorting out and testing the tourist baskets that exist and promoting regional Australia as an international tourist destination. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome what Qantas is doing. I want to see continued support for it. I do not want to see Qantas sold up and become nothing more than something owned by the Japanese, the Swiss or the Americans. That is where the money would come from. The Opposition talks about attracting billions of dollars in investment, but from where? Its own spokesmen admit that this country does not have the required savings. We must encourage more domestic savings. Where will the money come from? If the Opposition gets its way, because of its rules it will come from overseas investors. That is what it wants to do. It is happy to open the floodgates of foreign investment in this country. It has an official policy to do away with the Foreign Investment Review Board. If the Opposition gains office-I dread the day that that ever happens-Australia will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that capital be available. That is what the Bill is all about. It is important that Qantas be able to compete and continue to expand its activities in Japanese areas. I am told that there are now 15 flights a week from Japan. Qantas is moving to improve the number of Asian tourists coming to this country. It is making sure that Australia is an attractive destination and that people know about it. It is spending money doing it. Three hundred million dollars is a lot of money in tourist promotion and that is what Qantas is spending. I applaud it on its initiatives, the way it uses the flying kangaroo as an Australian emblem and for doing so proudly. It is important that Qantas maintain its pace in its development and expansion. It is important that it be able to compete. However, at this point it is clear that the right measure is to ensure that the loans that Qantas undertakes can be guaranteed. That is what the Bill is all about and I welcome it. I urge full support for it. I urge that the rather insidious amendment put forward by the Opposition be rejected. As I have said, it is not a matter of coming up with some idea to sell shares to the staff and the Australian public. It is really a matter of Elderising or placing Qantas in Bondage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that the hype we just heard from the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) would do Qantas Airways Ltd's public relations department proud indeed. I would like to draw the facts to the honourable member's attention and to that of the House because they point to the tragedy that is now facing Qantas. This year international tourism will grow in terms of this country by 23 per cent. To meet that extra demand Qantas had a plan to develop its capacity by 15 per cent. That figure has now been revised and Qantas has dropped it back to 10 per cent. The reason is that it does not have the aircraft to handle the increased business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate that has been ensuing in this House tonight is very much about the future of Qantas and its capacity to compete around the world as a major international carrier. At the moment Qantas is under all sorts of pressure. Qantas itself has stated that it wants by the mid-1990s to have a fleet exceeding 50 aircraft, but as recently as a fortnight ago the Chairman of Qantas, Mr Jim Leslie, for whom I have the utmost regard, was still calling on the Government to `Please privatise us-please give us the funds that we so desperately need to be able to go out and buy the equipment and to be able to go into the international market and compete'. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the capacity of Qantas to be able to compete into the future. In a matter of days Qantas begins seven flights a week, one stop, Australia-London, and that is good; but Qantas has massive competition on that route. Already the non-stops to the United Kingdom and to Europe are either in hand or are planned by British Airways, Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airline System, Thai Airways International, Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa and KLM. In the Pacific, Qantas has even greater competition, with one of the biggest carriers in the free world, United Airways Inc., going into one-stop and non-stop services there. Air New Zealand-and admittedly Qantas has a small holding in that airline-also will be in on that, and of course United Airlines is seeking more rights. Why is that happening? It is happening because Australia is the major destination. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for the honourable member for Capricornia and other speakers in this debate to talk about this tremendous growth in tourism, but I believe that we are only just now scratching the surface. It is all very well for the honourable member to start talking about the boom in Japanese traffic. The plain facts are that Qantas has had to curtail its plans to operate to Fukuoka and also has cancelled an extra service into Tokyo. That has been brought about simply by the fact that Qantas has not got the aircraft or capacity to handle that business. </PARA>
<PARA> There are desperate problems in Qantas in terms of servicing. From last year Qantas has contracted six foreign airlines to perform work on its 747 and 767 aircraft, which has cost Qantas an additional $10m. Two 747s went to United, others to Air France and to Air Lingus. Another is going to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The 767s are being handled by Air New Zealand, and Singapore Airlines is now undertaking maintenance of Qantas aircraft. Qantas is at desperation level in terms of company structure, staff and the capacity to be able to pay for new aircraft, and we are still just scratching the surface of the available international tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two countries in the Asian- Pacific region that offer as much hope as the Japanese market has been offering us in terms of increasing the number of tourists into Australia and thus the money spent here. For how many years now have negotiations been going on with the Republic of Korea? Korea now allows its nationals to go overseas on holiday. The Republic of China on Taiwan is in exactly the same situation. Both of those countries are desperate to get air services into Australia. Despite the fact that there is no direct traffic, they are still coming. In Taiwan alone there is a potential market for Qantas worth in the vicinity of $55m a year in profits from the Chinese coming into Australia for holidays. That figure would be even greater out of the Republic of Korea. Yet little if any progress has been made in the negotiations for new routes in that area. Those areas are most important to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, one has to look at the great expansion that is now starting to come out of Europe, especially from northern Europe in the form of visitors coming here from Scandinavia, West Germany, Switzerland and France. Going farther south, the Spaniards comprise one of our great potential markets for international visitors into Australia. In those places we have no direct international air routes and even if Qantas wanted them, it would not have the aircraft to service those routes, yet Qantas should be very much in that market. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening now around the world is that the mega-airlines are fast being formed, and Qantas has to get into the big league if it is to survive. Already Qantas is competing against mega-carriers United and Continental on the Pacific route. Arrangements have been made between United and British Airways, which is a massive conglomeration and a massive computer reservation service to compete against. Will Qantas be squeezed out of those markets? If we do not privatise Qantas, if we do not give it the available capital, will Qantas be reduced to a regional carrier? That is a matter of major concern to me because I believe that that is what will happen if Qantas is not allowed to expand. </PARA>
<PARA> The story behind the Qantas fleet problems relates not only to its capacity to be able to expand into these new markets. Qantas, like so many of the major international carriers, is now starting to have some problems with the age of its fleet. It was reported quite recently that a great number of Qantas's 747s are now over 10 years old. There are Qantas 747s flying around the world now at 16, 17 and 18 years of age and, frankly, they are probably getting towards the end of their useful life. They are the old 200 series; there is one 100 series aircraft still in the fleet. No doubt those aircraft will have to go very shortly. Qantas has a two-fold problem-the expansion problem and the replacement problem. It might be said that Qantas still stacks up pretty well against some of the overseas carriers. I suppose that it does, bearing in mind that the average age of the Qantas fleet of 9.62 years compares quite favourably with North West Airlines at 15.47, or Eastern Airlines at 15.11, or United at 14.87, or Trans World Airlines at 15.29. One of the areas from which Qantas gets some of the greatest competition relates to the Asian carriers. For example, Singapore Airlines has the newest and most efficient fleet in the world at 4.50 years; Thai International, which also competes fiercely with Qantas, is at 6.1 years; Japan Air Lines, recently privatised, at 9.14 years; Cathay Pacific, one of Qantas's bigger competitors, at 8.8 years. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that the airlines to which I have specifically pointed are interesting because they are in the private sector and in recent years have had the capacity to upgrade their fleets. They have had the capacity to get into airline deals which have made their operations in many respects much more efficient than some of the traditional carriers I have just mentioned. That will be a problem for Qantas, which has got to join the Asian carriers and get a mega-bloc in this part of the world, or-and this is what worries me-be relegated to just a major regional carrier. For the sake of Australia, the latter would be a great mistake indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas has some expansion plans into Australia and it must have such plans. When a thing is hot, it is hot, and if the international tourism boom is to continue into Australia, we must make sure that we have the capacity to be able to handle it. I think that the Government probably has two choices. It can go on the privatisation road as soon as possible to get that capital injected into Qantas, or we shall have to loosen up the international air regime that determines landing rights in Australia to allow more and more foreign carriers to come in here. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas has always argued that it should have an equal share. I do not think that it is always possible to have an equal share of the incoming market, but Qantas has to have a fair share. It will not have a fair share if we do not allow one of those two things to happen-either to expand the fleet dramatically or to loosen up on the international regulations that govern the other international carriers coming into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my speech, this is a most critical time for Qantas. It is a time when if it does not expand it has the capacity to lose its position as one of the major international carriers in the world. It is a critical time for Australian tourism. When we are booming we have to try to maintain that boom, because many millions of dollars have been invested in infrastructure and tourism in Australia. It is up to those international airlines to bring that traffic in, to make the most of that investment and, indeed, to provide many of the jobs that are available to young Australians through the ever-expanding tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Industry Economics figures should be repeated in this place time and time again. Every time we increase the net number of international visitors coming into Australia by 25,000, we create another 1,400 jobs for young Australians. It is the tourist industry, and only the tourist industry, that has the capacity to provide long term employment for young people in this country. At a time when that industry is booming, at a time when there are hundreds of thousands of jobs now available in the hospitality area, at a time when Qantas is earning massive amounts of foreign capital for this country, at a time when tourism is our second biggest foreign income earner and at a time when we have this massive international debt, it would seem to me to be absolutely crazy to cut that industry and that growth off at the knees. </PARA>
<PARA> What must be done is that Qantas must be allowed to expand. There is only one way in which that expansion can take place, and that is by the privatisation of that company and the injection of the capital that is needed, of up to $6 billion. Governments can never fund that. The real decision that this Government has to make is whether it is fair dinkum about the future of Qantas, whether it is fair dinkum about the growth of international tourism into Australia and whether it is fair dinkum about being able to provide jobs for our young people. This Bill is about more than just guaranteeing three Boeing 747-400 series aircraft; it is very much about the future of young Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with some of the comments made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in his contribution tonight but, of course, not with his argument that the only way in which young Australians will get jobs from having foreign tourists entering Australia is by allowing the privatisation of Qantas Airways Ltd. I do not accept that argument. I will explain a little later tonight why I do not agree with that proposition advanced by the Liberal and National parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Listening to the honourable member for Fadden telling us about his concerns about Qantas ending up as a rump of an airline in our part of the world, listening to the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) reminding the House of the maintenance problems which Qantas has had, like most other airlines, over a long period and listening to the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) telling us about the financial difficulties which he sees for Qantas, one would almost think that Qantas was in great trouble. In fact, at one stage tonight I wrote down that, after listening to the shadow Minister for transport and aviation, the honourable member for Richmond, telling us about bits falling off Qantas aeroplanes and all the other terrible problems that he believes that Qantas is going through, one would think that Qantas had the financial strength of the National Safety Council of Australia and the safety standards of some Dodgy Brothers Airways. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition tonight has simply set out to talk Qantas down. It has set out to discredit Qantas in the eyes of this Parliament and of Australians, who rightly are very proud of its achievements in a very competitive part of the international marketplace. We might simply start by asking, `What has Qantas achieved in recent years?'. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be aware that in the life of the previous Government Qantas did not have a very attractive story to tell. It was not a success story. In 1980, for example, Qantas made a loss of $16m. In 1981 it made a loss of $17m. In 1982 it turned the corner and recorded a great profit of $1 1/2m! That was a great profit for an organisation the size of Qantas! Then, of course, we had the change of government but with the restrictive policies of the Fraser Government still inhibiting the operations of Qantas. It recorded a further loss of $71m in 1983. What is the position today? It does not experience losses of $15m, $16m or $17m today. Last year Qantas made a profit of $153m. That profit will go towards re-equipping Qantas and making sure that it can continue to compete with the world's best. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not forget that not only does Qantas make a very healthy profit but it earns substantial amounts of foreign exchange for Australia. Given the difficulties which our economy faces with balance of payments problems, it is very important that we acknowledge that last year Qantas earned $2,500m in foreign exchange. That is something which can be compared with, perhaps, the maritime industry. Very few of Australia's goods that are shipped overseas are shipped in Australian ships. Because we do not have a shipping industry based in Australia which can compete with the rest of the world, a great deal of foreign exchange goes out of Australia and we lose that revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> If we listened to those opposite, if we followed the Opposition's path and allowed Qantas to be privatised, with the people of Australia no longer able to have any say in what happens to Qantas, sure enough, year by year we would end up with the Bonds and the Elliotts buying up all the shares of Qantas. Those people would move their operations to the Cook Islands, the Cayman Islands or these other offshore operations and would put their personal profits ahead of any consideration as to what is best for Australia and in Australia's interests. Mr Elliott has made it clear on many occasions that, if he believes that he can make a bigger profit in some offshore country, if he believes that he can make more money by brewing beer in England or in Scotland than in Australia, he will take his operations offshore. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the majority of Australians or of Qantas employees want people like Mr Elliott owning Qantas. Qantas has achieved a great deal for our country. The way Qantas can continue to make a substantial profit and earn substantial amounts of foreign exchange revenue is to ensure that the Australian people, through the Australian Government, continue to own it. That does not mean that we cannot ensure that Qantas has the flexibility to compete in the international marketplace. But we must concede that Qantas has been doing very well lately. At the moment Qantas spends more than $240m a year overseas promoting tourism to Australia. If Mr Elliott or Mr Bond owned Qantas, how would we know that they would spend those amounts of money to promote tourism to Australia? They would simply look at maximising their profits. If it meant that Qantas could make greater profits flying to some other country, nothing would stand in their way. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier tonight Opposition members said that Qantas cannot maintain its fleet and that it has to send planes overseas because we have a disastrous wages policy in this country. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) nods his head in agreement, reinforcing the Opposition's opinion. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) also lends his support to that argument. What is the Opposition saying to us? I suspect that the Opposition today does not want a prices and incomes accord between government, business and the trade union sector. The Opposition thinks that is something which restricts the market forces. The Opposition appears to be saying that it wants a deregulated labour market system in Australia. It wants a system where there is no centralised wage fixing, where there is no accord and where there are no national wage case guidelines. What would be the outcome of that today?</PARA>

The Qantas engineers might get a little bit more money today, but they would be paying more in the supermarket tomorrow and on the day after we would be facing massive increases in unemployment. I would have thought that Opposition members would have learned the lessons of the wages breakout in 1981, when Malcolm Fraser was in so much of a hurry to fly off to the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in London that he could not afford to tough out a battle with a certain trade union. He gave in to that union's demands and walked away from the centralised wage fixing system we had in that year. What was the outcome? There were massive increases in wages and, as a result, massive increases in prices. Ultimately there were massive increases in unemployment and a recession-the biggest we have had since the Depression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What does the Opposition tell us we should have now in our current tight labour market with very high levels of growth-the perfect circumstances for a wages breakout? It wants a return to 1981 and the wages breakout. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member shakes his head and disagrees. How can he believe that wages will not break out if there is no restraint upon them? Such a breakout would be led by people such as the Overseas Telecommunications Commission employees and the Qantas engineers. I believe that this Government has been very responsible in insisting that all employees must have wage increases negotiated under the national wage case guidelines. That means that those Qantas engineers, their union and Qantas management must explain that they are entitled to these increases because they have worked out ways to improve productivity. I thought that that was the Opposition's stated wages policy-that people would only get a wage increase if they could prove that they could work more productively. Under the current national wage case guidelines we have a system which says that workers must produce evidence of an improvement in productivity in order to get their wage increase. The Opposition claims that that is restrictive and is inhibiting market competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members do not want any increases based on productivity. What they want is a free-for-all. They want a system like the one that exists in the United States, where the wages of those engineers who work for the airlines are not set by certain market forces, as they would have us believe. Take, for example, Continental Airlines. A few years ago a certain entrepreneur got control of Continental Airlines. What did he do? He declared the airline bankrupt, sacked every employee and then offered wages contracts at greatly reduced rates. He told would-be employees, `You either accept those lower wage rates or you have the sack and you will never work again in this industry'. That is what market forces do in the US; it is happening again to another US airline at this very moment. If honourable members opposite talked to the pilots and the maintenance officials of Continental Airlines who lost their jobs because they refused to work for subsistence wages, they would realise the effects of the sort of market forces that they want to operate in Australia's international airline. I know that the engineers who work for Qantas can see through the Opposition's arguments because they meet people who used to work for Continental and they know what happens when the likes of Elliott and Bond gain control of an airline. They sack the employees and offer subsistence wages. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the honourable member for Gilmore is in the chamber, I wish to refer to a statement that he made in the recent debate on the third runway at Sydney Airport and the proposed second Sydney international airport at Badgerys Creek. On 24 February he issued a press release which said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the tourist industry in Australia could look forward-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, with the third runway at Sydney Airport-</PARA>
<PARA>to a loss of opportunity and an erosion of the recent gains the industry had made. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, if the Government had then decided to go to Badgerys Creek. The press release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> He emphasised that this was due to the Federal Labor Government's refusal to make a sensible commitment to a third runway at Mascot and to deal co-operatively with the NSW Government on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member was adding further weight to this bogus argument that the current traffic movements at Mascot are inhibiting our overseas tourist industry. That is the crux of the argument that people such as him have put forward. That displays the fact that the shadow Minister for tourism does not understand the limiting factor on international jets arriving at Sydney Airport. It is not the runway. International flights into Mascot make up only 16 per cent of aircraft movements at that airport so it is certainly not restricted runway capacity that is the limiting factor. If the shadow Minister for tourism understood his area of interest he would know that the difficulty has been the terminal at Sydney. That is the choke point for international tourist arrivals and departures at Sydney. This Government has already spent a lot of money putting new baggage handling facilities into the existing terminal. It is adding extra gateways at the terminal and spending many hundreds of millions of dollars on a new international terminal at Mascot. The honourable member for Gilmore was probably not aware that the terminal is the choke point which is limiting further expansion of international tourism in Australia. It is not the runway. Perhaps he will go back and study this area a little more closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable members, and other overseas airlines, have been criticising Qantas for seeking to protect its interests on its international routes. We heard this again tonight from the honourable member for Fadden, who has a great deal of expertise in this area. I acknowledge that. The honourable member for Fadden suggested that the Government and Qantas had been holding up negotiations with the Republic of Korea. I took a note of his words and he said that for years the Republic of Korea had been trying to negotiate access to the Australian market. That is true. Of course Korean Air Lines would have loved to have been on the Australian route many years ago. The essential question to ask is what benefit would that provide for Australia. Usually we negotiate these agreements only if Qantas can get some of the tourist market from that country. Until recently overseas travel by citizens of the Republic of Korea was restricted. So what was the benefit to Australia in allowing Korean Air Lines to travel on our routes if the citizens of the Republic of Korea were not allowed to travel overseas? Our Government rightly held off until Korean citizens were allowed to travel overseas. I agree with the honourable member for Fadden that this is an area of great potential for growth and I understand that Qantas and Korean Air Lines are very close to establishing direct flights between our two countries. I hope that area will expand in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the great battle that we have had with the United States of America over flights between Australia and that country. Of course the US airlines are great believers in deregulation of their domestic aviation market but they are not that keen on deregulation and open skies for international competitors such as Qantas. Qantas and the Australian Government had to fight for many years before finally winning an agreement last year for a fair deal for Qantas in the US market. Through the efforts of people such as the then Minister for Transport and Aviation, the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris), who took a tough line with the Americans, we were able to ensure that Qantas now has direct access to three additional gateways in the US. Qantas also has on-carriage rights into Canada, Europe, and other places in the US. I hope that Qantas and the Australian Government will continue to defend very strongly their interests, and therefore Australia's interests, on all of these routes, whether it is within the Asia-Pacific region or on the kangaroo route. We should ensure that our airline is maximising its profits and its returns to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the legislation before the House will allow the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to advance Qantas a substantial sum of money so that it can purchase the most modern and up to date jumbo jets available. I believe that all members of the House will support this and I think it is a pity that the Opposition once again has sought to use this debate to launch upon the people of Australia its arguments as to why Qantas Airways Ltd should be privatised. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) explained very clearly to this House, if the Opposition were elected to government and decided to abolish all foreign investment review controls, how would we know who would end up owning shares in Qantas? Even if only Australian entrepreneurs were able to purchase large amounts of Qantas shares, how could we know that at some future date some Liberal government would not allow foreign investors to purchase our international airline? All we need to do is to look to the US to see what has happened when entrepreneurs such as Elliott and Bond have taken control of an airline such as Continental. The employees get sacked. They get offered subsistence wages and, unless they are prepared to cop them, they are out of a job. That is not something which the people of Australia or Qantas should accept. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dorothea Mackellar, in her vivid description of her feelings towards Australia, as a 19-year-old, penned these famous lines in 1904:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I love a sunburnt country,</PARA>
<PARA>A land of sweeping plains,</PARA>
<PARA>Of ragged mountain ranges,</PARA>
<PARA>Of droughts and flooding rains. </PARA>
<PARA>That latter reference to flooding rains is what I wish to speak about tonight. Over the last few days a tremendous amount of water has been dumped over eastern Australia. Although it has received scant attention in the media compared with Lismore and other coastal flooding, a great deal of that rain fell in my electorate of Parkes. Regrettably, it fell to excess in an area around Nyngan, Coolabah and Warren. While great losses have been caused to cotton crops in the Warren, Trangie and Bourke areas, a 40 kilometre by 100 kilometre area in the vicinity of Nyngan is where the greatest losses and tragedies have occurred, primarily to livestock. Around 80 to 100 properties have been affected. Twenty to 30 properties have suffered large stock losses and about 12 or more properties are in very serious difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> As I ring around these properties the sad story that comes through is that 2,000 sheep are lost here, 3,000 there and 4,000 on another property. One property has lost 6,000 sheep. Who knows at this stage what the total is? It certainly runs into tens of thousands. That is heartbreaking enough, but the real tragedy is that the 40,000 or more sheep that we have so far been able to identify that are still alive will all be dead before the week is out unless help arrives. I am not just talking about sheep huddled on island mounds along with kangaroos, pigs and snakes-if those sheep are fed and if the water does not rise they will survive-I am talking about the tens of thousands of sheep standing in water eight to nine inches deep and up to shoulder height deep. Of course, if the water were any deeper these sheep would have already drowned. </PARA>
<PARA> This water presents a problem. The length of the fleece is critical here because wool is hydroscopic. As it absorbs the water these fleeces can weigh an extra 20, 30 or 40 pounds and that weight will pull the sheep down over a period. Some of these sheep have been standing in water now for 3 1/2 days. If they stand for another 3 1/2 days nearly all of them will be dead. Of course, if they are pregnant, as many are, the situation is worse and if they are near lambing they can run into problems like pregnancy toxaemia. We have to get feed to these sheep quickly. Feeding sheep in water is a problem. Some may not even feed and the feed will have to be repeated every three days. Of course, after seven to 10 days of standing in water the feet of these sheep become very soft and the hooves rot off. As the sheep are standing in black soil, when they move the black soil will suck off their hooves. Blowflies will also become a problem. Today up in this region the temperature was 27 to 29 degrees centigrade. With fly strike the maggots will be eating many of these sheep alive before the week is out. </PARA>
<PARA> We must get these sheep to higher ground. Army ducks have been suggested but apparently they are useless because they can only work either on firm ground or in water five feet deep or more. So many of the farmers up there have been using small flat-bottomed boats which only hold about four to 10 sheep and, of course, the sheep are very heavy to get into these boats. Here is a typical story: I just rang Alan Gadsby at Mulgawarrina. He, his family and helpers spent all day shifting 2,700 sheep 1 1/4 miles from the waist deep water they were standing in through to water which is only eight or nine inches deep. Twelve of them drowned but he still has 10 miles to go before he can get them to ground. Obviously they will have to be lifted by helicopter. Something like a Chinook helicopter that can lift six tonnes would be marvellous if it could gather up these sheep in nets and take them those 10 miles to safety. I appeal to the office of the Minister. If this is thought to work will the Minister provide these helicopters? I know that the Minister has been good and that he is sending a Chinook up there tomorrow. That can cart 160 bales at a time to sheep that need feeding. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I would like to say that the spirit of the people in this area has just been magnificent-not only the owners but also the local shires, the pasture protection boards, the local media and the people in the town. I hope that the spirit of these people in the Nyngan district who are in this desperate plight will carry them through. Perhaps they might just dwell on Dorothea Mackellar's other lines:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who has been talking about the problems that he has been experiencing in his electorate following the recent rains and the floods that they are now causing. I would like to take a few moments of the time of the House to relate some of the problems that are being experienced in my electorate because of the standard of roads throughout the electorate and, in particular, the standard of the Hume Highway between Goulburn and Yass. Between Goulburn and Yass on that now infamous stretch of highway a substantial number of people have been killed in recent weeks and a larger number of people have been seriously injured in motor accidents. I think there was a stage where, over a period of 10 weeks, 13 people had been killed on that section of highway between Goulburn and Yass and, of course, many others were injured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason this is happening today is due to lack of funds to complete the improvement of the Hume Highway to a dual carriageway for its entire length from Sydney to Melbourne. When the Australian bicentennial road development scheme was initially set up under the ministry of Ralph Hunt in the Fraser-Anthony Government, the Hume Highway was supposed to be a dual carriageway for its entire length from Sydney to Melbourne by the year 1988. Unfortunately, due to a lack of road funding by this Government that has not been completed. Today places such as Goulburn, Yass, the Cullerin ranges and Gunning are still experiencing tremendous difficulties with an increasing amount of traffic passing through those areas. Of course, that has now led to this horrific number of accidents occurring on that leg of the highway. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the lack of road funding throughout Australia, we are finding now that many local shires and municipal areas are unable to maintain roads adequately. For example, I have a shire in my electorate that, for the last three years, has not been able to carry out one inch of bitumen road in road construction. The reason is that the Federal Government has not been able to provide any extra funds for it to carry out any extra work. As a consequence, that district is falling behind. As I drive through that area quite regularly I am noticing now that the older bitumen surfaces are starting to break up substantially. As a result, I suspect that, unless a significant improvement in road funding occurs in the next year or two, that shire will be faced with the dilemma of having to tear up that bitumen surface to return it to dirt which is cheaper to maintain and to enable it to maintain that road in a safer condition. There is certainly nothing worse than driving on a very pot-holey, poorly maintained bitumen surface. I think it is even more dangerous than a dirt road because at least on a dirt road one is driving more carefully and slowly. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the situation that we currently face in our country areas of Australia. It is being faced by country motorists despite the fact that we are paying more than 27c per litre in taxes at the petrol bowser each time we purchase a litre of petrol. Motorists are interested to find out that approximately 5c of that 27c is going towards road funding. Unfortunately, that is a totally inadequate amount of funding. When Labor first got into government back in 1983 an amount of $1,250m was being allocated towards road funding by the Federal Government. Here we are, six years later in 1989, with $1,205m being allocated towards road funding by this Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the present Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) putting out statements trying to add to the Federal Government's road funding allocation-funds being spent on roads by local councils and by State governments- and trying to bodgie the figures to indicate that road funding has increased over the period of the last six years. In fact, road funding has deteriorated in real terms to the tune of 30 to 40 per cent. It is for that reason that shires throughout my electorate are now faced with the dilemma of having to tear up bitumen roads to return them to gravel because they are easier and cheaper to maintain and possibly safer to drive on. Of course, that is also the reason why we are finding that we now have horror stretches of highway such as the ones between Goulburn and Yass on the Hume Highway which are leading to a tremendous increase in the number of deaths and serious accidents on that highway. Unfortunately, this will not change unless we have a government that is prepared to allocate more of the taxes that motorists pay at the petrol bowser towards road improvements. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He says more than we are putting in. He has gone a little further than the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). When the Leader of the Opposition was asked that question, he said he could not say whether spending on roads would be increased or decreased under a coalition government. Members of the Opposition in this Parliament day after day say that government spending is too high and that if the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) were Minister for Finance they would cut back Federal spending across the board. They would cut it back for pensioners, for expenditure on hospitals, for expenditure on everything, including roads. That is the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore can come in here and pander to his own electorate by pretending that if a coalition government were elected then all of the problems in his electorate, including the Hume Highway problem, would be solved. We all know that he has to make his speech for his electorate, but the truth is that the Opposition is advocating the opposite. It wants to cut taxes; it wants to cut government spending; it wants less spending on roads. That is the truth of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member brought to the attention of the House the recent tragic fatalities on the stretch of the Hume Highway between Goulburn and Yass. The Hume Highway, of course, is a lot better now than it was in 1974, when the national highway program commenced, under the Government of which you were a member, Madam Speaker. I believe that anyone who has driven between Sydney and Melbourne in recent days knows how much money has been spent on that highway in constructing dual carriageways. Yes, better roads do save lives, and we still have a lot of very bad roads, including parts of the Hume Highway, which need improvement. That will take money and some time. I believe it is dangerous for organisations such as the National Roads and Motorists Association to suggest that it is the roads that are causing these deaths and accidents. The statistics show that in most cases the accidents are caused by driver error-people driving faster than is recommended for the road conditions. If people believe that the roads are at fault in all these accidents perhaps they get a little reckless. </PARA>
<PARA> One other area to which I think Federal and State governments need to pay more attention is the number of deaths caused by heavy vehicles. Madam Speaker, you may not have seen an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 25 March which suggested that it is now common practice for a large number of truck drivers to take drugs which they have nicknamed `speed' to keep them awake when they have been driving for very long periods. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his pharmaceutical advice. By taking these drugs the drivers are able to stay at the wheel for a longer time than they are legally entitled to. The article also suggests that truck drivers are registering log books in several different States so that if they are pulled up by a policeman they can produce one of several different log books showing that they have not breached the guidelines on the number of hours they have been at the wheel when in fact they have. By pulling out different log books, they can avoid being caught.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are now many accidents being attributed to these heavy vehicles, with an increase of over 30 per cent in the last 12 months in fatalities associated with heavy vehicle accidents. I believe there has been such a massive increase that we now need to look at making it compulsory for trucks to have installed some form of tachograph which records the speed of the truck and can be inspected at random by the police and by the Department of Motor Transport to ensure that drivers are not breaching the guidelines. Of course, many truck drivers borrow large amounts of money and are forced to drive for long periods so that they can keep their businesses afloat. However, we cannot allow the people of Australia to face unacceptable levels of accidents on our roads simply because some truck drivers have over-extended themselves in seeking to finance businesses. I hope all honourable members will take on board this idea of a tachograph and that those opposite will consider it in future debates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity tonight to talk about Australia Day. It has been of great concern to me, and certainly to a number of my constituents, that perhaps Australia Day is not understood well by Australians and is not treated with the importance it deserves. I point out that Australia Day actually commemorates the beginning of European settlement in Australia, when Governor Phillip landed at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past, when the date for Australia Day has fallen on a day other than a Monday, the holiday has been held on the Monday following 26 January in order to create a long weekend. However, in 1988, the year of Australia's bicentennial celebrations, the holiday was held on the actual day, Tuesday, 26 January. There was talk of continuing this practice in subsequent years. Unfortunately, that did not happen in 1989. In fact, in some States, including my own, Australia Day was actually celebrated on a day which enabled a long weekend, although in Sydney it was celebrated on 26 January. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the importance of the day is such that we should have 26 January as a public holiday and a day on which European settlement in Australia can be celebrated. This does not mean that we neglect the fact that the Aboriginal people were here 40,000 years before the Europeans came. Nevertheless, we are all proud to have been able to settle in this country, not least myself-I came here as a migrant in 1961-and I think it is therefore quite proper for us to celebrate that day. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the day is that it was first proclaimed a public holiday in 1838, which was the fiftieth anniversary of the founding, but some sort of celebration had been held in Sydney at least as early as 1817 or 1818. Different names, including Anniversary Day and Foundation Day, were used in different States, but eventually the other States followed the lead given by Victoria in 1931 when it adopted the name Australia Day, a title long-advocated by the Australian Natives Association. In 1946 the Australia Day Council was formed in Melbourne to foster national appreciation of the day's significance. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, a number of my constituents in La Trobe are very worried about the fact that Australia Day is not duly recognised or even understood by many Australians. I have with me a letter from Kate Hardie, a pupil of St Michael's School in Berwick. She writes to me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> My name is Kate. I am a grade six student from St Michael's School Berwick. Our class conducted a survey about Australia Day in the Berwick area. The results were very bad indeed. Only 40% of adults and 25% of children interviewed knew who brought the first fleet to Australia. Our class was disappointed by these low percentages to answer such simple Questions. That is why our class have decided to write letters to important people around Australia in hope that maybe they can inform more Australians about our national day. You too could help by maybe putting articles in newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank's for you time. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA> Kate Hardie. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very good letter and Kate has put the situation very well. I know that other honourable members in the House listening to this speech will agree with the point I have made. I should say that whilst I have some difficulty in getting articles in the newspaper, I do not have difficulty in getting up and putting the points of other honourable members in the House. I have done so on this occasion. I have brought it to the most important place-the Federal Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to report to the House an incident that occurred when, as the member for Wakefield, I attended a meeting of the Mid-North Local Government Association held at Spalding, in about the centre of my electorate. The Chairman of the Mid-North Local Government Association is Brian Hern, the district councillor of Angaston. He was more than a little indignant-and so was the entire Association-at a letter the Association had received, signed by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown). The Minister had apparently written to all local government associations expressing his concern about the Australian Automobile Association's and the State automobile associations' criticism of the Government's road funding program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason that Councillor Hern, the Association and the Association's President, who was also at that meeting, were indignant at the Minister's letter was that the Minister's letter contained allegations and assertions which were quite inaccurate. One does not have to go very far in rural electorates such as mine to find ample evidence of the rundown of Australia's road infrastructure under the funding being made available by this Government to sustain what little road work is currently occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> It was most appropriate that the meeting should have been held in Spalding. I have made the point to the Government in this House before that of all stretches of road in Australia, that most neglected and most justifiably needing work is the stretch of road that runs from the Riverland town of Morgan to Spalding in the mid-north of my electorate. If one looks at this stretch of road on the map, one appreciates that for anyone travelling from Sydney to Perth, it is the only unsealed stretch of highway. </PARA>

Anyone travelling from Sydney to Perth entering South Australia and reaching the Riverland town of Morgan is forced to run south of Eudunda, almost into the Adelaide environs, if that person wants to stay on a sealed road. The attraction of sealing the stretch of road that runs from Morgan to Spalding is that it would allow Sydney to Perth traffic to stay on a sealed road without having to run south into the Adelaide area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The crazy situation currently facing the Mid-North Local Government Association is that this stretch of road, over which a grader can be run, bringing it up to tolerable conditions, is, as soon as it is brought into condition, torn apart by truckies who find it such an attractive route that they use it. Because it is unsealed it promptly falls into disrepair. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has already been made by a previous speaker on the other side, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), of his concern about the way truck drivers treat other road users. What truck drivers need is not more regulation but the opportunity to work in a more deregulated environment. What forces truck drivers to put in the hours that make them hazardous drivers is the reality of the interest rates, the fuel costs and the tyre costs forced on them by this Government. Frankly, the truckies of Australia would be much better served if the stretch of road that currently runs from Morgan to Spalding were sealed and serviced so that they are able to make the trip from Sydney to Perth without having to venture further south into South Australia than they would normally choose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of honourable members to the imminent retirement of Mrs Joan Frost, who has loyally served this Parliament and previous parliaments continuously since 1952. Joan began her career as a casual waitress during the first session of the Twentieth Parliament and worked in the dining rooms in casual and sessional capacities until 1968, when she became senior waitress in charge of the Members' Dining Room. Joan continued as senior waitress for 10 years until she became a full time office assistant in 1978. Her career culminated in her frequently acting as food service manager from 1983 onwards. She was substantively promoted to that level in 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Her 37-year record of service to the Parliament forms part of a longer family tradition. Her father was chef at the Hotel Canberra for many years and catering manager of the Parliamentary Catering Service until his retirement in 1965. Her late husband Reg, originally a bellboy at the Hotel Canberra, subsequently became a barman in the Members' Bar before becoming a Senate attendant. Their four children also did some casual catering work in the old Parliament House. Honourable members may wish to make their personal farewells to Joan at a reception being held in her honour in the Members' Guests' Lounge at 18.30 on Wednesday, 5 April 1989. I am sure that you will all join with me in wishing Joan well for a long, happy and well merited retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was shocked by the remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), particularly his remarks about wanting to deregulate the trucking industry. I am sure that he would be happy only if truck drivers were taking more amphetamines and the police were totally abolished. He has no understanding whatsoever of the pressure that the truck drivers are under in trying to speedily complete their trips. I feel for these truck drivers. Whilst I think it is fair enough to marshal out some of the blame for our road toll to truck drivers, I think we also have to look at their employers and at the terms and conditions of the contracts they sign which often force them into taking these unnecessary risks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) has also spoken on roads, a very important issue and an issue on which the Federal Government has every bit of credibility. The Opposition has none. The Opposition advocates that tax cuts should be fully paid for by cutting expenditure, yet Opposition members have the hide to get up in this House and say that the Federal Government should be doing more for roads--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In their electorates. But they advocate that Federal expenditure should be reduced significantly. What utter hypocrisy! They defend the position of the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA), which has no credibility on this issue whatsoever. The NRMA has taken the most political stand. It does not say in my electorate `Why does the State Government not nominate the F4 freeway as a national arterial road? If it did so, we would not have the toll that Mr Greiner is going to give us. We have Liberal State candidates saying that the Labor Government wants to put a toll on this road, but what has happened? Twelve months after the Liberals are elected they are putting a toll on it, which is completely unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motorists of western Sydney are going to pay a toll, and not because there are not sufficient funds. I have spoken to the Minister about this. They will pay the toll because the State Government will not nominate the freeway as a national arterial road. It wants to embed in motorists' minds the idea that New South Wales should be dotted with tollways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is market forces, as the honourable member says. We believe that where there are Federal funds for roads, motorists should not bear the burden of double taxation. Therefore, there are no tolls on Federal roads. That is why a toll was recently removed. It was inconsistent with Federal policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me get back to the NRMA. What is this organisation, which is running a vicious campaign on roads, doing about its householder insurance for people who have suffered floods? People in my electorate have suffered floods three times in less than 18 months. What is the NRMA doing to those individuals? It is terrorising them. It is refusing to pay out. It is refusing to insure them. What a despicable record!</PARA>
