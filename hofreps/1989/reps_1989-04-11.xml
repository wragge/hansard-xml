<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will the Treasurer confirm that last week he was made aware that, as a result of the dividend imputation arrangements contained in the May 1988 superannuation reforms, at least one major life office will not be paying any tax on its funds investment income in 1988-89, nor does it expect to pay any tax next financial year and, furthermore, that its accumulated tax credits on its investment income are expected to wipe out the impact of the 15 per cent tax on employer contributions over the same period? If this experience is common to other major life offices, does the Treasurer intend to revise downwards his anticipated revenue collections of $925m in 1988-89 and $1.2 billion in 1989-90?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That related to the so-called bringing forward of the former tax on lump sums. All that the honourable member's question demonstrates is that the Government's initial claims were correct, that is, that a superannuation fund could minimise its tax to zero on its fund income by streaming imputed credits. I have been made aware that a number of the principal funds managed by a major superannuation fund, the AMP Society, expect that they will not be paying any tax at the 15 per cent fund rate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Opposition members-Former member?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I meant to say the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. The Government's decision to exempt the Australian Wheat Board from State regulations is yet another demonstrable example of this Government's commitment to micro-economic reform. It is a commitment which has been met by action, as outlined in the statement yesterday by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision I announced yesterday, coupled with initiatives already put into place by this Government, will ensure bigger returns to Australia's 40,000 wheat growers, through lower costs in all aspects of their industry. For reasons which most people find impossible to fathom, the National Party of Australia has a problem with the notion of reducing wheat growers' costs and giving them the freedom to make their own decisions. I quote the honourable member for O'Connor:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the people who are treating farmers as fools are in fact the Grains Council and the National Party who say you're all dumb fellows.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of the Government's latest initiative, the Liberal Party will have the guts, surely, to tell the National Party where to get off. The Nationals can no longer be regarded as just rural socialists; they are rural Stalinists, as emphasised by this morning's moaning and groaning from the Queensland politburo. It is at it again. Between the Nationals in Queensland and in Victoria it is 1987 all over again for the Opposition Leader, and he knows it. It all comes down to commitment of principle, the national interest, and that vitally missing ingredient in the Liberals' makeup-political courage. Senator McGauran is saying the Opposition still opposes the legislation, despite the wimpish agreement reached in the joint party room last week. Who is running the show on the other side? By delivering these new powers to the Australian Wheat Board, the Government will bring about important efficiency and service changes to State-run monopolies, such as railways and bulk handling facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> It will come as no surprise to honourable members that the Queensland Government does not want a bar of this. It has been sitting on its collective backside for more than 30 years, draining excessive transport charges out of both the grain and the coal industries. The nonsense of the freighting arrangements of coal in Queensland is well appreciated by honourable members on both sides of the House. Premier Ahern has predictably issued a warning that hundreds of grain trucks will start moving through the electorate of Merthyr, just in time for the by-election brought about by proof of corruption in the Queensland National Party.</PARA>
<PARA> There will be no noticeable increase in the road transport of grain if the Queensland Government gets its act together and makes the Queensland railway system truly competitive without the necessity of monopoly legislation. The Hawke Government's micro-economic reform runs are well and truly on the board. It is about time that people on the other side stood up for what they allegedly believe in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer him to his statement made in the House yesterday regarding interest rates and Citibank Ltd. He said that the comments of more responsible institutions, particularly the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac Banking Corporation, had been, in his words, a much better guide over time than some of the more irresponsible comments.

That is why I was quite happy to say a few words yesterday about Citibank. The implication of the question is, of course, that the Liberal Party would have some other policy.

The Opposition does not have a wages policy and it would have to squeeze the life out of Australia, crush Australian business and crush wages with a draconian monetary policy, yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the hide to get up and ask me about interest rates in relation to housing.

I am pleased to say that in those circumstances the applications for grants of citizenship for the current year are already 36 per cent higher than in the previous year. The campaign has created considerable media interest. It has also stimulated considerable public discussion. It has raised the level of awareness about the value of citizenship. I am pleased to say that that is not only amongst non-citizens but also amongst citizens in the wider community. Amongst the very considerably enlarged number of people who have become citizens we have had the pleasure of welcoming a number of prominent people as fellow Australians during the past six months including, for instance, the actor Warren Mitchell and the singer Jimmy Barnes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can assure the honourable member that the Government will continue its efforts to promote a positive concept of citizenship as an expression of commitment to Australia. We acknowledge, of course, that citizenship is not the only indication of commitment to this country and its future. But I hope we will all agree, including those sniggering opposite, that citizenship is an important symbol of an identity as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that these statistics, which are quite overwhelming, put the lie to the statements made by those who suggested that this was a hollow campaign with little purpose. It is quite clear that there has been reciprocity here. On the one hand the Government has made a significant effort to promote the benefits of Australian citizenship and on the other hand, I am pleased to say, the Australian community, as we would have hoped and expected, has responded magnificently.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member prides himself on having some technical facility, yet he has the audacity to say that tax cuts paid from the Government surplus are unfunded. That is what he said. That was the prelude to the question-that they are unfunded. They are entirely funded. They have been funded by the largest reduction in public sector outlays in our history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite may laugh at that, but the fact is that Commonwealth outlays rose to 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) under the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. This year they will be 25 per cent of GDP and next year, 24 per cent. In other words, by the end of next year we will have Commonwealth Government outlays back to their early 1970s levels. It is that 6 per cent shift in outlays and the dramatic shift in the public sector borrowing requirement which have so changed the state of Australian investment. But, in relation to the Budget, it is a six percentage points change in outlays which has produced the surplus. The tax share in GDP today is exactly the same as it was in 1985-86. But the fact is that we have outlays of 25 per cent of GDP. That is where the surplus comes from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To be parading around the country dishonestly referring to them as unfunded tax cuts or, even more dishonestly, suggesting that there has been no restraint in Commonwealth expenditure when we are in our third year of negative outlays growth, about to come into a fourth, reducing it to 25 per cent of GDP after the squalid spending on the Opposition side of politics in the period of the last Government of which the honourable member was an adviser to the then Treasurer, says little about his economic credentials. It leaves the honourable member's economic credentials where we think they are-nowhere. When the honourable member had an influence on this place, it was hidebound and regulated. Its fiscal policy was at the highest level of outlays ever. It had the most draconian and haphazard monetary policy in the world. It had no wages policy. Of what value was the honourable member as an adviser? Not content with wrecking the place once, in an amazing coincidence of personalities the coalition wants to bring back the honourable member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Stone, the three villains of the piece, to do it again-the Leader of the Opposition on his second go round. Anyone can slow down economic growth, but it takes a special kind of talent to make an economy contract, to make an economy get smaller. That is what the Leader of the Opposition did in 1982-83. He gave Australia the first negative growth in 30 years. And who was his principal adviser? It was the honourable member for Wentworth.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hawker for her question, in which she drew attention to what I would describe as a laughable but unfortunately cruel stunt that has been played on young people in Australia. This poll purports to give the results of a self-selected phone-in of just 61 people who responded to an exercise run by a group called the Campaign for a Fair Deal. The fact that 5 per cent of these callers-that is, three out of the 61-said that they wished to supplement or did supplement their income through prostitution is waved around as having some veracity. It also purports to say that young people are more interested in stealing than they are in working. One can imagine how the results of this poll might have been cooked up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By contrast to this mickey mouse survey, the Government has conducted three major surveys during the period from 1984 to the present. The results of those surveys have influenced Government policy and have led to the development of a comprehensive policy for young people. During our surveys, the most recent of which was conducted in 1988, we took a scientifically selected sample of 2,000 young people nationwide and asked them a wide range of questions about their concerns and aspirations. Specifically, two-thirds of them supported the replacement of unemployment benefit for 16- and 17-year-olds by the job search allowance. Indeed, a majority of the unemployed young people themselves supported that move.</PARA>
<PARA> The central finding of that survey was that the three key issues of concern to young people were jobs, money and education. They were the underlying planks which led us to develop our policy, which actively promotes the acquisition of knowledge and skill by young people, thereby improving their employability, by encouraging young people to stay at school until the end of year 12. As a result, retention rates have increased from about 40 per cent to just under 60 per cent in the period that this Government has been in office. Our policy does not discriminate between young people in need of income support, whether they are in education or looking for a job. It also makes it possible for young people from economically disadvantaged families to stay at school longer.</PARA>
<PARA> Since we have been in office the number of Austudy recipients has grown by 132,000 or 75 per cent, and the rates of those allowances have in some cases almost doubled. The Government's policy also provides training opportunities for more young people than ever before in Australia's history. The number of apprentices has grown by 46 per cent and in 1988-89 15,000 young people will be joining the Australian traineeship scheme. Our policy also links income support for the young unemployed with constructive measures to help them obtain work. There will be 8,000 participants in job clubs and job search training courses, many of them through SkillShare. These initiatives combined have led to the fact that there are now 80,000 fewer teenagers out of work and looking for a full time job. Another policy has been foreshadowed by the Opposition. It is a policy which wants to make people work for the dole, a policy which introduces an unacceptable and indiscriminate form of compulsion. I can tell honourable members that under this Government there will be no return to the susso.</PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that, the campaign's South Australian survey is a massive slur on young people, because young people are not like what has been demonstrated or purported in the survey. Therefore, it brings no credit to the people who produced this survey's results and, I might say, to Senator Janine Haines who was associated with its launching. If she is prepared to believe those figures, it is not surprising that she believes some other cockeyed poll which suggests that she has some chance of winning the seat of Kingston. The fact of the matter is that young Australians are not interested in handouts or a life of dependence on the state. They want education, training and jobs. In short, they want the opportunity to succeed-an opportunity which this Government is giving them.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1317" SPEAKER="West The Hon S.J." NAMEID="XJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CUNNINGHAM" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The policy with regard to preference as it applies to government purchasing, as it was implemented by the former Government and this Government, is under review by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and me. Current preference arrangements, as they apply to procurement policy, allow for a 20 per cent notional discount on Australia-New Zealand content on purchases over $20,000. As that is a notional discount, it is seen by many people in industry and the Government as a protective device rather than a measure to enhance the competitiveness, both locally and internationally, of Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had extensive consultations with industry and trade unions and have received significant input from the Bureau of Industry Economics. They have reported to me and Senator Button. One of the interesting points to come out of the report is that they say that present preference arrangements influence only less than one per cent of total government purchasing contracts which amount to something like $8,000m per year. On the other hand, some industry sources say that the policy should be retained because, for one thing, it is a signal to local industry of government support, particularly at a time of very strong restructuring of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA> On balance, I could say to the House that I believe that there is scope for major change in the present preference arrangements-changes that would alter the present protectionist nature of that policy to a system which gives Australian industry an edge but at the same time still provides an incentive to Australian local industry to become even more competitive than it is now. So we are considering these issues. I would expect to put the submissions before the Government in the very near future and I would expect to make some announcements some time in early May.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts as alluded to by the honourable member in his question are basically right. Last Friday night at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport traffic was allowed in the normal curfew period between the hours of 11.15 p.m. and 2 a.m. The reason for that was that industrial action had been taken by the air traffic controllers at Sydney which closed the airport on the busiest night of the week from 8.30 until 11.15. As a result, the airlines experienced very severe traffic disruptions. It was my view that these were exceptional circumstances that provided the appropriate circumstances for a dispensation to be given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, these were exceptional circumstances and it would not be my view that the continuance of industrial action at Sydney Airport involving its closure in the evenings would enable a continuing pattern of curfew dispensations to be given to allow flights during the night. Indeed, I can assure the residents in suburbs surrounding Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport that the noise reduction strategy introduced on 30 October last year will continue to apply. In this regard the Government has no intention to change or dismantle the curfew arrangements that currently apply for aircraft movements at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA> The serious dispute which lies at the bottom of this matter does not involve matters of safety or staffing but matters of money. This is simply a naked claim for additional pay, way outside the wage fixing guidelines, by a small group of members of one union who are acting against the wishes of the Federal body of the union. I understand that they indicated clearly at a meeting this morning their continued intention to defy their Federal union in relation to its proposal as to what was the appropriate policy to be pursuing. The fact is that there have been negotiations between the Civil Aviation Authority employing body and the union about an award restructuring which has already got to the stage where notification has been given to the Industrial Relations Commission that this matter should be brought before the hearing which is currently taking place to review developments in award restructuring. If proceeded with, it could result in air traffic controllers being amongst the first group of employees in the country to receive increases from award restructuring. However, the action is being taken by the Sydney air traffic controllers and supported by resolution, but so far not by industrial action by the Melbourne air traffic controllers which would put all that at risk and certainly create the situation in which there can be a continuance of severe disruption of aviation in this country by closing down periodically, if not more often, the major airport in the country. The Government's view of that quite clearly is that we will not tolerate the granting of a wage claim which is outside the wage fixing guidelines. Air traffic controllers along with everyone else have to abide by the wage fixing principles and the air traffic controllers at Sydney should understand that whatever industrial action they take will not lead to the Government taking action which would be a concession outside the wage fixing principles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of quite baseless claims made by Senator Janine Haines, Leader of the Australian Democrats, I think in a circular which was distributed to the electors of Kingston, that this Government supports cuts in child-care services. I do not believe that the electors in Kingston or, indeed, any Australians will be taken in by that kind of allegation because I think they very clearly recognise that this Government has made an unparalleled contribution to child-care services in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give the House just two statistics. In the last sixteen years, Commonwealth governments have spent $1 billion on community-supported child-care. Of that $1 billion, $850m has been spent by this Government. The result is that we have increased the number of child-care places from some 46,000 in 1983 to 114,000 now. As a result, in any given week some 132,000 families benefit from the child-care program, generating employment for the equivalent of 22,000 full time workers. But in this expansion we have exercised an appropriate restraint. We have redirected moneys from an across the board subsidy to an income-related fee relief subsidy. We have held the fee relief ceiling at $90 and we have taken steps to make quite sure that those fee relief subsidies are paid appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA> The areas which have benefited-this is a classic illustration of the inappropriateness of what Senator Haines is saying-are those with young families, such as Kingston. In the last six years, the six years of this Government, five new long day care centres have been established in Kingston. Expenditure in Kingston on child-care services is now $2.4m. The next stage of our child-care program, that is, the 30,000 new places, again will go to areas where there are families in need-electorates such as Kingston.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his question. I acknowledge his continuing commitment to the interests of members of the Defence Force; something which is well known on all sides of the House. I have seen a report of the comments of the Opposition spokesman on veterans' affairs on this issue. He is quoted as saying, `We can't just rely on the good intentions of the Government'. Given the general bipartisanship on the question of conditions for our Namibian contingent, I find these comments from the Opposition somewhat disappointing. Such comments raise needless fears in the minds of the families of the men who are serving in Namibia. My colleague the Minister for Defence already has announced that the members of the Australian contingent in Namibia will be provided with full operational service repatriation benefits. Those benefits include death or invalidity cover, access to service pensions and-importantly-the defence service home loan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has advised me that drafting instructions have been issued to prepare the necessary amendments. These amendments should be ready for introduction into the Parliament in the next two sitting weeks, as I understand it. The Veterans' Entitlements Act will be amended to provide members of the Australian contingent in Namibia with eligibility for service pensions under part III of the Act. In addition, the Defence Service Homes Act will be amended to extend eligibility for the defence service home loan to those members of the contingent who do not already qualify.</PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the Opposition, interested as it is in this question, will assist in the swift passage of the amendments. These amendments will have a date of effect of 18 February 1989. I therefore can assure the honourable member for Brisbane and, indeed, the House that all members of our Namibia force will have full operational service protection against any accident or injury for the duration of their service in Namibia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Briefly, yesterday in Question Time, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) had some remarks to make about a conversation I had with the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. His comments were repeated in the Australian Financial Review this morning. The Treasurer attempted to portray that discussion with Mr Kelty as a scathing attack on me and the Opposition's industrial relations policy. I do not propose to go into the contents of that discussion; it was a private one and I will leave it on that basis. However, to correct the misrepresentation, I simply make three points. Firstly, that conversation-as were conversations with a number of other senior members of the trade union movement in this country-was a frank and constructive conversation. As I say, I have had a number of those and I will continue to have such discussions. Secondly, the tone of such conversations, across the board, has been dictated by a realisation by many in the trade union movement that there is about to be a change of government and that it is important--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wills-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Prime Minister)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable members will recall that in November last year the Government announced a number of inter-related inquiries into the administration of Aboriginal affairs. The background to the establishment of these inquiries was material provided and statements made in Senate Estimates Committee processes, and elsewhere, alleging serious shortcomings in the administration, including financial management, in the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) announced in this chamber on 7 November 1988 that he had asked the Auditor-General to undertake a comprehensive audit of the Aboriginal Development Commission and to extend this, as appropriate, to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He announced also that the Public Service Commissioner would be investigating questions concerning personnel management in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and that the Department of Finance would investigate any staff classification issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, he announced that the Government recognised that certain matters might still require further examination in the light of these specialised investigations and that the Governnent had asked Mr Andrew Menzies, am, obe, a former Deputy Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, to make any such inquiry. The Auditor-General and the Public Service Commissioner are, of course, independent statutory officers, and the Government made clear that Mr Menzies would also be exercising an independent role in following up any outstanding matters. The Government also made it clear that each of these inquiries should be as thorough as those conducting them judged necessary. It was the Government's intention from the outset that, in the light of the outcome of these inquiries, it would consider whatever steps might be necessary to address any problems brought to light. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now able to advise honourable members that most of these various inquiries have been completed. The Public Service Commissioner and the Department of Finance have completed their inquiries. Moreover, as a result of a further request from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance has prepared a broader report on financial management in the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members already know, the Auditor-General has completed a substantial part of his remit, with only a report on some particular enterprise projects in the Aboriginal Development Commission area which were brought to notice in the Senate yet to come. Mr Menzies has completed an interim report which outlines the process he is following in his inquiries and the matters which he has excluded. In particular, he is not re-examining issues which have been dealt with definitively by the Public Service Commissioner, the Department of Finance or the Auditor-General in their reports. Mr Menzies has identified two issues in the Auditor-General's report which have not been or are not being dealt with to finality by the Auditor-General and which Mr Menzies sees as appropriate for his investigation. He indicates that these two matters are under active investigation, together with a comparatively small number of matters arising from submissions received from the public or otherwise brought to his attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Menzies outlines in Part II of his interim report the matters under investigation but recommends that that part of the report not be published generally. The Government accepts his recommendations that, in view of the continuing investigations, Part II should not be published. It has, however, been made available to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines). I make the important point that, pending Mr Menzies' final report, I shall not comment today upon the conduct of any individual. Nor should others prejudge the findings. Attempts to ascribe guilt by allegation or smear are simply unacceptable and should not be pursued by anyone inside this chamber or outside of it. The Government also has, of course, the recommendations and views of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident, therefore, that the primary issues of administration in the area of Aboriginal affairs have been covered in all the reports we have now received. Against this background, I now table in the House all the reports referred to, excepting the Auditor-General's report which has already been tabled and Part II of Mr Menzies' report. With the bulk of the inquiries now completed, the Government is in a position to inform the Parliament of its views and intentions concerning organisational arrangements for the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio on the basis of thorough consideration of the material now available to us. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will be following me with a detailed statement concerning these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, of course, stands ready to refine its response, and undertake any further action, should that be necessary, when the remaining reports are received. They will, of course, also be tabled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset it needs to be acknowledged that administrative shortcomings, some of them serious, are evident in the area of Aboriginal administration. The Government does not sweep aside these shortcomings; nor will we shirk our responsibility to correct them. In the case of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Auditor-General found that, overall, there was a lower than acceptable standard of administration. Clearly, administrative practices in a wide range of areas will have to be tightened. The Government recognises this, the Department knows it and some steps have been taken already. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Finance concluded, in relation to certain staff classification matters, that the action taken by the Department was not well founded in terms of classification principles and processes. Honourable members should note, in this regard, that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has accepted the Department of Finance's conclusions, and the necessity of appropriate corrective action. On the other hand, I believe it is important to note that, as the Auditor-General's and Public Service Commissioner's inquiries found, some of the more vocal critics of the Department were unable to provide evidence to back their claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service Commissioner has not substantiated allegations of patronage, favouritism, nepotism and cronyism in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. No hard evidence was produced that would warrant investigation under the Public Service Act. The Public Service Commissioner's delegate, Mr H. B. MacDonald, found no more than that there was an occasional lack of prudence or judgment and that there were some deficiencies in the Department's personnel practices, most particularly an inordinate delay in approving an equal employment opportunity program. Mr MacDonald also concluded that it was essential to clarify the policy guidelines on Aboriginalisation-that is, enhancing access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to employment in the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The much more fundamental problems brought to light in these inquiries are in the programs administered by the Aboriginal Development Commission rather than the Department. The special audit report's major criticisms are directed at the way the Aboriginal Development Commission administers its enterprise funds-pointing to a number of failed enterprises and less than rigorous oversight by the Commission. In nearly all cases mentioned in the report, Audit found that the ADC had failed to apply the criteria set out in its legislation, and concluded that the most serious defects in administration were in the ADC's approval procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that there are proposals in the broader Department of Finance report for a strengthening of administrative support in these areas, and for the exercise of greater control, through clearer and more specific ministerially endorsed guidelines. The Government has taken these findings into account in the response which I shall outline and on which the Minister's statement will elaborate. </PARA>
<PARA> Before outlining the Government's response to the findings of these inquiries, it is essential that I reaffirm the two basic principles at stake in this crucial area of government administration. There is, first, the imperative for self-management, by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, of Government programs designed to assist their well-being. If there is one lesson that emerges from 200 years of contact between the original inhabitants of this country and the Europeans who have arrived since 1788 it is this: that after all the benign neglect, the paternalism and the failed attempts at assimilation, we today realise that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders themselves are the best judges of their needs and priorities. In recent years, the imperative of self-management has received considerable bipartisan support and it is one to which this Government has shown its fundamental commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, there is the thoroughly complementary imperative for proper ministerial responsibility and accountability for, and effective parliamentary scrutiny of, programs as a whole, especially in relation to their financial administration. The nub of the issue before us, then, is finding the right balance between the principles of self-management and of overall ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Many critics-including in this House-have failed to see this need for balance. They have drawn the facile conclusion that answers to the administrative shortcomings that have been identified, especially in the Aboriginal Development Commission, lie solely in winding back self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes it is possible-indeed, it is vital-to strike a better balance; a balance that both widens and deepens the opportunity for self-management, and establishes a more appropriate means of financial accountability and ministerial oversight. That is precisely what the Government's proposed legislation for the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission seeks to achieve. It seeks to widen the scope for Aboriginal self-management to encompass all of the programs undertaken within portfolio agencies, and to deepen its real effectiveness by giving Aboriginal people at a regional and local level a far more specific responsibility to determine priorities and outcomes. It seeks also to establish the right mechanism for ministerial involvement which will genuinely uphold the principle of accountability to the broader Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Government's determination to proceed with the ATSIC legislation. Nothing that has emerged from these inquiries has eroded the Government's fundamental support for the concept and nature of ATSIC. But we can and will draw on the work of the Senate Committee and on the inquiries to refine and improve the details. In his statement today the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will describe the Government's intentions on amendments to the ATSIC legislation, particularly in the light of the report of the Senate Select Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is appropriate in this context to remind honourable members of some of the legislative history of Aboriginal self-management, and in particular to point out that the ADC itself was developed, under the previous Government, with a less than conventional level of ministerial oversight for a statutory authority. I begin by quoting the words of Senator Neville Bonner, the first Aboriginal member of parliament, in giving, on behalf of the previous Government, the second reading speech on the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill in the Senate on 21 November 1979. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government, in introducing the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill, is taking steps to put into effect what I have been saying for a number of years-the placing into Aboriginal hands of the control of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Aboriginals will be responsible for the decision making. Of course (he said) this is not to say that Aboriginals also will not make mistakes. It is to be expected that we will as we all do. But Aboriginals should have greater sensitivity to Aboriginal needs and they will learn from any mistakes they make while exercising this responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable members will know, the legislation to establish the ADC was not actually passed until 1980. The amended legislation, again in the words of Senator Bonner, was designed to `strengthen the commitment to self-management' and to achieve `further steps down the road to making equality a reality for Aboriginal Australians'. He was able to say that because the weight of the responses to the original Bill was to reduce the role of the Minister and expand the role of the Commission. I would also remind honourable members of some important points made in that 1980 Senate debate by Senator Chaney, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is an element of risk in Aboriginal self-management. I think it is a risk which both the previous Government and this Government have seen as a worthwhile risk. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to those Members of the Opposition who are concerned, that they look at the limitations of ministerial power in this Bill as compared to the Bills that the Opposition when in Government put through the Parliament in 1974 and 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I think they will see that we are progressing in the way that one would expect towards withdrawing ministerial authority. I do not suggest that the Bills that were passed in 1974 were wrong for their time. I suggest that, as one would expect, we are moving in a direction of increasing Aboriginal control rather than ministerial control. </PARA>
<PARA>The significance of this recital of the background to the ADC is that it shows without any question that both sides of this Parliament have made, and welcomed, moves to give Aborigines a greater say in the design and delivery of programs to advance their status in Australian society. We all have been prepared to accept what Senator Chaney termed `an element of risk'. In reaffirming my Government's support for ATSIC, I make the point that, given this legislative history, the proposed new Commission is the logical and appropriate next step for the advancement of both the great principles  of self-management and ministerial accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do the reports of the inquiries not undermine the Government's belief that ATSIC represents the correct way forward-we are encouraged by some of the positive implications for ATSIC's basic structure in the inquiry reports. For example, the special audit report illustrates the problems which can arise when one agency, the Aboriginal Development Commission, confuses its activities in enterprise funding with its own wider socio-economic responsibilities, and those of other agencies. It also points up some difficulties the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has experienced in providing a balanced range of services to communities in response to their expressed needs. While the report does not draw any conclusion, the Government notes that such problems as these would be reduced by bringing the full range of programs under a single administration, by eliminating the potential for overlap, and by planning systematically on the basis of communities' and regions' own priorities. At the same time, the Government accepts that it cannot proceed with these changes without addressing as effectively as possible the administrative shortcomings brought to light in the various inquiries, and the need for accountability and appropriate ministerial involvement and parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had already, in the development of the ATSIC Bill, sought to provide for greater ministerial involvement-through the Minister being able to establish guidelines within which the new body would be required to operate in the administration of policies and programs, and being closely involved in the monitoring of priority setting through approval of estimates on a regional basis. These controls are designed to prevent the possibility of any radical departures from the approved estimates and policy goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will note that the Department of Finance report tabled today recommends that the Minister should be given a broad role to approve the estimates of the Aboriginal Development Commission; should consult on the Commission's corporate plan; and should issue broad policy guidelines, especially where financial administration is concerned. The ATSIC legislation which the Government is proposing will meet those requirements. We have, moreover, considered to what extent the thrust of those recommendations should apply to the ADC while it continues to function in the lead-up to ATSIC, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will indicate in his statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Also relevant is the recommendation made by the Auditor-General that the Government review the business enterprise provisions in the ATSIC Bill. The Government has done so and a more detailed statement covering its consideration of both the general financial accountability and business enterprise provisions of the Bill will be made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The Government has also determined that it will respond to the problems raised in the various inquiry reports, and to the suggestions made by the Public Service Commissioner for strengthened support, in the following ways. We will amend the ATSIC legislation to establish an Office of Evaluation and Audit, details of which will be provided in the Minister's statement. We will ensure that adequate resources are provided to the new Commission to enable these audit and reporting functions to be carried out effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> We will make sure that there are sufficient resources, including for training and by way of a temporary infusion of specialist managerial skills, for the new Commission. The Public Service Commissioner's reports pointed to the need for better training and improved management practices, and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is discussing with the Public Service Commissioner the best way to implement those recommendations in the Department as it is now. Dr McIver, in her report last year, as consultant on the new Commission's staffing and administrative structure, also concluded that a very active staff development program would be vital in the Commission's early days. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the reports have highlighted the need for training Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who work in community organisations, if they are to function with proper financial management, the Government will look to how it can intensify its efforts under the Aboriginal organisations training program. More immediately, the Government recognises the need to spell out and clarify the policy of Aboriginalisation for specific staffing positions concerned with formulation of policy for, and direct delivery of services to, Aboriginals, especially within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the new Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We will require that relevant Commonwealth agencies establish-in consultation with the Public Service Commissioner and relevant unions-policy guidelines on enhancing access by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to employment, and that appropriate equal employment opportunity plans be in place on the establishment of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not be appropriate to conclude this statement without making mention of those many people whose diligence and commitment to the cause of the Aboriginal people cannot be questioned. The efforts of so many of these Australians, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal alike-including those in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission-are beyond the demands of duty. Indeed, some of the shortcomings that have been identified have arisen, not from base motives, but from a genuine determination to overcome the appalling disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is as a result of those efforts, over very many years, that government sponsored programs are, gradually, improving the health, housing, education and employment of Aboriginal Australians and are, steadily, strengthening Aboriginal communities through land rights, through enterprise development, and through the provision of services to improve basic living conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> My Government is proud that, in recognition of this vitally important work, we have continued to make substantial real increases in allocations to Aboriginal programs in an era when it has been necessary to wind back the growth in overall Commonwealth expenditure. The inquiries have submitted the administration of Aboriginal affairs to an extraordinarily detailed scrutiny and have produced a wealth of material and analysis in a relatively short time frame. The Government appreciates the effort of all of the agencies and people involved, and I take this opportunity to thank them for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the time has now come, especially in this Parliament, to cease the constant stream of allegation which has dogged this vital area of government administration. The Government's approach is, as I have indicated, to draw upon the lessons from the inquiries and to look to the future-to ensure that mechanisms are put in place and support provided so that future administration is on a sound footing. We are determined to address administrative problems in a way which ensures a higher quality of future administration in this very important area of government and, in the long run, a higher quality of life and sense of belonging for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the end of his speech, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made an appeal to the members of this Parliament not to make any more allegations about the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I say on behalf of the Opposition in reply to that appeal by the Prime Minister that we will go on making allegations about the administration of this Department and, indeed, any other department of the Government while there is a public interest in our doing so. I also say to the Prime Minister that it is a pretty pathetic appeal and a pretty pathetic argument for the Prime Minister to suggest that there is something wrong and unfair in raising allegations about the administration of the Department when he knows, as I do, that the matters still under consideration by Mr Menzies relate to allegations made in the Parliament about the administration of the Department. So let us get a measure of what the Prime Minister is asking us to do. He is saying, `Don't hit us any more. Don't raise any more criticisms of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but at the same time I want you to understand that there are certain matters under consideration by Menzies which should not see the light of day because those allegations are still being considered'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The four reports into the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and nothing the Prime Minister has done today dispels the force of this criticism, demonstrate a number of things: they demonstrate that there has been a massive waste of taxpayers' money; they demonstrate no clear policy direction; they demonstrate the funding of projects without any accountability; they demonstrate a misuse of travel; they demonstrate breaches of finance directions and hospitality guidelines; and they demonstrate unjustified staff reclassifications. In other words, they demonstrate a litany of maladministration and ministerial incompetence and yet, true to form, just as when the economy goes off the rails, when inflation is roaring out of control, when we are in hock to the rest of the world, when all about us is gloom and doom on the economic front, that is never the Government's fault. It is somebody else's fault. It is never the fault of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or the fault of the Prime Minister. It is always the fault of the people who want to buy a house, the foreigners or a former government. It is a wonder that sometimes the Government does not go back to Federation and blame Sir Edmund Barton for the difficulties that this Government faces and apply the same principles. When it comes to Aboriginal affairs, nobody in the Government is to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government can have four reports that damn its administration, it can have a Minister who misleads the Parliament, it can have a Minister who demonstrates a complete contempt for his accountability to the Parliament, it can have what would be, if it were not tragic, a comic pattern of maladministration and waste of taxpayers' money, but at the end of the day there is one thing the Hawke Government never does; it never admits that it has made a mistake. It never admits that; it is always somebody else's fault. I think that the Australian public are getting fed up with that cop-out. If ever there was a Minister who has demonstrated that if the Westminster principle means anything he should have gone, gone and gone many times before today, it is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). </PARA>
<PARA> What I intend to do today in replying to the Prime Minister is to take the Prime Minister's own words. They are not my words; they are not the words of the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles); they are not the words of any of the external critics of the Government. They are the Prime Minister's own words, used in his statement today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there is the thoroughly complementary imperative for proper ministerial responsibility and accountability for, and effective parliamentary scrutiny of, programs as a whole, especially in relation to their financial administration. </PARA>
<PARA>So I will take the Prime Minister's own test, that is, the imperative of proper ministerial responsibility. I will take the House through some of the things canvassed in these four reports. I will invite the House to make a decision as to whether this Minister has met the Prime Minister's self-proclaimed standard today. I will ask members of this House and others listening to this broadcast whether at the end of that examination this man, in any sense of self-respect, can remain on the front bench of this Government. I think anybody listening to the evidence, anybody realising to start off with that there were no less than four examinations into the administration of the Department, would agree with me. The pathetic excuse of the Minister is, `I have always wanted another structure, therefore I cannot be blamed for anything that goes wrong with the existing structure'. The Minister nods his head. That has been his excuse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will point, because the Minister is in the dock of Australian public opinion. I will go on pointing at him because he has disgraced his ministerial oath. He has not given a proper account of his administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Do honourable members know what this pathetic Minister's equally pathetic excuse is? He says, `I want another structure, therefore I cannot be held accountable for anything at all that goes wrong with the structure I think has to be changed and improved'. What an incredible proposition. That is the equivalent of the Treasurer coming into this Parliament and saying, `Because I would like the Treasury organised in a different way, because I would like some of the functions now in the Treasury to go to the Taxation Office, until that change takes place, you cannot blame me for any level of incompetence, administrative or ministerial, inside the Treasury'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that the Minister has not exercised proper ministerial authority and control. The Minister has never been in control of his Department. Of the four major inquiries that have been held into Aboriginal affairs, by far the most damning is the Auditor-General's audit into the administration of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The audit report is an indictment of the Minister, and it is an indictment of the Prime Minister for allowing the Minister to continue to hold a ministerial position. It exposes maladministration at the highest level, but most important of all, it exposes a dereliction of duty that is unforgivable from a government which in this area, more than any other area of its administration, uses moral outrage as a political weapon. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever there was an area of government affairs where moral outrage was used as it is by this Minister and this Prime Minister, it is the area of Aboriginal affairs. Whenever one disagrees with the Minister or the Prime Minister one is bashing Aborigines or one is a racist. One is not allowed to have a different view. If one does, one lacks compassion for Australia's black citizens. If one disagrees with the Minister one does not understand the Aboriginal people. If one disagrees with the Prime Minister's constant professions of moral concern, moral outpourings and moral outrage about the Aboriginal people, in some way one is forgetting the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister and to his guilt-ridden Prime Minister that the present generation of Australians has every reason to be concerned about the fact that the Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged cultural group in our midst. We on this side of the House will yield to nobody in this Parliament or elsewhere in our concern to improve the lot of Australia's Aborigines. I also say to the Government and to the Minister that they will never improve the lot of Aborigines in 1989 and beyond by empty symbolic gestures such as treaties. I take the opportunity of saying again that if the Government wants to divide Australian against Australian, if it wants to create a black nation within the Australian nation, it should go ahead with its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation and its treaty. In the process it will be doing a monumental disservice to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister and to the Prime Minister that all the breast-beating today about the Government's concern to get the ATSIC legislation through and all the breast-beating by the Prime Minister about the necessity for a treaty will not in any way divert the public gaze from the fact that these four reports have permanently crippled the Minister's credibility as a Minister in this Parliament. They ought to have permanently crippled his credibility as a member of the Hawke front bench. If anybody thinks that I am indulging in any exaggeration or any hyperbole, let me just read what the audit report had to say. It said that the policy guidelines of the Department are `out of date, unrealistic, not relevant, not measurable, ambiguous and too narrow'. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr N.A. Brown" NAMEID="PD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who said that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was said in the audit report. It was said of a department that this man has had responsibility for. He will say, `That is not my fault; it is Clyde Holding's fault. It is somebody else's fault. If you had given me ATSIC there would not have been a problem'. But who is responsible? Who lays down policy guidelines? They are not laid down by the Public Service; they are laid down by the Minister. Policy is the responsibility of the politicians. Carrying out policy is the responsibility of the bureaucrats. How does the Minister escape that responsibility? He does not. He ought not be allowed to escape that responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the ministerial standards of the Hawke Government are so contemptibly low that Ministers can get away with any measure of ministerial irresponsibility and lack of accountability and still go on smiling. `Westminister responsibility', says the Prime Minster, `what does that matter? That is some fuddy-duddy old notion about doing the right thing, telling the Parliament the truth and being responsible for the mistakes that are made in one's name, with one's knowledge, connivance and encouragement. Let us not get worried about fuddy-duddy notions about ministerial responsibility. We do not want to get concerned about that'. </PARA>
<PARA> The audit found that $500,000 provided for consultation in relation to the treaty was contrary to the purposes of the ADC's Act and consequently illegal. But that is not the end of the matter. The reports go on to say very plainly what a litany of failure this Minister's administration has been. I waited in vain for the Prime Minister, in his nine-page statement-this man who is always parading his candour, his honesty and his straightforwardness to this Parliament and the Australian public-to acknowledge that this report had really been damning of the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the ADC. But oh no! The Prime Minister, in typical style, grabbed the statement in the report that was the most favourable to the Minister, presented it as representative of the flavour of the report and then invited us to accept that all ought to be forgiven. Now, after four examinations and after the excruciating embarrassment of exposure before the Senate inquiry, where the work of such people as Senator Tambling brought to the attention of the public the disgraceful maladministration of this Department, the Prime Minister says, `We ought to forgive it all, because now they have been exposed and found out, the Department of Finance has extracted an undertaking from those in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that they are going to be good boys in the future'. The Minister nods his head as the Prime Minister says, `That is right. That is a big concession to parliamentary and ministerial accountability'. The Government asks us to take seriously a Minister who, for months and months, has presided over this shambles; has been found out; has been excoriated in a number of reports; and has been rapped over the knuckles by the Auditor-General and sundry other inquirers. The Department of Finance has said that the Minister's Department is in a mess, but because, at the end of all of that, the Minister has said, `In future I am going to be a good boy', we are expected to clap him and walk away saying, `Good on you, Gerry. You are doing an absolutely terrific job for the Australian Aborigines and the Australian public'. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as it is becoming futile for the Opposition to raise points of order in this Parliament, it is also becoming futile to expect the Minister, or the Prime Minister, to apply the ordinary standards of ministerial responsibility. If the Minister had been a member of Whitlam's administration he would have been out on his ear months ago; let alone had he been a member of any administration on our side of politics, which applies proper standards of ministerial behaviour and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone imagined that the charge laid by the Opposition against this Minister and this Government was confined to maladministration, incompetence, or ministerial failure, he or she would be mistaken. The issue goes beyond that. The Opposition also charges the Minister with having misled this Parliament. It is not sufficient for him to have been an incompetent administrator; he has also misled this Parliament. Let me give the House a classic example of the standards which this Minister has adopted, in terms of accountability to this Parliament. On 6 March last, my colleague the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs asked the Minister a simple question. He asked the Minister whether he stood by his earlier statement that at a meeting with State and Territory Aboriginal Affairs Ministers last November, the Minister had said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we had unanimous decisions . . . on every issue raised there. </PARA>
<PARA>I invite all members of the Parliament to listen to the Minister's reply:</PARA>
<PARA>There was a tied vote. Therefore the vote lapsed. There was a unanimous decision that I would write to them and I would communicate with them. Therefore it is unanimous. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister blandly gave that reply. He then chose to regard himself as having given a proper account to this Parliament. On tests of accountability, ministerial candour and ministerial and bureaucratic competence, this man no longer deserves to be a Minister in the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to deal with one or two aspects of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation. The Government announced this afternoon that it intended to go ahead with the implementation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. As members well know, this Bill has been scrutinised by a Senate inquiry. Many concerns have been voiced by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. It is hard to feel confident, in the face of those expressions of concern, that this Government is making a rational and sensible decision. The minority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs said that many Aboriginal people simply did not understand the legislation; they were taken for granted; they were not adequately consulted; their support was assumed; and they did not think the legislation should be proceeded with. We on this side of the House cannot, and will not, ignore those statements. We do not believe that the Government has effectively addressed those concerns or statements. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many commentators on this issue. The pathetically inadequate selective quotations by the Prime Minister of what Senator Bonner and Senator Chaney said eight or nine years ago in relation to entirely different legislation do nothing at all to remove the concerns that I have expressed. Many commentators have pointed to the dangers of legislation which takes the principle of self-determination for Aborigines to the point of creating completely separate representative structures. I think it is a very bad step for the long term unity of this country to establish the structure envisaged under the ATSIC legislation. The Minister can look as grave and earnest as he chooses. He can express the moral outrage that is the stock in trade of the Hawke Government on Aboriginal affairs issues, whenever it gets into a jam, which is usually the case on anything remotely connected with ethnic or racial difference. The Government always gets into a lather of moral outrage in an endeavour to intimidate anybody who disagrees with it. But the concern about the sheer national idiocy of creating one nation, separate and apart from the rest of the Australian nation, is not a concern confined to the Opposition parties in this Parliament. There are many people right across the political spectrum-constitutional lawyers, media commentators, State and local bodies, and ordinary Australian citizens of every different background-who are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is one thing, above everything else, that we in this Parliament should regard as our sacred and absolute duty, it is the preservation of the unity of the Australian people. The ATSIC legislation strikes at the heart of the unity of the Australian people. In the name of righting the wrongs done against Aboriginal people, the legislation adopts the misguided notion of believing that if one creates a parliament within the Australian community for Aboriginal people, one will solve and meet all of those problems. I say to the Minister that if the Government establishes this ATSIC legislation it will create more resentment and more division. Where it seeks to produce accord, peace and harmony, it will sow mistrust, resentment and division. The Minister and his Prime Minister will be held accountable by the Australian people for having done that. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister of what Professor Colin Howard said. He is not one of my relations; he is certainly not one of my political confreres-he is a former political adviser to Lionel Murphy. On this issue, writing in a recent review, Professor Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the long run it is folly to enact a racial law which manifestly divides Australians instead of uniting them. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister, the members of his Government, and those many thousands of misguided supporters around the country who passionately want to help Australia's Aborigines-as do so many on our side-to think again. This is even more important than my criticism of the Minister, serious as I am in that. If the Government enacts this legislation it will create statutory division in this country which it has not had before. The only way to bring about a proper accord between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians is to embrace Aborigines fully within the Australian community; to treat their deprivation and their disadvantage-which I do not dispute-as a manifest responsibility of the entire Australian community. The Government will not lift up Aborigines, embrace them, and right their wrongs by signing treaties or creating black parliaments. It will bring upon them more distrust, more hostility and more misunderstanding. I ask the Government not to go ahead with the legislation. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `this House condemns the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for his failure to correct the defects in the administration of Aboriginal Affairs which were apparent from the time of the dismissal of the Secretary to his Department as revealed by successive Government reports.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-It is now 16 months since I first made a statement in this House outlining the Government's proposals to significantly restructure the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. In that time, much has happened. We have had the most extensive consultation ever on a piece of Commonwealth legislation affecting a particular group of people. We have had a significant response to the proposal from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people right across the country. We have had a politically motivated smear campaign from the Opposition to try to thwart the plans of the Government and the Aboriginal community. But the Government is determined to proceed with its legislation establishing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal to establish ATSIC was announced on 10 December 1987. Since that time we have made many modifications, taking into account the views expressed to me and others during the extensive consultations with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Today I will outline additional changes. Many of these changes deal with the question of accountability. This is an area which, I remind the House, is just as important to Aboriginal and Islander people as it is to government. </PARA>
<PARA> During the consultations I had with communities around the country on the ATSIC proposal Aboriginal and Islander people stressed to me that they did not want to be set up to fail. They did not want to take part in the decision-making process if it meant operating under flawed legislation. They were happy to accept the increased responsibilities but only if they received the necessary resources and training for the job. They did not want to be blamed for other people's mistakes, which has happened too often in the past. The Government has no intention of setting Aboriginal people up to fail. ATSIC will be provided with proper training and resources. But the legislation will also provide a series of checks and balances to ensure that all participants in the decision-making process-from the regional councils through to government-are accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> The basics of ATSIC will not be affected by any of the changes I will announce today. I remind the House of the main features, as contained in the Bill passed by the House last year:</PARA>
<PARA>a system of regional councils, elected by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders resident in that region, which will determine priorities, develop regional plans, and generally represent the interests of the region;</PARA>
<PARA>commissioners, of whom the majority will be elected by regional councillors grouped into zones for this purpose;</PARA>
<PARA>the Commission replaces the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC);</PARA>
<PARA>programs would be administered by Commission staff with funding direct to Aboriginal organisations and individuals;</PARA>
<PARA>other portfolio bodies-Aboriginal Hostels Ltd (AHL) and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS)-would retain their independent existence, but would have three ATSIC commissioners on their governing bodies;</PARA>
<PARA>staff would come under the Public Service Act;</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister's powers would balance the requirements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-management with those of accountability to the Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA>a new body, the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC), would be formed to provide finance and services, on an independent commercial basis, for major enterprises involving, and of benefit to, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus ATSIC will combine, in the one organisation, the means for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have a real say in the management of their own affairs with an administrative structure that eliminates existing overlaps, is more responsive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wishes, and attains appropriate standards of accountability for public funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Accountability</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has already spoken of the Government's response to the findings of the Auditor-General in his special report on the ADC and on the Department. I affirm our resolve to address the problem areas identified in that report with vigour and determination. We have examined the Auditor-General's findings to see where they may bear upon the ATSIC legislation, and in particular on the provisions relating to accountability. At the same time we have taken into account the report of the Department of Finance into the ADC's financial administration. Both these reports lend support to the view that our proposals for ATSIC will result in a more effective administration of Aboriginal affairs. It is already the case that the ATSIC Bill contains stronger provisions than the ADC Act-for example, through the authority of the Minister to approve the estimates, which he lacks under the ADC Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes to the Bill must be considered in the context of the basic principle of ATSIC that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have greater control over matters affecting them. The question is one of balancing this principle with the principle of ministerial accountability for the correct and efficient use of public funds. We therefore propose that the ATSIC Bill be amended to:</PARA>
<PARA>establish within ATSIC an Office of Evaluation and Audit, to undertake evaluations and internal audits on programs, projects and procedures. Project evaluations will be on a continuing basis, while for programs and regions there will be a three-year cycle of general audits. More intensive examination will of course flow from any shortcomings revealed in the general audits. The Office will report regularly to the Commission and the Minister, and annually to the Parliament through the ATSIC annual reports. The head of the Office will have senior rank and will be appointed by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA>require ATSIC to observe financial directions to be made by the Minister;</PARA>
<PARA>require ATSIC to keep the Minister informed about specific projects that are encountering difficulties;</PARA>
<PARA>require ATSIC to prepare a corporate plan and to consult the Minister about it; and</PARA>
<PARA>clarify the distinction between commercial and non-commercial activities-a problem which has bedevilled the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>It might be noted that one of the recurring criticisms by the Auditor-General was that projects were funded without there being community plans against which to assess priorities. The ATSIC Bill addresses this need. Coordination of community and regional planning is one of the functions of regional councils. </PARA>
<PARA>Senate Select Committee</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs reported on 28 February on the ATSIC Bill. Senator Tate, who represents me in another place, is tabling today the Government's responses to the recommendations of that Committee. We have accepted, in whole or in substance, the great bulk of the recommendations of the majority report. Those recommendations include, I point out, support for the Bill proceeding in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall confine my comments here to the more substantial proposals for change to the Bill, commencing with those relating to the regional councils and the election of commissioners. The Select Committee expressed some concerns about the disparities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations as between regions in a zone, and as between zones. These differences exist because we have sought, as a result of the extensive consultations which have been held, to accommodate the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as to where boundaries should be drawn, thus taking into account kinship ties and community of interest. This has undoubtedly been the right approach. Comparisons with legislatures and the principle of one vote one value miss the point; ATSIC is not a parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless the Government recognises that a system where one region in a zone with a small population has the same voting strength in elections for a commissioner as a much larger region, has some inequitable features. Accordingly we accept the Select Committee majority's recommendation 11 to provide a sliding scale of regional councillors, starting with 10 for regions with populations of under 1,000, with an additional councillor for each additional 1,000 or part thereof up to a maximum of 20-the number presently in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also addressed the issue, identified by the Select Committee but on which it made no formal recommendation, of substantial population imbalances as between zones. To this end we propose that the five most populous zones be split in two, thus raising the number of elected commissioners to 17. In New South Wales, the Sydney region will comprise a new zone, as will the Perth region in Western Australia. The Northern Territory zone, which comprises much of the Northern Territory, will be split into two separate zones. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland, which has the largest Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, two new zones will be created. One is for the Brisbane region, and the other to accommodate the wishes of people living in the so-called DOGIT communities-those who hold a form of title to their land under deeds of grant in trust-to be encompassed within the same zone. A new map is being drawn up to show the proposed changes. I believe these proposals will make for a better balanced system of regional councils and, through the revised zone structure, a more equitable system for the election of commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 12 proposes, inter alia, voluntary enrolment for regional council elections, but compulsory voting for those who do enrol. The Government's intention has been that no special roll be established and that, as with the elections for the former National Aboriginal Conference, voters fill out a `voter card' on the day. There would be mechanisms for testing the eligibility of voters to take part in the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appreciates that the Select Committee has been concerned to find a system which would provide both the opportunity for persons of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent to choose whether they wished to vote in regional council elections and a means for checking the eligibility of voters. The Government has given careful thought to voting systems. In its view the overriding consideration is that a public roll based on race, whatever its purpose, should not be established in this country. We will explore possible alternative systems with the Australian Electoral Commission. The details will be contained in the electoral rules which I am to prescribe in accordance with clause 95 of the Bill; that clause provides that the Parliament may disallow such rules. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of the recommendations are for tightening up existing provisions of the Bill. They deal with such matters as eligibility for elected or appointed office, pecuniary interests, full written assessments of proposals before substantial expenditures are approved, acting appointments, and employment of consultants. The Government accepts these recommendations, with some modifications to bring them in line with the require-ments of other organisations established by statute. Although it modifies the Government's original intention to bring all bodies in my portfolio under one umbrella, we will also accept recommendation 3, which proposes that the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies should continue to be established under its own legislation. Other aspects of the proposed reforms to the Institute's structure will proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee looked closely at the preamble to the Bill. The majority, while recognising that concerns about possible wider ramifications of the preamble were not well based, has suggested that it could help to allay such concerns if the preamble were removed from the Bill and moved separately, without amendment, as a resolution of both Houses. The Government stands by its conviction that the preamble is of such significance that it should not be separated from the Bill. Australians should not back away from acknowledging, in a symbolically important way, the facts of history and our resolve to address the present effects of past injustice. We will not be diverted in our purpose by those who have chosen to represent the preamble as having a degree of legal force that it does not possess. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee's recommendation 2 is important, and has received close attention. It proposes that enterprise and related functions of the ADC be transferred, not to ATSIC as the Bill proposes, but to the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation-the AEDC. ADC's housing functions, however, would transfer as planned to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided not to transfer those functions to the AEDC. The reason for this is that the AEDC is intended to operate in quite a different way. It will not administer programs but will facilitate and participate in significant commercial enterprises involving, and of benefit to, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It would be inappropriate, and would dilute the commercial nature of the AEDC, to have it take on programs, especially programs which include quasi-commercial aspects such as grants and concessional loans. ATSIC, through the regional council planning processes, is designed to accommodate a whole range of community needs and in so doing will reduce the present wasteful duplication of administrative structures, including field services. I note here that the recent report of the Auditor-General has highlighted the problem that the ADC has often faced in separating its commercial and social functions. Maintaining the AEDC as a strictly commercial body will help address those concerns expressed by the Auditor-General. The ATSIC Bill will improve the capacity of the Minister to oversee enterprise activities in line with recommendations made by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the first recommendation of the Senate Select Committee that a separate Office of Aboriginal Affairs be retained within the Employment, Education and Training portfolio, I should point out that the ATSIC Bill does not restrict the advice available to the Minister to that provided by ATSIC. Indeed, it was always envisaged, under the ATSIC proposal, that there could be circumstances where the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and also the portfolio Minister, might occasionally require separate departmental advice on issues concerning ATSIC, and that this advice would come from the portfolio Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be clear from what I have said that the Government rejects the minority report of Opposition senators in seeking to have the Bill withdrawn. They have not established a case. Their report is long on assertion and colourful phrase, but woefully short on accuracy and fact. For reasons best known to themselves they wish to perpetuate a system-a system which they created-which is patently not working as it should. It is not a system for meeting the legitimate expectations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for a real say in their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Changes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity will also be taken to make a number of other changes, essentially machinery and minor in nature, to the legislation-for example, in relation to dates of operation. A summary of the main changes to the ATSIC legislation is attached to the printed copies of this statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation and Timing</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC has already been delayed well beyond the original proposed starting date. That has created considerable problems for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who naturally wish to know that promised and needed reforms will not be put off again. The delays have also left portfolio staff uncertain about their futures. In addition they have had to deal with a constant barrage of abuse from the Opposition as well as cope with the onerous task of responding to hundreds of questions on notice which have taken them away from their normal duties. I am very conscious of the additional difficulties this has caused for them, as it has for portfolio management. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the way in which portfolio staff have continued to undertake their demanding and important tasks with commitment and efficiency, in often trying circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still some reports to be completed, including a further report by the Auditor-General and some investigations by Mr Andrew Menzies. It is unlikely that these reports will show a need for further legislative change, but should it prove to be otherwise I shall, of course, bring forward proposals for such change. The timetable that I propose for implementing ATSIC takes this into account. I would also add that we will continue our consultations with the staff associations in the lead-up to the implementation of our proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments I have outlined are important but do not affect the substance of ATSIC. We believe they will be widely welcomed and acceptable as desirable improvements. We therefore propose to press ahead with the legislation in the present sittings of the Parliament. Once the legislation is passed, there are a number of processes to be completed before the new Commission can become fully operational. These include the holding of regional council elections, the processes for which will take some months, and the election by regional councillors of the commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very conscious of the need to minimise uncertainty and avoid further drift. It is also very conscious of the degree of confusion which has been generated in the community as a result of the political campaign waged by the Opposition. At the same time we recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people need time to understand the changes that are being made and, more broadly, to get to know more about ATSIC and how it will work. They need to have this information before being asked to make the important decisions of electing their regional councillors and then those regional councillors electing com- missioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Our preferred course is that the commission be established on an interim basis from 1 October 1989. This will be done under transitional arrangements which will allow for the appointment by the Minister of five commissioners, including the Chairperson. This arrangement will have a 12 months sunset clause. </PARA>
<PARA> We would then allow an extensive period for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to become familiar with the way ATSIC will work, and for the administrative structure to shake down. A major educative and training effort will be made during this time. Regional councillor elections will then be held, and ATSIC would become fully operational within this 12-month period. This phasing-in approach will help ensure that ATSIC comes into operation smoothly and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Already the ATSIC concept has been open for consultation and comment for over 15 months. We have made a series of refinements and modifications as a result of those processes. We will also ensure that ATSIC is properly resourced to undertake its important tasks. In its management and administration, ATSIC must have its priorities right from the start. It will have to put a lot of effort into such areas as corporate planning, program budgeting, policy and program guidelines, and evaluation and internal audit. </PARA>
<PARA> Another vital need to come out of the inquiries is for a much improved training effort to enhance the skills of those working within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and of portfolio staff and to ensure that ATSIC is properly understood by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> Some State and Territory governments-this was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition-have expressed concerns about ATSIC. I have sought on a number of occasions to provide opportunities to meet with them and I am continuing to do so. This is notwithstanding the fact that no State or Territory should have anything to fear from ATSIC. It appears, however, that some are happier to complain rather than put their views to the test. </PARA>
<PARA>Immediate Needs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> ATSIC will not be operational for some months, but there is clearly a need, identified in the reports of the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General, to act now to remedy deficiencies within the present structures. We shall ensure that the ADC, during its remaining life, operates on a similar basis to ATSIC and in a manner that properly reflects Government priorities. The problem lies, at least in part, with defects in the ADC Act. By a combination of amendments to the Act, cognately with the ATSIC legislation, and of directions to the ADC under section 11 (1) of that Act, we will require ministerial approval of estimates and consultation on its corporate plan; issue broad policy guidelines, especially relating to financial administration; and empower the Minister to request information and advice. A summary of the main proposals is also attached to this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as my Department is concerned, problems identified in the reports can only be addressed by administrative action. This action is currently being taken. In this regard I am able to report that considerable progress has been made in respect of a number of matters identified by the Auditor-General as requiring improvements. These include: substantive work on the development of revised performance indicators; the acquittal of grants to Aboriginal organisations; revision of financial guidelines for grants; and the acquisition of additional field resources for some regional offices of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The changes we have made to ATSIC have not come about as a result of actions by the Opposition. It has had the opportunity but has failed to make any constructive contribution. The Opposition has only sought to delay the proposal and generate confusion within Aboriginal and Islander communities. The Opposition has demonstrated that it is not interested in any kind of progressive reform. It is certainly not interested in Aboriginal people being part of the decision making process. The only conclusion we can draw from the Opposition's stance is that it cannot accept the role of Aboriginal people as decision makers. It cannot accept that Aboriginal people must be part of the processes of government. It cannot accept that Aboriginal people are the ones who can best determine their own needs and priorities. I am happy to say that the Opposition's efforts have clearly failed. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, for the first time, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians will have a real say in matters affecting them. We are putting an end at last to paternalism, to the idea that others must decide what is best. We cannot amend history, but we can act to correct its adverse effects for today's and tomorrow's Australians. That is what ATSIC is all about. It is an achievement of which all Australians will be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> For the information of honourable members, I present the Government's response to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> In my speech earlier I indicated that the ADC, during its remaining life, should operate on a similar basis to that envisaged for ATSIC and in a manner that properly reflects Government priorities. I also went on to say that what problems have been experienced have been at least in part because of defects in the ADC Act. I want to highlight this point about the significance of the problems of the Act for it has been all too easy for this to be overlooked. Indeed, this problem has been substituted by attacks on individuals. ADC commissioners all along, but especially the present ones, feel very strongly they have been working to make the ADC effective in advancing the interests of Aboriginal and Islander people and yet been criticised unfairly. I want to take this opportunity to make it clear that the task of the ADC commissioners has been a difficult one which they have striven to handle well. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of this criticism it is important that any action I take can be seen as assistance for their task. I believe the Auditor-General's report and the report of the Department of Finance have highlighted the need for consistency of action across the portfolio. I therefore now table a set of general directions to the Aboriginal Development Commission which I have issued under section 11 of the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980. In essence these directions, as I said at the opening of my remarks, ensure that the ADC will operate for the remainder of its existence on a similar basis as envisaged for ATSIC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clear reality of today is that we would not be here having this debate if it had not been for the work of the Opposition in highlighting the lack of accountability in Aboriginal affairs and the shambles and chaos that we have seen over the last six to eight months. That is the reality of today. There would be no debate, there would have been none of these reports and there would have been no Senate select committee looking into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Let us put it down quite clearly at this stage that this debate would not have taken place and the Australian people would not have been alerted to the absolute chaos and shambles of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) which we have seen now for six months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government announced today that it has decided to proceed with its proposal for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The passage of this proposal to this point has been a litany of misjudgments. The statement of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) brings to four his major statements on this proposal. It puts the fourth proposed start-up date, if ever. The very fact that this is now the fourth announcement that we are going to have ATSIC illustrates the level of misjudgment under this Minister in regard to administration of Aboriginal affairs. The legislation was brought into the House on 24 August 1987. It has now been scrutinised by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which put forward 40 recommendations for change. Even though these recommendations were substantial, commentators have commented on the disjunction between the evidence and the majority recommendations. In other words, the majority of Committee members did not allow their minds to follow the logic of the evidence. Factional stability required that the Labor majority of the Committee put aside the weight of evidence. It seems that the significant section of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) which opposes this proposal, as we know very well from discussions around the corridors of this Parliament, has decided that it will leave it to the Opposition to try to stop it. The resolution of the disagreement on this issue will now be far more public and damaging than it would have been within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Minister outlined the Government's response to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee. In looking at the proposal in its latest revision it is easy to lose sight of the genesis of the proposal, which is now 21 months ago. Three days after the last election, I remind honourable members and the Australian public, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced his new super-portfolio proposal. As part of this arrangement he announced that the Commonwealth Aboriginal affairs bodies would be amalgamated under one statutory authority. Why? What were the reasons given? Was it to promote Aboriginal self-management and input into Commonwealth programs? Was this proposal to replace a tired and worn-out bureaucracy, rife with maladministration? No. Was this a proposal to give Aboriginal people a national voice? No. It was none of these. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said on that day that it was so that the Australian people broadly would understand the importance that the Government attached to the obligations that government and the community have in this area. It was to be a symbolic gesture, not a considered piece of reform, as argued by this Minister. It was so that the Government could be seen to be doing something, to tide it over the difficulties of the coming Bicentennial, to smooth the waters, to quell the demonstrations. Sure enough, on 10 December when the Minister came into the House and introduced the document Foundations for the Future he described it as `of great and historic importance for all Australians'. The statement was full of generalisations and empty of detail. The very conception of the idea of ATSIC sprang from the Government's bicentennial guilt trip. </PARA>
<PARA> There were no administrative reviews requiring a change in Aboriginal administration. The Block Efficiency Scrutiny Unit had rejected any suggestion of joint Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) and DAA field services, let alone amalgamation. So the most up-to-date scrutiny report that the Government had in 1987 actually rejected that concept. The first serious airing of the proposal for a statutory commission to replace the Department was within the context of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration during the 1970s. Whilst Coombs recommended against such a commission, a consultant, C. D. Rowley, suggested that the client to department relationship was inappropriate in Aboriginal affairs. Rowley maintained that in the light of the special claims of Aboriginal people the client to department relationship should be replaced by a bargaining relationship between government and the institute representing the Aboriginal pressure groups. Clearly, the Government's basis of action was the ideology of the 1970s rather than the administrative realities of the 1980s. This ethos of special arrangements based on special claims asserts Aborigines to be a different group of Australian citizens. It is an ethos that gives rise to the separatist policies of the Government, to separate out Aboriginal people from the mainstream of Australian life. In contrast, the coalition asserts that, whilst the Aboriginal people have a special status as the first Australians, all Australians should be treated equally. Aboriginal Australians should be assisted on the basis of need and not on the basis of race. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn to several points in regard to what the Minister has said. Firstly, there is no difference between separating out economic and welfare functions, and that will be a disastrous situation. Secondly, the Minister has been forced to improve accountability provisions because of the actions of the coalition. Thirdly, confusion still reigns supreme in the proposal before the Parliament, even though amended. The confusion between the representative and executive functions remains. Fourthly, the coalition's position in regard to the Institute of Aboriginal Studies remaining separate has been accepted by the Government, and we welcome that. Fifthly, the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs has been justified. Sixthly, the House has not been given any assurance that the Minister has the interest to ensure that accountability will occur under any revised structure. Seventhly, the Opposition rejects the Prime Minister's assertion that the fundamental problems were with the ADC. Quite frankly, they were with the whole portfolio, and in the Auditor-General's report there are 60 pages on the DAA as well. So we reject that claim by the Prime Minister, and we reject the claim that the coalition is not interested in Aboriginal people being part of the decision making process. That is clearly false and we reject it. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn my attention to the fundamentals of ATSIC as it proposed. The Minister has come in here today and illustrated to the Parliament and the people of Australia that he is just cutting around the edges of this proposal. He has not changed the main thrust of it. The ATSIC proposal rests on a suspect foundation. Worse, however, it is flawed in its detail. What the Minister submitted today was mere renovation work. The fact is that the key plank of ATSIC is cut from sapwood. As this plank is placed in position and begins to take the weight that inevitably it will, the structure will shrink, warp, and inevitably break. </PARA>
<PARA> A fundamental need in Aboriginal affairs is accountability. When Minister Hand uses the term in relation to ATSIC he refers to two distinct relationships. When he talks to Aboriginal people he talks of accountability in terms of ATSIC giving them control of the bureaucracy through the election of commissioners. When he talks to the wider community he talks of accountability in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of administration of Aboriginal affairs. The coalition believes that under ATSIC both aspects will be worse than they are now. The resolution of this conflict is fundamental to the viability of any administration in Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government really wants to get Aboriginal affairs administration back on the track, there is a great need for a return to a bipartisan approach, one which has been rejected by this Government over the last six or eight years. Government members are the ones who broke bipartisanship. The Government ought to go back to the drawing board with this proposal and search for a bipartisan approach to administration of this vital area. The Minister is silent on this major conflict. The reality is that the conflicting interests within the Commission will ultimately force the ATSIC commissioners to choose their constituency. When a large community in a zone needs funding for a project, it will not take a commissioner long to decide that his or her need for votes is greater than the Government's need for sound financial management. To suggest that decisions will be made otherwise denies the democratic process and is contrary to any government's experience in Aboriginal affairs in the last 25 years. One cannot serve two masters. The commissioners will learn that quickly. It is in this conflict that the seeds of the demise of ATSIC are sown and are clearly evident, even before the legislation has passed this Parliament. ATSIC cannot improve, and has not improved, accountability for Commonwealth funds. Today's amendments will make very little progress in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the second aspect-that is, the Commonwealth Administration's accountability to Aboriginal people-the ATSIC task force struck the bottom line in a letter to Senator Coulter in which it wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme presents a challenge to the leadership of the Aboriginal community to the extent they provide governments with professional objective advice. They will obtain the opportunity to influence the development of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>If, however, the Aboriginal leadership is unable to recognise the reality that no government will abrogate ultimate responsibility for governing and demands the freedom to operate purely as a lobby group inside government, the Commission will be isolated by the bureaucracy and will lose credibility and influence within government. The bottom line is that the Commission may court two masters but, when the crunch comes, it is the Government which regards itself as the real master. Either the Commission cooperates with the Government, to the detriment of Aboriginal opinion, or it will be isolated from the very source of its power. ATSIC cannot improve accountability to the Aboriginal people. As one Australian Labor Party member of parliament is quoted as saying, ATSIC is either a disaster or a fraud. The Commission will be either an administrative disaster, without tight ministerial oversight, or a fraud on the Aboriginal community, if the Minister enforces the legislation to the letter of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> The ATSIC approach of trying to fuse the representative and administrative functions into one organisation will inevitably produce so much unnecessary and destructive friction that the Commission will have little chance of success. Even with separate goals for areas in the portfolio-as we have seen until now, there have been enormous difficulties-what we will see is a confused set of goals for the Commission. We will see even greater difficulty and, I suggest, greater chaos and shambles some time down the track. It is beyond belief that a government could even contemplate putting an experimentally novel administrative structure on the most educationally deprived group in our community-a structure which we would never dream of using ourselves. No compassionate, thoughtful and concerned administrator would do that to the Aboriginal people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition also sees great difficulties in the fusing of representative and administrative functions. This means that the proposal goes beyond providing Aborigines with a consultation mechanism and establishes a black power parliament in this nation. There is no doubt that this fusion will be exploited by the radical, politicised elements in the Aboriginal community to obstruct the benefits that should flow to needy Aborigines. They will also use it to undermine this nation's unity. We have a three-tier parliamentary system representing all systems, all people, all citizens, in this country. We should be encouraging Aboriginal Australians to be involved in the main game, the main political process, rather than a separate political arena. Every encouragement and enthusiasm should be given for them to enter into local, State and Federal government. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, as a political rather than a consultative arrangement, Aboriginal people are forced to engage in a political process to have their needs addressed. This can only distract energy from addressing basic needs. Energy will be put into developing a political base to make sure that they get the resources they need rather than focusing on developing local Aboriginal self-management to address those needs. The coalition considers that this Government's separatist political approach to Aboriginal self-management is flawed. To enable Aborigines to gain greater control over their own lives and families, the fundamental issue is not how they control the Commonwealth Aboriginal Affairs bureaucracy: the issue is how they can become independent of it. The prime focus of any reorganisation should be on how the Commonwealth can facilitate more Aboriginal families to be independent of government handouts. The best hope for this is by addressing employment needs so that families can stand alone. That should be the goal. To facilitate that goal, education, health and housing must be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The determination of the Prime Minister to establish a single statutory authority responsible for all aspects of Aboriginal affairs did not mean that the new Commission would deal with all aspects of Aboriginal affairs. The bureaucratic empires of other departments were not proposed for takeover. I illustrate the fact that almost $200m involved in employment, education and training areas is not mentioned in regard to this reorganisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To be precise, $198m. There is no comment in the statement about a State grants program for Aboriginal housing or an Aboriginal arts board. No attempt has been made to explain why ATSIC is not responsible for those areas any more than an explanation as to why one large bureaucratic structure was needed to take over all the elements of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. We have a number of other concerns which we will address in detail as the legislation comes before the House. Some of those concerns are still the electoral system; the regional boundaries as they are presently designed; the definition of `Aboriginal'; and the use of electoral rolls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's Aboriginal affairs policy has failed miserably. Its policy of symbolism, separatism and perpetual guilt is totally outmoded, out of date and inappropriate for Aboriginal people. The coalition believes in addressing the basic needs instead of symbolism, of having a one people and a one nation approach as distinct from a separatist approach. We reject the concept of the perpetual guilt mentality that the Government shows continually in debates in this House. In 1980 we acknowledged, as a coalition, Aboriginal dispossession and dispersal and now it is time to get on and address those basic, fundamental, difficult areas in Aboriginal affairs-that is, health, housing, education and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great scandals of government administration is the fact that the money earmarked for Aboriginal advancement does not get through the bureaucracy to the people in need. In the last six years the money allocated has been equivalent to over $100,000 for a family of six. The tragic reality is that that money never reached the grass roots. It is this Government's administration that is culpable in that regard. There was the Bonner review and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's inquiry into the situation at Toomelah in northern New South Wales. Both those inquiries addressed the problem of local, Federal and State governments and the gap that existed in the passing of the buck. ATSIC does not address anything in regard to the three tiers of government. So the problems which have been highlighted will still exist. The Bonner report indicated that the communities were serviced by over 40 government agencies. ATSIC will reduce that number to 39. That is the reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, `Big deal!'. There is no mandate for this Government to put ATSIC in place. I just want to return to the issue of an Aboriginal mandate. In Foundations for the Future the Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The effective implementation of ATSIC ultimately rests on receiving a positive endorsement from the Aboriginal and Islander community of Australia. The consultation process fell well short of endorsing anything other than a general proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition believes that, if the Government stands by this statement, it should put the proposal to a plebiscite within the Aboriginal community to test the waters, to see whether the Aboriginal Australians believe that this structure is a good one. The Government should put a provision in the Bill so that it will be proclaimed only when it receives the endorsement of the Aboriginal and Islander community by plebiscite. Without such an endorsement the Government cannot claim a mandate. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the proposal for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission still has not been justified by this Government. It is unnecessary and I suggest to this Parliament and to the Australian people that it is culturally inappropriate. The amended proposal that has emerged is still faulty and I regard it as unsafe. If pursued, it will operate to the detriment of the very people it is allegedly designed to serve. It is likely to lead to worse outcomes than those of the bodies it is to replace, to worse services for Aboriginal and Islander people, to less accountability of the Commission and its servants to the Aboriginal and Islander people, and to less accountability to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As yet the Government has not made any convincing case justifying the radical changes involved in this proposal. The problems of Aboriginal people are too complex and the links with all aspects of government too diverse for this experiment to have much chance of success. The coalition believes that the amended ATSIC proposal should be withdrawn and the whole concept it represents reconsidered. I hope that the Government will not guillotine the debate in the Senate; that it will allow a sensitive, thoughtful debate about this important issue; and that it will allow the senators time to give detailed consideration to this massive rearrangement which we are opposed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am somewhat amazed by the contributions of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). I think they have both presented a tiresome performance. They have demonstrated yet again in this place a lack of credibility, a lack of moral fibre and a lack of preparedness to listen to Aboriginal and Islander Australians. I thought that the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition was particularly pathetic. It was epitomised by a tirade against any concept of self-management by Aboriginal and Islander Australians, it contained empty rhetoric and it made a number of false accusations about the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) misleading this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, the Leader of the Opposition had the temerity to praise the work and the contributions of the infamous and, dare I say, despicable senator for the Northern Territory, Grant Tambling. I use those words because I mean them. He is the person who is responsible for creating division in the Northern Territory community in particular and also for fostering division within the Australian community by undermining the confidence of the general community in Aboriginal people throughout Australia by his attacks on Aboriginal Australians and by promoting the concept of a black mafia. He said that he has consulted with Aboriginal people and that he reflects their views. Let me tell honourable members that nothing could be further from the truth. I mix fairly widely with my constituents in the Northern Territory and with Aboriginal and Islander people throughout Australia. Not once have I heard one word in support of the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-the honourable member for Braddon-or that nitwit senator from the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy Speaker, in deference to your ruling, I withdraw, but I maintain my view about the senator for the Northern Territory. As a vindication of my view, I will just quote a statement attributed to him in the Centralian Advocate of 3 March 1989. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . Senator Grant Tambling has hit back at accusations he did not consult Aborigines about the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Combined Aboriginal organisations in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and the Northern Land Council last week called for Senator Tambling to resign because of his opposition to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA>What did Senator Tambling say? In true faith with his statements about a black mafia he said that he rejected the claims and labelled them `wild accusations by radical groups'. Who were these radical groups? Among them were the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, an Aboriginal health organisation whose work has been praised not only by this Government but also by the Opposition and the Northern Territory Government; the Institute for Aboriginal Development, an educational institution in Alice Springs; and Tangentyere Council, a town camp resource agency in Alice Springs. The work of the Tangentyere Council has also been praised by this Government, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and by the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet these groups are victimised as being radical groups and it has been said that what they say is not representative of Aboriginal views. Let me inform members of the Opposition and the House that they represent Aboriginal opinion, unlike Senator Tambling, unlike the Leader of the Opposition and unlike the shady person from Braddon, who is afraid to venture through the doorways of these Aboriginal organisations as he knows what will happen to him. He knows that his views are not the views of Aboriginal people and he knows that the views that he expresses are those of a minority group within the Australian community. Yet he has the temerity to walk into this House and make accusations about the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that have no foundation in fact and are entirely fictional and he supports the statements that have been made in a disgraceful manner in the Senate and other places about people working in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) or Aboriginal organisations throughout Australia. They have been victimised, vilified and attacked by members of the Opposition, who have done it in a very thoughtful way. Their purpose has been to divide the Australian community, as has been said here today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Braddon, saying that we should return to bipartisanship. When this Government was elected we made that plea for bipartisanship. We have had three debates in this House around the concept of bipartisanship. Not once have honourable members opposite taken up the cudgels of that debate and accepted that approach. They have sought division; that has been their purpose. They have not tried to reconcile the differences which we may have on these issues. I repeat that not once has the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, or any other member of the Opposition come up with any constructive suggestions about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) despite the numerous invitations by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He made those invitations as early as December 1987, yet not once have members of the Opposition approached his office with any valid suggestions either about the administration of Aboriginal affairs generally or, in this particular case, about the ATSIC legislation. Yet they come in here and purport to represent a view which they say has some credibility; it has no credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal affairs is in a state of siege because of the complete disregard for any concept of justice, equality or fairness by the Opposition. Members of the Opposition have conducted a witch-hunt which has clear objectives. Those objectives have been to undermine the public confidence and the ability of Aboriginal people to manage their own affairs. That has been their purpose. They do not resile from it because they are saying it. It is part of an ideologically and politically motivated attack to divide the Australian community. They have refused to work in a constructive and meaningful way with the Minister and this Government. They feign support for concepts of self-management and self-determination, but the coalition's wariness of the term `self-determination' or `self-management' is not just a question of semantics. Members of the Opposition do not support it and they have said as much here today. What they want is a mainstream of all activities in the areas of Aboriginal and Islander affairs. Members of the coalition are not prepared to accept that Aboriginal and Islander people may have different expectations, quite legitimate demands, for the recognition of their rights and honourable members opposite will not recognise them. Instead they want to impose their will upon them as they have done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition agenda has clearly as its basis the removal of any special recognition of Aboriginal rights. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs have said as much today in this House. No longer are they talking about self-management; no longer are they looking at self-determination; and no longer are they prepared to look at the special rights and needs of Aboriginal and Islander Australians. They have thrown that out the window despite being committed to it from as far back as 1973. The agenda they have set is to moderate the behaviour of Aboriginal people to accord with what the coalition believes to be appropriate-not what Aboriginal and Islander people may believe is appropriate or significant, but what the coalition believes is appropriate. This Government has taken a different approach. This Government has said, `We will go to Aboriginal and Islander people and see what they think is most appropriate. We will provide them with the mechanisms to establish the priorities of Aboriginal and Islander affairs in this country', unlike members of the Opposition, who have taken the approach that they will not wear that. What they have said is that they will oppose that at every turn and they have demonstrated that they will do that both here and in the Senate. They oppose any agenda which includes the possibility of a settlement and any sort of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians through any treaty or compact. It was rejected here again today by the Leader of the Opposition. Members of the Opposition oppose land rights. They have an agenda which is principally aimed at denying Aboriginal and Islander people the right to develop their own structures, mechanisms and organisations to represent their interests. As I have said, their idea is to stop them from setting their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate has been about ATSIC. Innuendo and allegations have been made purposely by the Opposition. It has undermined the support for the Aboriginal and Islander people in our community. I would like to read some comments made by a very venerable Australian, Dr Nugget Coombs, in the Age. He was making some observations about the attacks which have been perpetrated by the Opposition principally, I might say in the first instance, through the Senate estimates committee structure. He refers to personal attacks which have been made on Aboriginal and Islander people. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . all these lent plausibility to the view that the real agenda of the debate, an agenda shared . . . was not to design an effective political instrument for black-white relationships but to prevent any significant transfer of power to Aborigines. Gerry Hand must go, not because he was doing a bad job, but because the process he had set in train might result in such a transfer. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the agenda. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the debate has left a public image of Aboriginal Affairs as a vast area of failure-not merely within the agencies of the minister's portfolio, but throughout those of Aboriginal communities and their organisations. This image, I believe, is profoundly false. </PARA>
<PARA>No-one with any more authority in Australian public administration could make such a statement, but members on the Opposition benches take no note of it. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> True, there are evidences of policy mistakes, administrative incompetence and individual corruption, as there also are in all areas of white Australian affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>We need not comment any further about that. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the overall picture in Aboriginal society is one of increasing effectiveness and a record of success at individual, group and national level, which amounts, I believe, to a renaissance. </PARA>
<PARA>What do members of the Opposition want to do with a renaissance? They want to put it in the back cupboard and forget about it. Dr Coombs continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In all areas where the outcome depends on individual or collective Aboriginal competence and creativity, example of achievement can be added to example. Those who, for whatever motive, choose to see or present Aboriginal Australians as inevitably heading for failure and despair can think again. </PARA>
<PARA>The message is: think again. Aboriginal people are not headed for despair or failure; they will take up the challenge which this Government has put before them and they will do it well. Members of the Opposition were not prepared to give them the credibility to be able to make that effort: instead they want to white-ant the Aboriginal people at the post. As Dr Coombs said, what needs to be recognised in terms of the debate about the reports which have been put down in the Parliament is that they were reports about:</PARA>
<PARA> Organisations we-that is non-Aboriginal and Islander Australians-created, embodying our concepts, offering such opportunities and imposing such constraints as we think wise in our interests. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the message. The message of the members of the Opposition is that they will only allow Aboriginal people to do what they think is in their interests and not in the Aboriginal people's interests. The attacks which they have made on Aboriginal people, and particularly on the present commissioners of the ADC, are scurrilous because they pay no account to the efforts of the Aboriginal people and other people who have been working with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to try to correct the maladministration that may have occurred in the past-maladministration which, if there is any evidence of it, occurred not when this man was Minister. Most of the material which has arisen in these reports came from a period prior to when this man was Minister, from periods way back when the coalition was on the government benches. But members of the Opposition pay no account whatsoever to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to illustrate what the Opposition agenda is really all about, I will briefly quote from a statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), who is reported to have said in an address to a Port Macquarie rally in July 1984 that `Aboriginal affinity with the land was not much different to the affinity he had with his own property'. That epitomises the sort of attitude the Opposition has. What did John Elliott say? He said in November 1988 at a Liberal Party meeting in Perth that he was against handing over land to Aborigines. He said that the handing over of Ayers Rock to the local Aboriginal population was a national disgrace. There we go. That is the sort of attitude that members of the Opposition have. Yet the shadow Minister, led by the Leader of the Opposition, comes into this place and condemns this Minister and this Government for taking an approach to Aboriginal affairs which will dramatically alter the balance of relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal and Islander Australians. It is quite a deliberate exercise to transfer power back to Aboriginal and Islander Australians, to give them the responsibility for making decisions, to give them the ability to manage their own affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard this afternoon two or three speeches from Government members which have said very little. In fact, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) were to speak, I guess members on this side of the House and the Australian people were expecting something a little special to be said. The Prime Minister and the Minister have promised virtually everything but delivered nothing, as they have done in the area of Aboriginal policy in the last six years. There was nothing new in what they said, with the exception that they will go ahead with the disastrous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation, which nobody, except a few Government members, seems to want. I find that quite remarkable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of Aboriginal affairs in the last six years is a history of chaos, maladministration and embarrassment to taxpayers and Aboriginal people. Little more has been achieved than the discrediting of the Aboriginal community in its own eyes and in the eyes of the public. To a large extent Aboriginal people's hopes have been dashed, and it appears from the statements by the Minister and the Prime Minister that their hopes will continue to be dashed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has acted in a quite cynical and blatant manner in regard to Aboriginal affairs. He tries to use the Aboriginal community in an attempt to win votes. We see him on Sunday night television programs. He flies into some distant Aboriginal community and swans around, exuberating in an affected concern for Aboriginal people. He ends up making a lot of ridiculous promises such as treaties, et cetera, and raises unreal expectations amongst Aboriginal people. Then he flies out, leaving the Minister to pick up the pieces. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister usually leaves behind him more chaos, and more dashed hopes than when he arrived. It is a cruel and ruthless exercise to have been perpetrated in the last few years. It is not washing with the Aboriginal people at all. They are seeing through this insincerity. The way the Prime Minister is acting in this regard is becoming a bit of a joke amongst the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While all this is going on we have continual reports in the press of money being wasted on poker machines or training racehorses or not being spent on projects that it was supposed to be spent on, of hotels going broke, and so on. I ask the Government: What is the result of all this? At the end of it the average Australian, the average Aborigine, can see only waste, corruption and desperation. We are seeing these things in a magnitude that has never been seen before. I acknowledge that there have always been problems in this area, but they seem to have been getting quite a deal worse over the last five or six years. Any number of reports have been prepared concerning this area. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latest report, the Auditor-General's report, verifies that the problems have been worsening. Paragraph after paragraph tells of waste and mismanagement. When the Minister, who is so vocal in the chamber at the moment, is asked about this in Question Time his answer is: `I am aware of the problem. It has existed for a long time. We are looking into it. We are doing the best we can. We are consulting the Aboriginal people'. I suppose that in one sense that is a fair enough answer, but it seems to be the answer we are getting to every question we ask. The Australian people are getting a bit tired of it. They expect a little more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a background of chaos, of shambles, of multiple investigations. Instead of straightening out the problem or doing something towards solving it, the Minister is giving us the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. ATSIC will only exacerbate the situation. It will cost a lot of money. It will divide the Aboriginal community, as it is already doing. It will certainly divide the Australian community. The amazing thing is that the Aboriginals themselves do not want ATSIC. If the Minister is so confident that he has consulted the Aborigines sufficiently and that the Aborigines want ATSIC, I invite him, as did the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), to hold a poll, a referendum, to see what the Aboriginal people really want. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, the Prime Minister and the Minister got up today and reaffirmed that the Government will go ahead with ATSIC, come what may. I find that amazing, particularly in light of inquiries such as the Senate one, which found an enormous number of deficiencies in the original Bill. In fact, I would go so far as to say that most Government members see this legislation as a noose hovering over their heads, about to be slipped around their necks before the election. Most of them, from what I hear, would love to be rid of it. They would like to see the last of ATSIC. They would like to see it go away, disappear. Instead, I repeat, the Prime Minister got up today and told us nothing new at all, except that he was going to maintain his support of the Minister and the left wing who, for some reason, so desperately want to see this legislation implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the Minister's speech itself? He revealed nothing more than a blind ideological obsession, a blind left wing commitment to this socialist Taj Mahal, the ATSIC legislation. He said that, come what may, the Government will go ahead with it. It will set up a system of regional councils. It will set up a commission replacing the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It will appoint the commissioners. In other words, as the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs said, the Government will set up a type of black parliament in Australia as soon as it can. I find it absolutely incredible. </PARA>

We look forward to seeing the next lot of legislation. If it is anything like the last, it will be blocked, too. I can assure the Minister of that. Aboriginals themselves do not want it. It will do nothing more nor less than divide Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister ran around earlier this year consulting various groups. I am told that he handed out in excess of $800,000 in goodies, four-wheel drive vehicles and goodness knows what, trying to get some approval for ATSIC. For most of the areas he went to he had no maps. Aborigines are complaining that there was no detail, that at best they got only a general concept of what was going on. I acknowledge to the Minister that there are problems in explaining something as complex as this to Aboriginal people, but apparently the Minister's attempt was very much a half-hearted one. </PARA>

The letter, written to the Minister by a member of the Anmatjara tribe of Central Australia, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard about this new proposal for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner. We went to see Mr Hand and Yuendumu but he was gone. He only stay a short time. That no good. He should stay longer and listen to each group and not just visit big communities. </PARA>

<PARA> Other mobs we talk to are not happy with ATSIC either. All over Napperby, Alyawarra, Utopia outstations, we don't like to mix everyone up in one big council. </PARA>
<PARA> We got map today from D.A.A. The map shows all those ATSIC regions in different colours. </PARA>
<PARA> Well now we got to tell you, we are not happy about ATSIC and we are not happy about that map. That map is wrong. You can't split our country up. You can't put us with all those other people from different country. That mob from south haven't got skin groups like us. You can't put us with them. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not happy with ATSIC and we don't want it. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to talk more about this with our own people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is splitting Australia, as the honourable member for Cowper says. Nobody wants the ATSIC legislation-Australians do not want it; the Aboriginals do not want it. The Government is too terrified to have a poll. I find that extraordinary. I believe it is patronising to Aborigines for the Government to do this to them. The legislation will not work because it is not the Aboriginal way of doing things. The Government does not seem to be able to grasp this simple point. The Minister has set himself up as someone who is going to tell the Aboriginal community what he thinks is best for it and it is going to cop it or else; that is all there is to it. The amount of consultation with the Aboriginal people will be minuscule indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen other things which have gone on in relation to the Government's trying to get this piece of legislation implemented. For example, when the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) commissioners protested about ATSIC, saying they wanted further time to consider it, and finally would not accept it, what happened? The entire board of the ADC was sacked. Then we saw the amazing event of the Government trying to smear the board with a fictitious story of financial mismanagement, which was leaked to one of the major newspapers in the country. That act, quite frankly, was disgraceful and I was sorry to see that the Government had to resort to that action to try to get acceptance for this legislation which nobody wants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has ignored the problem. He is ignoring the concern in the community about various aspects of this legislation, but he is still telling us that it will go ahead. Regardless of what one looks at in the legislation, nobody seems to agree with it. For example, there is a section relating to voting. In his speech today, the Minister said that there would be voluntary enrolment for regional council elections-voluntary enrolment-but compulsory voting for those who did enrol. Anybody who knows anything about the history of Aboriginal organisations in Australia knows immediately that that is a prescription for absolute disaster. It will allow coercion immediately. </PARA>

<PARA>We are going to have an election in this country based on race, based on the colour of a person's skin. Yet these people are not going to have a roll based on race.

<PARA> There is so much which is objectionable, but unfortunately there is so little detail in the Bill. It tells one nothing; it simply states that the Government will go ahead with the legislation and will have this shonky voting system. Wherever there is a scintilla of detail, the coalition finds itself in total objection to it. We find the whole proposal quite objectionable. There has been nothing new offered today which will change the Opposition decision to oppose the original legislation that came before the Parliament.

<PARA> One finds it a little disheartening, to say the least, that after 16 months not one positive contribution has been made by those sitting opposite. It is at least refreshing to hear the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Minister today relating to the administration of Aboriginal affairs and ATSIC. I believe the statements were timely. It is important that these issues be resolved, not solely to allow the passage of the legislation through Parliament, but also, very importantly, to place clearly on the record this Government's attitude to the administration of Aboriginal affairs; a position which is clear, unequivocal and in stark contrast to the attitude and policies of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week, during a debate on a matter of public importance, a considerable number of these issues was canvassed. I do not intend to go over those issues. On that occasion, I appealed to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to indicate his Party's policies to the Aboriginal people of our nation and, more importantly, to rein in some of the more irresponsible members of the Opposition in their attitudes and comments in relation to Aboriginal matters generally. That is a step that has to be taken urgently by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad history of the discussions and debate on Aboriginal matters since the Hawke Government came to office reflects adversely the attitude of the Opposition. As I have said previously, we have had no positive input from those opposite over a long period. The sole approach-I repeat, their sole approach-has been one of disruption, diversion and blind opposition to any suggestion of change; change which we, on this side of the House, believe will be in the best interests of the Aboriginal people of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a sad reflection that history will record that those opposite have opposed any issue of change in Aboriginal matters, but on no occasion have we heard any proffering of alternatives from the Opposition. It will go down as a sad chapter in the history of the Australian nation that those opposite have engaged in total and abstract opposition to any matters raised in relation to Aboriginal issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In December of 1987, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs made a significant statement in this place relating to Aboriginal issues. In prefacing his summary, he made observations that should be known to most Australians, but unfortunately, they are not. He spoke of a period of more than 40,000 years during which the Aboriginal and Islander people had considered themselves the custodians of this land. He spoke of the maintenance of their pride, dignity and integrity, despite the impact of European settlement just some 200 years ago, and the subsequent dispossession of their land by European settlers, an impact which is still being felt by Aboriginal and Islander people. On that occasion the Minister also made reference to the fact that only 20 years ago the Australian people voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to give the Commonwealth the power to make laws affecting the lives of those Aboriginal and Islander people. It was on this premise that the Government acknowledged that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were prior occupiers and the original owners of this land, something that was acknowledged in a resolution passed in this House-once again, not on a bipartisan basis-on 23 August 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolution that acknowledged the prior occupation by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders thousands of years before British settlement at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788 also acknowledged that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders suffered dispossession and dispersal of their traditional lands by the British Crown. In doing so, the Government affirmed the importance of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' culture and heritage and, importantly, the entitlement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to self-management and self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> On the occasion of speaking on the resolution the Prime Minister made reference to the many programs of assistance to Aboriginal and Islander people decided upon by governments without informed involvement by the people they were designed to assist. This fundamental flaw in Aboriginal administration is to be removed. I believe that the introduction of the ATSIC legislation will achieve that goal. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of those opposite in relation to the ATSIC legislation has been one of diversion and disruption. There has been a total lack of understanding, whether deliberate or not, in relation to those matters. Unfortunately, those opposite have not in a spirit of bipartisanship put up any positive alternatives. We have had the sorry state of members of the Opposition parading around the nation misrepresenting to Aboriginal people and communities the thrust and purpose of the ATSIC legislation. None of the public statements by those irresponsible members-I do not class everyone opposite in that category-have been revoked, unfortunately, or disclaimed by the Leader of the Opposition or his shadow spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). In those circumstances we must then accept that the Leader of the Opposition embraces the comments of those such as Senator Sheil-I will not go into the nasty detail of what he has said over a period-Senator Boswell in his untruthful utterances throughout the State of Queensland, and Senator Stone; the list goes on. It includes members of the Liberal Party, such as the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). It is no wonder that the Aboriginal people of this nation have become disheartened and are now disillusioned with the approach to issues affecting them taken by members of this Parliament. That disheartenment and disillusionment could only be expected in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> In August of last year Senator Sheil spoke of `black bludgers and stirrers looting the nation'. He is on the record as having said it. As I have said previously, neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the shadow spokesman on Aboriginal affairs has denied or refuted that. So what are we to believe? Does the Leader of the Opposition allow irresponsible members of his back bench to go about this country dividing the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people of this nation? Why does he not act? One can only assume that he accepts the statements made by those whom I described as irresponsible members of his back bench. It is unfortunate that Senator Sheil has a long and disgraceful record with respect to making racial remarks, but his more recent outbursts have gone unchecked. It is a shame that action such as that taken by the former Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, was not taken when these outrageous outbursts became public. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost a year and a half ago the ATSIC legislation was foreshadowed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Notwithstanding that period of time, the legislation has not passed the Parliament, even though consultation never before contemplated in relation to an Act of parliament has taken place between the Government and the Aboriginal people of this nation. It is interesting to note that the response to the legislation by Aboriginal people has generally been positive. I do not accept the assertions of those opposite that the Aboriginal people generally are opposed to the ATSIC legislation. I have travelled far and wide through Queensland and the Northern Territory-indeed, throughout this nation-and if one thing is certain in my mind it is that in general the Aboriginal people of this nation accept in principle the ATSIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> To be a little more precise, when bodies such as the Aboriginal Coordinating Council, which represents all Aboriginal communities in Queensland, and the Torres Strait Island Coordinating Council, which represents all the islander communities in Queensland, support the legislation strongly and strenuously, I have some difficulty in accepting the assertion of those opposite that it is not accepted within the Aboriginal community. There is a feeling within Aboriginal communities of frustration and despair. The blame for such frustration and despair lies squarely at the doors of the Leader of the Opposition and his spokesman on Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have done in the past, I repeat my appeal to the Leader of the Opposition to take a bipartisan approach to Aboriginal issues so that the government of the day, whatever its political persuasion, can get on with the important role of introducing the legislation and measures which will benefit that underprivileged sector of our community. To continue the negative approach of the Opposition will only delay the flow of those benefits to the Aboriginal people, not just in the area of administration but also, more importantly, in the areas of health, education, employment and other basics that normally others in our community take for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs have already spoken of the Government report on the findings of the Auditor-General in his report on the Aboriginal Development Commission and Department. Already the Government has acted and will continue to act to overcome the deficiencies highlighted in the report. In a determined approach to overcome these deficiencies, no good or proper purpose will be served by those opposite, particularly the shadow spokesman, coming into this place day after day criticising and deriding by inference the Aboriginal people and their organisations in their endeavours towards self-management and self-determination. I conclude on a sad note. Being mindful of the approaching election, I have no doubt that these attacks by the Opposition on the Aboriginal people and their organisations will continue. I have no doubt that in those criticisms and public denouncements of those opposite we will not hear any positive alternatives or utterances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I rise to take part in the debate on the ministerial statements on the administration of Aboriginal affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission presented by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) respectively, I put on record the fact that, whilst I may be very critical of the Minister and some areas of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs I could say some positive things about many areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to comment on a couple of remarks made by the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) when he mentioned Senator Sheil. He talked about Senator Sheil's disparaging description of some Aboriginals as `black bludgers' and so on. If he really understood Senator Sheil's true thinking and looked at his outlook on the Australian population as a whole, he would realise that Senator Sheil says the same things about white bludgers, perhaps in even stronger terms. The honourable member is putting a slant on Senator Sheil's remarks which is undeserved. </PARA>
<PARA> The central problems before the House today concern the political and managerial incompetence of the Hawke Government in Aboriginal affairs and the impact and consequences of that incompetence on the Department, on the Aboriginal community and on parliamentary and ministerial practice. Let us be quite clear about the fourfold consequences. First, there is the corruption and demoralisation of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. That is a fact. Secondly, there is the alienation of large sections of the Aboriginal community. Thirdly, there is the discrediting of the difficult long term work of Aboriginal development in the eyes of the taxpayers of Australia and in the eyes of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. Fourthly, there is the contemptuous discarding of traditional practices of ministerial accountability in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to take issue with specific sections of the statements of both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs before I make general comments on this unfortunate and harmful course of events in the area of Aboriginal affairs. My first point concerns paragraph 2 on page 3 of the Prime Minister's statement. This ingenious paragraph is designed to suggest an acceptance of responsibility for the mismanagement of policy, administration, funding and accountability which has clearly occurred, whereas in actual fact the opposite is the case. The Prime Minister accepts the responsibility for future unspecified change, but not for the crisis which has produced the need for change. To do so, of course, would involve the honourable resignation of the Minister. For all the lip service paid by this Government to the Parliament and to accountability, its commitment to and respect for ministerial responsibility stops short of actually resigning when that is obviously appropriate. The Prime Minister's stance reflects that of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout this issue, over the last six months, the Minister has adopted the political approach of implying that he is as angry and determined to turn things around as are the coalition and the Aboriginal victims of mismanagement. The broader community is also certainly desirous of doing that. That approach has involved the implicit acknow- ledgement that this mess was caused by his predecessor, Minister Holding. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us be clear about this Minister's direct responsibility. Yes, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was brought down in chaos under his predecessor and most of the problems in maladministration predate his appointment in July 1987. The point is that the present Minister was fully aware of the problems, but was either unable or unwilling to tackle them. The facts are that the Minister was active in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs for four years prior to ministerial appointment. He was aware of the call in a report in 1985 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure for a judicial inquiry into the Aboriginal Development Corporation (ADC) and apparent malpractice and illegality within the portfolio. In July 1987, when he took up his Ministry, the respected Aboriginal leader, Margaret Valadian, was publicly complaining that her organisation's focus on the need for professional performance and the need for accountability in Aboriginal Affairs was anathema to his Department. He was aware of the problems in July 1987. He has been the Minister for 18 months. He cannot honestly ask us to believe that he is not responsible for the situation in the portfolio in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to page 9, paragraph 6, of the Prime Minister's statement. The Prime Minister prides himself on the `extraordinary detailed scrutiny' and `wealth of material and analysis' produced by special inquiries over a `relatively short time frame'. The question is this: Why did this Minister not produce this detailed analysis in the same time frame when he became Minister nearly two years ago? That he did not is sufficient grounds for his removal. I simply remind the House that illegal activity, and policy described by an external audit as `out of date, irrelevant, unmeasurable, and unrealistic', characterise this Minister's portfolio, notwithstanding his long-standing familiarity with the portfolio and nearly two years as Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to those paragraphs on pages 4 and 5 of the Prime Minister's statement where he wants this place to believe that the problems in Aboriginal affairs are inherent in the balancing of self-management and ministerial accountability. I also refer to page 24, paragraph 2, of Minister Hand's statement where he claims that the coalition cannot accept that the Aboriginal people must be part of Government processes, be decision-makers and determine their interests and needs. The coalition would be happy to compare the commitment to, and the success in winning, community support for Aboriginal self-management and self-determination of Ministers Peter Baume and Chaney with that of Ministers Holding and Hand. The comparisons would be more than embarrassing for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's record speaks for itself in terms of the achievements of the Fraser Government on land rights, economic development and self-determination. As to accountability and self-management, contrary to the Prime Minister's belief, the two are compatible. The coalition does not share the paternalism and inverse racism of the Government concerning goals set for and by Aborigines in their communities or in the portfolio bureaucracy. We treat Aborigines equally. We assume competence; we expect accountability. I simply refer again to Margaret Valadian, who said in July 1987 as Minister Hand took office:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there is a widely held view that as Aborigines we should be above accountability, but this is an insult to our intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition understands that there will be mistakes and losses in Aboriginal development. That the Prime Minister can quote Senator Chaney, when he was Minister, on the element of risk is a refutation of Minister Hand's dishonest description of motive and stance on this side. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the attempt by the Prime Minister and the Minister to blame the coalition for a politicisation of this issue. The question is: who is responsible for this damaging political exercise? Is it the Opposition, which is duty bound to raise publicly questions concerning abuse of public office and taxpayers' funds and to raise the question of opportunity costs for Aboriginal communities? Or is it the Government, whose incompetence produced the situation and whose refusal to acknowledge the problem and attempts to cover up and to kill the issue have forced the matter to be raised publicly in this manner?</PARA>
<PARA> My final comments have to do with the Minister's announcement today that he will press ahead with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Part of the problem in Aboriginal affairs over the last two years has been this Minister's total preoccupation with his political model of modernisation of the Aboriginal people, his `top-down' revolution designed to create the Aboriginal people. It is an attempt to impose a model of political development designed by one faction of the developing intellectual elite within Aboriginal communities with the political support of the Minister. It deludes its authors who cannot see that fine constitutions and political rhetoric are not the substitute for action to lift life standards and opportunities for Aboriginal communities oppressed by poverty, racism and powerlessness. It is a centralist's fantasy. It will not work. It might damage Aboriginal development by giving politics pride of place instead of equal place with training, education and development on the agenda of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say to the Minister that he ought to think hard again about this whole issue. Bipartisanship could be restored and the damage to Aboriginal affairs repaired if he would give up the theatre of treaty and political modelling and discuss long term strategies for Aboriginal development with the coalition and the community, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition raises this matter of very great public importance in the context of a statement to be made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) tomorrow night on the economic management of this country. I do not think there is any doubt that tomorrow night will be a tragedy as we see this Government basically sell Australia down the economic drain. Tomorrow night's statement will be a blatant political ploy to buy some votes, at the sacrifice of the economy of this country, simply to save the political necks of Government members. That is the harsh reality. I say to honourable members opposite that they will rue the day that the Treasurer brings down this statement. As we look at the conduct of parliamentary business this week we note that the Treasurer has a very simple strategy. It is a strategy that I am sure honourable members opposite can well understand-a strategy to divert attention from the calamity of the Treasurer's Budget strategy for 1988-89. His wages policy is in tatters and I think most people in this Parliament well understand that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take as a case study of the sensitivity of the Treasurer to the collapse of his wages policy the finale of the award restructuring package presented by Mr Kelty, which was the negotiations on supplementary payments. What has happened on supplementary payments is a case study of the way in which this Government is dictated to by the trade union movement in the running of economic policy. Yesterday in this House we saw an element of sensitivity on the part of the Treasurer about his conduct of policy, a sensitivity which finds its origins in the debate between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) over supplementary payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Some press reports a week or so ago suggested that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris), who is at the table, had some problems about supplementary payments. For the benefit of those not close to the action let me say that supplementary payments for Mr Kelty are the piece de resistance of his wages policy. Mr Kelty is a shrewd customer when it comes to the political scene and one thing that he understands is that politically this Government is going down the gurgler. The last thing that he wants to be associated with is a government that is on its way out. So he has a twofold strategy, and part of that strategy is to shore up his own position. We have seen the exit of the gentrified Mr Crean and heard the ACTU talking about running a public relations campaign to improve its image. We have seen Mr Kelty appeasing the Left and Mr Campbell with the across the board components of award restructuring and we have seen Mr Martin Ferguson, who is much more acceptable to the rank and file, being elevated to the top spot in the trade union movement. So supplementary payments and the proposal which contains them-in other words, across the board wage increases-are very important to Mr Kelty's long term future and, as he sees it, the authority of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelty's position on wages policy since the ACTU Executive accepted his propositions at the end of 1988 is that the unions want the lot. There is no halfway house; there is no compromise. In the words of Mr Ferguson, the incoming President, it is pay-back time for the trade union movement. The Minister for Industrial Relations knows, as most commentators know, that supplementary payments, rather than being good news for the low paid, are bad news for them. Supplementary payments are given across the board, regardless of the capacity, the productivity, of enterprises to fund those increases. Have we not seen that in this country before? It is the dog chasing its tail. This is just another round of inflation, more tax increases, bracket increases and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the departmental advice that the Minister for Industrial Relations had, and he started to voice that opinion. But interestingly enough, Mr Kelty, in his attack on the Government through the Australian Financial Review, declared the Minister to be incompetent and put the pressure on the Treasurer to come in and save the Kelty deal. I think the Treasurer is peeved because he has had his own Minister for Industrial Relations promoting the position that the Opposition has been putting on supplementary payments, which we oppose. The Minister has had to put that position to the Treasurer, who has known that the Minister was right, as he has known that the departmental advice from a number of senior people in their opposition to supplementary payments was right. But when it came to the crunch, the Treasurer had no choice as he saw it but to capitulate to the ACTU, so he delivered what Mr Kelty required of him. That, quite frankly, is the same for each and every component of award restructuring and the debate that has been going on in recent months. Mr Kelty made clear what he wanted and he has been busily getting it. He has got the lot and that is what honourable members will see tomorrow night-a final, total humiliation for the Treasurer in the conduct of wages policy. We will have, as we now have in this country, the twin evils. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer claims that he is running a good wages policy. Let me compare his wages policy with those of other members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Treasurer is running the worst wages policy in the OECD. Unit labour costs in Australia in 1988 were higher than those in any other member country of the OECD. The rate of inflation in this country is near the top of the tree. This country has the worst of both possible worlds, and it is this Government's wages policy that has brought the country to this very sorry plight. Underpinning all this is what I call Labour's yawning productivity gap. If one looks at productivity figures and compares how Australians are working and how efficiently they are producing with how people in other OECD countries are working and producing, one sees that this nation is going backwards. The productivity figures supplied by the OECD show Australia's position at minus 0.2 per cent. It is no wonder that living standards in this country are falling when productivity is falling. Let us look in comparison at our international competitors. Not only are they in the black, with positive rates of growth in productivity, but they are actually on the move upwards. They have a growth factor. So we have Labor's yawning productivity gap. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow night we will hear a statement which will confirm the Government's capitulation to the ACTU, the total humiliation of the Treasurer and a recipe for further inflation and further erosion of international competitiveness. This country will have a short term boost to domestic demand, which is totally irresponsible in the current economic climate. It will have tax cuts unfunded by spending cuts and wage rises across the board unrelated to productivity. I do not think there is much doubt now that almost certainly this will lead to recessionary circumstances. The people most vulnerable to this downturn are those for whom the Treasurer and the Secretary of the ACTU cry crocodile tears in their promotion of supplementary payments. It is not just the Opposition which has this feeling of foreboding about the statement. I draw honourable members' attention to a statement by the leading employer organisation in Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is on course for major economic upheaval sometime during 1990. The policies that are now being followed will potentially stop the economy in its tracks. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we face tomorrow night. The Government has totally endorsed the ACTU's blueprint in the face of very serious reservations by its advisers and a number of leading commentators around Australia. Mr Kelty's blueprint is exactly what we do not need in Australia. We do not need wage rises unrelated to productivity. That is the great cruel hoax of tomorrow night-this illusion that people will be better off, when the advisers, the experts and all those who follows this closely know that people will not be better off; they will be worse off. The Government has had its hands in people's pockets and all they will get back from the tax cuts is a few dollars of what the Government has already taken. Inflation will get the rest. If people still reckon they have a chance of getting ahead, they can be sure of one thing, and that is that increasing levels of taxation will soon get them. The gains will be an illusion only. </PARA>
<PARA> The blueprint, instead of giving us a mechanism for increasing productivity, doing things better, giving people an incentive, leads to a very limited agenda for change. Mr Kelty has got things just as he wants them. The Minister is not prepared to stand up to the ACTU and demand working time arrangements, contracting out and all the other sorts of things which would provide people with some chance for real wages growth. We have a more regulated and compressed system as a result of the implementation of Mr Kelty's plan than we have ever had in this country. Instead of a more flexible, less rigid system, we will have a more centralised system. Mr Kelty has been dreaming about this plan since 1970, apparently. Part of his plan is to set in concrete new relativities between key minimum rate awards. As we all know, that is absolutely wrong in terms of providing the greater flexibility we need in the management of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of leading to improvements for people, we will have a greater institutionalisation of those factors which, I might say, perversely encourage wage break-outs. The Treasurer's sole position this week is that the best form of offence is defence. It is his wages policy which will lead to wage break-outs. The only thing in Australia is that we do not call them wage break-outs when they have been endorsed by an agreement between Mr Kelty and the Treasurer. They are said to be part of the accord; therefore, all will be well. What we need in this country is some real addressing of the problems which have led to wage break-outs in the past. We have had them before in 1974 and 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> As we go into the next election the coalition presents two things to the electorate in terms of labour market reform: firstly, a comprehensive policy of labour market reform and, secondly, a wages policy which will end up giving people some real dollars in their pockets to meet some of the ever-increasing costs they have had in recent years. It will really give people a chance to claw their way back from the decline in living standards which has been foisted upon them by the Government as a result of its economic mismanagement. Unlike the Treasurer, we have a comprehensive strategy for reform of the industrial relations system. He is in a corner and he knows it. His problem is that he cannot address these fundamental issues because he is told what he can and cannot do by the ACTU. He has a political blockage in terms of his reliance on the ACTU. For that reason, as he well knows and as the Minister for Industrial Relations knows on the question of supplementary payments as a recent case study, he is in a corner and has nowhere to go. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that we ought to address some of the basic institutional factors which have led to unreasonable wage demands in the past. We ought to do something about the imbalance of bargaining power which so characterises industrial relations in this country. Twenty years ago Clarrie O'Shea was let out and, since then, we have had a one-sided industrial relations system. The one side says simply that if it does not get what it wants out of the Industrial Relations Commission it will go out into the field and get it. We have not had a system of effective dispute settling which would impose a proper, sensible regime on people. We also have an award structure that ensures a flow-on of wage increases regardless of the circumstances of a particular enterprise. That is an absolute recipe for across the board wage increases, to the detriment of people because they are unfunded. Our multi-employer awards situation also leads to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Treasurer there is no alternative. He has a policy position constrained by his masters at the ACTU. It is time for Australia to look for a change in direction, for some real reform in industrial relations. Tomorrow night will simply be an example of this Government's being prepared to pay any price for its own political neck, at the sacrifice of the good economic management of this country. The only consolation for the Australian electorate is that it will be able to cast the final judgment on this Government when the next election arrives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just listened to a rather pathetic presentation of a journey into fantasyland. We on this side of the chamber welcome the opportunity to debate this issue today. It is very timely, given tomorrow night's Treasury statement. It gives us an opportunity to contrast the stable, successful, consultative policies of this Government with the confrontation, division and fragmentation that would come if those who sit opposite ever came back to government and for whom the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) is the mouthpiece. Today's discussion gives us an opportunity to demonstrate quite clearly the dramatic contrast between the Government's successful economic management of the past six years and the mishmash of what is presented by those opposite that masquerades as an industrial relations and wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will advert to productivity quickly. In recent years low productivity growth was due primarily to labour cost restraint. Reduced labour costs encouraged the substitution of labour for capital and so reduced measured productivity. Those who advise the honourable member for Flinders on this issue know that full well. The decision to use labour rather than capital is a rational business decision. It does not mean that business profitability has been reduced. The profit share is now back to appropriate historical levels and that improvement has supported the huge boom in investment that we are witnessing at the moment. Similarly, productivity data are distorted by growth in non-market sectors of the economy and the services sector, and output for those sectors is often measured by input, thus making productivity growth zero even though those sectors have become much more productive. In many sectors it appears that productivity growth has been very rapid-around 4 1/2 per cent in manufacturing and 8 per cent in transport in 1987-88. Taking an empirical example, in the steel industry steel output per employee rose by some 35.1 per cent between the March quarter of 1984 and the December quarter of 1988. Business, industry and managers know that. We can have a theoretical debate about the relevance of productivity data, but we prefer to deal with the real facts, the real world in which industry operates. </PARA>
<PARA> Award restructuring provides a vehicle for the most fundamental type of productivity change-multiskilling, more flexible work practices and the breakdown of demarcation problems-which will greatly increase labour productivity. Award restructuring provides an historic opportunity to make industrial awards more appropriate to modern competitive requirements. The honourable member for Flinders criticises the way we propose to bring about this restructuring. He is out of touch and out of date. The Opposition has no way of bringing about the changes that are needed. It bleats about linking wage increases to productivity growth, but it has no idea how to do it. Its proposals will not work. What we would see from the Opposition in the so-called enterprise by enterprise set of industrial relations that it is talking about would be a re-run of 1981-82-a massive wage outbreak, escalation in unemployment and a collapse of the economy. That is all that members of the Opposition offer and that is all that the policy they are putting forward now offers. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders hates the idea of minimum rate adjustments because these will increase pay for those at the bottom end of the scale. He has the gall to say that he is concerned about living standards. He does not want a pay increase for the breadwinners of our poorest families; he wants pay increases based on market forces for the wealthy executives. When he was questioned on the Face to Face program on 12 February about the big increases in salaries for executives he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I mean, people are paying these executive salaries because they are facing a very competitive market for the skills that they need to run our businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an apologia for them but for the people on the bottom, the families which have been struggling and which have felt the pain of recent years, there is nothing. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us contrast this with what the honourable member for Flinders has said. I have to smile at the interjection. The Opposition has learnt nothing and has forgotten nothing from six years in opposition. As I have said before, the message is the same as the message in 1980-81: let it rip, let it go. The economy is down, unemployment is up and there is no way to the future. Members of the Opposition say, `Let the market fix it. Let the unions and employers negotiate individually so they get agreements'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened? When the collapse came what did the Opposition do? Its solution was to bring in the most centralised wage fixation system of all-a total freeze on wages. In that period when wages blew out, average weekly earnings grew by 17 per cent over the year to the September quarter 1982, cutting into the buying power of pensions, wiping out savings and investment and putting tens of thousands of families below the poverty line. So as the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and former Prime Minister Fraser took Australia into the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, almost a quarter of a million Australians lost their jobs in just over one year. As I have said, when the proposal blew up, the coalition government panicked. It introduced a wage freeze, the most centralised form of wage fixation there is. We inherited that chaos in 1983 and we have set about fixing it. </PARA>
<PARA> All that the Opposition can offer is that we go back to the law of the industrial jungle. The Opposition has no sensible policy to develop a wages system. It does not have the confidence of industry. Some industry associations are saying one thing to members of the Opposition, but behind their backs they do not want a bar of them. Bert Evans from the Metal Trades Industry Association made very clear the other day that the industry associations are the realists. They are investing the money, they are making the decisions and they know that the system is working. </PARA>
<PARA> After six hard years of the legacy that we inherited from those who now sit opposite let us look at the achievements of the past six years: 1.3 million new jobs have been created; over 85 per cent of those jobs have been in the private sector; more than half of those jobs have gone to women; and all of that has occurred in a time of record participation by males and females in the work force. We have seen inflation come from 11 1/2 per cent down to 7.7 per cent, despite the historically strong growth and the inflationary pressure of a lower exchange rate. We have seen unemployment slashed from 10 per cent to 6.2 per cent-the lowest rate in seven years-and that is despite many more people being encouraged to join the labour force. We have seen teenage unemployment more than halved, down almost 80,000 since 1983. What does this mean? It means more families with the breadwinners employed; it means more women working and raising family incomes; it means that young people have a future in the labour market; and it means less poverty and less hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice is clear: no wages policy, the law of the jungle, industrial chaos and recession as the Opposition proposes, or this Government's offer of an orderly, equitable wages system under which there is an agreed method of overall wage restraint, the overall stability of a centralised wages system and the added flexibility of certified wage agreements, a system under which living standards are protected and wage sanity prevails. We have been successful because we have adopted a consultative consensus approach both with industry and with the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says that this is all a myth, that none of the Government's achievements are real. According to the honourable member for Flinders in his `Futile Diversions', the 1.3 million new jobs are a myth. Inflation is down to 7.7 per cent but he says that is a myth. Real unit labour costs are down by 14 per cent but he says that is a myth. Unemployment is down to 6.2 per cent but he says that is a myth. According to the Opposition, the record level of business investment-17 per cent in the last calendar year-is a myth. The honourable member for Flinders says that the reduction of almost 60 per cent in industrial disputes in the past six years compared to the Howard-Fraser years is a myth. </PARA>
<PARA> Private business, industry leaders, managers, shareholders, families and the trade union movement know that these are all solid achievements of this Government. They know that they are a fact but they also know that the real myth is that the Opposition has a wages policy. They know it is a myth that the Opposition has a tax policy. Maybe one day it will surface. Well after the next election, when they are still in opposition, we will see it. Instead of the cooperation and consensus that we offer, all that the Opposition can offer is more of the same-back to bashing the unions, back to putting down the low paid people and back to confrontation, which is the path it has followed before. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's `Future Disruptions' policy document makes it all quite clear. Leopards and Liberals are of the same ilk-they do not change their spots. We have heard the nice soft words of the Leader of the Opposition. He wants to cuddle the unions; he wants to be friends. He is saying, `They are really all right. First and foremost, our goal is to work with the unionists'. He had better talk to the honourable member for Flinders and to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) because they have a different story to tell. If there is anything that the honourable member for Flinders stands for it is confrontation, division and fragmentation. He is the mouthpiece for those things; let us be very clear about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition do not understand what award restructuring is about. They cannot live with consensus, they cannot live with consultation, and they cannot work with industry and the trade union movement. They see the wages-tax trade-off package as a dangerous sham, which implies that we should be restoring taxes to 60c in the dollar level, which was the rate when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. That was the achievement of those who now sit opposite. Taxes have already been cut by this Government-in November 1984, December 1986 and July 1987-and tomorrow night we will see them cut again. This is what has really stuck in the craw of members of the Opposition. They do not want that to happen. It is paining them and grieving them so they are lashing out with their so-called wages policy. They also imply that we should return to the system that they created. In seven years they were in office the only growth industry was the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member knows that that is a fact. He knows that the tax avoidance industry was the only growth industry in those seven dark years of Fraserism. Honourable members opposite are saying that their policies would mean a return to a system marked by an absence of a capital and fringe benefits tax and under which the payment of tax for the rich people and the high income earners would be optional. In government, they slugged the wage and salary earners and that is why they do not want the tax cuts tomorrow night.</PARA></TALK.START>

They cannot make such a system work and, if they did make it work, it would mean that they would have the same kind of wage discounting that they sought between 1975 and 1981 in the wage indexation system. Ultimately they had to throw that away because it would not work and, similarly, it would not work in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is wrong on the filing of union financial returns. We saw the climb down, we saw the apology and we saw the humiliation suffered over that. He is wrong on the productivity linkages and he is wrong on wages policy. He is now posing as a prophet with a new gospel. He draws on the old emotional and abusive themes, such as the dictates of the unions and the power of the union bosses. He wants to be strong and authoritative but he does not have the guts to do it and he does not know how to do it. The way to the future is through what industry has been experiencing under this Government-industry, trade unions and government working together to improve our system. As members of the Opposition have already admitted in their strategy paper, they regard industrial relations as a marketing exercise. They are simply recycling old, worn-out, repressive anti-union shibboleths. Their supposed policy document is no more than a repetition of the coalition's self-plagiarism which should have been headed `Future Disruptions'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders postures as the voice for freedom, but in reality he stands for confrontation, fragmentation and divisiveness. For us on this side of the House the national interest means all people. It means job growth and security; industrial efficiency; fair wages, taxes and social benefits; training and career paths; opportunities for women; and safe and healthy workplaces. But for members of the Opposition the national interest seems to leave out most of the people in this country. They cannot tolerate the idea of consultation and working with trade unions and industry. They want to go back to the old ways and they want to go back to the old confrontation that they had in the past. I have a message for them: those days are over. Their `us versus them' days are over. What this country will get from this Government will be a continuation of industry, government and the trade unions working together to improve the productivity, efficiency and competitiveness of Australian industry and in that way, through the award restructuring process, we will improve job security, the satisfaction of jobs, career paths and, ultimately, the security of jobs across this country. We have been taken by the honourable member for Flinders on a journey to fantasyland. We have had more of the same old hackneyed approach that led to confrontation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) on reading so well the speech written for him by Mr Kelty. He needs to have the speech written by Mr Kelty. As Pamela Williams has so accurately reported in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 5 April, it appears that the Minister for Industrial Relations has a lack of familiarity with his subject. That is the reason why the Opposition has raised this matter of public importance before the Parliament today. We are concerned that the national interest is not being served by this Government because it is giving in all the time to the union movement. It is being bullied and dictated to by the union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Have members of the Opposition ever wondered why the union movement is so influential in dictating this Government's policies? If we want to answer that question, we need look only at some of the people who make up the front bench of the Labor Party which forms this Government at present. If we begin at the most senior of positions, we realise just what sort of an influence the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the union movement have on this Government, commencing with the most senior of positions, that of Prime Minister. Honourable members will realise that he is on sabbatical leave from the ACTU in order to come here and run the Government for a few years. Assisting him whilst in government are people such as the Treasurer (Mr Keating), a former trade union employee; the present Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), also an ACTU employee; the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), a trade union employee; the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), previously a trade union employee; the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys); and a whole host of other people who form this Government in Canberra. They are all from the trade union movement. Those people are allowing this country to be governed not by the Parliament, not by the properly democratically elected representatives of the people, but by the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Just last week we saw another example of how that occurs. Into Canberra rolled the ACTU team with Mr Kelty at the helm. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Industrial Relations, the Treasurer and Mr Kelty and his team arrived for a big meeting which was held in Canberra. What came out of that meeting? A decision that we are going to have a wage rise, not the wage rise option that the Government wanted, but the wage rise option that the ACTU wanted, that the ACTU dictated to the Government it must have because it is the influence that dictates the policy of the people who govern this country. It is that dictation of policy that concerns us on this side of the House and, indeed, concerns people right throughout Australia. It causes us to believe that it is not in the national interest to have it continue. </PARA>
<PARA> We just saw the example of the wage-tax deal struck here last week in Canberra. Last week we also saw the Inter-State Commission bring down its report on the waterfront. Immediately the intellectual giants in some sectors of the trade union movement stepped forward and offered their opinions. People such as Tas Bull stated, `We are not going to have any recommendations put forward by the Inter-State Commission. We are not going to have any of that. There will be no discussions and no negotiations. Any changes will take place over my dead body'. Despite the fact that the recommendations highlight to the people that there could be more than $800m per year in benefits flowing to the people of this country if those recommendations are picked up, we do not hear the Government attack Mr Tas Bull and his colleagues and say, `Look, you are not taking the national interest into account here. There is $800m worth of benefits to be had for the people if changes are made. How about taking that into consideration?'. There is no criticism from the Government in regard to that. Honourable members opposite just sit back in the corner sucking their thumbs and letting the unions dictate the policy. I can bet my boots that we will find within a few months that all the recommendations of that Commission will slowly collect dust in the office of the Minister for Industrial Relations because the issue will not be raised again. All of those matters cause us concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is concern being expressed not just on this side of the House but throughout the community? We are concerned and we feel the need for change when we look at the economy. The economy is in dire peril. We have the biggest balance of payments deficit this country has ever experienced. We have rising interest rates. Mortgage rates are at the highest they have ever been. We have tax rates that are increasing. People are paying more taxes than they have ever paid before. Our standards of living are falling. This is well recognised. Why? It is because this Government will not bring this country into line with what the rest of the world is doing to ensure that we have a vibrant economy and a future that we can depend upon that will be prosperous. Why will the Government not do something? It is because the unions dictate what this country does, because the unions are the government. It is because the unions are made up of people who pull the strings here in Canberra. Until that is changed, then I am afraid we will not see the status quo changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The unions are not radical; the unions stand for no change; the unions stand for status quo. Any change such as the change the honourable member for Flinders, our shadow Minister for industrial relations, is proposing would actually reduce the power that the trade union movements have. That is not in their interests and they will not allow that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation occurring in Australia today has caused us on this side of the House and people right throughout Australia to bring to the attention of the Government the need for change. On the Opposition side of politics I have responsibility for tourism. There is no greater need for change than in the area of award rates, penalty rates and wage agreements. We need to have a flexible wage agreement in the tourism industry. Everybody knows that. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), when he was a Minister and a shadow Minister, highlighted the need for a change. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr John Brown called yesterday for a reduction in `outrageous' penalty rates which, he said, were having a `horrendous' effect on the Australian tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA>In another article in the Courier-Mail it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA>He said high penalty rates were costing the tourism industry jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Horrendous penalty rates are costing jobs. This political organisation, the Liberal and National parties, is prepared to change the position and to deliver those jobs that bring economic benefit to the people of Australia. This Government is not prepared to do that because it is being controlled by the forces of no change, of the status quo, the forces of self-interest and of maintenance of power. That is why we bring this matter of public importance to the attention of the Parliament today. We are prepared to make those changes. As has been outlined by our shadow Minister, we are prepared to bring in these mutually satisfactory wage agreements which would increase efficiency, productivity, wages and jobs that are there for the taking. They now would be created. Our policies would bring those benefits to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What we would do, which is totally different from what this Government is prepared to do, is let the people of this country determine their own future by enabling them to agree to their own wage awards, to make their own wage agreements. We would ensure that they had a right to determine their future. We would create jobs, promote the economy and increase our productivity and competitiveness. If we do not have those changes we will find that not only the tourism industry, in which I have a great interest, but also every other industry in this country which has the potential to benefit from changes to our award wages, to our wages policy, will miss out. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few years since I have been a member of parliament we have seen some significant industrial situations. The Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets disputes were two situations in which this Government could have taken a lead, benefiting the people and the workers of this country. But the Government ignored that opportunity. The case of Castle Bacon was a real example of where this Government could have taken a lead. But the Government backed off. Government members sat in the corner and sucked their thumbs. </PARA>
<PARA> Some changes need to be made in regard to the Inter-State Commission and the situation on the waterfront. The sum of $800m could be delivered to the people of this country. We will see no action there because, as this matter of public importance which the Opposition brings to the Parliament highlights, this Government does not have the courage or the determination to do what is in the national interest; that is, to ignore the self-interest and the attitudes of the trade union movement and do what is best for Australians, giving us jobs and improving our economy. We are prepared to do that. Let us hope that the next election is called soon so that we get a chance to do it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) has correctly identified a long term problem in our economy, the balance of payments and trade deficit problem. He should have been able to identify it correctly because it has been spelt out for him in this House by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) since 1986. When asking ourselves how to go about fixing the problem we have to look at the history. The honourable member said that he would not tackle the problem the way the Government proposes. Let us look at the way the honourable member for Gilmore, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and other Opposition members have tackled these things in the past. What is their recipe? The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) alluded to this in his speech. I remember from my days as a trade union official and advocate during the 1970s--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to come to the question of all the trade unionists on this side of the chamber. I am glad that it has been raised. Honourable members opposite talk about who is in touch with the workers. In the late 1970s the trade union movement compliantly agreed with plateau indexation. It went along to wage cases and tribunal hearings, cap in hand, saying, `Please give us consumer price index reduced wage rises as proposed by the Fraser Government'. What happened? Despite all the promises, that Government compressed the wage system and did absolutely nothing about the fundamental problems of the economy. It held the currency fixed. At the time the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) was the Treasurer's principal adviser on these policies. That Government destroyed our manufacturing base and expected the trade union movement to sit there and cop it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the heat got too hot, when the policy was failing, when unemployment was rising and everything else was going wrong what did the then Government do? It threw up its hands and said, `This does not work any longer. Forget centralised wage indexation. Forget the plateau system. You just go and work it out for yourselves', and off went the wages explosion. </PARA>
<PARA> We have even had a little taste of this since 1983. For a few brief days in 1986 when the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission introduced the two-tier wage structure and the superannuation productivity flow-on, the Government recommended to the Commission that the flow-on be a managed process. The Opposition and its people said to the Commission, `No. Not everyone deserves this superannuation flow-on. It should be paid only where it has been negotiated and agreed between employer and employee'. The Commission said, `Fair enough. Let us pay it where they reckon it is okay. You go and sort it out amongst yourselves'. How long did it last? It lasted about four days. It was four days before the employers went along pleading to the Commission and to the Government, ignoring the Opposition and saying, `This has to be a managed structure, otherwise the strong will get stronger and the weak will get weaker'. It did not work in the 1970s, it did not work in the early 1980s, and it did not work even for a few days in the mid-1980s when we returned to the Opposition's system for a short while. So let us scrap the Opposition's recipe and approach. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister said, when the Hawke Labor Government was elected in 1983 and Bob Hawke was elected Prime Minister he was elected on a specific platform and promise. The key promise he made was that he would bring people together, get them talking and solve problems by consensus, the thing that he was universally recognised as being the best at in this land. That pro- cess, through the prices and incomes accord, the consensus approach, has led to the things that the honourable member for Gilmore described as a myth. As the Minister said, from the day the prices and incomes accord was introduced-through mark 1, mark 2 and mark 3-the Opposition said that it would not work, that it would break down. What has happened? It has gone on, it has been modified and it has worked as a conciliatory and consensus approach between the trade union movement and the Government. It has led to the creation of 1.3 million new jobs, and honourable members opposite call that a myth. It has been an instrumental factor in the reduction of inflation from 11.5 per cent in 1983 to 7.7 per cent now, and the Opposition says that is a myth. The Minister also spelt out the reduction that has occurred in unemployment, in real unit labour costs and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make something constructive of this debate today. The honourable member for Gilmore pointed out-and I thank him for doing so-the number of people on the Government side of the House with strong trade union backgrounds and trade union affiliations. I bet that the honourable member wishes he had some on his own side, because it is only through Labor governments, the Labor Party and the trade union movement that there has been any sort of press in Australia for managed change. Honourable members opposite are members of the conservative parties. They adopt a conservative approach and they have fostered resistance to change in this country at all attempts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider a constructive approach to wages policy. Let us consider the pressures for wage increases and how they can be accommodated and the sorts of preconditions the Opposition might agree to. Honourable members say that there must be an increase in productivity to pay for an increase in wages. Okay, how can we produce a productivity increase? Firstly, we can train and increase our skill base. What happened during the Opposition's years in government? There was a winding back of the emphasis on education, the scrapping of apprenticeships and an opting out of business and industry-with the encouragement of those opposite-from the training of employees and the upskilling of our work force. What happened to our investment base? The previous Government held the currency fixed, decimating Australian manufacturing industry with the free ride it gave to imports to the point that there was no investment incentive in this country for any kind of technology or for improved productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the prices area. Since the mid-1970s in almost every case that has come before the Arbitration Commission for an increase in wages based on the price increases that have flowed through the CPI honourable members opposite have opposed such an increase. At the same time they have not done a single thing to meet the other side of the equation for ordinary families, that is, to hold back price increases. All that ordinary families were saying was, `Give us a fair go. If you are going to hold back our wages, at least hold back prices so we can maintain our living standard'. What did those opposite do? They scrapped the Prices Justification Tribunal. They bagged any efforts on the part of this Government to beef up the Prices Surveillance Authority. Even now, at the most minor level the Opposition has its people going around bagging the Government's price watch network, for God's sake. There is an effort by members of the Government. Not one of the Opposition members is involved in price watch. Members of the Government are encouraging consumers to work actively at keeping prices in their electorates at least under control. Yet people like Senator Short wander around in my electorate saying, `It does not work. It is all a scam'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last December CPI figure, for the first time in 1988-I put to the House that it was the first time in a decade-increases in grocery prices were not a component of the increase in the CPI. For the first time, supermarket prices were not a contributor to an increase in inflation. The principal reason for that is that at the consumer level, price watch is working. It is a very simple mechanism of people working together to help themselves. The Opposition will not join in and it is bagging the system. The Opposition cannot go on having two bob each way; saying that the Government's policies do not work; saying that any attempt to get people working together will not work; and, at the same time, bagging all the constructive measures which have been put in place in an attempt to resolve these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As a nation, we looked at the Opposition's solution; its technique of confrontation; its days of conflict, and we said, `It does not work and we are not going back to it'. That continues to be the situation. The program which the Minister has set in place, which will be reflected in tomorrow night's statement, is part of the process. The Minister is now going around Australia talking about the processes of wage restructuring; getting people to work together and to work towards outcomes that are better for everybody, but emphasising that people should work together; taking notice of the people who do the job, for a change, instead of those who think they know how they ought to do the job. That is the way we get these things resolved in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was interrupted late last night, I was discussing, amongst other things, the need for Australian businesses to make their presences more and more felt, especially in the Asian and Pacific region. I raise just one other matter as part of my contribution to this debate and that is the fear that I have that many of the opportunities that we have for increasing trade to the Near East are being forgone because of a difficulty that has evolved through the air freight regime in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that as the countries of South East Asia are becoming more and more consumer societies they are looking for more exotic produce. There has been quite an increase in the build-up of primary products going into Asian ports in recent years. The real difficulty with this is that most of that produce must be on the spot fairly quickly and that air freight is the major means of getting that produce to the market. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times a number of primary producers have come forward and said that their difficulty is that there is just not enough air freight space available out of Australia, especially into South East Asia. While it is true that the international air freight regime has been loosened up in recent years, obviously there is a great need for improvement. The horticulturalists of south-east Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia, in particular, have asked for consideration to be given to freeing up that international air freight regime. Huge markets are available in fresh fruit and vegetables, especially in areas such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan and, in terms of a specialist market, more opportunities are opening up in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you come from Western Australia and I am sure you would be aware of the tremendous traffic between Perth and Tokyo in the export of fresh crayfish. That has been an outstanding market for Australian exporters. It has been outstanding inasmuch as the coordination of the air freight allows delivery of those items within about 17 hours of the crayfish hitting Fremantle. While the crayfish are initially treated and chilled, it is only a short time before they are at Perth Airport on an aircraft straight through to Tokyo. They are in the fish markets of Tokyo early the next morning. Within 17 hours they are on the tables of the restaurants in Japan. That has been a remarkable example of how we can get into those sorts of markets. The other example has been the export of tuna from the mid-coast of New South Wales, from areas such as Coffs Harbour, where the same technique has been used with great success. However, when it comes to tomatoes for Singapore or lettuce for Hong Kong we appear to have a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Another difficulty that has arisen is that some of the licences that are granted to the international air freight operators have proved to be a bit restrictive. There was quite an opportunity for Australians to get into the export of dairy products to Guam. Many people in this place would not have much knowledge of Guam, but it is a big American base with quite a large local population and a huge tourist industry catering to the Japanese. An air freight company had the opportunity of opening up the dairy products market, especially for fresh milk from Sydney. It made only two flights before the restrictions forced the cancellation of that service. That is one area that I sincerely hope the Government will look at. </PARA>
<PARA> There are tremendous opportunities for export of our primary products particularly. At a time when we need all the foreign exchange we can get that is the way to go. Let us free up the international air freight regime and open those markets because the real difficulty we have found in using only the scheduled carriers is this: while they are full to Singapore, quite often beyond Singapore they have a lot of empty space. Qantas Airways Ltd and Lufthansa German Airlines have got together on an agreement for a joint international air freight operation. That is well and good for the European market; it has solved that difficulty. But it has certainly not solved the problems of South East Asia. I sincerely hope that that is one area that the Government will look at very seriously to see whether it can free up that regime a little more in order to make the most of the export of our primary products into those very lucrative Asian markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) spoke a lot of commonsense about our trade with South East Asia and the problems of our international air carriers. I do not wish to grapple with that but to turn directly to matters economic and take up the comments made by the honourable member for Went-worth (Dr Hewson), the pretender to the position of Minister for Finance. After hearing the honourable member speak for almost 30 minutes and utter some 4,000 words, one had to come to the immediate conclusion that he had nothing to say. He certainly gave no alternative economic strategy, although he was, indeed, full of criticism-good old reliable criticisms. He made claims of economic mismanagement and said that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was a mine of disinformation. Those are throwaway lines, but the people want to hear a substantiation of his accusations. He did not do that at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider his contribution in this debate on the Appropriation Bills and the amendment that he moved. He was very critical that Budget outlays represented more than a quarter of our gross domestic product (GDP). What he did not say was that when the Opposition left government those outlays stood at some 30 per cent of GDP. By careful and prudent pruning this Government has brought them down to 25 per cent and I understand that the Treasurer has forecast that the figure will come down to 24 per cent during the next 12 months. Nor did the honourable member add that we were in Budget surplus for the second successive time after a series of deficit Budgets-for the past 15 years or so. Here we have all the signs of a buoyant, growing economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member made no mention of the fact that society's standard of living consists of private consumption and the government providing goods and services. Under this Government the social wage has made forward steps and improvements. There was no recognition by the honourable member of the fact that taxation is a transfer payment, out of which government provides pensions, student allowances, repatriation benefits and services to individuals, such as pharmaceuticals, hospitals, medical services, child-care, student places in higher education and so on, as well as other services to society as a whole, such as roads, defence and so on. On any reckoning, nearly all of these have greatly improved under this Government. I outline a few of those achievements: pensions are up 8.3 per cent in real terms; the number of child-care places has trebled; greater chances of higher education are available for secondary school students-an encouragement to stay on at school; road funding has increased and been maintained; and family allowance supplement has been introduced for low income families. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member did not say anything about what the Opposition would do except to give some small hints of proposed policies. I must say that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), absolutely trumpet the fact that they believe that there should be further cuts in government expenditure-obviously, 25 per cent of GDP is too high for them. But they will not spell out where those cuts will be. They are dishonest with the people. If they were fair dinkum they would say where government expenditure should be slashed. They have no social justice policy and no credibility with the people. I challenge the Opposition to tell the pensioners where it would cut pensions-or perhaps the level of pension would be frozen again as it was in 1981-82. Would the Opposition reduce or cut out rental assistance? I challenge members of the Opposition to tell working mothers-more than 50 per cent of the women at work at present-that their kids can go without child-care. Or does the Opposition not care at all? Will it go out and tell the students that Austudy will be slashed? Will it tell the motorists, the truck drivers and local government that there will be cutbacks on road funding? Will it tell those on low incomes with children that their family allowance supplement will be cut back or removed, thus returning those recipients to poverty?</PARA>
<PARA> Until Opposition members can stand up and tell us where they will make these cuts, then the electorate has the right to reject them. The Opposition cannot run the economy. It lacks the nerve or courage to indicate its policies in those areas. The truth is that this Government has exploited budgetary policy as far as it can without starting to cut into people's standard of living. In fact, that standard of living provided by government has increased. Opposition members should not tell us we have relied solely on monetary policy. Budgetary policy has been outstandingly successful. We have maintained those government services which I have mentioned, we have reduced outlays as a percentage of GDP, we have brought about a fairer tax system to finance them and we have ended up with a Budget surplus. We have also reduced the public sector borrowing requirement to zero. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition argues that the Government's economic policy, its strategy, is off course. Let us look at a few key indicators. First of all, let us take productivity which is up some 3 per cent and which is being paid by way of superannuation for future retirement incomes in the years ahead. Employment is up. This Government has created 1.3 million jobs. We have reduced unemployment from 10.2 per cent when the Opposition left government to-and the news was announced earlier today-6.2 per cent. We have reduced unemployment in this country by 40 per cent over seven years. We have reduced the number of unemployment benefit recipients from 627,000 to 407,000. In fact, some 7,000 to 8,000 people on unemployment benefits are being removed from those benefits every week and being introduced into the work force. So we have reduced by 40 per cent the greatest cause of poverty, misery and indebtedness in this country. Economic growth is up 4 per cent. We have recorded a repeatedly positive growth rate, whereas there were many years of negative growth rate under the coalition when it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to admit that inflation is still too high at 6.5 per cent or 7 per cent. This has been due to demand outstripping supply and forcing up prices over the past 12 months or so. When the Opposition was in government it left an inflation rate of 12 per cent. As we cranked up supply to meet demand we reduced the figure to 5 per cent. As I said, it has edged up slowly and that is regrettable. But at least the Government recognises the problem and is grappling with it. This Government has brought the balance of payments, which is central to its whole economic strategy, under some control. It stabilised it, mainly through deregulating the value of the Australian dollar, restructuring industry, holding down unit costs of production and increasing exports-although we were helped along by a temporary commodity price increase and an end to the drought. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumption is ahead of Budget estimates. This nation is spending more than it is earning. That would be somewhat excusable if the investment represented most of our imports-and a lot of it does-because that builds a future. It builds our import replacement and value added export industries. But too much is spent on consumption items. Despite the Government's most successful `Australian made' campaign and the placing of extra sales tax on luxury cars, most of which are imported, our consumption remains at 4 per cent in excess of our production. The root cause is the damage done to our manufacturing industries over the 30 years after the Second World War-27 of those years being under conservative governments. It takes time to turn around monumental mistakes and negligence of this order. But the Government still has to, and does, grapple with that question. </PARA>
<PARA> How can we keep the lid on consumption? The Government has done this by reducing Budget outlays-as I said, from 30 per cent to 25 per cent of GDP. It has done this by cooperation with the trade unions which has realised a workable, effective wages policy through the accord. The Opposition's answer to this most successful wages policy-perhaps the most successful in the world-has been deregulation. Deregulation is not a policy. People are not commodities to be traded. Families-people-have certain needs that must be met with minimum wages and so on. We will maintain an accord with the trade unions; we will maintain an arbitration system in this country. The Opposition has no wages policy. The honourable member for Wentworth did not mention wages policy because the Opposition does not have one. In fact, the record of the Opposition is dismal. In 1982 the wages blowout was about 20 per cent. If we were to deregulate the wages area, we would find that situation being repeated. In fact, if we have any sign now it is in the deregulated area of executive incomes, where executive salaries are rising by 15 to 18 per cent. The people are not fooled. They know that a government without a wages policy, like the Opposition, would lead to more unemployment, a blow-out of inflation, confrontation and industrial disputes. That was brought about by the Fraser Government in the early 1980s. It brought about a recession and it sent businesses to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has a monetary policy in keeping with current needs. That is actually where the Opposition is weakest. The honourable member for Wentworth gave us a mini-lecture on monetary policy in a deregulated economy. He kept quoting the Treasurer to illustrate his points, but he left us no wiser except for one point: the honourable member for Wentworth believes that interest rates should be higher than they are now. That stands to reason. An Opposition with no other economic controls, no wages policy, no defined budgetary policy, no anti-inflation policy and no courage to tackle an inappropriate value of the Australian dollar-in other words, without an exchange rate policy-has to rely on monetary policy. People can only conclude that the Opposition would rely solely on monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's economic successes have been such on several fronts that interest rates would be much higher otherwise. Yet we hear Citibank Ltd and other banks, with the cooperation of the Opposition, talking up the rate of interest and trying to beat up a situation whereby ordinary people would suffer. Compare that with the responsible attitudes of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corporation. The Opposition would have interest rates at 25 to 30 per cent to curb the economy. It believes in the short, sharp shock. It would hit spending so hard that demand would plummet, unemployment would rise, prices would go through the roof, we would have a Budget blow-out, unemployment benefits would expand and, as revenue dropped, this country would be placed in recession and Budget deficits would be another feature of the Opposition's economic landscape. There is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 we have heard no new policy prescriptions, no alternatives to the Government's policies. That is because the spokespeople on the other side are the very same people who occupied the treasury bench before they lost office on 5 March 1983. Those same people would do what they did in 1982: they would plunge the country into recession. The same people are in charge. The Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer at the time. The shadow Treasurer would be a lackey of the leader. His only experience has been as a globetrotting Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Opposition's spokesman on finance, the honourable member for Went-worth, is a former adviser to the Fraser Government. It is he who is arguing, as he did before, for higher interest rates. We have seen promoted to the front bench a textbook Friedmanite professor who has a stable of six cars and who drives a Dino Ferrari. People cannot expect compassion from that sort of person, an Opposition spokesman like that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, I repeat, has no social justice policy or attitudes towards ordinary people. It is left to this Government, which knows that the answer to our balance of payments problem is a gradual, moderate and effective course, to allow interest rates to rise only to a level that will not reduce living standards in this country but will curb excess, unwanted demand. Everyone knows that interest rates have to be high at the moment, but not as high as the Opposition wants them-25 and 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> My regret is that, despite the correct economic policy mix implemented by this Government, interest rates at their current levels have flowed over into housing mortgages. A way must be found to mitigate housing interest rates, separate them from the levels necessary to reduce demand, causing our balance of payments problems, until our industries can increase supply. We are honest on this: we do not like interest rates as high as they are but, unfortunately, right now they have to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The duplicity of the Opposition is staggering on this point. In this chamber it calls for an increase in interest rates but out in the electorate it promises to reduce them. A person in the electorate of Casey rang me and said that the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) had been promising that he would reduce home interest rates. How can he do that when the might of the three economic spokesmen on the other side speaks in another direction? They believe interest rates should be higher. That is duplicity. With no other policies and relying on monetary policy, either interest rates would have to go sky-high or there would be a blow-out in the external debt. Either way, under the Opposition we would be headed for economic disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The dilemma faced by the Opposition showed up clearly when, in a pitiful performance of supposed misrepresentation, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said that the Opposition had not decided to remove the 13.5 per cent ceiling; but it will. It is not that it had not decided to remove it; it has not implemented that decision. It cannot have deregulation and retain it. It cannot have it both ways. It has to come clean with the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow evening the Treasurer will announce a tax reduction-wage increase package that will further strengthen the Government's wage and price policies. That will ease pressures for a further increase in interest rates. The announcement will take yet a further stage forward the Government's tax reforms, which have restored equity and credibility to the tax system. I support the Bills before the House and reject the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In introducing the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89 and cognate Bills into Parliament on 8 March, the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) stated that supplementary moneys were required to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1988-89 under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. The Minister went on to talk of this requirement being largely due to post-Budget commitments by the Government, unavoidable price and cost increases and other parameter changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One particular request that puzzles and concerns me is that for an additional $50m for Austrade. The reason given by the Minister in his second reading speech for this supplementary funding is to enable the Government to meet eligible grants under the export market development grants scheme. He states that these additional funds will be sufficient to enable settlement of all grants that are expected to be processed and payable by 30 June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a particular concern in this matter because of representations to me from a constituent who is the manager of a small but successful company which is engaged exclusively in exporting. His company made application during 1987-88 for an export market development grant associated with an ongoing promotional program to be conducted over 1988 and into 1989. Austrade advised this company in March 1989 that a grant had been recommended for payment but:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the $109m made available through the Federal Budget for payment of export development grants in the 1988-89 financial year has, unfortunately, been exhausted and in accordance with established procedures, the Commission is seeking additional funds to meet commitments in respect of unfinalised claims lodged in respect of the 1987-88 grant year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission's advice went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>As soon as additional funds become available the Commission will be in a position to finalise your company's 1987-88 EMDG claim. </PARA>
<PARA>We should note the word `unfortunately' in the first quotation. It really is unfortunate for an Australian exporter who has committed himself to ongoing export promotional activity through 1988 and 1989 in the belief that part of that expenditure would be supported by an export market development grant. In principle, that support is forthcoming but, of course, principle is cold comfort to a businessman who finds that a 1987-88 claim has been approved but cannot be paid at March 1989 because Austrade has run out of money and is waiting on supplementary funds. The exporter is being seriously inconvenienced by Austrade's inability to meet its commitment. He faces a choice of scaling down his promotional activity or carrying an increased financial liability. At today's rates of interest, he is naturally reluctant to increase his loan liabilities; but Austrade, ever helpful, concludes its advice to my constituent with the comment that it `hopes this letter will assist your company with its proposals with its bank'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is obviously far removed from the sort of effective and efficient support which Australian exporters really need and expect from a government agency. The businessman in question has prepared his promotional activities over many months, involving the outlay of considerable energy and expenditure. Now, at the eleventh hour, Austrade cannot give him its promised financial support. The exporter's program is jeopardised and he of course has very good reason to be cynical about the Government's sincerity in wanting to encourage Australian export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> This is simply not a satisfactory manner in which to conduct an export development scheme. As we all know, the scheme is intended to encourage exporters and prospective exporters to seek out and develop overseas markets. Furthermore, I believe that small business people who find themselves similarly placed to my constituent would join with him in doubting whether this Government has the necessary will or the business acumen to achieve that objective. An examination of the Budget Papers in relation to the export market development grants scheme gives cause for even greater concern about the Government's management of and attitude towards its assistance program for Australian exporters. Budget Paper No. 1 for 1988-89 shows that the export market development grants scheme received $92m in 1986-87 and $174m in 1987-88, and has been appropriated $189m in 1988-89. These amounts exclude small amounts of specific target funding. This shows a drop of $65m in 1988-89 and the Budget Papers disclose that this largely reflects special funding of $64m in 1987-88-and I emphasise the next few words-to reduce unpaid claims on hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, in April 1989, the Minister is seeking special funding of $50m, and again I emphasise his words, to enable Austrade to settle all its 1988-89 grants. Let me put this situation to the House in a businessman's language. In 1987-88 Austrade needed a special 58 per cent increase in funding to meet some, but not all, of its outstanding commitments. In 1988-89 it needs a special 46 per cent increase in funding to meet its outstanding commitments, some of which relate to the year 1987-88. Who is responsible for this unsatisfactory situation? I find it hard to believe that an agency such as Austrade could be so seriously negligent in two consecutive years that it needs approximately 50 per cent extra funding to meet its commitments. I guess one has to look elsewhere for the culprit. It probably smacks of the manipulative hand of the misnamed Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and perhaps the Government's Expenditure Review Committee. If this is the case, the Government's treatment of Austrade is intolerable, the more so when it occurs in an area where the public record simply abounds with statements by almost every member of the Hawke Cabinet about the continuing prosperity of Australia being heavily reliant on the successful restructuring of the economy towards those industries most able to contribute to increased overseas earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> That restructuring will occur only in an environment which gives confidence to Australian entrepreneurs that the energies that must be expended, and the risks that must be taken in developing export opportunities, are both understood and supported by the Australian Government and its agencies. When one contemplates the funding history of the export market development grants scheme and its effect on my constituent among other people, is there any wonder that he and other exporters feel that the sheer procrastination and disincentives they meet in their dealings with the Labor Government are simply not worth the effort? Regrettably, there is ample evidence to show that the Labor Government has never realised the importance of the small and medium sized business as the principal provider of jobs, investment, innovations and, ultimately, national economic growth. It is no coincidence that commentators often refer to small business as the powerhouse or the backbone of the economy, and these statements are backed up by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> A 1988 report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on small business showed that in 1986-87 over 94 per cent of Australian businesses-that is, approximately 730,000-employed less than 20 people. These businesses generated a 13 per cent increase in employment in the four years studied by the Bureau, and produced 40 per cent of the gross national product (GNP). This has never been properly understood by members of the Hawke Government, who, despite their alleged socialist roots in the well-being of the ordinary, battling Australian, have, for six years in government, deliberately and heartlessly adopted policies which have lowered living standards for the majority and permitted the creation of large personal fortunes by a small minority. This House needs no reminding of the highly questionable wheeling and dealing associated with the Government's restructured media industry and the insidious influence of WA Inc. and its close relative, the Victorian Economic Development Corporation. Big government, big unions and big business are okay for this Government. It is the ordinary Australian and small business that have had to bear the brunt of the highest interest rates ever for many categories of loans, for record deficits which have created a record level of foreign debt, for record bankruptcies, for unacceptably high inflation, and for record levels of taxation both absolutely and as a proportion of GNP. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies that created this economic quagmire are not the policies needed to restructure the Australian economy or to give encouragement to those 730,000 or more small businesses which make up the backbone and provide the powerhouse to the Australian economy. The Labor Party has never understood the vital role of small business. In fact, it is very suspicious of small business because small business tends to be a little independent of unions and government: small business tends to think for itself, tends to be a little flexible. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And what happened to him? As far back as the Australian Labor Party's 1983 platform the Party committed itself to a small business policy of increased access to equity and loan capital at reason- able interest rates and to reducing the costs imposed on small businesses through discriminatory charges, taxes and regulations. Now, six years later, I believe the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) would be hard pressed to find a small business person who would suggest that the stated policies have been achieved. To the contrary, there is almost certainly an overwhelming opinion within the small business sector that the Hawke Government's taxation, regulatory and general economic policies have discriminated against and discouraged the efforts of small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Government has no effective policy for small business, has not had one in its six years in office and does not know what to do to create one. Why else has the Minister responsible for small business asked the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to inquire into small business and to identify the main problems it faces? What an incredible thing for the Minister to do-to ask that Committee to do that. An inquiry such as that would not be needed if the Government had an effective policy, or even any policy, in place. What has happened? Suddenly, the Government's opinion pollster is telling it that the small business community is fed up with the discriminatory and unsympathetic attitudes of this Government. This has galvanised the Government, after six years of neglect, into an inquiry which it hopes will tell it what the core issues are for small business and make recommendations that will provide the Government with a ready-made, off the shelf, small business policy. The Government does not need to do that, because the major problems for and complaints of small business are well documented. But that community is being asked to present that material, for the umpteenth time, to government through the hearing and inquiry processes of the House of Representatives Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Individual small businesses, such as those which have dealings with the export market development grants scheme or those with particular industry interests, will have their specific problems, but beyond that there is a remarkable degree of consensus within the small business community as to the core issues or major problems that it faces. At the outset it must be acknowledged that small businesses are greatly affected by State and local government policies and regulations, and that these matters are beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. I acknowledge that. But I believe it is accurate to suggest that the major issues lie in that latter jurisdiction-in other words, within the Federal jurisdiction-and I point them out. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is taxation, with particular attention to its general administrative complexity and uncertainty; sales tax complexity and the 21-day payment requirement; aspects of capital gains and provisional tax; and discrimination between incorporated and unincorporated businesses. The second issue is trade practices, with particular attention to anti-monopoly and price discrimination provisions in sections 49 and 50 of the Act, and unconscionable conduct provisions in section 52a, and the third aspect is superannuation, particularly its general complexity, the viability of small funds and the unsatisfactory limit of a $3,000 deductability for self-employed people. The fourth aspect is industrial relations, and particularly the advantages to small businesses from deregulation and access to voluntary agreements. Members of the Labor Party do not like that. The final issue is regulation and general economic policy with attention to the failure of the Business Regulation Review Unit to address adequately the oppressive and inappropriate regulatory requirements imposed on small businesses and the destructive effect on small businesses of the high inflation, high interest rate strategy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> In due course the House of Representatives Committee will offer the Government a report on small business which will be quickly reshaped into a Labor Party small business policy in time for the next election. In contrast, the coalition has a well-established small business policy which is being re-examined presently in preparation for the election. At the core of that policy is a recognition that small business will benefit most from an overall strategy to provide more incentive, more choice, less regulation and a more productive competitive economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not much care how the honourable member pronounces the name of his electorate. I am more concerned that he was a Minister in a government that helped to destroy Australian manufacturing. Now he has the audacity to talk about his forward thinking on manufacturing policy. One can go through the years from 1983 onwards and look at the variety of programs which the Government has implemented. For example, the steel plan saw the re-establishment of Australian steel manufacturing as world competitive and of world quality, for the first time since the 1960s. In 1983 a number of our major engineering companies were in serious difficulties. Those heavy engineering companies, with Government assistance and support and certainly the cooperation of their work force, are now effective and competitive. They certainly look healthier than they did in the previous nine or 10 years. One can look at the ship repair bounty and the ship building bounty which, for the first time, recognised the stupidity of paying a bounty on the domestic market but not on the export market. For the first time a bounty was paid on ships for export sales as well as for Australian owners. There has been major restructuring, rationalisation and reorganisation of those industries because of those government initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A major factor in re-establishing Australia's manufacturing industry clearly was research and development. The 150 per cent tax write-off on research and development has been a major spur for a number of industries to start investing and redeveloping. The textile, clothing and footwear industry is one of those. The two industries which offer in some ways perhaps the greatest potential of all are electronics and pharmaceuticals. Those industries are now developing at a dramatic rate and in most exciting ways. It has taken six years of long and diligent effort to achieve that. The achievements, essentially, are about repositioning, restructuring and, eventually, reconstructing. There is a flow-on from that. When one visits factories and looks at the new plant, the relationship between management and the work force, their directions, order books and where they are targeting their markets, one finds there has been an enormous change since 1983 and the earlier gloomy years. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of industrial relations in the workplace, it is not a question now of workers versus the boss; it is a question of the corporate team which includes the work force. For the first time in their lives-in some cases it is more than a century-companies are sending tradesmen overseas with management to look at new equipment. In the past there was no way that management would allow a tradesman to go on an overseas trip; that was a perk for management. But much of the equipment management bought was not useable by its tradesmen. Management has learnt its lesson. The award restructuring that is taking place at the moment represents a continuation of that process and certainly offers us the most dramatic change since we first inherited the British guild system last century. That restructuring, particularly in engineering, offers scope for diversity, retraining and enormously increased productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The major key to the future of this country's manufacturing industry is investment. What the honourable member for Warringah did not mention was that the analyses from which we work from the Australian Bureau of Statistics were established over the decades under previous governments of the coalition parties. What is not commonly known is that the money spent on leasing does not figure in Australia's investment figures. So if one tries to compare the level of investment with that of 20 years ago, one finds that amounts spent on leasing do not appear. People have always leased: they have done so for more than 20 years. When one looks at smaller businesses and how much of their plant is leased rather than purchased, one finds the shift to leasing is quite significant. A significant investment has taken place in this country over the last two or 2 1/2 years, largely on a lease basis. Those who want to use investment as published as the major criteria of economic or industrial restructuring are not that well placed. That point was made by the Committee that is conducting the small business inquiry in a report tabled last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Other aspects need to be addressed. Most people in our community believe that the Appropriation Bills are about government spending on services such as welfare, pensions, education, health and the like. Of course, most people do not think about the government spending that goes on in an attempt to restructure. The honourable member for Warringah talked about Austrade and the amount spent on export grants. This Government believes that the major need is to get industries effective. We must invest in making them competitive. There is no point in creating incompetent, ineffective and uncompetitive industries and then subsidising their exports. That is what the coalition did for 25 years and that is why we are in trouble. We must make industries competitive with imports in the domestic market and then export competitive. But the concept, which dates back to the 1950s and 1960s, of offsetting our lack of competitiveness and competence with export subsidies so that industries can compete is precisely what this Government has been fighting in Europe, America and Japan for the last six years, eventually with some success. So our task is not to offset our lack of competitiveness by subsidising exports; our task is to make sure that our fundamental manufacturing base is competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist in that I believe that the Government should be spending more funds in some areas. I would argue most strongly for the retention of the 150 per cent tax write-off for research and development for a longer period. Our companies are not used to research and development; our companies are not used to competing in world markets. It will take longer than currently assessed for those companies to migrate to the point where research expenditure is a normal part of their budgets. Although quite significant steps have been taken to date to improve quality, I believe that more should be done. There should be more expenditure and more assistance for companies to upgrade their quality of production. If Australian consumers do not believe in the quality of the Australian product, they will buy imports. </PARA>
<PARA> What did we specialise in under the previous regime of the coalition? We have a long history of selling the world's cheapest wheat, coal and meat. The only thing that we have sold that was expensive was wool; we have been the world's bargain basement for everything else. Our concentration on quality, which is essential to manufacturing, had been minimal. That is changing rapidly. I believe that companies need assistance, support and encouragement to escalate the shift to quality production. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the question of statistics. I believe very strongly in the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for a review of our statistics gathering and evaluation so that the Government and we, as parliamentarians, have much more accurate and insightful information about what is happening in our economy. I believe that the statistics we are gathering now would have been more appropriate some 10 or 15 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the heavy engineering plan, which I think has done quite remarkable things for many companies. That concept, which required a combined management and work force committee structure and consultation, has been excellent. Within the award restructuring context I would certainly support the Government increasing our appropriation and expenditure in that area. Quite frankly, I believe that the faster we can move attitudes and the faster we can change within the award restructuring and skills enhancement programs, the more competitive we will be in manufacturing terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Eventually, the bottom line of all this is that either Australia makes more things itself or it becomes a degraded economy. We have come very far in six years but we still have as far, if not further, to go. If one goes into the factories of Australia, as I have done in Newcastle for the last six years, and looks at the changes and talks to the people on the work floor and in management one will find that what has been occurring has been quite dramatic and extremely exciting. I am quite confident that we can make those transitions. I think the Government's role in that context is to encourage and assist-not to dictate or provide subsidies to offset a lack of competitiveness; rather to help those companies make that transition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we recognise that our industries have been repositioning and rebuilding. I am sick and tired of hearing criticisms about Australian industry that are so badly based. I go to factories of some of the largest industries in the country. The number of politicians, particularly those from the other side of the House, who actually go inside those factories is very minimal. There are very few on the coalition benches who venture into our major organisations and industries. Their capacity to comment on those industries is zero. I can assure the House that those companies have changed and are repositioning. It is important that we recognise and encourage those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of all, it is important that we communicate to our public that Australian industry is getting its act together. It has lifted its quality, it has its competitiveness just about right and it has certainly improved its performance. If the Australian community had any lack of confidence or faith in Australian manufacturing years ago-whether it was well or badly earned-nowadays it can certainly look to Australian industries to supply its needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me rephrase a comment made by the Chairman of the Reserve Bank of Australia about people spending $300 a year less. If every taxpayer in Australia spent $20 a week less on imported goods, whether it be a Mercedes-Benz, a BMW or a pair of Reebok shoes, Australia would not have a trade deficit problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pretty poor outfit if it is still on. I hope that it is off, because I would hate to think I am getting hot flushes. Tonight I would like to deal with a smorgasbord of matters that I think are not only of interest and significance to the remote and underprivileged areas that I represent but also of immense interest and significance to this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first matter that I would like to deal with is drought. It may seem strange that, at a time when cyclones are buzzing around in my part of the world and many areas are being flooded, I should bring up the subject of drought. But this is where the difficulty lies. We go through a period of drought, a period of desperation and a period of huge effort by courageous people to survive. Then come the rains and everyone says, `All the graziers and farmers are right again. They are building up huge bank accounts'. I have news for the House and for the nation. Those days are gone. This is an age of survival. God does some funny things. All around my area there are floods, roads are cut and people and planes are bogged down, but 100 miles away in the north-west of Queensland we are still experiencing a drastic drought. </PARA>
<PARA> If the points I am addressing now appear to be parochial, I have succeeded in my endeavours. If an industry worth $9 billion is regarded as parochial, this nation has gone into an era of Kamikaze thinking. I propose to present to the House evidence that, when a drought reaches its apex, as has happened in many parts of Australia, people struggle for survival. The people who are involved are the people who made this country. The men on the land not only established industries which will always be there and which are totally necessary for our balance of payments but also were prominent-and I ask honourable members to think back-in placing their lives and their futures in jeopardy when the regrettable wars of the past occurred. It must not be forgotten that in my home area alone two fine people won Victoria Crosses. We do not have Victoria Crosses these days and so we forget what it is all about. We forget what the Australian flag stands for. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I proceed further with the views that I want to express as forcefully as I can, I want to give credit to a number of people who helped me correlate and collect this information. Let me give an example. After 20-odd years in this Parliament I am hoping to get the message across that we have to do more than I am doing now-that is, pay credit to these people, say how courageous they are and how they are struggling to survive in times of drought. We say, `We have to do something about this'. One of my former leaders, Black Jack McEwen, used to say, `Never mind about the something that has to be done; tell us what the something is'. I cannot understand why successive governments have failed to anticipate these recurring drought conditions because, believe you me, they will come and go as long as this land exists. </PARA>
<PARA> I present to the House and particularly to the Government and the Ministers involved-and that very much includes the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-the following points that could help and would be a substantial contribution to preventing this country from suffering billions of dollars of loss. It is nonsense to suggest that the man on the land-the cocky or the grazier-has his big car and so on. From a material point of view, losses accumulate to a terrifying degree when we are in the grip of these terrible, continuous and inevitable droughts. In time of drought, funding should be more obtainable by simplifying criteria and red tape. Honourable members should talk to these people and hear what they have to go through to get a few lousy dollars to survive and then they would understand why I make this submission to the House and to the Government. It is felt that few people would meet the criteria at any given time to obtain government loans without long delays of weeks and even months. This excludes many applicants from receiving help. Many graziers who were examined were broke but viable. </PARA>
<PARA> I plead with the Government to read Hansard and for heaven's sake to act and at least give consideration to these submissions I am making because they come from dedicated men who are still hoping that they will survive-they are probably third generation and fourth generation people on the land. Once a property is drought declared and cash flow is non-existent, $10,000 is to be made immediately available upon application for a concessional loan through an individual's normal banking channel at 6 per cent interest when banks are charging 18 per cent. One of my constituents told me the other day that he has been informed that he will now be paying 20.5 per cent to the bank. How on earth can one make that sort of repayment and still survive?</PARA>
<PARA> Could the Government subsidise interest-this is a pretty practical approach-to the bank to bring interest rates up to competitive commercial rates? The eligibility for carry-on finance at concessional interest rates of 6 per cent after two years of continuous drought should be automatic. The ceiling of these carry-on loans is to be raised to $120,000. There was an alleged scandal up in my part of the world recently. A fellow was granted a loan of $100,000. It was said that the Government had given him great concessions and great assistance. He put his head down, was lucky enough to get rain and was able to completely repay the loan in about three years. It is not as though we are investing in a very risky proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make one thing clear: my heart does not continuously bleed for the grazier who may have millions of dollars behind him, is very substantial and never has very much trouble meeting his indebtedness. I am concerned with the small landholder, the small businessman, the carriers and the railway men-all the people who are so totally dependent on the viability of this industry. I am briefly pointing out the terrible difficulties of people who have given their life to the land. These families are having extreme difficulties. Rains, floods and everything else do not wipe out the possibility of future droughts. They will occur. Surely to goodness our parties have the capability of setting up a monitoring organisation that will do everything possible to mitigate drought and make every effort to cushion the effects of future droughts. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about a matter that more seriously affected less privileged people. I refer to the declaration of the rainforests for World Heritage listing. I suppose I would have been the greenie to end all greenies when it came to rainforests because in my part of the world if we see one big tree we quiver with excitement. We think, `Oh, there is a tree and a bit of shade. This is just wonderful'. Honourable members can imagine what the people from my part of the world thought of the rainforests when they went to the magnificent Atherton Tablelands and places like that, up along the coastal areas and beyond, on this side of Cairns. I used to get terribly depressed if I thought those rainforests were going to be put at risk. I got a great surprise. I happened to become familiar with the situation when it began to build up-not on a political basis; I ask honourable members to understand that. I began to understand by going into the rainforest and spending hours, days and weeks with foresters that they were not destroying the rainforest. They were making sure that no-one else destroyed them. But that is not my point. Is it not a pretty smart little act to get a group of smaller nations that would not really know where Australia is and would not be concerned about what our future holds or does not hold to gather in Brazil? I do not want to create some diplomatic crisis by naming these nations, but I just say this: it would be a damn sight better if the Brazilian people began to take a greater interest in the destruction of their own very extensive rainforests which we are told are being destroyed at the rate of many acres per second. This is how sophisticated their method of destruction is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business is in the chamber. I really have a great affection for this man. He has helped me in this matter by giving the precise detail. `One football field a second', to quote one of the most distinguished Ministers on the Labor side of the House. Yet the Government will host a group of people who will pass judgment on our nation. Is this not a pretty talented way of infiltrating the affairs of other nations? Surely to goodness the people of a nation are the ones most concerned with the future of that nation, its heritage and its magnificent attributes. Surely to goodness the people of that nation know what they are doing. All that is history now. We have been over all the speeches that have been made in the House. I am concerned with the aftermath, the wreckage that has been left in towns such as Ravenshoe and other centres where these magnificent rainforests existed. These rainforests were magnificent. I see my friend the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) walking past me. He was one of a group of people who visited the rainforests. We spent days familiarising ourselves with all that was going on there. I would like him to visit the area now, to see the rubbish, to see what the pigs have done to these neglected, magnificent rainforests. They are already suffering deterioration. Let me get back to my point. I see, in the declaration of these rainforests as a World Heritage listing, a sinister, talented and unforgiving attempt by small, nondescript nations to pass judgment on and to exercise their influence on our country. On behalf of my people I say that I totally resent it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am presenting a smorgasbord of matters that I think are critical not only to my own area but to the nation. Overall, governments have done a pretty good job with roads. But here and there one finds a vital segment of road which is suffering neglect to a possibly irreparable point. The following may sound parochial, but it is not because it relates to a segment of road which is vital to the defence of this nation. I refer to the Barkly Highway, a segment of the road that runs between here and Darwin. Between Mount Isa and the Northern Territory border that road is crumbling to nothing. We were speaking to the Minister today about other matters. I plead with him to do everything possible, to collaborate with the Queensland Government and the Queensland Minister, to get that road repaired very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five minutes remaining to me I would like to talk about tourism. To go abroad to present a movie is not precisely what the average politician would do, I guess, but I had the privilege of doing so. Paul Hogan was ill or something; he just was not there to present the film. So-would you believe it?-I was chosen to do the job. I was a very questionable substitute; our physiques are not entirely synonomous. But let me get serious about this matter. My secondary responsibility was to monitor the reaction to the film of a certain segment of the American people, the glamorous segment if you like. We spent the first two nights in Hollywood. We then went to Minneapolis and so on. The sort of address I had to give prior to the showing of the film was, `We are going to see a great adventure film. That great adventure land is available to you. Come across to Australia, see our Great Barrier Reef, go into the hinterland, enjoy the thrills and experience that Dundee experienced-not in every respect, but in most of the more adventurous matters'. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, I have been to the United States of America since, on a similar assignment. I find that the American people are not so concerned about the Gold Coast. They have bigger and better. They are not so concerned about what is easily the finest harbour in the world, the Sydney Harbour. They are looking for the sorts of things one will find in inland Australia. They are looking for warmth and friendliness and a natural manner. Someone was talking to me the other day about this business of saying, `Have a nice day'. People even say it on the telephone. They finish their call by saying, `Thank you. Have a nice day'. The person with whom I was discussing this said that he answered a woman he was talking to on the phone, `And you drop dead'. People are getting fed up with his sort of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to promulgate in the House tonight a really Australian package deal which first of all involves a visit to the Barrier Reef or to one of our coastal cities. I am referring particularly to Queensland because, as honourable members will remember, I am talking about the adventure-type holiday which would particularly attract the people of the USA. The interest of Japanese tourists in this type of holiday is accelerating. They are beginning to look for something beyond the fleshpots. The package deal is this: The tourists will visit the Barrier Reef, whether it be off Townsville or Cairns. They will then go down to Winton where they will see the Banjo Paterson country. Overseas tourists probably do not know a damn thing about Banjo Paterson or Waltzing Matilda but what they will see is Australia's natural life. They will see kangaroos-we see too damned many of them, of course-and all that sort of thing. I need not go into the details. They will then go on to the Stockman's Hall of Fame. If I might put in a little plug, I have the great privilege of being the foundation Chairman of the Stockman's Hall of Fame, and my wife is the foundation Secretary. Any other family announcements will be made later! They will then go on to Ayers Rock. They will go from the Barrier Reef to Winton, with all it has to offer, down to the Stockman's Hall of Fame-there is nothing like it anywhere else in the world-and then to Ayers Rock. This is the sort of thing people are looking for. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a huge and wonderful potential. I could go on and on. I could talk about tourism for the next three or four days, but it is too damned hot. I wish the maintenance staff would turn the air-conditioners back on. I have mentioned drought. It is critically important that the Government set up the machinery to deal with the effects of drought. I am sure that many people in the Minister's Department could find ways of mitigating the effects of continuous droughts. I have talked about roads and a segment of road that is vital to the security of this nation. I then talked about tourism. I have presented a smorgasbord of matters that are vital not just to my electorate but to the people of this great nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to pay tribute to those men and women in Queensland who over the last two years have experienced both drought and flood. As someone from a family which has been on the land for more than 70 years, I recognise, as does the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), the contribution that the men and women on the land have made to this nation. It is important that the money provided under the natural disaster relief arrangements go to those most in need. I believe that the Government should continue to encourage the concerns about our soil and land degradation. The Government should ensure that those problems are resolved. As our climate is cyclical, we should encourage the drought-proofing of properties for the droughts in years to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 28 April 1988 in this House I spoke about natural disaster relief arrangements (NDRA). Earlier this year a Queensland State Government memo from the Department of Primary Industries Drought Secretariat came into my hands. It set out six pages of rorts in the administration of drought assistance in Queensland-drought assistance which received substantial financial support from the Commonwealth Government under the natural disaster relief arrangements. The memo had been written by a diligent officer of the Secretariat who had found evidence of widespread, systematic fraud and wanted to see something done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the document became public, the reaction of the Queensland Government was not to establish an investigation into this series of allegations. The Queensland Premier, Mr Ahern, dismissed the allegations as some kind of political ploy. Last month the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries described the officer who had written the memo as naive and said that he had been moved to another job. No investigation was initiated by the Executive of the Queensland Government, probably because it knew what it would find. This was at a time when we had experienced severe drought. Now, of course, we have experienced severe flooding. </PARA>
<PARA> This was not the first time that there had been public disclosure of rorts in the administration of drought relief in Queensland. In 1986 a former National Party organiser, Michael Behan, received $148,000 in low interest, natural disaster relief loans after the then Queensland Primary Industries Minister, Neil Turner, had directed the Agricultural Bank to lend the money, despite the fact that it had previously assessed the Behan property as non-viable and, therefore, ineligible for assistance under the national disaster relief arrangements guidelines, a fact which was confirmed in 1987 when the Behan property had to be sold because of its debts, despite the receipt of $148,000 in concessional loans. The National Party had tried to help one of its mates. All this corruption went uninvestigated by the Queensland Government. Mr Bjelke-Petersen used the same excuse as did Mr Ahern. The Behan loan was being questioned only as a political stunt. He refused numerous requests from the Commonwealth to investigate. The Commonwealth could not itself investigate these sorts of allegations without the cooperation of the Queensland Government because drought relief is administered by the State. The Commonwealth does not vet either drought proclamations or individual relief applications, nor should it have to duplicate administration at that level. The Commonwealth should be able to expect a State government to administer relief properly, in accordance with the guidelines set down by the Commonwealth. The only check that should be needed is an auditor's certificate saying that the funds provided by the Commonwealth have been expended in accordance with the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the Queensland Government's refusal to investigate the Behan loans affair, the Commonwealth Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who administers disaster assistance, two years ago publicly canvassed the option of cutting off Commonwealth funds for drought assistance to Queensland. He did not do so because of the effect that action would have had on those farmers who had a legitimate need for those funds. He did, however, tighten the Commonwealth guidelines. In particular, he restricted the total amount of money which could be provided to one property, thereby at least avoiding the kind of blatant favouritism in the extent of largesse which could be provided, as occurred in the Behan case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that Queensland has used Commonwealth funds for drought assistance to a far greater extent than has any other State. The figures for the last five years suggest that Queensland is systematically milking an arrangement which was set up to help the States and the farmers in genuine cases of need. The States have the constitutional responsibility for disaster relief in times when dealing with an emergency is beyond their own resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1984-85, 1986-87 and 1987-88 financial years, Queensland used all the funds spent by the Commonwealth on drought relief. In 1983-84 it used 64 per cent and in 1985-86 it used 91 per cent of those funds. From these figures, one can come to two conclusions: either Queensland has had a bad run of drought over the last five years, or else the funds were not being deployed exclusively for drought relief. The document from the Queensland Drought Secretariat provides the answer-there was an occurrence of widespread abuse and fraud. The document reveals that declarations of individual properties as drought affected have been made in non-disaster situations. Relief has been extended through area declarations to non-droughted properties. Subsidies have been paid where overstocking has produced the same symptoms as drought, effectively rewarding mismanagement. Most tellingly, the document notes that since the existing drought declaration procedures have been adopted, many areas have been drought declared for 50 per cent of the time. This is a higher frequency than could ever have been expected from climatic variation. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>It can be seen the pickings are worthwhile for those prepared to have a go . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The document then goes on to outline a number of ways in which the individual applicant can manipulate the system, and gives the example of rail freight concessions. The document, which I stress has been released by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Rail freight concessions are also available for droughted sales, agistment and fodder movements. Unfortunately, the railway has even less opportunities for checking eligibilities, and effective checks available to the Drought Secretariat can be circumvented by switching between the two transport systems. </PARA>
<PARA>In a section headed `Case Studies' the document states:</PARA>
<PARA>Field staff handling hundreds of claims are unable to monitor the happenings on particular properties and ineligible movements are discovered accidentally, well after large sums of irretrievable subsidies have been paid. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Harper's outrageous denials of abuse of the scheme are not shared by his own Department which administers the funds on a day-to-day basis. Mr Harper has been encouraged in his `head in the sand' approach by the Hinkler division of the National Party. It swells the ranks of quango boards in every part of the electorate. Unable to get a job on their own, they rely on Government-appointed taxpayer-funded positions to boost their incomes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Bowman says, it is jobs for the boys. The Hinkler division of the National Party, through one of its spokesmen, claimed the reports were false. That was not a bad piece of arrogance from someone who had not even read the memo. He was the same person who had been calling on wage and salary earners, pensioners and small struggling farmers in Hinkler to give him a subsidy. I have had several complaints directed to me about him. Apparently, he is finding it so tough, he has bought a new $28,000 Toyota Cressida and has taken his wife on an overseas trip. This is evidence of the credibility of the National Party as it tries to tell people it can administer drought relief. No-one would trust the Queensland National Party with a jam jar full of five cent bits when it comes to administering anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fortunately, the United Graziers Association and the Cattlemen's Union have been the voices of reason in this matter. The United Graziers Association President, Mr Drysdale, was quoted in the North-West Star as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clearly in the interests of all graziers and landholders to ensure that drought assistance is geared towards helping those in genuine need. </PARA>
<PARA>I fully agree with him. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If undeserving individuals are abusing assistance measures or are receiving assistance outside the set guidelines then it is up to the responsible department or authority to take appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely what Mr Harper should have done. As the responsible Minister, he should have called for a report into the matter. After all, it is affecting genuine farmers in need. In failing to do so, he has been negligent as a Minister and should be sacked. The Queensland Cattlemen's Union Chairman, Mr David Corr, said in the North-West Star:</PARA>
<PARA>Our members realise what is going on. Many experience trouble getting assistance, especially during the period when they are coming out of a drought and need concessional loans to re-stock. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Corr's claims were backed by the Cloncurry Branch President of the Cattlemen's Union, who said on 6 February in the North-West Star:</PARA>
<PARA> The drought assistance scheme has been ripped off but no government scheme is water tight against this, and any assistance formula will inevitably be open to abuse from various sections. </PARA>
<PARA>The saddest thing this does is to cast a bad light on all farmers. Ninety-five per cent of all farmers are decent, genuine people who work hard to earn export dollars for this country. However, there is a handful of greedy squatters who have had their hands in the pockets of battling farmers, have been ripping off this system and have been protected by the incompetence and lack of will of the Queensland State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to read a few figures from the document: In a drought, when $15m was paid out in subsidies, 84 per cent of subsidy users received subsidies of $5,000 or less. The remaining 16 per cent of users received 76 per cent of all subsidy payments. In other words, 16 per cent of applicants received $11.4m. It is quite obvious that there are genuine people out there who are finding it hard and are missing out on assistance. It is not a case of needing more money, as we have heard from the State Government, which wants an endless supply of Federal money. At the same time, the National Farmers Federation has called for cutbacks of billions of dollars in a bucket which has a hole in it, because the money is not being administered properly by the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, it is time for the Queensland Government to have a total review of its own administration of drought relief. It is a damning indictment of the Ahern Government that it has not taken any initiative at all in this area. Yet, it pretends that it prides itself on looking after country people. At the same time, genuine people who are finding it hard are missing out because of a handful of rorters. The Government had to be dragged into this inquiry by Mr Ken Haywood, the Australian Labor Party member for Caboolture, through the Queensland Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no point in gutless Queensland National Party politicians, who are afraid to take on the rorters in their own party, pretending this is a case of the Commonwealth Government giving Queensland a hard time. It is a case of Queensland National Party corruption at its worst. We, at the Federal level, have an obligation to ensure that Commonwealth taxpayers' money is not being used to fund this corruption. Most importantly, we have an obligation to ensure that those moneys, which are put there for national disaster relief arrangements, go to those people most in need. We have just seen flooding in Queensland from a cyclone. There will be more applications for NDRA and yet the same guidelines are in place and the same system is open to rorts. We need accountability in Queensland, something which has not happened for 20 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject before the House tonight, as some in the gallery may wonder, is the Appropriation Bills. As is always the case, the Appropriation Bills deal largely with the hopefully equitable distribution of the tax money available to the Government. I am reminded of the timeless biblical injunction to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. With these Appropriation Bills that biblical injunction is being given new meaning, because in 1989 we no longer willingly render unto Caesar; in most instances, it seems that Caesar seizes it for himself. The ultimate irony, the cruellest twist of all for Australia's taxpayers, is that they have been duped into believing that tomorrow night the Government will give them back something. What they do not seem to appreciate is that the Government is handing back to them only what it has effectively already stolen from them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The press covering tomorrow night's statement-whether the Adelaide Advertiser or the Sunday Mail-has spoken of a wage-tax trade-off that will be worth between $50 and $70 a week. There has been speculation about how the sum of money is to be equitably split between low and high income earners. Inevitably, as one would expect, there has been lobbying of the Government by tax and welfare groups for some sort of equitable redistribution of whatever money might be available in the tax-welfare and tax-wage trade-off. The point I will continue to hammer during the opportunity I have to address the House tonight is that the Government is not generously handing back something to the people of Australia, but making available to them a little of the excess the Government has at its disposal because it originally took too much. I find that people in my electorate ask me about the state of the economy. They are confused because they hear on one side that the nation is awash with money and that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) intends to hand back in a tax and wage trade-off money to low income groups, a portion to all income groups, and on the other that the nation is broke. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the devious approach to answering questions employed in the House by the Treasurer the electorate is totally confused. People say to me, `Neil, how can it be that there is too much money in Australia, as the bank manager tells me, when interest rates are going through the ceiling? How can it be that the Treasurer has money available to hand back to the taxpayers of Australia when in our own household budgets there is not enough to go around?'. They are confused because they recognise that along with every other Australian they are tightening their belts, but the standard of living continues to fall. In spite of the belt tightening and the difficulties they have in balancing the household budget, still it is that unemployment rises, that inflation inexorably goes up and that our terms of trade do not improve. So they are confused. They come to me, a non-economist, and ask what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a simple and, I hope, not inadequate illustration of what is currently happening in the nation and I put it to the House this evening. I say to the people in my electorate, a largely rural one, that I believe running the nation is not unlike running the farm. The problem currently facing Australia is just the same as the problem that faces any farmer who discovers that he has more coming in through the farm gate in the form of fertiliser, seed, livestock for fattening and farm chemicals than he has going out in the form of grain for sale, fattened livestock and produce ready to be shipped to market. That is the nation's problem. Just as a farmer discovers more coming in the gate than going out, so the nation currently finds itself importing more than it is exporting to the tune, in January, of $1.5 billion and, in February, almost $1.3 billion-astonishing sums of money. At that rate of stumbling backwards as a nation, the figure for the year would be to the tune of $14 billion or $15 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> My constituents then say to me, `That is all very well, but if that is the case how come Treasurer Keating has available money to hand back to us?'. The truth, simplistically, is that we could compare the Treasurer to the farm housewife-I do not mean to be sexist-who says that no matter what happens to the farm she will continue to balance the household budget by charging more rent to all the people who work on the farm and live in the house. So, in the form of taxation, the Treasurer has reaped more and more from all the people who work on the farm, so that while the farm-Australia-continues to go backwards, the household budget-the Federal Government's Budget-is in surplus.</PARA>
<PARA> That is a very simplistic illustration, but it serves to remind my electorate and anyone listening of what is currently happening. The Government has money to hand back only because it has already taken too much from the people who live and work in Australia. What Australia-the farm-most needs right now in 1989 in the face of a $1.5 billion or $1.2 billion deficit, depending on the month nominated, just as every farmer needs, is productivity. In order to get productivity, we need some incentive to encourage all those people who live and work in Australia to run a little harder. But any sense of incentive has been totally foreign to the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done? It has applied a capital gains tax so that those who want to be productive and get into business discover themselves being ripped off for their very productivity. It has instituted tax rates which discourage people from being busy and innovative and producing more goods to send out the farm gate. Tax rates under this Administration have gone up, up, up. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) said that he had instances of Queensland drought administrators who had their hands in the pockets of farmers. He may be right, but if their hands were in the pockets of farmers they would have already found in those pockets another hand, that belonging to the Treasurer, who would have beaten them to whatever happened to be in surplus in the farmers' pockets. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of encouraging people to get on with being productive and having a little more for themselves, the Government has increased the tax take of the nation from $41 billion in 1982-83 to an estimated $82 billion in 1988-89, a record 26 per cent of our gross domestic product. From whom has this money come? At the Australian Labor Party National Conference in 1984 a former Australian Labor Party senator, Arthur Gietzelt, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have in Australia some 120,000 people in the accountants, medicos, pilots and other professional people. We have 313,000 people who are self-employed and that comes to something over 430,000 people . . . as we have to raise more revenue, I think that (the) directions of the Government should be directed towards making that section of the wealthy portion of our society pay their due tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Pay their due tax those people most certainly have, in many cases paying between 70 per cent and 90 per cent more than previously. If that were not sufficient disincentive to become enterprising, we also had the implementation of a capital gains tax. What did the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) say to an ALP conference in 1982, before he became the Prime Minister? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>A Labor Government must be committed to an effective capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA>But by 1983, in the face of some electoral reality, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>And here let me make one point so that even our opponents can understand it; and let me make it beyond all their powers of misrepresentation and distortion. There will be no new capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA>What did we have? The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>Around the world they (capital gains taxes) never raise much money . . . If the principal reason for government wishing to introduce a capital gains tax were to raise a lot of revenue, we would be damned to fail from the start, because they never raise very much revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>If capital gains tax does not raise very much revenue, why are we stuck with it? That tax is, in itself, a major disincentive to all those people who would otherwise choose to invest more in Australian small business, manufacturing and rural enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> In the farm we call Australia, the farm that most needs productive people, this Government seems hell bent on destroying any sense of productivity. Let me quote the Prime Minister again. On the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's PM program on 11 December 1984 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . let me make it clear that this is not a country which needs an increase in the tax burden and under my Government it's not going to get it. It's also a country which doesn't need an increase in investment rates and it's not going to get it and that means it's appropriate that we reduce the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>On all those counts the Prime Minister has failed and as a result of his failure there is no encouragement for Australians to be productive. </PARA>
<PARA> But I am sorry to say that the picture is even worse than that. In spite of this high taxing Government, in spite of the revenue raising policy we have had from the Government and particularly from the Treasurer, we have had a rundown of the very infrastructure that should have been rebuilt from the proceeds of those high taxes. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) gave the classic illustration of roads. One would have thought that with the tax collection that this Government has had at its disposal, our road building program would be second to none. The honourable member for Kennedy gave a specific illustration of a road in his electorate that he said had essential defence priority. Let me tell the House again-and I run the risk of boring honourable members, but I will bore them time and time again until something happens-about a specific road in my electorate which also should receive some attention. That road, which runs from the Riverland town of Morgan to the mid-north town of Spalding, is the only unsealed stretch of road between Sydney and Perth. With the capacity that this Government has had to collect tax, that road should have had attention. It has had less attention under this Administration than under any other Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I digress briefly to the subject of wheat deregulation-a subject with which I and other members of the coalition are comfortable. I remind the Government that as we move from obligated rail transport into additional road transport, there will be increasing responsibility on the Federal Government to see that adequate funds are made available to maintain those roads that will enable the grain, which we need to address our balance of payments deficit, to move safely and efficiently to its ports. While I am on the subject of roads I remind the House again of a prime ministerial promise. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor-</PARA>
<PARA>would honourable members believe this?-</PARA>
<PARA>will reduce the price of petrol . . . by the order of 3c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA>Less than three years after that statement was made fuel had gone up by 300 per cent and the road infrastructure in Australia was no better-in fact, in many instances it was worse-in spite of that revenue raising measure and the money that must have poured in as result of indexing excise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills before the House tonight make an additional gross appropriation of $684m available to the Government. Some of that money comes from savings, but most of those savings result from programs that have been deferred rather than money that has been pruned from government expenditure. These Bills are set sadly in times of real economic difficulty. All the indicators suggest that we are going wrong. Everyone tells us that the economy is overheated. As I have said time and time again, our balance of payments deficit is becoming increasingly worse and inflation is up. This is not because I pluck any figures out of the air but because the national accounts for the December quarter all sadly illustrate those points. But from the Treasurer and from the Government back bench there is no apology, not even a whisper of change. Instead we hear perpetual invective aimed at this side of the House and we have had to come to terms with it. With monotonous regularity we hear from all Government members in the House, including the honourable member for Streeton (Mr Lamb), who spoke earlier, the allegation that the Fraser years were far worse than the Hawke years. Even if that were true, I fail to see why the Hawke Government should get any comfort from it. If Government members do not use that argument they run the line, `What is the Opposition going to do?'. I thought that the Government was on the other side of the House. The question is what is it going to do, not what are we going to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to my earlier comment about the comparison between the Fraser and Hawke years which is so often paraded in this House as something for which we should be apologetic and of which the Government should be proud. In the little time left to me I wish to run through some comparisons between the events which occurred in the period 1975-83 and those which have occurred in the period 1983-89. In March 1983-not a time when we were exactly proud of being in government-the home loan interest rate was 12.5 per cent; in February 1989 it was 15.5 per cent and rising so that by April 1989 it was closer to 17 or 18 per cent. Under the Fraser Government 4,717 firms unfortunately were declared bankrupt; under the Hawke Administration 7,138 businesses have gone through the hoop. The Fraser average current account deficit was $4.7 billion or 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product; the Hawke average current account deficit has been $11.7 billion or 4.9 per cent of GDP. In June 1983 our foreign debt was $35.5 billion or 20.9 per cent of GDP; by September 1988 that figure had risen to an astonishing $121.2 billion or, would you believe, 40.2 per cent of our GDP. Public housing waiting lists went from 110,000 in December 1982 to 160,00 in December 1988. Under the Hawke Government the cumulative tax is $298 billion whereas under Fraser it was $202 billion for the same period. If honourable members want an even more telling figure I will give them one: in spite of the drought, under the Fraser Government tax as a percentage of GDP was 23 per cent whereas that figure under Hawke has been 25 per cent in what have been good rural years. </PARA>
<PARA> Statistic after statistic reinforces the simple fact that the performance of this Government in rurally good years has not been anything like the sort of performance it would have the electorate believe as a result of the efforts of its media machine. The average monthly unemployment under Hawke is 627,000, while the average monthly unemployment level under Fraser was 403,000. These are not figures honourable members will hear from the Government benches, but they present the picture as it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to my earlier statement: what Australia needs is more productive people. I use an illustration from a former Premier of South Australia, Sir Thomas Playford. When he was picking apples one day he was told by an employee, `I think we need a new tractor'. Sir Thomas turned to the employee and said, `Son, I think we need to pick more apples'. The job in Australia is to get on with picking more apples and to encourage people to do so in order to address our balance of payments deficit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that parts of the contribution of my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) articulate or throw into very stark relief one of the problems in the Opposition parties. He talked about apples and machines and he talked about Australia being the farm. Sure enough, in part it is; the farm is a very important part of our economy. But it is that approach to the conduct of our nation's economic affairs that has caused many of the problems that currently we are trying to grapple with. The honourable member for Wakefield said that the Fraser years were `not exactly a time when we were proud to be in government'. That is a relevant point. I, for one, would not have been proud to be a member of that Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essence of the debate is not so much about the juggling of figures. The honourable member for Wakefield did what politicians are wont to do. In so doing he simply confirmed the accuracy of the old adage that there are lies, damned lies and statistics. He adverted to nominal figures, of course, for the unemployment rate. That has to be a grossly misleading approach. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether monthly or otherwise, he used a statistical base that has to be quite misleading. The smile on my colleague's face confirms it. I want to put a view that would be embraced by most conservative economists in this country. I am not arguing from a partisan perspective in relation to this comment. This is embraced by most conservative economists in this country. Indeed, in so doing they raise some of the concerns they have about the overall level of demand in our economy. Most conservative economists in this country will state, indeed quite accurately, that if the figures for unemployment that are current today were discounted by the quite significantly increased participation rates, that is, the number of women who increasingly have become part of our full time and part time work force, the unemployment rate today would be 3 per cent. That stands in stark contrast to the period that the honourable member for Wakefield conceded was one he was not proud of, when the unemployment rate was 11.7 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While they are figures and statistics-some people tend not to be too swayed by statistics-the overwhelming reality in terms of those statistics is that they represent hope; they represent opportunity; they represent security for many hundreds of thousands of Australian families. In so doing they represent basic levels of standard of living in many homes across this nation. So, they are not just stark figures. I counsel the honourable member for Wakefield not to be so liberal, or illiberal, in the use of what I would regard as quite misleading statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of what the honourable member for Wakefield said I would not argue with. One of the important things about the economic debate in this country is not so much that we should stand up in this chamber and compare sometimes like and sometimes quite incomparable statistics. That is easy for any of us to do. The essence of it is summed up in those two comments by the honourable member for Wakefield. He says that Australia is the farm. Australia is not only a farm. The farm is an important part of our economy, as I indicated earlier. But if we maintain that mentality we will become a quarry. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australia desperately needs to do is not to say, `We will go out and physically work harder to pick more apples'. This was an example that the honourable member for Wakefield reflected on. It is an interesting one; I concede that. It probably says a fair deal about Premier Playford, who embraced dying industries for many years in the State of South Australia. He is, in fact, with that most incisive of analytical tools, the benefit of hindsight, one who many Australians would now say was misguided in the approach he took to the management of not only the South Australian economy but the overall national economy. I am not casting aspersions on him. I simply say-I concede, with that most incisive of analytical tools, the benefit of hindsight-that he was wrong. I assert that the honourable member for Wakefield is wrong if he embraces an argument that says, `We will not use machinery; we will just pick apples faster'. </PARA>
<PARA> What we ought to be doing is working harder and smarter. There is no doubt that that is what we ought to be doing. In the context of comparing these statistical figures that we heard thrown around tonight, the important thing about this Government, which has caused an awful lot of conflict both within the Australian Labor Party and in the wider community, is that it is the first government, certainly in the post-war period-we cannot compare the period during the First World War and the Second World War because there was a completely different environment-which has grappled with the fundamentals, not the superficial issues, not the ones that get the headlines every day, not the ones that the majority of voters tend to respond to as they will always do. This is the first government that has done something about the fundamentals. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, in identifying the problems that Australia has, it has looked at things like, taking one area, education. We have a record second to none in the Australian context not only in terms of retention rates-they have increased, as everyone in this chamber knows, quite dramatically-and in terms of tertiary places but also in bringing to bear some powers of persuasion about the areas of priority that our educational institutions ought to be pursuing. It is again a matter of great debate, a matter of great controversy. But I think we can rightly claim to be the first to really go about addressing where Australia is going and how particular policy areas and changes in those policy areas relate to an overall economic framework and an overall approach to where we are going as a country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, an important ingredient of the approach is not only working harder but also working smarter. Those things are intrinsically related. The things we are doing in education and in a raft of other government policy areas are within that overall framework. As a member of the Government Caucus I am in the luxurious position of being involved in the development of many of those policies. There is a theme right across that spectrum. As I indicated earlier about the contribution of the honourable member for Wakefield, it was, as is often the case in this chamber, fundamentally recognisable as an Opposition policy for one central theme. It continues, as the Opposition is wont to do, to point out areas of difficulty. I can tell honourable members that on this side of the chamber I need no education, particularly from the Opposition, not only on the problems that Australia has in a contemporary sense but also on the problems and challenges that we face over the next 20 years. What continues in the Opposition's theme is the absolute lack of policy prescription, the absolute lack of policy alternative put before this House. It is just a continued theme. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been here since 1983. I have been through three elections. The one ongoing theme is the lack of Opposition policies. Sure enough, it is the case that the Opposition will come up with advertising slogans. Future Directions is a good example of that. I remind the House-my colleague the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) will be aware of this-that about halfway through last year there was an article in the Bulletin magazine that had Louie the Fly on the front. The article showed a jar of Vegemite and a couple of other things that were evocative of the 1950s. The essence of the article in the Bulletin magazine was that research that had been conducted not only by political party polling organisations but also by a range of other polling organisations indicated a fundamental feeling about moving back to the old days in the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A nostalgia-led recovery, as my colleague so aptly puts it. I said to a couple of my colleagues at that time, `There is no doubt that in the near future this will be translated into Liberal Party policy'. I had occasion late last year to be talking to a group in Canberra and I pointed out the comparisons between the Future Directions policy and that Bulletin article. If I remember correctly, the man who came up with the old Louie the Fly jingle that I remember from my childhood days was the very same gentleman who came up with the Future Directions jingle. So I think there is something to be said about that approach to policy. The honourable member for Wakefield said that it is not up to the Opposition; it is up to the Government. That is as it always will be, but I think Australian electors are now a little more discerning and are not about to be put in a position where they simply respond to a series of assertions with no alternative policy prescription. As I have indicated, that is what the electorate has had to put up with for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have moved off at a slight tangent. I was going to talk tonight about what I consider to be an important issue. It is in some ways related to the contribution of the honourable member for Wakefield in so far as he adverted to a range of taxation measures and to such issues as incentive and so on. I want to talk about the relationship between the current business environment, the nation's future business environment, and a hoary old thing called business ethics. In the recent past I have had occasion to be involved as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in a number of inquiries that are intrinsically related to the business community-for example, the mergers, takeovers, and monopolies inquiry and the insider trading inquiry that is currently getting under way. In the course of that involvement I have been struck by what I consider to be the absolute lack of or, if you like, the devalued concept of, business ethics. In that context there is nothing new. </PARA>
<PARA> A rudimentary understanding of Australian business history will show that there have been periodic booms and in the course of those booms or bull markets Australian business people have got up to all sorts of misbehaviour. Indeed, there are people in this House, whom I will not name, whose inherited wealth is probably largely derived from what I would consider to be inappropriate or at least unethical business behaviour. Be that as it may, the important issue that I want to address tonight is the broad issue of business ethics and what the Government ought to be doing in terms of the legislative framework to regulate business conduct in this country and, on the flip side of the coin, to encourage decent business behaviour, to ensure that small shareholders can invest in companies safe-or as safe as one can reasonably make it-in the knowledge that their investment will not be arbitrarily removed from them via corporate misbehaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> I am talking about trying to establish an overall framework of ethical business behaviour. I can recall the anecdote in the United States of America that if one wanted to be guaranteed of passing a business ethics examination one would simply write down the opposite of what one would do in any business circumstance. That amusing anecdote is probably an important guide in this context. A number of areas are subject to contemporary political debate. They are, for example, in terms of an inquiry by one House of Representatives committee, the use of international tax havens. I would strongly submit that the so-called good corporate citizens of Australian business have a very great deal more to lose by taking the short term advantage of using international tax havens than they will gain over time by applying themselves to the more rigorous business decision making process, the harder decision making process about production, value added, import replacement and export enhancement. They will gain more by following the latter process than they will ever gain by sliding off to some tax haven halfway around the world for the short term benefit of the company from which they derive so many tax advantages and from which they have derived their education. The infrastructure that has nurtured their business does not get a decent return on that particular form of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole raft of areas of business behaviour that I am finding increasingly offensive and increasingly irrelevant in terms of where Australia ought to be going. They encompass, for example, the creative accounting industry in which so many of my colleagues from my university days are now employed. That industry is absolutely unproductive and is inimical to the development of a productive business based culture in this country. I refer to such things as put and call options, of which all honourable members will be aware, and the misuse of those highly technical and in my view quite unethical and unacceptable business practices. I am concerned also about the insider trading area to which I have adverted, which, of course, is the subject of my Committee's inquiry. I am concerned about where this country should be going internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often said by Australian businessmen who are involved in the international area that it is almost impossible to be honest; that one simply cannot win a contract in some countries without slinging money to some crooked intermediary or somehow or other to bribe one's way into a good business outcome. Once again, a long term perspective is probably more important than the short term gain scenario. I believe it is very important for this country to have a reputation just like Qantas Airways Ltd has for safety in flying and good maintenance-a reputation for delivering honest government and business contracts. I believe that in the final analysis that approach would pay clear dividends to the country and to its individual business corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about the whole area of warehousing. It is impossible to review the last few years of Australian business conduct without the practice of warehousing being thrown up. This possibly legal-when one divides it up and approaches it in a certain way-method of going about takeovers is grossly unfair to the ordinary shareholders who are usually represented through institutions, simply because it rips off their savings. The small shareholders are being treated like mugs by some of the smarties who parade as great leaders of business in this country. </PARA>

That practice does enormous damage to our productive sector. We simply cannot go on allowing these people to bask in the glory of successful entrepreneurship simply because people do not understand how they have gone about achieving their wealth. They have done that in many cases by throwing out any productive culture and any creativity other than a creative accounting culture and using the tax system to advance their own interests, often against the interests of ordinary shareholders, whom the Government should be encouraging to participate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, I say that it is very important in my view for this Parliament to embrace the theme of corporate morality and corporate ethics. It is not treated seriously, in my view, in the business sector. In fact, it is treated almost as a laughable concept. Increasingly in an international context it is not only taken up as a serious area of academic inquiry but also, importantly, as a serious area of corporate pursuit. People overseas have learned the lessons that I hope we will begin to learn in this country; that, in the final analysis decent long term planning, a decent corporate morality and approach to business ethics, and a decent productive culture will return more to ordinary shareholders and corporations than any smart alec approach to the corporate sector. </PARA>

In practice, the Minister does not vary the plan until the variation and public comment on the variation have been considered and reported on by the Joint Subcommittee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This report covers variation 1988-5 which relates to a road addition and deletion in the Gold Creek tourist area in Gungahlin. At present there are a number of tourist facilities at Gold Creek, which have grown around a group of historic buildings, and include a model village, a craft shop, an inn and an art gallery. The area surrounding this existing nucleus of tourist facilities has the potential for the development of a range of tourist oriented uses such as art and craft studios, an equestrian centre or a country town main street. The Joint Subcommittee held a public hearing on the proposal on 24 February 1989 at which officers of the ACT Administration, including the interim Territory Planning Authority, gave evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this variation is to provide access to land to the north west of the existing Ginninderra Village. The proposal entails the deletion from the city plan of part of O'Hanlon Place and the addition of a road which will provide access to the land north-west of the existing Ginninderra Village. The Joint Subcommittee was informed that the proposal is to construct a connection onto the Barton Highway and then build a parallel road to the highway which connects into O'Hanlon Place, the small cul de sac off Gold Creek Road. According to ACT Administration, the layout of the road will enable later expansion into the rest of the Gold Creek tourist area. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT Administration intends to stage development. The first stage will provide the Barton Highway junction and a road and services to connect to a service station. The Committee was told that as further sites are needed the road will be extended at that time in a second stage, eventually connecting to O'Hanlon Place. We were concerned to ensure that the location of the road entrance was the most appropriate both from a safety and future development perspective. The Joint Subcommittee is satisfied that the explanation of the ACT Administration about the location of the road takes account of both safety and land access requirements. We also recognise the value of the collocation of tourist facilities in the Gold Creek area. Therefore, the Joint Subcommittee approves variation 1988-5. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the honourable member for Fraser agrees with me. I wish to make two points relating to the report which has just been presented which deals with some very minor alterations in the Gold Creek area. Firstly, there is a need for the accuracy of the administrative instruments flowing from the report to be adhered to so that there is not a repetition of a previous exercise when a new set of documents, a new set of regulations, was required for the alteration of the United States Embassy fence. The whole process had to be repeated at great expense. That came about through administrative error and it was admitted by witnesses of the relevant Federal department-relevant public servants-in evidence before the Committee last year. Their homework at the time was sloppy. I am sure that that will not be repeated because they learnt their lesson the hard way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I remain quite angry that it cost several thousand dollars-as I recall it, that was the amount admitted to-in terms of administrative errors, for some very minor alterations to facilitate the upgrading of the United States Embassy's security fence. At the time I felt that we could have contemplated deducting the amount from the pay of the officer in question. However, that approach received some criticism from the honourable member for Fraser. Certainly, in the real world, in private enterprise, someone would have had to face the music for that error. I hope that the administrative instruments associated with the report which has been presented to the national Parliament tonight, on a minor road alteration in a section of this national capital, not even in the city proper, will be attended to with efficiency and great accuracy. Secondly, we do not object to the fundamentals of the report. However, in closing let me say again that I hope the crazy system that exists will soon be supplanted by a better one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this rather late hour of the evening I take the opportunity, briefly, to address the Appropriation Bills being debated cognately. A colleague who was scheduled to speak at this time sought my cooperation to stand in for him because a circumstance arose which prevented him from being here. So with that unexpected opportunity I now proceed to address matters of great consequence as I am mindful that in some 20 hours-plus the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will make a statement to the Parliament and, by extension, the nation which, presumably, will have some important bearing on the state of affairs in this country. I would not presume to anticipate all that he may have to say, but it has been widely canvassed that the package will devolve on a wage increase and a tax reduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say again, as I have said on a number of occasions in this House over the years, that I am utterly confounded at the inability of the work force, loosely described, to recognise that not only does it fail to derive benefit from a salary increase, in fact it suffers an adverse consequence. The simple fact is that, taking a notional increase-say, in hypothesis, $10 a week-after taxation, sundry deductions, Medicare and perhaps superannuation, people will be fortunate if they take home $5. But the $10 compounded will go into every solitary item people purchase. So they will not have caught up: they will have actually gone backwards. To compound the matter in the broad-and it affects all Australians-it has a decidedly inflationary effect. Clearly, there would be a significant benefit if any advantage passed through to the work force-again, I emphasise that I use the term `work force' loosely-rested in taxation deductions because instantly there would be a deflationary effect. It would give a real benefit to the recipient, the worker. There would not be an inflationary factor. Indeed, the only problem attaching to that is that it would give the people of Australia a capacity to spend more and that could further exacerbate the problem with which we are currently confronted-too high a liquidity, reflected in turn in excessive imports and a trade imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA> But here tomorrow night it appears that we will again witness the extraordinary paradox where a government elected to govern in the interests of Australia feels itself bound to accommodate the expectations and demands of what we might call a surrogate government-that is, the trade union movement-in an objective which does not serve those whom the trade union movement notionally represents. I wonder how long we must go on before the truth of this proposition descends on the people of Australia-the workers of Australia-to ensure that they do not any longer go about compounding their difficulties and the difficulties of Australia. It seems to be a continuing exercise in futility and I lament that circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> One might speak about a number of things in this wide-ranging appropriation debate. Let me just snatch at a few things. Today we discussed in part the problem of the acquisition of Australian land and assets by foreigners and, more to the point, by the Japanese. Arguments have been advanced by honourable members on both sides of the House that this practice should be endorsed and accepted as being in the best interests of Australia and our economy. Unequivocal statements have been made by both the Treasurer and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), that there should be no intervention on the part of either group and the Parliament as a whole in that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> A sad message is contained within that. I hasten to say that I understand exactly the rationale of their respective positions. But what it really boils down to is that Australia may have won the war but we unquestionably have lost the peace. This comes about simply because we have elected to loaf in the sun and to delude ourselves into believing that, somehow or other, we are masters of our own destiny whereas we are at the mercy of the global marketplace and we have to measure up with the right article and the right price at the right time. If we fail to compete we lose the ability to accommodate the expectations of our society. Those expectations have become far removed from reality. </PARA>
<PARA> We are presently beset with protestations that the young people of Australia in particular are being denied their entitlement in so far as there is an inability to purchase or finance their first homes because of the increasing cost of real estate, extortionate interest rates and associated reasons. But the objections are predicated on the proposition that they have a right to have a first new home. I must admit that, in the passage of my lifetime, I can recall the pinnacle of ambition of a young couple marrying being to find a nice little home to rent and, if they found it, they were in paradise. </PARA>
<PARA> By the slow progress of familiarisation with the good times we have come to a stage where we confuse expectation with entitlement or vice versa. This Parliament is now subject to most insistent claims that we must assert ourselves to accommodate the expectations of our people. There is only one way we can accommodate the expectations of our people-that is, to earn the wherewithal to meet the cost of such accommodation. We have an increasing national debt, our trade balances increasingly are adverse, yet we go on believing that somehow we can ignore the harsh reality of these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> Because we ignore the realities we find that we are virtually impotent to do anything about the purchase of Australian assets and land in particular by nationals of other countries. Some will say that that has been Australia's history. There has been a continuing history of land and asset acquisition by the British, the Americans, the New Zealanders and the Japanese. But that is not strictly true. When we ponder the matter we cannot say that the British were foreigners. We were British. Believe it or not there was a time when Prime Minister Menzies described himself as `British to the bootlaces'. Nobody took offence because that was a fair assessment of the character of Australia. So British investment was not foreign investment. The Americans also were benign, if at times slightly jarring, good friends. </PARA>
<PARA> But because of the war the Japanese moved into a different category altogether. It was not just because we were militarily opposed-we were allies in the war before that-but because there is such a conflict in cultures and because many Australians in our defence forces and in the broader society were subject to behaviour which we regard as inexcusable. So it is a tall order to expect Australians to adapt instantly to the notion that their land must be surrendered to non-Australians. But the bitter pill to swallow is that we have nobody to blame for that circumstance but ourselves because we have let the world go by. We have allowed Japan to ascend to a position where it is one of the richest nations on the earth. And it will not stop there. </PARA>
<PARA> The Republic of South Korea will be a creditor by 1991, demonstrating a capacity to invest in Australia or anywhere in the world. Buy the place up; that is business. Following South Korea is China. We know the opportunities South Korea has seized from Japan and other nations by its industry, its cheap labour and its prowess. But South Korea will be undersold by the emerging China. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly the way it will go. So no responsible person should delude himself that we do not have to bother; that we can just sit and wait for it all to descend upon us. It has not and it will not. Until we recognise the reality of our circumstances and stop beating around the bush, there is no way in the world that we will resolve the problems with which we are confronted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could ask: What is the prospect of resolving the problem when within this House there is a substantial division of opinion as to who is responsible, what the nature of the problem is, and who will fix it? People outside this Parliament listening to the debate and reading the press would have no confidence in anybody to fix it because the way in which we present ourselves and the way in which we conduct ourselves would suggest strongly that we are irresponsible fools. I cannot accept that. Come this May I will have been in this Parliament for 15 years and I know that there is considerable talent on both sides of this House. But somehow or other the Parliament is not selling itself to the electorate in a real and honest way. Unless we do that we cannot get the confidence of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate must have confidence in this Parliament to permit it to do the things essential to the restoration of the good health of the nation. Because of our failure to spell out loudly and clearly the nature of our problems, the electorate has been lulled into believing that all will be well and the problems will be resolved within the parameters of conventionality. We are not within conventional parameters. Australia is facing unprecedented problems and it will require the collective talents of all those within this House and the willing acceptance of the electorate to cope with that which must be inflicted-and I use the word advisedly-upon them to ensure longer term improvement of their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this week and in the course of this debate the financing of roads has been mentioned. Anybody with the slightest familiarity with Australia must instantly recognise the need for road funding. We have a vast country. Road communications are critical to our social development and our economic advancement, but it is also quite clear that the resources of the nation fall far short of the requirement to attain standards in road transport or to facilitate communications commensurate with our desire and our need. Half the population of Australia lives in Sydney and Melbourne. The need for road services in the cities is huge. It could well mop up the entire road funding. On a flyover in Los Angeles a few months ago I found that I was in a compact road network of six vertical levels of road. Can honourable members imagine the cost involved in that?</PARA>
<PARA> We say to the government of the day that we need more money for roads. I have no hesitation in saying that I would increase the proportion of our resources going to roads; I consider them that important. But only a fool would venture to say how much we should provide in dollar terms a year hence or two years hence because one does not know what is in the kitty. As an article of faith we should say that we will give it a higher priority; that whatever we have, it will get a higher proportion of a larger slice. Whatever we give will not meet the requirement. If people are insistent on more money for roads, with our limited resources it must necessarily follow that there are only two ways the wherewithal to meet that requirement can be found-through increased taxation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House for its forbearance to allow me to spend a few more moments to round off my remarks rather than delay the whole procedure tomorrow. The House and I can now sleep with greater peace of mind than might be the case otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was just about to say that it stands to reason that if we have an expectation of government finance to improve our road system-there is no limit to the amount that could be required and usefully applied-the wherewithal can only be provided by an increase in revenue, an increase in taxation, or the Government retreating from an area of current expenditure which will make the money available for roads. </PARA>
<PARA> It does seem to me something of a nonsense just to continue bleating for more money for any particular area of government responsibility or expenditure without taking heed of the simple truth that money does not grow on trees. There is no money lying around the place. Great store is put on the amount of revenue derived from the motorist in fuel tax. That is a statistical fact that one cannot deny, but to suggest that all the money should go back to roads or to accommodate the expectations of the motorists would raise the question as to whether we should spend the taxation on cigarettes to make mortuaries more comfortable so that smokers who die as a consequence of smoking will find their exit more comfortable. Or should the tax on beer be spent to extend drinking hours or lengthen the bars?</PARA>
<PARA> I am being just a little flippant, but the point is that it is a revenue grab to meet the total commitments of the government of the day. So if society is insistent on more money being spent in a particular area, it should indicate its preparedness to go without in another area or, perish the thought, say, `Let us have a taxation increase'. </PARA>
<PARA> May I just say on taxation that I lament the performance of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) today when, by skillful use of statistics, he demonstrated that this Government had a smaller percentage of outlays than any previous government. That again was a statistical fact. It was a smaller percentage but measured against the tax grab-the extraordinary revenue intake from increasing taxation by bracket creep and what have you-the percentage meant more dollars towards expenditure and outlays. So the percentage figure was totally misleading. That is fairly typical of the way we carry on here. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say again that there are great expectations out in the electorate getting tattered around the edges, as evidenced by more support than normal for fringe political groups, for those of the pseudo independent character. That in itself must be seen for what it is-an expression of disenchantment. I cannot for one moment allow these people, who no doubt are well intended, the likelihood or possibility of their being able to achieve that which has thus far alluded us. </PARA>
<PARA> It rests with us to do the job. The first requirement is to come clean with members of the electorate, to give them the facts of the matter. They are not getting those facts because it is not within the capacity, I venture to say, of any government in a conventional mode to resolve the problems of this country. As I have said, perhaps at the risk of being considered a heretic, traditionally we find governments hesitant about giving the facts to the country because of the electoral consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if I can put it in analogous terms, if the Government were to endeavour to convince the electorate that it was afflicted with cancer and that it was necessary to slit its belly from side to side to extract the malignancy and make the electorate well, we would almost certainly find the opposition of the day, whoever it might be, if not asserting, at least implying, that it could cure the cancer by rubbing ointment on the elbow. The patient would suffer the consequences. Perhaps I am demonstrating just a little unreality. Historically we seem committed to pursuing our own objectives and our country often suffers as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in this House before that parliamentarians fall short of that which we expect of them simply because they will insist on behaving just like people. They warp logic and the reason of their own desire and have a preoccupation with the next election while the next generation goes down the drain. I know that we are cursed with our personal ambitions. Who is to say who is right and who is wrong? But I am saying categorically and positively that there is no evidence thus far to suggest that the course on which we have embarked and on which we persist will take this country to a position which could be seen fairly as consistent with that which we would wish for it. I thank the House again for giving me the opportunity to conclude my remarks. I trust that I have not disturbed it unduly with my rather revolutionary comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been no recent scandal in Australian public life that has captured the attention of our media and the public at large more than has the collapse of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia. That division was principally located within my electorate at the West Sale airfield, although it did have bases stretching as far north as Darwin and at a number of ports in between. Some 260 of the 450 employees of the National Safety Council of Australia, Victorian Division, were located at Sale. Needless to say, in all the raging public debate about what has happened, the personal suffering of the 260 employees and their families has been largely forgotten. My task tonight is to remind the House of the suffering that has been imposed on a number of very dedicated and very good people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing that has been forgotten is that the National Safety Council did perform a great many worthwhile functions. Indeed, I have with me a computer print-out of some 450 missions that the National Safety Council performed in the last 12 months, many of which saved human lives. My concern is that now the Victorian division has been wound up a number of Australian lives are at risk. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that Australian lives will be lost because the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council no longer exists. People forget the range of functions that the National Safety Council performed and also forget that it was made up, in certain areas, of the best trained specialists not only in Australia but arguably in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In the little time available to me, let me very quickly go through some of the functions that were performed by the National Safety Council that will now fall onto other shoulders and will probably not be performed to the same level of excellence. In brief, in search and rescue the National Safety Council had twin engine, all weather helicopters fitted with the most sophisticated equipment. There were twin engine, all weather, fixed wing aircraft. There was operational coordination and ancillary equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look now at fire fighting. South-eastern Australia is considered by most experts to be one of the most fire prone areas of the world. In brief, the National Safety Council had 15 fire bombing helicopters, again with very sophisticated equipment. There were fire mapping procedures. There was logistic support. In the area of medicine, four National Safety Council doctors who formed an integral part of the organisation were on call 24 hours a day. Those doctors participated in para-rescue training, enabling them to be dropped into any area to give extra medical support to the initial rescue team. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Safety Council provided helicopter ambulances throughout south-eastern Victoria. There was also hyperbaric transport. Divers throughout Australia are seriously at risk without the hyperbaric facilities provided by the National Safety Council. Many training programs were undertaken by the National Safety Council which assisted other search and rescue training organisations. It assisted firefighting organisations such as the State Electricity Commission and the Country Fire Authority as well as offshore personnel. The National Safety Council provided 24-hour industrial emergency services. There was coverage for 365 days a year of rescue, fire and first aid services for personnel in the La Trobe Valley power stations. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to pay tribute to the dedicated people of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council. Now that that organisation appears to have been scattered to the four winds and the ground it once occupied ploughed, I very much fear that Australian lives will be lost. The level of services that the Council once provided in a unique way simply cannot be duplicated. The tragedy of the collapse of the National Safety Council is that Australian lives will be lost. What was once one of the world's leading safety organisations no longer exists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to speak tonight about a matter that has been raised with me by many electors in my area, the price of beer in Perth. What is in question is the pricing structure used by Bond Brewing and Carlton and United Breweries Ltd. For a carton of two dozen 375-millilitre cans of Tooheys Draught purchased from the Coles Liquorland chain in Sydney one will pay $18.99. I make the following comparison because Bond Brewing produces that product in New South Wales. Bond Brewing also produces a product in Western Australia, Emu Export lager, or Swan Premium lager. So there is no transport cost differential in both markets. One would pay $22.59 in Perth for Bond Brewing's local product compared with $18.99 in Sydney. In other words, there is a $3.60 difference in the price per carton asked by the Liquorland chain in Sydney and Perth. In effect, people who choose to drink Bond Brewing beer in Perth, the local product, are being charged, unnecessarily, an extra $3.60 per carton. Honourable members should bear in mind that there is no differential in transport costs because both beers are produced locally in the two markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is even more alarming-I find this interesting-is that if one chooses to buy the Bond Brewing products Emu Export lager or Swan Premium lager in Canberra, one will pay $19.99 a carton. It has been shipped all the way from Western Australia, but one pays only $19.99 a carton. That is cheaper than the product in Western Australia, where one pays $22.59. In other words the product is $2.60 a carton cheaper in Canberra than it is in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> How does Bond Brewing justify that price differential? Clearly, there is a problem that we have to address. It is also very disturbing that the price, in metropolitan Perth, of a two-dozen carton of 375-millilitre cans of Fosters lager, is $22.59, which happens to be identical to the price being charged by Bond Brewing. I ask people to draw their own conclusions. One could draw many conclusions, but one very clear conclusion is that there is no price competition. That is a matter in which the Trade Practices Commission would be interested. There is no effective price competition. This matter deserves further investigation because people in Western Australia are being disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do we have no competition but also we have an unjustified price differential. People in Western Australia are paying $2.60 a carton more than people in Sydney pay for a similar product shipped right across Australia. What is also very telling is that a locally produced product in New South Wales, Tooheys Draught, costs $18.99 at Liquorland, yet the comparable locally produced product in Western Australia, Swan Premium or Emu Export, is $22.59 a carton. There is a $3.60 difference in price. It is up to the brewer, in this case Bond Brewing, to justify that. Many of my constituents have said that they do not believe it is justified. I can see no justification for it whatsoever. What is also worrying is the price difference between the Carlton and United product in Western Australia and the Bond Brewing product. As I have said, there is no effective price competition. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes a national comparison, State by State, one finds that the price of beer depends upon the market. If one looks at the Brisbane market, where Power Brewing is providing effective competition with Fourex, one finds that much lower prices are being charged by the Fourex brewery compared with what it would charge in Western Australia. A carton of Fourex in Brisbane costs $19.82 compared with, again, $22.59 for the product in Western Australia. There is no justification for it. When one looks at such price structures one sees no evidence of price competition. There is clear evidence that there is an attempt to arrange a market structure which certainly disadvantages ordinary people. It is clearly not the intention of this Government that that sort of non-price competition should be occurring. In effect, there is an absence of price competition. Drinkers in Western Australia are being asked to pay a premium over and above what they would pay if they were drinking similar Bond Brewing products in New South Wales or Canberra. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to extend my earlier remarks regarding the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA). In the days before the provisional liquidator finally found it necessary to close the doors on the West Sale base of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council I spent a considerable time with its employees and their families. One occasion which will be forever remembered by me was a quickly called together barbecue on the Wednesday night prior to the Friday afternoon closing which was attended by almost all of the 260 employees and many of their families. It was obviously something of a wake, but at the same time it was a demonstration of the spirit and determination, even courage, of the employees as they awaited their inevitable fate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What one has to understand about the employees of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council is the dignity and strength they showed as public controversy raged around them throughout Easter and the following week. There was never any damage on the base or any theft, despite the fact that some of the pilots are owed more than $50,000 in unpaid leave and superannuation. Almost everybody on the base will suffer considerably regarding wages owing to them. It was a measure of their pride in their work that, in that final week they were able to continue rescue missions and, in some cases-it was universally agreed-save some lives. </PARA>
<PARA> These people are now in a state of despair. Many of them moved to Sale to join the NSCA, some of them as recently as the last couple of months. They left, for instance, secure positions in the armed forces or the police forces. Some of them were pilots, some operational officers. Some were near pension time, but they left to take what they thought were positions with Australia's premier search and rescue organisation. Some of them cannot afford to remain in the Gippsland area. They will have to leave and seek work elsewhere. A number of them will not be able to find work. Some of the pilots will be able to find work, but many of the specialist operational rescue people simply will not be able to. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a tribute to them that throughout the time between the public collapse of the Victorian Division and the final winding up they were able to carry out their duties. All of them left the base for the last time with their heads held high. They pose the same question I pose to State and Federal governments: What organisation, what personnel, will replace them? It was the National Safety Council of Australia that specialised in off-shore search and rescue; hyperbaric medicine and services; aerial water firefighting; helicopter underwater escape training; remote sensing; helicopter ambulance and industrial emergency services. Let us take, for example, a maritime collision somewhere in Bass Strait, or anywhere in Australia for that matter. Who could respond to such an emergency? The Royal Australian Air Force, itself, states that it cannot respond in under less than an hour, and possibly three hours, because it cannot assemble the crews. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a shortage of pilots and it does not have the equipment. Its aircraft would be either the Hercules at the Richmond base, or the Orions at Edinburgh in South Australia. If there were a maritime collision in Bass Strait, for instance, a maritime route which experiences very heavy traffic, who would get there? What helicopters would have the winch equipment? The Esso helicopters would, but they would have to be specially fitted out and a crew assembled, so the response time now throughout Australia for emergencies, in some cases, will be greatly lengthened. That puts at risk a great many lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is imperative that the Federal Government, through the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), very closely examine the whole problem of what, or who, replaces the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia. I very much fear that not nearly enough attention has been given to this aspect of that Council's collapse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say that the Women's Safe Harbour is the only group in Australia which happens to acknowledge that alcoholic women can be rehabilitated within society. The refuge is the work of two very excellent women whom I have admired for quite some time. Those women are Norma O'Connor and Robyn Mason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Norma O'Connor was an alcoholic and is now a sober alcoholic. She has been sober for 11 years. Her sobriety should be acknowledged by this House. She joined Alcoholics Anonymous on being urged to do so by her young son, who was killed by a drunk driver three years after she joined AA. In anybody's language, this would have driven anyone back to drink, but it did not have this effect on Norma. She pursued, and worked for, the rights of alcoholic women to live and to work with their children. She believes that those women who acknowledge their alcoholism, who work through the detoxification unit, and who then are willing to become sober alcoholic women in the community, have only one thing to live for-their children. </PARA>
<PARA> With Robyn Mason, another ex-alcoholic, Norma O'Connor established the refuge for alcoholic women in our community, called Safe Harbour. This refuge provides and has provided for, large numbers of women and their children within the Queensland and Brisbane community. It is the only refuge of its kind in Australia, because, as honourable members know, alcoholic women are usually isolated from the community. Many people here know that alcoholic men normally have their wives to look after them. Let me tell this House that alcoholic women never have their husbands to look after them and they never have their families. In Australian society, alcoholic women are totally isolated from the rest of the community. Safe Harbour acknowledges this fact, but more importantly, it acknowledges that alcoholic women need their children for their rehabilitation. Safe Harbour has been so successful in the rehabilitation of alcoholic women, that it has drawn large numbers of people within the field from both America and the United Kingdom. It is the only refuge in Australia which is prepared to acknowledge that alcoholic women need their children, need to work and need to successfully rehabilitate within the community. Safe Harbour has been successful to the point where only two women who have been through it have returned to their alcoholism. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the work of not only Norma and Robyn but also the committee as a whole. I urge this House to look upon the work which has been done by the Safe Har-bour Refuge for alcoholic women and their children. This is a milestone within Australia and in the rehabilitation of women. It is also a milestone in the world context. It has been acknowledged by the world community as a method by which alcoholic women may be and are rehabilitated within the community. We see here a group of women who were previously dependent upon alcohol who have become, through their own work and through the support of the Safe Harbour Refuge and Alcoholics Anonymous, which works through the Safe Harbour organisation, independent human beings who are able to provide for themselves and their children a worthwhile and meaningful life, free of the dependency not only of alcohol but also of the government system. I urge that all members of the community support such groups as Safe Harbour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the honourable member for Throsby does not support the capitalist system, nor does the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) who is at the table. I heard the speech made by the honourable member for Streeton (Mr Lamb) earlier tonight and his damning of the capitalist system. I am collecting quite a lot of these quotes; they will certainly make very interesting reading during the next election campaign. The genius of capitalism is competition. The Labor Party, when it suits it, talks about the need for competition. When it does not suit it it talks about the need to maintain monopolies. It is like a lot of its public sector monopolies and it does not believe that competition will work there. Apparently the honourable member for Stirling thinks that somehow competition will work in the beer market. On that point he is absolutely right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The instrument that this Parliament has established to ensure that we have competitive markets is the Trade Practices Act and its handmaiden the Trade Practices Commission. What is interesting is the way this Government has treated the Commission with such disdain. Over the period of this Government, public sector spending in real terms has increased by 24 per cent, yet outlays on the Trade Practices Commission have declined by 7 per cent. That is a measure of the seriousness that this Government attributes to the Trade Practices Commission. That Commission needs the resources to ensure that we have a proper competitive marketplace in Australia. When we come to government we will make sure that works properly. </PARA>
