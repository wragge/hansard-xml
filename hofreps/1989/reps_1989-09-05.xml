<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Vice-Admiral Sir John Collins, the first Chief of the Naval Staff, died in St Luke's Hospital in Sydney on the evening of Sunday, 3 September, following a short illness. His distinguished naval career culminated in appointment to the position of First Naval Member of the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board and Chief of the Naval Staff from February 1947 until his retirement in February 1955. His naval career commenced at the Royal Australian Navy College, Geelong, in 1913. He saw war service in both the First World War and the Second World War and was awarded the Companion of the Order of the Bath following a major naval action in the Mediterranean while in command of HMAS Sydney. Following his retirement from the Navy he was High Commissioner to New Zealand from 1956 to 1962. A naval funeral will be held at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney, on Friday, 8 September. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia I convey to his relatives our sincere condolences.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for drawing the death of Sir John Collins to the notice of the House and to the people of Australia. Vice-Admiral Sir John Collins was a most distinguished Australian, the first Australian to become the Chief of the Naval Staff, a record of service to Australia through the Navy ran-ging from 1913 until 1955, service in both world wars, and service to Australia, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, as High Commissioner in New Zealand. His career was as outstanding as his contribution to this nation. He gave unstintingly of himself for his country and we join the Prime Minister in extending sympathy to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) and members of the National Party I seek your indulgence to also extend my condolences to Lady Collins and their daughter. Sir John Collins' death really marks the end of an era. He was one of those Australians who joined the Navy almost when the Royal Australian Navy began. He was educated, like so many of those naval officers of the period, largely in the United Kingdom, but his service brought great tribute, not just to the Australian Navy but to Australia itself. He was a remarkable man. I met him on a number of occasions at Defence Force functions and I found him a person who really brought together a great deal of experience as a fighting sailor and as a peacetime sailor. He has really reflected the best of the traditions of the senior service and I know that all of those who served with him would share in the message that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) are extending to his widow and his daughter today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Royal Australian Navy has, since the days when the late Sir John Collins joined it, established its own traditions and those traditions of course are now more and more becoming part of an integrated Australian Defence Force. But none of that in any way reflects the fact that during World War II it was men like Sir John Collins who contri-buted so much to enable the Allied cause to defeat that of the Nazis and the Japanese during the 1939 to 1945 period. On behalf of the members of the National Party I join in the message of condolence to Lady Collins and their daughter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I very much appreciate the remarks that have been made about Sir John Collins. It is a very sad day for the Australian Navy. One cannot have been a Defence Minister of this country without having had drawn to one's attention at some time, indeed frequently, by serving members of the Royal Australian Navy, particularly among its senior ranks, what a figure they regarded Sir John Collins to be. He was very much seen as a man who was in on the creation of the Royal Australian Navy, very much a man setting traditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think one or two things ought to be said about his war record and the period immediately after that. At the outbreak of World War II he was Assistant Chief of Staff and Director of Naval Intelligence at Navy Office, Melbourne. In November 1939 he began his command of HMAS Sydney, which played a significant part in operations against the Italian fleet in the Mediterranean in 1940. Here we come to an action which I guess every Australian has come across in readings of World War II history. In the most spectacular action of the Sydney's Mediterranean deployment, she sank the Italian light cruiser Bartolomeo Colleoni and forced the Giovanni delle Bande Nere to retreat. For this the then Captain Collins was awarded the Companion of the Order of the Bath. In June 1940 he was appointed Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, China. By 1942 he was commanding the British Far Eastern Squadron, which was responsible for escorting convoys through the Dutch East Indies and Malaya during the Japanese offensive. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1943 he commanded the cruiser Shropshire during its Pacific operations. By June 1944 he was given command of the Australian squadron operating with the United States Navy Seventh Fleet. He was seriously wounded during the Allied landings in the Philippines in October 1944. For his service in the South West Pacific the US Government conferred on him the Legion of Merit. In August 1945 as Australia's naval representative he attended the surrender of Japan aboard the USS Missouri. On 7 January 1947 Commodore Collins, along with Commodore Farncomb, was appointed a rear admiral. They were the first graduates of the Royal Australian Naval College to attain the flag rank. On 24 February 1948 Rear Admiral Collins was appointed First Naval Member of the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board and Chief of the Naval Staff, a position he held until 1955. </PARA>
<PARA> At about the time Sir John Collins joined the Royal Australian Navy we had only just concluded a decade's debate in this country on whether or not Australians were fit to command ships or whether they ought to provide simply the seamen to essentially a British-commanded squadron; and, when found fit to command ships, whether or not they ought to be commanding them in discrete Australian squadrons or as part of the British Far East Fleet. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggested that senior figures in the Royal Australian Navy today see Sir John Collins as being very much a man in on the creation, the foundation, of the real Royal Australian Navy. From the record I read out I think honourable members will see why they would so regard him. His death is appropriately recognised in this chamber, and I join in expressing condolences to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister and I ask: Has any attempt been made by the Government to ascertain whether the pilots, who have now indicated that they are prepared to negotiate, would also be prepared to return to work under pre-existing terms and conditions while negotiations take place?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="912" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question by the Leader of the Opposition continues the totally unfortunate incapacity he has displayed to understand the essential nature of this dispute. The fact is that in regard to the employers and their former employees, the union has no place in that position. What they do not understand, and what they will not face up to, is that there is a situation now where the employees who were engaged in and members of the union have undertaken in this country the pursuit of the industrial relations policy of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand, Mr Speaker, and it is not surprising, that the Leader of the Opposition took a ballocking in his party room this morning on his handling of the dispute. No wonder! No wonder his spokesman from the party room would not hold his press conference, because his own members in his party room gave him the ballocking he deserves. I join with them in the concern they expressed at the Leader of the Opposition's ineptitude. It is an ineptitude founded on ignorance. The fact is that the pilots have been following the industrial relations policy of the Opposition: that is, opt out of the system and then, having opted out, they are saying to the Government, `Now, you solve the dispute'. Can you imagine anything more ridiculous?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we on this side of the House are not bound by their insanities. What we have been doing is dealing with the situation as it is. What have we been doing? We have been doing these things. Firstly, we have been encouraging the employers in question to negotiate in the only way they can. They have no employees, so they are talking to their ex-employees, and what they are doing, assiduously and with a mounting degree of success, is signing contracts with individual former employees. Opposition members should not be worried about that. That is the sort of thing that flows from their policy, and, as the days go on, so will more of the former employees, who put themselves outside of the system, sign up and within a relatively short time the two domestic airlines will be flying aircraft in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA> But, while that is happening, we have done everything we possibly can in two ways. Firstly, we have provided the facilities of the Royal Australian Air Force, which facilities are being gratefully used by those members of the public who can get access to them. Secondly, we have taken steps to accelerate the availability of both aircraft and pilots from overseas. These are the things which a government can do in these circumstances. I notice that there is some report in today's media that Mr-because he can no longer be `Captain'; he is no longer an employee-McCarthy is making noises. His captaincy does not carry on with him after he has left employment. Mr McCarthy, I understand, is making some noises about what the pilots would like to do. It is quite clear what they can do. They can make up their minds that their previous stance is, as it is, totally unacceptable, not only to their employers, to the Government and to the Commission, but also to the Australian people. If Opposition members want to go on identifying themselves, as they have continuously, with the pilots, all I can say is, `Good luck to you; you keep on doing it'-because the Australian people are saying that they will not condone a situation where an already highly paid group of people is holding the Australian community to ransom to get an increase, which increase is equal to the average salary of the ordinary Australian person.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government stands ready to do all it can to resolve this. There is no more that we could have done. What I am saying is that the airlines are doing the right thing now in trying to sign up these pilots and, as each day goes on, more of their former employees will be signing up, and, as I say, there will be additions to those services already there, which additions will constitute the actual flights by aircraft of the two domestic airlines.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Will the Minister for Housing and Aged Care inform the House of the action the Government is taking in response to the recent decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT) concerning the fees paid to pharmacists under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS)?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="913" SPEAKER="Staples The Hon P.R." NAMEID="KJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="JAGAJAGA" MINISTERIAL="HOUSING AND AGED CARE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government recognises that the PBRT's decision cannot be overthrown by the Government, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia or any other body. The Tribunal was set up in 1981 by the now Opposition, the Liberal and National parties, and the honourable member for Warringah-the Minister for Health at the time-told this House on 29 April 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, it will remove from the political arena the question of the level of fees paid to chemists for the dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits. Both the chemists and the Government will be bound by the tribunal's decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the situation, but it appears that again there has been a conflict of policy within the Opposition, and that it wants to overturn that. Last week when I met with representatives of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and other bodies, I raised with them the PBRT's decision. I also indicated to them that, apart from the decision on the dispensing fee, the Tribunal made two major recommendations which the Government wants to talk about with the Guild and other bodies. These are primarily to ensure the maintenance of essential and isolated pharmacy services through the essential pharmacy allowance. If honourable members opposite were really serious about pharmaceutical services in their electorates-particularly those in rural areas-I would hope that they would be encouraging pharmacists to talk to the Government about this matter. But they are encouraging pharmacists to close. I would hope that they would take a responsible line and encourage pharmacists to talk with the Government about this important matter.</PARA>
<PARA> We also want to talk with the Guild about an inquiry into the restructuring of the pharmaceutical industry and, very importantly, to discuss the professional role of pharmacy in the community. The Government is committed to ensuring that all Australians continue to have access to pharmaceuticals under the PBS. We are still awaiting the Guild's response to the Government offer to discuss these recommendations. There are a number of questions which need a serious answer from the Guild. Firstly, why would the Pharmacy Guild urge its members to close their doors on the public while the Government's doors remain open for discussion? We have made the offer; so far it has not been taken seriously.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government wants to look at ways in which it can deal with other issues in terms of pharmacy remuneration in areas that have not been dealt with before, particularly in the area of the professional role of pharmacy in the community as a health care provider. Why is the leadership of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia continuing to delude and inflame its pharmacists into thinking that the PBRT decision can be overturned?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the umpire's decision, as it has in the past, even when decisions have gone against it. The Guild today, and members of the Opposition, are running the line that the Government did not accept the Tribunal's decision in the twelfth inquiry. The fact is that it was not the Government but the Guild that challenged the PBRT's decision in the Federal Court. The Federal Court initially supported the Guild's challenge. The Government is appealing against the Federal Court decision-not challenging the PBRT decision.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1981, when the Liberals set up the PBRT, the pharmacists had not had a rise since 1977. The history of the PBS and remuneration shows that there has been continual friction and hostility on the issue of remuneration. That is why this legislation is like it is. But the bottom line is protecting people's access to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, and that is the Government's commitment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Prime Minister. In view of the announcement that the pilots are willing to negotiate with the airlines on a productivity basis, has the Government, as the owner of Australian Airlines, given any direction or conveyed any attitudes to the airline about commencing negotiations with the pilots?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="914" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the existing guidelines the capacity has always existed for the pilots to pursue negotiations involving productivity within the system. That capacity has always been there. It is being used by other organisations within the system. In this country one does not have to have some special arrangement, some direction from government to one of its enterprises, to enable a situation whereby a group of employees through its union can successfully negotiate on a productivity basis. You simply get driven back to your anomaly, to your paradox, to your dilemma. The Opposition is saying to individual organisations quite consistently in this matter, `Reject the system'-a system which provides the opportunity for negotiation about productivity increases which can be negotiated by employers and unions within the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A strategically placed organisation-the pilots organisation-has said, `We will adopt the Opposition policy. We will opt out of that system which provides the opportunity for productivity negotiations. We will opt out and hold the community to ransom'. The Opposition is saying, in regard to that system, `That's right. Let them opt out'. When they have opted out, the supreme paradox is that the Opposition now says to the Government, `They are following our policy; you should hop into them and resolve the dispute'. The simple, inescapable facts are these: if the pilots previously employed by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines want to negotiate with their employers about any claim for an increase in remuneration, an increase based upon possible increases in productivity, the system is there for it to be done. Every other organisation in the country uses it and is prepared to use it, but this organisation of pilots is not prepared to do what everyone else is prepared to do. The Opposition encourages them and condones their action. As far as Australian Airlines is concerned, we are totally satisfied with the way in which that independent body is conducting itself in this dispute.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question addressed to me by the honourable gentleman is indeed a question of fundamental importance. The honourable gentleman will know, by way of background to the specific answer I will give him, that the attitude of my Government from day one has been that we want to see a peaceful resolution of the tragedy in South Africa. We want nothing more or less than a situation in which each citizen of South Africa, in a totally free and democratic framework, will have the right to vote and be a full participant in the determination of his or her destiny. We have done everything that we possibly can within the Commonwealth and outside it to plead with the Government, with successive regimes in South Africa, to go to the negotiating table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Along with others in the Commonwealth, we have taken a lead, where there has been a refusal to follow that course, to try to use sanctions, not as an end in themselves but as an instrument to get the regime in South Africa to the negotiating table. In that, we have fortunately been joined by other members of the Commonwealth and by many countries outside the Commonwealth. The only significant body as far as Australia is concerned which has not joined in that totally admirable objective is the Opposition. The violence that has occurred in the days leading up to tomorrow's South African election is a clear indication of the attitude of the South African Government to its black majority. De Klerk has claimed that it is-and I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . an outright lie that whites want to dominate South Africa's political life in perpetuity.</PARA>
<PARA>He has said that the future lies in consensus without the domination of any one group. Let us measure that claim against the events of the last few days. The first overwhelmingly salient point is that the black majority of 23 million has no vote in tomorrow's election. That is the overwhelming, salient and unavoidable fact, and that is what the current protests are about. One may well ask: How have the authorities responded? I will give just a few examples. Students were fired on at Durban University after a meeting, declared illegal, was broken up by police. About 20 students were injured. In a separate incident leading church people, including Archbishop Tutu and Dr Boesak, were detained after police attacked with bull whips people attending a meeting in the Methodist Church in Cape Town. Can you imagine anything more disgraceful, Mr Speaker?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Peter Cave was one of a number of journalists detained in the course of covering some of these events. We have seen the disgusting sight of baton-wielding police beating and arresting blacks protesting the fact that they cannot enter the water on a whites-only beach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am simply making the point that those interjections, coming as they did during the answer to the question I was giving, were not something new from those sources. They were a continuing reflection of an attitude which has been consistently expressed inside and outside this House and which has given aid and comfort to the apartheid regime in South Africa. Those honourable members ought to understand that they have been doing that and that the interjections they have been making today are nothing new. They are a continuation of that aid and comfort which they have consistently given to the regime in South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that those Australian sports players-the rugby players and administrators-who visited South Africa against the advice of this Government took note of these developments that have been occurring in South Africa while they were there. Unlike black South Africans, they live in a country which extends human rights to all its citizens. In exercising their freedom to travel, a right which this Government will always respect, they might have spared a thought to the denial of elementary human rights which is the daily lot of millions of South Africans. It is far too early to be optimistic about the prospects of sufficient change after the election on 6 September. We will be, of course, as I hope all reasonable people will be doing both here and elsewhere, watching the situation carefully. But it is depressing that the soft words emanating from South Africa are being accompanied by the harshest and most brutal of police repression. The ultimate challenge is the abandonment of the apartheid system and there is to date, very regrettably, no sign that the Government there is contemplating this.</PARA>
<PARA> While apartheid remains, so must international pressure, unfortunately, including sanctions, because there is only, as I have said on many occasions, one of two possible ways in which that tragic situation in South Africa will come to an end. Either it will come to an end by peaceful negotiation, or it will come to an end by bloodshed. Everyone should have a vested interest in trying to ensure that, by all appropriate forms of pressure, it is the former and not the latter which sees an end to the abhorrent regime of apartheid.</PARA>

This is the first time for very many years that we have had a proper system of a rolling triennium to underpin the expansion and the maintenance of higher education in this country. The new funds to be provided in 1992 will not only provide a continuation of a considerable building program but also fund an additional 14,000 new student places in that year.

<PARA> The importance of this decision is not only that it reveals that we are prepared to continue the growth and expansion of the higher education system but also that it provides for individual institutions a stable environment in which they themselves can plan for their future and their future growth. Between 1988 and 1992, higher education expenditure will have increased by a very significant $1.3 billion. During the period from 1988 to 1992, we will see the expansion in places of some 63,000 bringing to 150,000 the total number created since 1983. That is a 60 per cent expansion in the higher education system during the period of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member asks whether there are any alternative policies for the funding of higher education. In the context of the Government laying its cards on the table and indicating what it is prepared to do for the next three years, it is appropriate that we should look at alternatives that have been revealed from the mishmash that has come from the other side. What we hear from the current and most recent spokesperson for education is that Opposition members will encourage institutions to fund in their own way, that is, through fees, any expansion in the system. They will also encourage the expansion of private universities. In other words, they will starve the public institutions of funds so that either they will have to charge fees or private institutions will spring up charging fees in order to try to provide for the increasing demand in this country for higher education opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> What we know from the Opposition's policies is that it will not increase expenditure in this area, which means that, on the basis of the policy which has already been announced, to the extent that it is at all intelligible, there will be something like a $500m hole in the higher education budget by the time we reach 1992. The only way in which that hole can be filled is through the imposition of high, upfront fees. Particularly at a time like this, it seems to me that we ought to have a clear exposition so that the higher education system understands what its clear choices are. Yet during the course of the last two years, when we have seen such an imaginative rewriting of higher education policy in this country, I have been confronted by no fewer than five shadow Ministers in various combinations. Following the appointment of each one, various policies have been floated. I point only to the author of the most recent policy, the honourable member for Deakin, whose optimism about the coalition's prospects at the next election is such that he had to scurry off to a safer seat. It must be remembered that we were at one stage offered the prospect of the honourable member for Bennelong making an appearance as the shadow Minister for education. He would have--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, so that there can be the proper context for my answer to this question, may I read and then table the response that I gave to the honourable gentleman with respect to his question yesterday. I said by letter of the same day, that is, yesterday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to your question to me in Question Time concerning allegations about Mr John Halfpenny.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the National Crime Authority (NCA) did take a statement related to Mr Halfpenny but judged this material to be outside the scope of its charter. It was accordingly passed to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) which is, I understand, examining it.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with usual practice, the need for the AFP to undertake any further action is one for its judgment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made that position clear to the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have any particular reason to be in love with Mr Halfpenny. I have had more than my share of arguments and fights with him. I want to make the following point, seeing that the honourable gentleman has gone to the question again, and I put it in terms of something I said to my Caucus in recent days. There is a gentleman of the honourable member's party against whom recently very serious allegations have been made. I am, of course, referring to Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. I said to my Caucus that as far as my Government is concerned there is a very clear principle involved here, which is that a person is innocent until proven guilty. I instructed all the members of my Caucus to adhere to that principle.</PARA>
<PARA> So, as far as I am concerned and as far as the Government is concerned, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen is innocent of whatever allegations have been made until he is proved guilty. There are processes to be followed; they have been referred by the Premier to those processes. They are being properly undertaken. In this case I simply ask that the same principle should be applied to Mr Halfpenny. Allegations have been made, apparently, and what we have done is to see that the processes available for the investigation of those allegations should be undertaken. Those processes should be allowed to follow. I ask honourable gentlemen opposite to apply in respect of this particular gentleman, Halfpenny, the same principles that I have insisted apply to Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security. The Government announced in the April economic statement that the income test free area for married couples would become 100 per cent tax free in this financial year. In view of the different treatment of married couples under the taxation and social security rules, can the Minister inform the House how the Government will give effect to this commitment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="918" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the relationship between the social security free area and the treatment of income for tax purposes, particularly small amounts of income, has been a matter of considerable confusion and concern to pensioners. That became very clear during the consultations that were carried out by the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes. The consultations also confirm that taxing modest amounts of non-pension income acts as a disincentive to pensioners to maximise their income. The Government has a three-stage reform of tax and income test arrangements for age and service pensioners which will overcome these difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is, however, the question which was raised by the honourable member of the different treatment of couples under current taxation and pension rules. These differences arise because the social security system treats couples as a single unit but the Taxation office treats them as separate individuals. This different treatment creates a potential difficulty in giving effect to our commitment that a married couple can receive income of $70 a week combined without losing any pension or paying any tax. In cases where one partner, usually the husband, receives most of the couple's income, a pensioner's tax rebate that allowed each to receive half the combined free area would not be sufficient to free such a couple from tax. The Government has therefore decided that where both of a couple are pensioners, they will be able to transfer to their spouse any unused portion of their pensioner tax rebate or shade-out threshold. For 1989-90 this will mean that a pensioner couple with a combined taxable income of around $15,140 or less will not pay tax regardless of the distribution of income between husband and wife. Even more generous arrangements will apply in the case of pensioner couples living separately due to illness. Superannuants who are pensioners will particularly benefit from this initiative. Like other components of our retirement income policy, it has certainly been welcomed by pensioner organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> I think if some value has come out of the Social Security Review it is that as a Government we have been able to address-not simply from the recommendations of Professor Cass but as a government in an integrated way-quite complex and difficult problems that often rob incentive and create inequities. I do not think there is a clearer example of a reform long overdue than this reform or cleaning up of the relationship between social security and tax as it affects pensioners and superannuants with small amounts of income. I am sure that the honourable member's electors, as would aged people across Australia, welcome particularly the changes that have occurred in this area.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="919" SPEAKER="Hand The Hon G.L." NAMEID="5H4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MELBOURNE" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly let me say that I answered a similar question to this some time ago. I have read the story in today's Australian in which Mr Perkins makes a number of comments, and I stand by my answer to this Parliament on 13 October last year that I had no prior knowledge of the events which occurred at the ADC commissioners meeting. Mr Perkins has had a lot to say about me in recent weeks, and about the Government's policies on Aboriginal affairs. I have noted, for instance, his comments on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in recent days, which I find rather curious and certainly in stark contrast to what he told both the Prime Minister and me in 1987 when we were first discussing ATSIC. I recall very clearly that, when asked by the Prime Minister whether ATSIC would work, Mr Perkins gave a very clear and strong assertion that it would-an assertion that he repeated right across Australia during our consultations beginning in 1988, and an assertion heard by members of this House and of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me return to today's article and the thrust of the question. Firstly, Mr Perkins did not ring me prior to the ADC commissioners' meeting in Adelaide to inform me that the ADC Chairman and the ADC General Manager were to be removed. In the article Mr Perkins is said to have called me at Marla Bore on Saturday, 1 October, at about 7 p.m. Honourable members might recall that on that particular Saturday the Victorian State election was taking place and I was in Melbourne. On the evening which Mr Perkins was supposed to have called me at Marla Bore I attended three functions in the Melbourne Federal electorate. The first was a function for Mr Barry Rowe, the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs and member for Essendon; the second was for the new member for Melbourne, Neil Cole; and the third was for Demetri Dollis, the member for Richmond, held in the Collingwood Town Hall. After that I went to the tally room and members of the press gallery, members of this House and a whole lot of people saw me at that function, and I point out that I received no call at the tally room.</PARA>
<PARA> The next day I flew to Marla Bore and arrived there at about 5 o'clock. I checked into my motel and then went across to the departmental office. While I was there a call came through and the then South Australian State Director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, Miss Dawn Allen, answered it. Just for the record, Dawn Allen is now on my personal staff. She then hung up and advised me that Mr Perkins had just called from Alice Springs and was extremely angry that no car had turned up for him in Alice Springs. Dawn Allen then told me that Mr Perkins had asked her to pass on a message to me that he would not be able to get to Marla Bore that night as arranged, and I did not speak to Mr Perkins at any stage on the Sunday. The article in today's Australian quotes Mr Perkins as saying that he spoke to me as I was departing for Indulkna. I did not go to Indulkna. The next day I left Marla Bore and went to Mimili via Mintibie. That night I camped out just outside Mimili. I did not speak to Mr Perkins on that day either; there was no phone in the creek bed.</PARA>
<PARA> On the following days I visited a number of communities, including Ernabella, where I camped out; Amata and Nypari, where I also camped; and finally Kalka and Pipalyatjara-and I did not speak to Mr Perkins while I was at any of these places. Mr Perkins also claimed that he spoke to my senior private secretary, Mr Geoff Pryor, about the intended resolutions. This is also wrong. For the record, Mr Pryor was travelling with me through South Australia along with other senior officers. In short, the claims in the article in today's paper, the Australian, are absolutely false. At no time did he discuss the matters with me.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G4">Mr DUNCAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to some of your comments in just a moment or two. I know of the keen interest that the honourable member takes in the employment situation in the south-east of Melbourne, where the car factories referred to in that article are situated, and I did see the article. The gravamen of it was that there were criticisms of the fact that Newstart participants were unsuitable employees in the automotive industry. I thought it was interesting, in passing, also to note that, on the Sunday following the appearance of that article in the Melbourne Sun, the Sunday Sun contained an article which indicated that individuals under the Newstart program had started in automobile factories, particularly Toyota, I think, and had proved themselves to be very satisfactory employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Newstart is the Government's program to assist long term unemployed people in this nation, people who have been unemployed for 12 months or longer, people who are disadvantaged in the labour market. The program has now been operating for some months and the whole purpose of it is to seek to assist long term unemployed people to become job ready and get back into the labour market. It is particularly notable that a number of employers and unions, union leaders, employer leaders, including Mr Brian Noakes, have endorsed and supported the program as an important part of the Government's fight to assist long term unemployed people to get back into the work force. It is also interesting to note that the program to date has been pretty successful. It is too early yet to make fine judgments about how successful, but early indicators are very encouraging. Almost 11,000 people in the Newstart target group have returned to work since the program began, and almost 7,000 have received the employment entry benefit of $100. Those figures are very encouraging and certainly this Government can be pleased with the results that we have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the car manufacturers, I simply make the point that the solutions to some of the problems are in their hands, because in Melbourne, particularly, where the unemployment rate across the conurbation is about 3 per cent, they may well have to review their employment policies and decide whether it would be in their interest to lower the standards that they require from new employees. One is not going to find that people who have been unemployed for 12 months or longer have a good employment history over the past three or four years. Such people, obviously, are not going to be able to provide the checkable references which are being required by the car companies. I think it is fair to say that most Newstart clients do not meet those sorts of requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> We have sought to involve Nissan, Toyota and Ford in the Newstart program. We have not had a lot of success to date. I have asked the Department to invite, at the local level, Toyota, Nissan and Ford to become more closely involved in the programs. I would like to see the car companies in their local areas become involved by putting representatives on to the Newstart advisory committees. I hope that they will take up those invitations because it is important to the long term unemployed and to the car companies that need employees for these people, who have been unemployed for a long time, to have the opportunity to get into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the Government's policies in this area of assisting long term unemployed people to get back into the work force have seen some quite dramatic results in the past 12 months. The number of long term unemployed has fallen dramatically. In the year to July those people unemployed for 12 months or more fell by more than 22 per cent; 36,500 people fewer than twelve months previously. Those unemployed for two years or more declined by 14 per cent, or 13,000, over that period. I think it is fair to say that that record is unsurpassed. It is part of our overall excellent employment record which is, undoubtedly, the best of countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) is not leaving the chamber. This matter of public importance is motivated, obviously, by the article which appeared in the Australian today and which I think all honourable members in this place would recognise makes a very important point, that is, that the former Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) makes public by the leaking of a letter certain allegations with regard to his discussions with the Minister. In the answer the Minister has just given he relies on a date. The date is 1 September. The question is whether or not he received a phone call from Perkins on that day. We either take the Minister's word or take Mr Perkins's word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that when one reads the letter one finds no reference to a date. So I do not think this matter is closed yet-not by any means. There is still every possibility that a call took place. The Minister says that he was not there on the relevant day that Perkins says that he was there. But Perkins does not say which day. He does acknowledge that he was in Marla Bore on the following day. He does acknowledge that Perkins was in Alice Springs; a call could well have taken place. The matter is not closed. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole issue revolves around what happened with regard to the meeting of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) on 10 October. The question we asked two days after that meeting was: `Did the Minister have prior knowledge of the intention of the Secretary of his own Department to take action in his capacity as Acting Commissioner of the Aboriginal Development Commission against the Chairman and the General Manager of the ADC at the meeting of the Commission in Adelaide last week?' In response the Minister emphatically answered, `No'. On 14 October, Senator Tate was asked a similar question in the Senate and he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I . . . confirm that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs did not have prior knowledge of any actions taken by the Aboriginal Development Commissioners at their meeting this week. </PARA>
<PARA>Both answers are starkly at variance with the letter that has been published in the Australian, which was a letter to his biographer that gave rise to the leading article that all of us I am sure have read. In this letter Mr Perkins makes a number of important and significant disclosures that clearly contradict the advices given to the Parliament. Mr Perkins makes it clear that the Minister appointed him to the ADC Board to monitor developments and keep him informed of them, to quote his letter. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>As secretary of the department I always felt obliged to heed his request for information. </PARA>
<PARA>Is the Minister therefore prepared to stand up and say that he had no communication at all from Mr Perkins prior to that vital ADC meeting? Will he do that when he responds to this matter of public importance? Mr Perkins states:</PARA>
<PARA>Before the Adelaide meeting which passed resolutions against the chairman and general manager, I ensured that the Minister knew what was about to happen. </PARA>
<PARA>There was no reference to a date. The Minister therefore has to answer: did he know or did he not know prior to the meeting? His answer today does not satisfy that question. On this matter of having kept the Minister fully informed before the ADC Board meeting of 10 to 14 October, Mr Perkins also notes:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I had numerous conversations with Geoff Pryor (his private secretary) re these resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA>There are people on both sides who have been Ministers, and I note that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has been through this process before. Surely a private secretary relates to a Minister in detail all sorts of matters relevant to his administration. Is the Minister trying to tell us that his private secretary, whether it be Geoff Pryor or someone else, did not advise him of this major undertaking by the Secretary to his Department, whom he appointed to be his eyes and ears on the ADC Board? I find that hard to believe and so do honourable members on this side and so do many who saw these events back in October. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolutions referred to were those which resulted in the censure of Mrs McPherson, the ADC Chairman; the removal of Mr Mick O'Brien from the position of General Manager of the ADC; and the appointment of Mr Cedric Wyatt to that position. Mr Perkins then goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>I clearly recall informing Gerry Hand on the Saturday night a week before the Adelaide meeting of what resolutions were being proposed against Shirley McPherson and Mick O'Brien. I left him in no doubt that those resolutions would be passed. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear from this statement that the Minister knew well before the ADC Board meeting of the matters that would be placed before the ADC Board and of the action which would be taken by it, information the Minister denied having prior to the Board meeting of 10 to 14 October. Also in his letter Mr Perkins records in relation to the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>He was pleased that we were going to do something to meet the resistance from the ADC towards our proposal for ATSIC . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One only has to hear the answer to the question to know that the core of the motivation for all these issues has been the position Mr Perkins has taken on ATSIC. Is it not ironic? Yesterday National Aborigines and Islanders Day was launched by none other than the former Secretary and the remarks he made that were published in the media were `that he no longer had any faith in the concept that is being put forward by the Minister'-that is, ATSIC. He saw it as a revolutionary proposal that did not have the full support of Aboriginal people. That is the point that Charles Perkins has constantly made. This is a man that spent 20 years in Aboriginal affairs-a lot longer than you or I-and his view was that your proposals for ATSIC were not worth following, that it needed far more time, that the mechanism proposed was something that he could not lend his support to. He was loyal; he did not say a word about any conversations he had with the Minister prior to that ADC meeting until he retired from the Public Service. He has more to lose than anyone else by coming out and saying what he thinks, and I will quote to you in a little while what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said. </PARA>

Further, on 6 October or thereabouts, Mr Jackomos, who was Secretary, interestingly, of the Woden Town Club and was also on the Minister's staff, told ADC officers of these moves and the actions which would and did follow. Now these and other matters known at the time are entirely consistent with and supportive of the disclosures made by Mr Perkins in correspondence with his biographer, Dr Read of the Australian National University. These disclosures are not a figment of the imagination. They are the truth and they are an indictment of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I also spoke with Charles Perkins over a period of time and he explained to me that he did keep the Minister advised of all matters, as was the role of a secretary to any of the departments of state. I find it very difficult to now stand here and hear the Minister say that there was no conversation on a particular date. I would think, and I am sure my colleagues believe, that the Minister was advised prior to that ADC meeting and, therefore, we come to the crux of the issue: did the Minister or did not the Minister mislead the Parliament? The evidence is very heavily against him. He will have to do far better than he did in Question Time to deny the allegations that are made by Mr Perkins. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some time ago the honourable member for Parramatta resigned from his portfolio because he quite unintentionally and unwittingly misled the House. It was the honourable and proper course of action to take to comply with the high standards set and expected in this chamber. That is what this issue is all about because honourable members would be aware that this is not the first time that there have been motions from this side of the House alleging that this Minister may have misled the House. He has escaped two such motions. He may or may not escape this one, but it is quite clear that there is a systematic pattern of administration which indicates that this Minister is wanting in the administration of this Department. If we have a look at the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio we will find that during the time that this Minister has been Minister it has been subject to more inquiries than any other in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we now should look to see what the Prime Minister had to say. It was only on 15 August when the Prime Minister came into this House and, in the summing up of the report of the Menzies Inquiry into Allegations as to the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which was the final report into the allegations that had been made about certain things in relation to Charles Perkins, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is true that he has occasionally been a controversial figure; but only, I believe, where he saw this as important to his continuing effectiveness as a leader of his people. </PARA>
<PARA>That is important. The Prime Minister recognised what all of us recognise, that Charles Perkins spoke out in many controversial circumstances, but when he did he spoke out in defence of his people. Do not tell me that this letter to his biographer, which is going to be the sum total of 20 years work in the Aboriginal affairs area, is such that he is motivated by something other than defending his people and defending his record obviously, but primarily he is defending his people. Is the Minister going to ascribe to Mr Perkins some other motive, some other reason for making these statements? I think that he wants the record to be correct as it states in his letter, and the Minister is trying to rewrite history in his answers here in not admitting that he did have that prior information. What about the Prime Minister? He went on further to praise Mr Perkins. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is time this House and this Parliament put those matters behind it and instead expressed its recognition of the substantial contribution Charles Perkins has made throughout his working life in the interests of advancing the cause of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>That has been his motivation, that has been his lifelong commitment and he has been totally frustrated. When he was Secretary he was not appointed by the present Minister. He was appointed by the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), but he has been totally frustrated by the direction in which this Minister wishes to take Aboriginal affairs with this revolutionary exercise in establishing a black parliament, this ATSIC legislation. Charles Perkins has come to believe sincerely that this legislation is something that is not good for his people and so he is prepared to stand up and say so. The Minister wants to criticise him for it. I think that the Minister is neglecting the role that he plays in this place, and that is being the spokesman for Aboriginal people within his Party. That is my role on this side of the chamber-to be the spokesman for Aboriginal people; to put their views across. A Senate select committee went off and took evidence all over the country and the vast majority of submissions were against this proposal that the Minister is putting forward. Now the man who was chosen to be the one to launch National Aboriginal Day has come forward and said he does not believe in this proposal. He does not believe in the Minister who is currently in charge of Aboriginal affairs in this country. That is significant. He is defending his people and the Minister is trying to discredit him. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me turn to the Prime Minister. What did he say on August 15? He said this:</PARA>
<PARA>I express, on behalf of the Government, regret that his services as a full-time officer will be lost to the Government, and I hope honourable members will join me in wishing him well in his future career. For the Government's part, it will be actively seeking appropriate opportunities to engage Mr Perkins in appropriate part-time activity so that the wealth of his knowledge and experience is not totally lost to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Charles Perkins was in here that day. I sat here and I saw him sitting up there in the gallery, and he was pleased to hear the Prime Minister of this country say that about him. He was pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) echo similar sentiments. What happened on that day? The Minister vacated the chamber. This Minister has conducted a vendetta against Charles Perkins. To this day he has never explained to this House why it was that Charles Perkins was removed in the way that he was. Honourable members should remember that they have to make their judgment about which man they believe, because at the end of the day that is what this issue is all about. Do they believe this Minister or do they believe Charles Perkins?</PARA>
<PARA> It is all right to dissemble the facts and say it was this day or that day, but the base allegation is there. The Secretary to the Department says, `I advised my Minister of all activity that was proposed'. The Minister says, `No. Contrary to all accepted public administration principles, I was not advised'. I cannot believe that they cannot believe it upstairs and we cannot believe it over here. I know that many on the Minister's side of the chamber do not believe it either. He ought to hope that there are no Telecom records that perhaps would reveal telephone calls or any written evidence because if there are the Minister is history because he would have been shown to have misled the House. It will be the final time for him, because a cat cannot continue to be as lucky as he has been. He has been flying very close to the wire. His whole pattern of administration of this portfolio has been seen to be wanting and many people believe that his proposals for the future of Aboriginal people in this country will take this nation backwards. That is what this debate is about. It is all right for the Minister, as he will in a moment, to accuse Charles Perkins of having a vendetta against him; he is defending his people and the Minister ought to have listened to what he had to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have just had a bit of an outburst from the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), in his first performance. He tried to suggest that in my answer to the House I was attempting to run away from the facts. In the letter that he quotes from, Mr Perkins says quite clearly, on page 2:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was at Alice Springs at the time at my daughter's place . . . and my wife was with me. The Minister was in Marla Bore . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Well, I was not in Marla Bore. I was in the Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne. He says to me that it is no good my getting up here and denying it. I cannot help it if I was not where somebody said I was. The fact of the matter is, quite clearly, that I stand by my position of saying I was not informed about the activities being proposed by the then Secretary to the Department and acting commissioner of the Aboriginal Development Commission, Charles Perkins. But, the shadow Minister says that it could have taken place. It could have taken place, but it did not. It did not take place in that he never spoke to me prior to that meeting about what he intended to do. If honourable members are half reasonable, they will think about where Marla Bore is, they will think about where Alice Springs is and they will think about where the Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne are. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that some of those opposite are the very people who pilloried Charles Perkins day after day, in this place and in the other chamber, and who went after him in an unmerciful way-in a way in which people from their side came and saw me about. People over there were ashamed of what was going on. I defended Charles Perkins, along with his family, in here from those attacks when the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) wanted to go into the dungeons in the old Parliament House and drag out information given under privilege to a committee and to have it tabled, to smatter it across the pages of the newspapers in order to denigrate Mr Perkins. I find it extraordinary that the honourable member for Bass comes in here with crocodile tears to suggest that he is sympathetic to Charlie Perkins. The fact is that my answer today is factually correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The travel arrangements of me and my staff will clearly indicate that I was not where Mr Perkins suggested I was. I regret that he has made a mistake. The shadow Minister said that I was going to come in here today and pour a bucket all over Charlie Perkins. Well, I am not going to do that. I am just going to make a couple of points and then move on to what the second part of the matter of public importance deals with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, to anybody who thinks that I got a big kick out of what happened to Charlie Perkins, I say that I did not. I regret what happened and I found it probably one of the saddest or most difficult days that I have ever been involved in in politics. The fact is that there is a unique relationship between a Minister and a Secretary to his Department. In the last few weeks I have been referred to as acting in a racist way. People in the Opposition know me; I am not a racist. Does anybody here think I am a racist? I do not tell lies. The proof is there. Why would I say `no' to an answer that clearly was designed as a bit of a trap. What did I have to gain by saying `no'? What was in it for me? There was absolutely nothing. To be fair, the way things were flowing out of the Aboriginal Development Commission in those days, I would have been a bit adventurous to have pretended that it would not get out. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us clear the matter up. The fact is that Charlie departed the scene in terms of his relationship with me over a specific issue which I outlined in the Parliament. I do not resile from that situation. It was intolerable. He knows that. I did not use him as a black scapegoat or some other colourful term that has been bandied around in the media. I resent that. A few articles have been written that I might do something about, for the first time in my life. I do not like being called a racist; I do not like being called a liar and I do not like people printing that. </PARA>
<PARA> The day before Charlie Perkins left the job, I was defending him and his family and I will continue to defend them and all those other Aboriginal people that were named here and in the Senate during that terrible period with no shred of proof. Names were flung around at random, day after day after day; I defended all of them too. I will defend the officers of my Department. The other day we had the spectacle in the Senate of a senator standing up and saying, `Isn't it interesting? Hand has no Aboriginal advisers in with Senator Tate today'. Why would I? Every single one of them has been battered and pilloried all through the Senate chamber because they happen to work for me. Honourable members can read the Hansard reports and the press cuttings about anybody who is black and who has worked with me. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this is really all about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). It has been all about ATSIC right through 1988, when the Opposition went after Charlie, after me and after all those other decent people, and attempted to destroy them. Not once do we get a debate from the Opposition on policy. Not once does the Opposition talk about the issues. Opposition members put out mealy-mouthed press releases every day which no-one runs, thank God, but they never put up a proposition, an amendment or whatever, in this chamber. Opposition members never came to talk to me about ATSIC, when I offered them the olive branch. When I met with members of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs a day or so after they were appointed. I said to them, `Look, let's see if we can work it out. Let's see if we can reach agreement'. What did I get? Not one approach, except Senate inquiries, privilege committee inquiries and millions of dollars being wasted. You could have talked to me about the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell you what, there is one thing about the mob of National Party members over in the corner; when they have a beef, they come and see me. I do not agree with a lot of their politics-I have said this before-but they know how the system works. They know the damage that can be caused in their community when one goes off half-cocked in the media. Other members know that, too. There are horrendous results for black and white people living in these communities when one goes off half-cocked. I remind the House that when a senator was asked, `Why do you use the words `black mafia''?', he said, `I use it to get you mugs there to listen'. He was referring to the press gallery. He said, `The only way you'll come along and hear me is if I use an outrageous claim that there is a black mafia in existence'. That is why he used it, and that is a disgrace in this country. It is a disgrace that it is allowed to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that I know that the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the shadow Minister are wrong. Unfortunately, I gave the shadow Minister a bit of a rap yesterday on a radio program as being a reasonable person, one with whom I hoped I could work; I have no doubt that I can. The fact is that he is wrong. I happen to be a little proud. I do not want to get the flick out of this joint for having lied to it. I am a bit old fashioned about that. Take it from me, I am not going to tell you any lies. What I am about is trying to rectify the problems that you have talked about in a few of your press releases and the problems that you and other members opposite have talked about. The text of the matter of public importance that the shadow Minister has proposed is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's disregard for parliament and proper accountability in the administration of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Look at what has happened in terms of the second part of the proposal, which you did not address. I have been doing virtually nothing else in this portfolio except working with the officers within it, and the Aboriginal people, trying to make the system work better. It is fair to say that I could score a lot of points by dragging out the odd blue that somebody before me made, but that does not serve any purpose. We have had an exciting period, action packed if you like, in Aboriginal affairs. One could say it has never been dull. When I look around the chamber at some of the grey-headed members, I reckon I will be like them at the end of the next six months or so. The fact is that we have reviewed nearly all areas of the portfolio, setting up systems for better administration and better accountability. I am sure that when honourable members on both sides of the House visit Aboriginal communities, they are always told, `Don't set us up to fail', because they have been set up to fail so many times. What we have tried to do in terms of ATSIC is make it work. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many reports. Interestingly, when we amended the Bill relating to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Opposition members never came to see me. I had to go to them and say, `Look, they're not bad ideas. I think I will accept those; the Government will accept them', but they never came to see me; no, they are too thick to do that. They hoped I would oppose it. We accepted all of your amendments regarding the Institute. Just think what you could have done about ATSIC if you had got off your backside and come to see me about it. We might have agreed on a few things in that regard, too. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the matter of the article in newspapers today. It is regrettable that it has happened but maybe one day I will get the opportunity to write my book and I will have to dream up a few ways in which to get a bit of publicity. By golly, I tell you what, it will be a ripsnorter when I drop a few things that I know about. I make the point again: there was never any criticism of me in regard to those issues during the course of the lead-up to those inquiries on Charles Perkins or his family. I kept saying to people in this chamber and other places, `Put up or shut up and let the processes that the Government has put in place be the judge'. I made no judgment. In terms of the Woden Town Club, I do not move back one inch-not one inch-from my views. I, like you, have to travel around this country seeing people without shelter, people without water, sick kids with crook ears and crook eyes, and all the associated problems that we read about in the newspapers. The last thing on my priorities is poker machines and the Woden Town Club. So I resile not one centimetre from my view on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Now Mr Perkins has an equally strong view in the other direction, and that is his right. But while I am running this portfolio I said I would do everything to stop the money going to the Woden Town Club. As a consequence of that we fell out. I ask the honourable member to read my answer regarding the reason why Charles Perkins left. Honourable members would have to agree that it was not a very good relationship for me or for him, and the best thing for both of us was for him to leave. I also point out that Charles Perkins approached both the Prime Minister and me quite some months before seeking a way in which he could vacate the position and retire. There are a lot of things I could talk about, but I am not going to go on with any more. </PARA>

There are a number of them and they met with me, together. Sometimes I bumped into them all around Australia and they spoke to me then too. If you read all the reports and all the inquiries that were taking place in the Senate you would see that the motives for the actions they took against Mr O'Brien and Mrs McPherson were not, according to the evidence given by Mr Perkins, related to ATSIC, they related to other matters, so I resent the imputations of your comments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People who have been observing the affairs of Aboriginal people in Australia and its administration over the last two years would be absolutely horrified by the way in which this Government has treated Aboriginal people in Australia. Never since the Commonwealth became involved in Aboriginal matters have Aboriginal Australians been treated so shabbily and dismissively and superficially as they have by this Government and by this Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand). He may well talk about how he has great compassion and understanding of the Aboriginal people, but the simple reality of it is that there has been very little action at the grassroots level. Little is done and only a small amount of the money actually gets through to the Aboriginal people at the grassroots level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are discussing a matter of public importance which concerns proper accountability to this Parliament in the administration of Aboriginal affairs. Today, in a major newspaper, an issue has been raised which we are concerned about. That is not because it is not the first time that it would appear that this Minister has misled the Parliament. It is not we who have made the judgment that he has misled the Parliament. He got up here a few minutes ago and said, `I don't want to go out of here because I lied to the Parliament'. I say to the Minister, and to the people who are listening to the broadcast of these proceedings, that not only on our part but also on the part of many journalists and many observers there is no doubt that people believe you have already misled this Parliament, abused the truth, at least three times. If today we are not satisfied with your answer, and it is actually proven to be otherwise than what you have said to us, it is clear that you will have misled the Parliament at least three more times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the Minister to refer to his unique relationship with the Secretary of his Department is absolute bunkum, nonsense, ludicrous, and again is misleading this Parliament-because that was not the situation. People know that. In fact, sometimes it went three months and the Minister of the Department never spoke to his Department head. That is a unique relationship for sure! It is a unique relationship that the Minister would not even spend time talking to his Department head. That is the sort of unique relationship that the Labor Party has, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had with his former head of Department. That is an incredible situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the Minister to say that we launched an attack on Aboriginal Australians, that we launched an attack on Charlie Perkins's family or on Charlie Perkins himself, is absolute nonsense. The whole debate over the last two years in this Parliament in regard to Aboriginal affairs has not been about the Aboriginal people themselves; it has been about the incompetence of this Minister and the lack of strength on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to sack him. The debate has not been about the Aboriginal people themselves. In fact, we have mentioned many, many times their need for health, education and housing facilities, and so on. Nobody in this Parliament resiles from that. They know that it is very important to the Aboriginal people that they have those facilities, that they are treated equally with other Australians in those matters. We do not back away from that. In fact, it is a very firm commitment of ours. </PARA>
<PARA> But the situation with which we are faced in this Parliament is that on several occasions the Minister has spoken here and it has been subsequently proved that he misled this Parliament. Today we have a letter from the former Secretary of his Department which is very clear, as the shadow Minister stated. It gives a very clear indication that he discussed matters with the Minister prior to that meeting. The Minister says that he never discussed those matters. Obviously, the truth lies somewhere, and it does not appear to be clear at this stage to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two years there have been four major investigations into the administration of Aboriginal affairs, totalling 337 pages. The Minister regards himself as being a good Minister in regard to the ATSIC legislation, yet there have been 92 amendments already to a new piece of legislation. That does not seem to be competent administration. Over 100 questions have been asked in this and the other place in regard to the administration of Aboriginal affairs and over 800 questions asked in Senate Estimates committees. That has been generated by poor administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs through this Minister. It is an absolute disgrace that that has occurred to those people who are culturally recognised as the most disadvantaged group of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Minister indicated to us that he does not believe the letter that we have received is an accurate record. The shadow Minister gave a very plausible argument that it will not rest there. If we had not had two years of discussion on Aboriginal Affairs; if this had come up only now-if we had not had the report on the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) and the discussions about that when the Minister misled the Parliament, this House and the other place; if we had not had the audit report on NAIHO where he misled the Parliament again, and if we had not had--  Mr Hand-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have not misled the Parliament. That has not been proven. The fact is the organisation the honourable member is referring to is still not funded. I ask that that be withdrawn. </PARA>

I have already mentioned the NAIHO funding and the NAIHO report. He also said that the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council made unanimous decisions when it did not. It did not make unanimous decisions. It is absolute bunkum for the Minister to indicate that there were unanimous decisions. I refer people back to what he said at the time that question was asked. This is just one illustration. This was his explanation to the Parliament:</PARA></TALK.START>

We all know about the honourable member for Braddon. Let me tell honourable members a bit about him. He is the man who was shadow Minister at the time that his colleagues in the Senate attacked Mr Charles Perkins and other leading Aboriginal people. He knows who they are: Pat Dodson, Rob Riley, Charles Perkins, Peter Yu, Cedric Wyatt. The honourable member was the shadow Minister at the time.

He showed some commonsense, something the previous shadow Minister did not have'. It seems, unfortunately, that the present shadow Minister shares the same lack of commonsense that the previous shadow Minister had. Had he any commonsense either then or now he would have repudiated every one of those remarks which were made by Senator Tambling in the Senate about Charles Perkins. We have not yet heard an apology being made to Charles Perkins by the shadow Minister, the previous shadow Minister, or any other member of the Opposition with regard to these attacks made by their colleagues in the Senate. They are the people who represent Opposition members' interests. They placed on notice 800 questions to the Estimates Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I cannot be held responsible for the lack of commonsense, the outrageous behaviour or the malevolent remarks made by the honourable member for Braddon or, in this case, the honourable member for Bass. Let us go to the point of today's matter of public importance. It seems rather strange to me that Opposition members did not check their facts in the first instance. I would have thought they would have at least referred to the Senate Hansard, because in the Senate Estimates Committee Hansard of 25 October 1988 Senator Tambling asked Mr Perkins about discussions that might have taken place between the Aboriginal Development Commission, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister's office. I refer the honourable member for Bass to his statements about arguments or conversations that may have taken place between the Minister's staff and Mr Perkins or Mr Perkins's office. Let me tell him what Mr Perkins's reply to this question was. Senator Tambling asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>So there were no discussions with Mr Rob Riley or Mr Andrew Jack in the Minister's office in the week prior to the ADC meeting?</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Minister might like to listen to the answer:</PARA>
<PARA>Officers never discussed any matters, if you are referring to the ADC. We were over there, now and then, but I do not think I was over there because I was travelling most of the time, I do not recollect any officers having those discussions with the Minister's office, certainly not about the ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>There it is on the record by Mr Perkins at an Estimates committee meeting. Is the honourable member telling me that Mr Perkins, as the permanent head of a department, was not aware of his responsibilities as permanent head? Is he telling me that Mr Perkins, who was the permanent head of a department, was not aware that if the Minister had in some way erred in his response to this Parliament-he had not-Mr Perkins had a responsibility to remind the Minister, to tell the Minister, that he had erred in his response to the Parliament or, if he did not want to go and see the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, that he could use the power he had and go and see the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)? Is he telling me that he would not have done that?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Perkins has a very special position in this community and Mr Perkins had the ear of the Minister, the Prime Minister and several other senior Ministers. There is not on record in this place any evidence that Mr Perkins went to see the Minister or the Prime Minister to suggest to either of them that he had erred in what was said in this House, or in what Senator Tate said in the Senate. I think that demonstrates-I take it the honourable member would agree with me-that Mr Perkins took his job seriously. </PARA>

Is he saying that? If he is, he should go outside this House and accuse Mr Perkins of misleading the Minister. I do not think Mr Perkins ever misled the Minister in this respect and I do not think Mr Perkins misled the Prime Minister. The honourable member accepts, does he not, Mr Perkins's bona fides as the permanent head of the Department? He said so. In fact during his speech he said, `Mr Perkins did keep him advised of all matters as befitting his position as permanent head'. Now, if Mr Perkins kept the Minister advised of all matters, as befitting his position as permanent head, given his responsibilities as permanent head of the Department he had the responsibility to advise the Minister on the answers he gave to this House in relation to issues which dealt with his portfolio for which Mr Perkins had some responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The reports I have tabled propose the construction of an office building of 6,990 square metres of accommodation to provide accommodation for several Commonwealth agencies at Logan City, Queensland, and the proposed fitout of the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters building in Canberra. The first report proposes the construction of a three-storey office building to provide accommodation for the local offices of the Department of Social Security, the Commonwealth Employment Service, and several other Commonwealth agencies. The Committee inspected the existing offices of the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service and found both offices to be of poor standard and inadequate to meet the needs of the agencies. With respect to the proposed building, the Committee recommends that public toilets be provided on the ground floor additional to those previously proposed by the Department of Administrative Services, and that measures be introduced to ensure the security of staff and records.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two particular issues have, in recent times, kept reappearing before the Committee when it has been considering proposed government building projects. These issues concern the provision of car parking spaces and the provision of child-care facilities. The Committee notes in the report that the Department of Administrative Services is to review its existing policy where parking facilities are generally provided only for official vehicles at government buildings. With respect to the provision of child-care facilities, the Committee recommends that the current policy, which is that child-care facilities not be provided in Commonwealth offices, be reviewed. The estimated cost of the building is $9.6m at April 1989 prices. It is expected that construction will commence in November of this year, with completion scheduled for January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report proposes fitout works for the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters building in Canberra. The fitout is 16,500 square metres of floor space and will provide a suitable standard of accommodation for the majority of central office staff. The Committee believes that relocation of Civil Aviation Authority staff into a central location will result in a more efficient use of resources and will improve staff morale. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $13.4m at July 1989 prices. I commend these reports to the House. </PARA>

Whilst one certainly does not wish to see an expansion of services in relation to social security and Commonwealth employment services within the Logan City area, one is also mindful of the very difficult situation in which people work, and the services that are provided. These are very people oriented programs and we have had very successful back to work programs and very successful programs-in particular, the jobs, education and training adviser, and the return of sole parents into the work force. Indeed, beneficiaries from the Woodridge social security office have decreased by 20 per cent in the last 18 months due to some very active work in the work force planning areas and in targeting people with special needs. However, despite that reduction, the office is still far too small, and the new office, which will also house a number of other government agencies, will meet the needs of the people and demonstrate that this Commonwealth Government has a commitment to the people in Logan City and is prepared to make infrastructure developments which will support them, provide long term services, and provide work, not only in the building and construction of such an office but also in providing facilities for work in the very much longer term.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Civil Aviation Authority, no doubt, could do with these improved office facilities at this very time as its staff must be working around the clock fast-tracking the Government's proposals for the proper ticketing of foreign pilots, whom it is using to break the pilots strike, and certifying foreign aircraft from all over the world, which is apparently necessary to carry Australian passengers and which, according to its own statement, normally would take some months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, as has been pointed out, a proper working environment for the workers at the Civil Aviation Authority is essential as the Government is putting them under considerable pressure in regard to the programs it has embarked upon in its strikebreaking. I do not say that critically at all. I just want it recognised that it must be a considerable extra workload for the work force of the Civil Aviation Authority. It is a pity, therefore, that they do not now have these new and more acceptable facilities in which to do all this extra work. If they are doing their job properly, they would be working around the clock compared to the amount of time they would normally take on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt the honourable member who spoke before me, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), is delighted that a bit of the pork barrel has arrived in her electorate. I made the point the other day that, notwithstanding the Government's demand that the economy be cooled, that the private sector spend less and the terrible pressure that has been placed on home owners and the home building industry, the Government continues in the twilight of its term of office to rush around announcing new projects for office buildings built with taxpayers' dollars. The Minister some day might explain to the House how that is not reheating the economy, which his Treasurer (Mr Keating) tells us is supposed to be hosed down. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot have one's cake and eat it too. If it is time for restraint, it seems a peculiar time for honourable members opposite to be running around from electorate to electorate announcing new projects. We will have the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) get up in a minute and tell us about the grave necessity of all these improvements he is getting-I have been in his airport a few times and he is probably right-but it does not alter the fact that the Government is embarking on a major construction program. We have the Minister in here nearly every day, either telling the Parliament about some program that has been referred to the Public Works Committee or having that Committee come back and say, `Spend the money-pork-barrel the member for Forde'. </PARA>

He attacks members of the general community and tells them it is all their fault. Of course, it is always someone else's fault. They are the people who want a Hills hoist in their backyard, but they have to constrain themselves from that desire. The Treasurer tells them that they are paying too much for houses and attacks the housing construction industry, the banks and any other industry that puts its head above the trenches. He tries to hose down the economy. Yet here we are again discussing major expenditures recommended by the Government in marginal electorates. As I have said, we are not objecting to this project; we are just making the point that there is considerable hypocrisy in the Government's stance regarding who should bear the burden of economic restraint.

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of terminal facilities at Alice Springs airport. </PARA>
<PARA>On 1 April 1989 the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) assumed ownership of Alice Springs Airport. As part of the transfer arrangement the Corporation agreed to develop new terminal facilities on the site. I might digress and say to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that I do not, nor does the Government, consider in any way that we are in conflict with the macro-economic policy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in following a planned program--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am making it clear, too, that this public work that I am referring to the Public Works Committee today is a component of a planned public works program which can continue despite the exigencies of the macro-economic policy of the day. It is necessary because the existing terminal building was built back in 1963, I understand by a Liberal government. It has already been extended twice and now stands at just 1,460 square metres of covered space. Have honourable members ever heard anything so ridiculous? Yet the Opposition is canning this public work that we want to proceed with. There is excessive overcrowding due to the high sustained growth over many years, as the terminal now handles 960 passengers in a peak hour. This has resulted in airline passenger handling areas operating well below acceptable standards. The Corporation is simply proposing a new terminal and surrounding infrastructure at an indicative cost of $20m at July 1989 prices. The proposed terminal is designed to handle 1,500 passengers in a peak hour rate made up of something like 511-odd arrivals, 513 transfers and approximately 445 departures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The conceptual design takes into account the forecast passenger and aircraft movements and the space requirements requested by both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines, along with the forecast aircraft parking requirements in the mid to late 1990s. The work comprises a new terminal of approximately 9,000 square metres, a new access road system and associated landscaping, vehicle parking areas and the upgrading of engineering services. I anticipate that construction would start towards the end of this year with works to be completed by mid-1991, that is, less than two years away. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal was referred to the Northern Territory Conservation Commission, the Australian Heritage Commission and the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority and has been judged environmentally acceptable by all those authorities. The proposal will be funded from non-Budget sources by the FAC and will incorporate measures to maximise commercial returns to the Federal Airports Corporation. It will greatly assist the Northern Territory by boosting construction activity and by providing a more attractive gateway to the many internationally renowned and famous tourist attractions in northern Australia, in this case around Alice Springs and at Yulara and Uluru. I have great pleasure in tabling the drawings of this proposal, and despite the rantings of the Opposition. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) hears me say that the Opposition does not oppose the recommendation that this matter be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I had said in my previous aside-I was addressing the office construction in Logan City-that, having been in the Alice Springs airport on numerous occasions, I recognised the need for a new facility. Let me get that straight. But that did not stop my raising the general question of the Government's macro-economic policy. I am pleased that the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), is present, because I hope he takes these remarks on board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) has made available to me a copy of the plans proposed and I thank him. I am very impressed with the innovative design. It is unique in many ways and seems at a glance to have quite a lot going for it. Nevertheless, there is one important factor of the design that is relevant to a current situation confronting Australia. It relates to a facility for Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia. I cannot identify one area-I have studied it very carefully and I hope the Minister is able to correct me-where another airline operating under the deregulated system could independently operate. The Government can get down on its hands and knees to Ansett or Australian and be treated in the way that we know it will be treated at all the other major airports where the Government, prior to its handing over the major airports to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), was at pains to guarantee almost a complete monopoly of the airport facilities available, and--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It forced them to be leased before the FAC, which is supposed to be some sort of independent authority, could get into the business of making some proper and reasonable arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the problem that faces this Government in the pilots strike, and the Government knows it. We are not talking about an ordinary industrial relations system. We are talking about a system that is operating for another 14 months under regulation-a two-airline policy-which gives huge industrial power to pilots, flight attendants, refuellers and the rest. With deregulation, which will come into force about the time our Party opens this building, we will have a situation where other airlines will want to compete and create an environment allowing voluntary contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> We know very well that the new airlines that will be operating under voluntary contracts will not be trapped into this Government's industrial relations system and accord. They will have the sorts of bonus systems and incentive systems for their work force, whether for pilots or aircraft cleaners, that give people the incentive to be productive and lift Australia out of this mess. The Government is making sure that those locked into its system through history will have such a massive privilege in terms of airport facilities that the others will be in the situation that poor old East-West Airlines Ltd was in at one stage, having to run a baggage collection service from a vehicle on the footpath. We saw it out here at Canberra Airport. There is a bit of history that makes that difficult. Here we are-I address myself to the Chairman of the Public Works Committee-looking at a proposal for a brand new airport. What are the Government and its Federal Airports Corporation doing about deregulation? They are doing nothing-not a thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we ever want evidence of what will happen on the waterfront, we get it in this drawing. We will have a lot of words about it. Under the proposed Waterfront Industry Reform Authority-the process by which the Government puts Dracula in charge of the blood bank-it gives two groups of people, namely, the stevedores and the Waterside Workers Federation, the total responsibility for this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This building is another example of the Government's genuine approach to micro-economic reform. Those opposite go out there and give lip service to it, but when we get down to the printed word, the draftsmen's efforts, which are before us here, what do we find? A two-airline policy, in a building that is going to be open about the time that deregulation occurs. That is a wonderful situation! There is nowhere that an independent operator can work in this system. One side is for Ansett check-in and Ansett administration; the other side is for Australian check-in, Australian administration. There are two baggage claim areas. In other words, there are two areas for Ansett and Australian to come in. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for the Northern Territory is likely to stand up in a minute and defend the Government's action on this. He is telling the tourist operators in his electorate, `We, the Labor Party, don't really want you to benefit in any way from half price fares coming in to Alice Springs, as might occur in a deregulated airline system. Yes, you will have to go around to the hangar or somewhere like that to get out of your plane'. Those are just the sorts of things to impress American tourists and others when they get on to domestic airlines. It is too bad if Qantas Airways Ltd wants to go there. Perhaps the honourable member is so confident about the amalgamation of Qantas and Australian that he does not think that is a problem. If we are going to have genuine deregulation, it is possible that Qantas will want to go into Alice Springs. There will be no room for it, no room for others such as United Airlines, who may want to fly in there. We have these brand new jets that fly huge distances now and just might want to come into Alice Springs. There will be no opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the perfect evidence in this proposal of the Government's true attitude to deregulation. It is a farce. That means more of the same in terms of industrial relations. The Government is trying to keep the lid on the pilots, who have such massive industrial power because of the way the Government has organised the two-airline system, and this is the evidence that the Government sees that system going on in perpetuity. It is not really getting out of it. It has given lip service to it. Its intention is to make it so difficult for new entrants that they will give up and die and go away or try flying in some other country or whatever. They will not be able to make it. They cannot operate an airline without equal treatment on the ground. They are not going to get it in Melbourne; they are not going to get it in Sydney; they might get it in Brisbane, because there is some spare space up there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we designed that. The reality is that, on this drawing, they are certainly not going to get it in Alice Springs. The honourable member should say, because he says he likes to speak up for his constituents, whether that is acceptable to him. I challenge him to say whether this design, which confines the activities at Alice Springs Airport to all intents and purposes to a two-airline system, is satisfactory to him. We will get a real test of his commitment to the electorate if he says that is so. He had better not dodge the question because he likes throwing a bit of advice around the place. He had better tell us whether that is satisfactory. If it is, let us get that around in Alice Springs. I hope the first press release is that he is dissatisfied with the Government and with the FAC's proposal in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very concerning matter that has been brought before the Parliament today. Here we are with the nation stopped and heaps and heaps of tourist operators, small businesses and large, in the electorate of the honourable member for the Northern Territory struggling like mad. The Northern Territory Government is doing more about it than the Federal Government. It at least has the Brunei people in there to give a bit of a hand. The reality is that his Government is doing nothing about solving the problem. We know that at the bottom of this problem is the two-airline policy, and here he is just about to stand up and tell us about this wonderful improvement that his Government proposes for the Alice Springs Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell the honourable member what the improvement is. It is a message that says more of the same-more pilots strikes in the future, more high air fares, loaded up with staff and feather-bedding-all because this Government does not genuinely believe in the two-airline policy, any more than this Minister believes in the selling of Australian Airlines, the Commonwealth Bank or any of those other things. At heart those opposite are regulators. Nobody is more of a regulator than the Minister who has brought this proposal to the Parliament, and if we ever wanted a better demonstration as to how he is going to get around the decision of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to deregulate the airline industry, we have it in these drawings. It is quite outrageous that we see that in such a small centre, where it is so important to have a clear opportunity for independent airlines to operate, the Government proposes a two-airline airport facility. I sincerely hope that the recommendation to this Parliament from the Public Works Committee is that that is not acceptable and that the Government must do something about it. Considering the factional connections of the Chairman of that Committee, I doubt that he really wants that to happen, either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am extremely gratified to be able to speak on this important matter. It is important in a number of respects. As the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) belatedly but at last acknowledged, a public works project of this type is extremely important, not only to the Northern Territory but also to the Australian travel industry and to the airlines in particular. I am at a bit of a loss as to the understanding of the honourable member for O'Connor of the processes of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. It seems to me that he has completely ignored the facility that exists within the Public Works Committee structure to seek out information from the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), the body that is responsible for building this facility. This is an FAC project. It is not a project of the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for O'Connor should at least learn the procedures of the House and of this Government, and understand how these matters are discussed and dealt with by the Public Works Committee. He might also acknowledge to the Parliament that he has at least some trifling understanding of the plans that were put in front of him. I do not have them in front of me. I have seen them, and it is true that in the main this is a proposal for the two existing airlines because, as the honourable member for O'Connor ought to know, the FAC has as its primary responsibility the provision of air terminal facilities around Australia-in Alice Springs in this instance. It cannot plan for those facilities on the basis that there might be another airline in 18 months or two years. There is no clear evidence that another airline will provide services to Alice Springs or, indeed, Darwin once deregulation comes about. </PARA>
<PARA> What he also ought to acknowledge is that there is scope within the plans which have been put before the House for expansion, for change, to allow for the incorporation of further operators. The honourable member for O'Connor is trying to have a lend of us because he does understand the processes of the Public Works Committee. He does understand the processes which allow for people to put in submissions to the Public Works Committee and to argue their case in front of that Committee. He also understands the planning that goes into providing capital works of this type and the fact that it is impossible at this point to plan for further operators who may use Alice Springs airport. He does not acknowledge it because it is convenient for him not to. </PARA>
<PARA> He does not show any understanding of the economics of the airline industry. If he had any understanding or any knowledge of the economics of the airline industry he would know that it is very likely, in terms of passenger numbers carried at present by aircraft in the Northern Territory, that if another operator or operators wish to enter Northern Territory air space and use Alice Springs and Darwin airports-in this case, Alice Springs airport-they will need to have a very low cost structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the honourable member for O'Connor might like to get a bit of advice on the potential impact of deregulation of the airline industry on northern Australia. I do not think he understands it. I do not think he has any knowledge of it. Instead of coming in here and crowing about what knowledge he does not have, he ought to go out and find a bit and then tell us what he knows, instead of what he does not know. Today he has expressed very clearly to the House his ignorance on the subject of deregulation of the airline industry, and the economics of the airline industry in northern Australia after deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject of this reference is an extremely important and vital development in the Alice Springs area. It has been something which, despite what the honourable member for O'Connor has had to say, was on the Government's agenda prior to the last election. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) quite correctly pointed out, on transference of the responsibility to the FAC on 1 April he made it plain at that point in time that it would be building a new airport at Alice Springs and that the value would be around $20m. The existing terminal-the honourable member for O'Connor at least acknowledged the need in this instance, previously when he has spoken in debates in this place or on matters like this in relation to public works in the Northern Territory he has not even deigned to acknowledge their need-was built in 1963 and had two subsequent additions. </PARA>
<PARA> The terminal, as the honourable member for O'Connor and every other honourable member in this House who has used that terminal knows, is subject to excessive overcrowding. The airline passenger handling areas are well below acceptable standards and the transportable buildings used as departure holding lounges for security streaming belong in a zoo not at an airport. The working conditions of airline employees are, to say the least, not so much out of date as antediluvian. They have no appropriate recreational areas and no service facilities for staff. It is something which is quite outrageous and something which this particular project will remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Alice Springs airport is one of the busiest in Australia outside the major metropolitan areas. Indeed, in 1980 passenger movements were 210,000. By 1988 that number had increased to 509,000. It is, I understand, the ninth or tenth busiest airport in Australia. It is busier than Darwin. Approximately two-fifths of the air travellers through the Alice Springs airport are tourists and we get 192,000 of those visitors to Central Australia for a short duration as a result of using the airport. It is true, as others have indicated, that the action by the pilots in their outrageous decision which seems to be tacitly supported by the Opposition, has meant, as the honourable member for O'Connor pointed out, an attack on the ability of the airlines industry and the tourism industry to cope. Let me make very clear what the impact of this has been on Alice Springs air travel and indeed on the air terminal. It is not being overstretched at the moment because last week the number of passengers carried to Darwin and returned to Alice Springs was 4 per cent of the norm. </PARA>

Now that is a result of the outrageous pilots' action, an action which unfortunately, as I have indicated, seems to have the tacit support of the Opposition. The facts are that this is a very important construction for Alice Springs. It is important not only because of the need of the tourist industry, and the airline industry in particular, but because it has quite significant community input. If one looks at the plans one sees-and the honourable member for O'Connor quite graciously referred to the nature of the plans-how attractive they are, and indeed they are, because of the community input. There is a theme around the landscape design of the place which will give people an impression of Central Australia as soon as they alight from the aircraft. This is something which is quite unusual in terms of the provision of airport facilities anywhere else in Australia, not only because they are not in Central Australia but simply because they do not, in normal circumstances, accommodate the immediate physical environment. But the Central Australian environment is unique and something which this plan has taken account of. I am happy to support the reference of the Minister for Administrative Services to the Public Works Committee and I applaud the action of the Minister in expediting this reference.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this will be my last speech in a Budget debate, I turn to my maiden speech which was given 15 years ago-on 26 September 1974. I said then that I was proud to represent the then electorate of Balaclava. Indeed for the next 10 years I was very proud to represent it. Subsequently, for the last five years, I have been extremely honoured to represent the electors of Goldstein and very gratified by the many demonstrations of support and their desire to have me continue as their member. I regret as much as they do that that will now not be possible. On that occasion-I quote from page 1918 of Hansard-I also said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I anticipate that during my political life expectancy in this Parliament, the Parliament's greatest problem may well be to raise its own standing in the eyes of the community and to review its role in the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it goes without saying-and I regret to say this-that the Parliament has not done any of those things. It has not lifted its standing in the eyes of the public. It has not, in fact, made itself effective. It has not given itself adequate resources. The only remotely effective part of this Parliament in terms of being a guardian of the people's interests lies in Senate committees and they are underresourced. The Auditor-General's report is not properly made use of because of the lack of resources. The same goes for the Ombudsman. The House of Representatives is nothing more than an electoral college for the Ministry and a rubber stamp for the Executive. If ever any government gets control of the Senate, then the same will be true there. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very sad, because this year is the 300th anniversary of the signing of the Bill of Rights in Westminster which proclaimed the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament, particularly the House of Commons, over the Executive-at that time the King-but it was not very long really before the factions of the day, who could persuade each other on the floor of the chamber, became formulated into parties. Party discipline arose and Cabinet government followed from the time of Queen Anne onwards. So really the sovereignty of parliament-the supremacy of parliament as the representative of the people over the Executive-was very short lived indeed. I am very sad about that in my own way. Compromise though I did most of the time, I must say that I resent the fact that the party discipline and the aspirations of the Executive became so great that we now see elected people overworked and too busy as Ministers representing the non-elected Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> We see a situation in which pressure groups in the community must arise to assert themselves to overcome the strength of the Executive and to demand of the Executive certain statutory rights which the Executive then introduces into this Parliament and ultimately gets rubber stamped. They are, of course, the minimum which can be tolerated by the Executive but the ray of hope-if there is one-is that the courts will interpret what statutory minimum rights are tolerated in ways which may just help the sovereignty of the people. The courts may indeed be prepared to examine the actions of this Parliament, not just in terms of its proper constitutional power vis-a-vis the State parliaments, but whether measures that it passes under an undisputed constitutional power really are serving the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia. So, it is with regret that I say that parliamentary sovereignty over the Executive is now virtually non-existent and the people cannot look to the Parliament to be adequately represented. Having said that, I think that I tried to stay here in the hope of again being a Minister and again helping to produce some influence of sovereignty on the role of the Executive. But anything that rests tenuously upon busy Ministers is not a very satisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also look at what I said in 1974 about inflation. I said then:</PARA>
<PARA>Inflation will continue making a mockery of the so-called tax concessions . . . Without an overall adjustment to our current tax structure the Government really increases its revenue each time inflation reaches new dizzy heights. </PARA>
<PARA>We now find in 1989, 15 years later, that those words are true. In spite of some attempts to provide tax cuts there has not been any serious restructuring of the tax system. Over the past two decades our rate of inflation has averaged 9.1 per cent per annum and between 1980-81 and 1987-88 our inflation rate was 8.3 per cent, whereas the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average for the same period was 4.91 per cent; so we are very well ahead of the OECD average, and that is not something to be proud of. The 1988 Budget forecast for inflation was 4.5 to 5 per cent, yet the inflation rate for the financial year was in fact 7.7 per cent. Even the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Mr Crean, was quoted in the Australian of 16 August as saying that the biggest fault with the Budget was a lack of an anti-inflationary strategy. He said that there was no anti-inflationary strategy beyond trying to contain wages. </PARA>
<PARA> So we find in the present Budget that the forecast for the inflation rate, the rise in the consumer price index, is 7.5 per cent. We also find that bracket creep in respect of taxation made a significant contribution to the surplus that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is boasting about in this Budget. In 1988-89 tax revenue was up 9.7 per cent, although real government expenditure fell. In fact, the $9.1 billion surplus is also boosted by businesses having to pay 85 per cent of their tax within 15 days of the end of the financial year. Firms will have to borrow, of course, to meet this commitment. Perhaps they will borrow from overseas. If they do so, they will aggravate our foreign debt level and it could have negative consequences for investment. An article in the Age of 16 August stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Total collections from individuals are expected to jump by 8 per cent, accounting for well over half the Government's revenue in 1989-90 and continuing the trend for individuals to carry an ever-increasing proportion of the burden. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the speech I made in 1974 I said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I wish to make an observation of a long term nature regarding inflation. It is that our materialism may need to be curbed. Perhaps we will need to search for a happy medium between economic growth for its own sake and the goal of no growth at all . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We have not done that as a country. I do not suggest that we all try to reduce our living standards totally consciously, but we should have a much better national appreciation of our material resources, the need to conserve them and use them sensibly, without going to the extremes of some people in the environmental movement. Of course, if we did not have them putting their more extreme arguments we would not have any debate at all about the nature of materialism in our society and its contribution to our inflation rate. I also said in that speech that in order to have an effective industrial relations machinery, we should have fewer unions and employer organisations. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have over 300 trade unions and many more employer and trade associations. We need more amalgamations on both sides of the industrial fence and a greater centralisation of authority in the hands of persons elected to carry out the democratically ascertained views of the members. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has changed, except that the ACTU, under the quite imaginative and courageous leadership of its Secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, is in fact now setting out to try to reduce those 300 unions to 20 federal national unions which ultimately will be capable of being single unions at different work places, thereby reducing demarcation disputes. I hope he can achieve it; I suspect that if I were here for another 15 years I would see some progress, but progress inevitably must be slow. The Government and employers must do all that they can to assist it. I also said in that speech:</PARA>
<PARA> My final observation is that when sufficient individual employers and unions give practical application to job re-design programs aimed at bringing the overall quality of working life into line with the quality of life outside the working place, and when more managements recognise that affluence and education have created expectations which cannot be satisfied by traditional systems of work, there will be a better chance of some reduction in the level of wage demand relative to productivity improvement. There should be less job turnover, less plant disputation, less absenteeism and more productivity. The wage-cost element of inflation ought therefore to be less than at present. Union leaders would not cease claiming a larger slice of the cake but they would at least be more likely to co-operate in building a larger cake to share. </PARA>
<PARA> Sanity will only return to industrial relations when management recognises that its most important asset is people and when unions recognise that `profit' and `productivity' are not necessarily dirty words. These observations, however, in no way relieve the Government of its duty to control inflation by its own fiscal, monetary and taxation policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, what has changed? I am pleased to say that in that respect a little has changed, and only recently has it been manifest. But I had the privilege in the period 1976 to 1979 of being the Minister for Productivity, and I jawboned, as it were, continually upon the multitude of ways in which we could reduce our unit cost of production at the place of work. I am pleased to say that, by the end of that period and certainly when I came back to that situation after three years as Minister for Immigration, I found as Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations that the message had got through to the trade union movement. The message of actually involving people in the way they do their jobs, what we called employee participation or what the unions call industrial democracy, had not proceeded quite as rapidly in the eyes of management, however. So the single biggest factor still is, as it always has been, the willingness of management to be modern, enlightened and to work with its people. But there are signs of that happening too, and all around us there are seminars being held on people performance and on the moves now being made in what was the Arbitration Commission but is now called the Industrial Relations Commission for both award restructuring and union restructuring. There is now developing slowly, but significantly, an employee relations concept, not a confrontationist industrial relations concept, but an all-embracing concept in which the way people do things, the way they communicate, is now being developed slowly as an ethos and it is only by that that we will get effective working relationships and we will get improved productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> To its great credit, under the equally inspired leadership of Mr Justice Maddern, the Industrial Relations Commission has introduced a concept called the structural efficiency principle. If one looks carefully at the criteria outlined there, one sees that that is the best hope yet for award variations or over-award agreements at the work place on a productivity basis. It is better late than never, and we will all need to show great patience because we are transforming entrenched attitudes. There is a huge onus on management to do precisely that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last five years investment has increased by 10.6 per cent. The Government has spoken of record levels of investment and the benefits that should accrue as a result. But how is industry restructuring faring? It is not faring very well. David Clark, in the Australian Financial Review on 16 August, said:</PARA>
<PARA>While capacity utilisation in manufacturing was higher last year than any time since the early 1970s the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates showed that the average age of the capital stock in manufacturing has increased, not decreased, from 9.9 years in 1966-67 to 12.8 years now. </PARA>
<PARA>How can we take on the rest of the world and how can we really compete with our Asian neighbours when our machinery in our factories is getting older and older? If we look at the Economic Planning Advisory Council's Paper No. 39 of April of this year, called `Productivity in Australia: The results of recent studies', we will see that precise international comparisons are not possible, but EPAC's general impression is that growth in multifactor productivity in Australia was below the OECD average of the 1960s, while the underlying growth in multifactor productivity has remained close to the OECD average since 1973. In manufacturing there may have been some relative deterioration in the first half of the 1980s and the reasons for that are, of course, that we are well ahead comparatively in productivity in agriculture but we are behind in the micro areas that we now identify, the key sectors, notably coastal shipping, port activity, rail transport, and power generation. In all of those areas productivity is below average, and of course it impacts desperately on our competitiveness in manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These poor figures highlight the urgent need for action on the overdue micro-economic reform. The data is there; there are reports galore. There needs to be a political will and a leadership capacity, and so far the Government has not shown those. All employers must make the most of the opportunity of the new Industrial Relations Commission wage fixing principles. They present them with a golden opportunity to take the initiative, to get productivity improvement outcomes at the place of work, and to have a capacity to work with instead of against their employees and the unions which represent them. The challenge for manufacturing industry remains about as great as it did in 1974, and arguably it may even be greater. </PARA>
<PARA> A report on exports by a committee chaired by Professor Helen Hughes was released last week by Senator Button. It really is as dismal to read as was the report of the Jackson Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry, which was released when I first entered the Parliament. Attitudes in manufacturing industry are not changing fast enough. Most of the things that I said in those three years as Minister for Productivity-and, indeed, in my time as Director of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures-need saying again and again. The fact is that local industry in Australia supplies 73 per cent of the requirements of our manufacturing industry. That is similar to the ratio in the United Kingdom, Canada and other medium sized developed economies. But compared with similar sized countries Australian manufacturing has a very low export orientation, and manufactured exports make a relatively small contribution to total exports. In fact, if we look at elaborately transformed manufactures, they account for a little over half of Australia's manufactured exports whereas in comparable economies they are 80 per cent of manufactured exports. </PARA>
<PARA> To build an enduring comparative advantage we have to have much more than just price competitiveness because of adjustments in the exchange rate. We must have areas which require more flexible and adaptive industry structures, management and work force attitudes. Beyond that we must look to comparative advantage in the areas of non-price performance such as quality, design, innovation, marketing and after-sales service. Progress has been made in some structural areas but it is not fast enough, and I regret to say that the Budget before us does nothing to accelerate the pace of reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I start my speech I would like to say to the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) that we will all miss him when he goes, not just because of the sort of contribution he has just made, but because he is such a nice person and has made such a substantial contribution to the Parliament over the years. I am not wishing him a hasty retreat but I am saying these things now because I might not have an opportunity to say them in the future. I thank him very much for being such an excellent colleague on the other side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1989-90 Budget, which is what we are here to discuss today in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), is designed to protect the social and employment gains of the past six years by easing Australia's overheated economy down to a more sustainable pace. That is not as easy as it sounds. The Budget also furthers the Government's program of economic reforms and meets the challenge of Australia's ageing population by establishing a comprehensive policy to encourage working Australians to save now for their retirement. Furthermore, the Budget recognises that Australia must increase its production so there is less pressure to cut its rate of spending. Our strategy as a government has been to bring about the economic reforms necessary to achieve this objective in the longer term. Australia can anticipate a better future but it must be based on an efficient and productive economic base. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget contains many important initiatives. For instance, all pensioners, not just the aged, will receive the extra $2 weekly increase in April next year, which will lift them above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. As most people in this House would know, that has been an objective of the Labor Party and this Labor Government for some time, and I personally am very pleased to see it achieved and in fact exceeded. This increase is over and above indexation. Rent assistance will increase by $5 a week in December 1989. An additional $5 a week will be granted in June 1990 and a further $5 in September 1990. From March 1991 these rent assistance increases will be indexed in line with the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA> A four-year, $100m package for youth was also included in the Budget. It will cover increased housing assistance, major improvements in income support, important means to improve the participation and education of disadvantaged young people, and an upgrading of labour market assistance and community-based health services. </PARA>
<PARA> An element of the Budget which I support very strongly is the extra $15m to be distributed under the existing mortgage and rent relief scheme administered by the States. There is also a $40m package to improve the health of Australian women, which is a very important proposal and one which I think most people in the community would view as essential. An increase of more than $40m over the next two years was also granted for sport and there was a 64 per cent increase in funding for environmental programs, bringing it up to $118.4m. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with other members on this side of the House and, undoubtedly, members on the other side of the House, I have received a number of representations from students in schools in my area about environmental issues. I think that young Australia as well as older Australia will welcome these initiatives on environmental issues, especially things like soil conservation and the one billion tree planting program which have been envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> As was pointed out by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), there has also been a $1.3 billion allocation for roads. A major restructuring of the Commonwealth Employment Service has been budgeted for, including a special $10m program to improve income support and work opportunities for unemployed people aged over 55. That too is an important initiative, as these people are often discriminated against in the community and have a great deal of trouble getting work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget forecasts an increase in real household disposable income of 4 per cent, the highest increase since 1983-84. Household disposable income will also be boosted by the 1 July tax cuts. The tax cuts and the family allowance increases have been fully funded from this Budget. Assistance ranges from around $15 a week for a single taxpayer on average weekly earnings to $30 a week for a family taxpayer with the same income. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is totally committed to reducing Australia's foreign debt and has already established an impressive record in this area. It is worth noting that we have used all of the last three surpluses to pay off debt, that is, $2.1 billion in 1987-88, $5.9 billion in 1988-89 and every cent of this year's $9 billion surplus will be used to pay off debt. The Government has tackled the national savings issue in the most responsible way by lifting government-or public-savings and by encouraging the development of superannuation. Last year superannuation assets grew by $15 billion but our retirement package will ensure that that increases further to a pool of $60 billion a year by the turn of the century. I would like to read into the record part of the Better Incomes Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century document, put out by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in conjunction with the Budget. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government will implement a three-stage reform of the income test and tax overlap. The first stage which was announced in April 1989 will make the income test free area for pensioners 100 per cent tax free by July 1990. This will eliminate tax payable on non-pension income within the pension free area and simplify the way in which the social security system interacts with the tax system. The free area for a single pensioner is currently $40 a week and $70 a week for married pensioner couples. </PARA>
<PARA> The second stage of the Federal Government's reform is to index annually the income test free area, for social security and veterans' pensioners, from 1 July 1991. The free area will continue to be 100 per cent tax free. The free area has never before been indexed by any Federal Government. Maintaining its real value will give pensioners greater certainty in organising their finances. </PARA>
<PARA> The third stage of the Federal Government's reform will address the position of pensioners who have income above the income test free area-that is, part rate pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is committed to introducing from 1995 a better integrated system of social security and tax administration for age and service pensioners and to reducing combined pension withdrawal and tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is a very important quote and I want to make sure that gets into the record because many people do not yet realise the impact that those changes will have on their retirement living standards. Without wanting to point to you in particular, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have to thank for some of these changes the input and contribution of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes, of which you were a member. Your involvement in the seminars in our electorates was very helpful and I believe the people in those areas were extremely grateful for the opportunity of input into the Government's policies. Of course the retirement incomes task force built upon the work undertaken by the social security review group headed by Professor Bettina Cass. All of these things have contributed to an excellent outcome in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing assistance decisions in the Budget were very good. Together with decisions taken at the Premiers Conference, the housing package announced in the Budget amounts to a record $1,290m for direct housing assistance. The restructured Commonwealth-State housing agreement will enable 650,000 Australians to be offered public rental housing over the next five years. Home ownership assistance under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement will increase, with up to 40,000 home loans expected to be made available in 1989 and 1990. Furthermore, as foreshadowed earlier this year, additional assistance will be provided to subsidise the operation of State government approved rental housing trusts, up to $13m in 1989-90 rising to $65m in 1993-94. There has been a special allocation of $15m for a safety net to assist low to moderate income earners who are facing default on their mortgage repayments as a consequence of the effects of high interest rate levels and house prices. As I have said, this assistance will be administered by States through the State mortgage and rent relief schemes. The Commonwealth Government does not anticipate the States having the dollar for dollar input that they normally have. Although the criteria for these schemes vary they generally relate to the size of mortgage repayments as a proportion of total income. More people ought to be looking to see whether these schemes would assist them in their circumstances at present. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude I believe this to be a very responsible Budget which takes account of Australia's current economic circumstances in terms of its surplus and simultaneously addresses the needs of particular sections of the community, such as pensioners, young people and older people saving for their retirement. As most members in this place are aware, economics is not an exact science. Choices must be made between competing needs and wants when allocating scarce resources. With this Budget the Government has once again made the right decisions for the nation and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 there are many things that I could speak about as far as the Government's Budget is concerned, in particular those things concerning people in my electorate. Probably the thing concerning them most, of course, is the general fall in the standard of living that most people in Australia are facing today. One thing I would like to mention very strongly to the House is the very poor attention given to road funding in Australia as a result of this Budget. Of course that is nothing new because we have seen over the past years a general deterioration in our road system and a general fall in the amount of funding. Yesterday in Question Time I know that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) complimented his Government on the 2 per cent increase that it has provided in real terms to road funding. I think any student of economics knows that we really have to look at the base before we start talking about percentage increases, and I am afraid that we have started from a very poor base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past several years the present Federal Government has cut by almost 30 per cent funding for roads in Australia. This has had a very detrimental effect particularly in rural areas. In fact the Federal Government is returning less than 20 per cent of fuel taxes to roads, whereas the former coalition Government returned at least 66 per cent to roads. Labor has increased excise from 6c to 23c in its time in office, but only 5c of that goes into road funding. I seek leave to table a schedule I have here of the amounts that are going from excise on fuel into road funding. It shows, for example, that in 1982-83 there was road funding of $850.9m from a fuel excise revenue of $970m-meaning that nearly all of it was going into road funding. In 1989-90 the Government is receiving $5,645m but only about a quarter of it is going into road funding. So there is a real deterioration there. I can understand, particularly with the present Federal Government and its mismanagement of the economy, that there is no way that all that excise and tax can go into road funding. It needs every cent it can get to keep the economy on the road. </PARA>

We all know the precarious situation that local government is in already and with these cutbacks I just cannot see any more money being spent on roads. I know that every member in this House is aware of the terrible situation we are facing with roads, with their general deterioration, and in particular in this year which has been, especially in my electorate and no doubt in other parts of Australia, very wet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you might ask what has stirred me up about roads. I have always been very interested but this weekend when I left the Parliament on Friday I travelled first by aircraft to Wagga and from then on by car. I spent 27 hours all up in a motor vehicle last weekend, from the time I left to the time I got back to the Parliament. I must say I congratulate the Minister at the table, who is the honourable member for Calare and Minister for Defence Science and Personel (Mr Simmons), on being the first A-grouper, or Broken Hill resident, to be a member of the Ministry in the Federal Parliament. I believe the Minister was in Broken Hill on Friday night receiving debutantes at a ball. At about that hour I was travelling along State highway 14, which is really what I would call a death trap in some areas, dodging kangaroos, dodging potholes and dodging semitrailers. I think that as a State highway it is a disgrace. I believe that the State Government is doing all it can to fund the repair of that road but I think the Federal Government has to do much more. That, nevertheless, does not detract from the congratulations I offer the Minister at the table. </PARA>
<PARA> We have always been aware, as I said-the National Party in particular-of our roads system and how important it is to the nation, not only in providing wealth to the nation but also for its very great social aspect in letting children get to school and letting people travel along the roads to get where they are going, but I would like at this stage to look at some of the roads in my electorate because I am sure that these roads would reflect what is happening in other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On Friday I received a phone call from a gentleman who lives on the Boodilla road, which is a road running to the west of the Coleambally-Darlington Point road. He rang me to tell me that he had a gravel road there but a few hours earlier an ambulance with a patient in it had slipped off the road and gone into the side drains and they were having trouble getting the ambulance out. Fortunately the patient was not critically ill but it gives us some idea of what is happening there. Around $1m worth of produce comes up that road annually, and it is very important to the people of the area to get their produce out. </PARA>
<PARA> I also have a submission here from the Nimmie Pollen Development League. There is a road down there on the Lower 'Bidgee, going through some of the best, most productive country in Australia-the Warwaegae road in the Lower 'Bidgee area between the Sturt Highway and Maude. That road has been cut by floodwaters and the committee is complaining that what will happen is that it will just be restored to its former situation. It will not even be restored to a one in five flood frequency. The reason for that is that there is just not enough money to do it. We find that the organisation in New South Wales responsible for roads, because it cannot improve the roads and take the crests off and do all those things it should be doing, is widening the roads in the hope, I suppose, that we can dodge each other as we go past. They are just two little roads that I have submissions on. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at State highway 22, the Silver City highway from Broken Hill to Tibooburra, we see that it has been closed for 20 days this year. In one stretch it was closed seven days at a time. Although it is sealed for about 50 kilometres, the total length of the road is over 340 kilometres, so we have a long way to go there. Of course the people in Broken Hill and Mildura would like to see that as a north-south highway. </PARA>
<PARA> State highway 21, the famous Cobb highway from Ivanhoe to Booligal-many people have heard of Hell, Hay, and Booligal-has been closed for 69 days so far this year and the Cobb highway action group has made representations to State and Federal Ministers. The State Government is starting to do something about this. The Road and Traffic Authority says that the road has been closed 30 times this year. Of course, when it says that the road has been closed 30 times, it is really longer than that because one closure might last for two or three days or longer, and Ivanhoe, the small town that is served by that road, is isolated on those occasions. It does have a rail service but now the State Government is going to reduce that rail service. I think that has to be looked at very closely because those people in Ivanhoe would be isolated. This year the road was closed from 13 May to 25 August in one stretch to normal 2-wheel drive vehicles, and of course that makes it very difficult for any social contact for those people in Ivanhoe. </PARA>
<PARA>r Of course, if one gets on main road 80, Mossgiel to Hillston, and there have been a few points of rain one will never get off it again. I was on it the other day and, fortunately, just got off before it started to pour, otherwise I would still be there and I would not be in the Parliament. The Cobar to Hillston road is main road 410. I was speaking to the publican at Mount Hope last night and he said that the condition of the road was very poor. I said, `Is that the real description you would give to it?'. He gave me another description which I cannot use in the Parliament. That road is still closed to vehicles over two tonnes. I believe the signs actually have just been taken down but that has been the situation since Christmas. I ask honourable members to imagine that situation. That is a very important road from the southern part of the electorate, the southern part of New South Wales, to the northern part and perhaps into Queensland. That road is impassable. I was on it the other day in a four-wheel drive vehicle and was flat out getting through with that vehicle. So there is no way that a normal vehicle can travel on most of those roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The Lake Cargelligo to Mount Hope road and the Euabalong to Mount Hope road are just tracks. What happens there is that the carrier cannot get supplies into Mount Hope. It is very difficult because anything over two tonnes cannot go on that road. The carrier has an eight-tonne vehicle; so it makes it very difficult unless he buys another vehicle. Of course that area is a great wool producing area and we cannot get the wool out. I believe that anything that holds up our export industries, especially with the situation that the Government faces at the moment with its balance of trade, is a hazard that we just cannot afford. Some of the old-timers there, of course, are saying that the state of the roads is the worst they have seen in a lifetime. I believe it is simply because the roads are just not getting enough funding, and some people are saying, `If we cannot use our vehicles on the road, what is the point in registering them? We register them there and then we pay 79c a litre for fuel in that area and there is no bitumen road'. So honourable members can imagine just how upset they are about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Closer to home, the Griffith to Leeton road is a disgrace. It is packing up, the bitumen is falling apart, there are potholes everywhere and people are finding that very difficult to travel on. We say that speed kills, we say that drink driving kills, but I am saying that bad roads kill also. I spend many hours of my parliamentary career on the roads, hundreds and hundreds of hours driving on roads in my electorate and elsewhere and I find them very difficult to traverse. I find them dangerous. I believe that the more time one spends driving on the road, the more one lessens one's chance by a degree. </PARA>
<PARA> One road I have not mentioned is the famous Lake Cargelligo to Rankins Springs road, with creeks and gravel. Sometimes on that road it is like driving on marbles and we have a problem there because the ambulance and other vehicles really need that road. Of course the school bus uses it and the people in Lake Cargelligo depend on tourism for much of their income. </PARA>
<PARA> In driving from my home town of Griffith to Canberra, I traverse a lot of local government areas. Over the years I have seen those roads deteriorate to such an extent that it is an adventure-not an adventure that I look forward to-to drive from Griffith on bitumen roads. I am not talking about dirt roads now; I am talking about bitumen roads. I do not know how the shires are getting on, but yesterday when I was crossing a bridge a semi-trailer heading towards me crossed over the white line because the bridge is so narrow. Two young ladies in front of me nearly hit the truck. They got such a shock that they pulled up in the middle of the road on the other side of the bridge, not quite sure where they were or what they were doing. I say to the Government that it is not a simple matter just to reduce funding for roads. Roads cause a lot of accidents. As I said, it is not only drink driving and speed that kill; the roads that we have in Australia are killing and injuring people. If our road system is falling apart so dramatically, what is happening to the rest of our inventory-our major bridges, dams, wharves, and our irrigation capital works structures? I think we have real problems on our hands. This Government must address them and try to give some priority to the road system by putting some of the tax which it is so good at taking from people-$10 billion worth-back into the road system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On my way into the chamber I glanced at the speakers list and I noticed that I am to be the last Government speaker in this long debate on the 1989-90 Budget. I was struck by some of the company I am keeping on the speakers list. On the Opposition side the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) spoke a while ago and I am to be followed by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter). Both of these gentlemen have lost pre-selection. I understand that later this afternoon the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) will join the debate. These people, of course, four months ago lost the leadership of their parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want at the outset to express some sympathy to these people and, indeed, some sympathy to the whole of the Opposition because, since those changes in leadership on 9 May, nothing has really gone right for the Opposition. The new leaders promised a new leadership style. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) was elected by his Party as somebody who could function as a better salesman than his predecessor. Members of the Liberal Party made a conscious decision to exchange substance in John Howard for style in Andrew Peacock, in search of a desperately needed new image for their Party. The problem is, of course, as subsequent events showed, that that image was one of deceit and backroom conspiracy. It was compounded by the deceivers parading their deceit on national television and by having those deceivers rewarded with front bench positions. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately for the Opposition, nothing has gone right since then. Its performance over the last four months has been marked by confusion and conflict. Oppositions are supposed to stand for something. They are supposed to offer the public an alternative. But after four months we do not know where this Opposition stands on expenditure cuts or taxation. The Opposition has three major problems. Let me deal with the difficulties it faces on spending cuts. Only in June the Leader of the Opposition very proudly told the Australian people that impressive progress was being made on a program of spending cuts. Let me quote from the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock said . . . that the Opposition's expenditure review process was well advanced and `was cracking through options at an impressive pace.'</PARA>
<PARA> But he again refused to outline any specific area to be cut, saying only that reductions would be bold and would be outlined `at a time of our own choosing'. </PARA>
<PARA>That impressive progress, of course, commenced the month before, in May, when the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), targeted health, education and welfare for the axe. Let me quote again from the Sydney Morning Herald:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Opposition will cut spending on health, education and social welfare if it comes to office, and has urged the Government to do the same immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer, Dr Hewson, repeated yesterday earlier calls for cuts in social welfare with the words `I mean, how many genuinely needy people are there?'</PARA>
<PARA> He added that education and health expenditure would also fall under a Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Treasurer was immediately contradicted by the shadow Ministers for education and health. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the shadow education Minister, told the Herald the day after that the Opposition remained committed to its announced policy that no school would be worse off and that it would maintain the existing number of tertiary places. The shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), said that under a Liberal government Medicare would concentrate on the aged and disadvantaged, and that the changes would not cost anyone more. The honourable member was not talking about any savings in his area, as is so keenly promoted by the shadow Treasurer. In July, the ever helpful Federal President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, weighed in on the shadow Treasurer's side. He supported the attack on welfare. On 27 July, the Australian reported:</PARA>
<PARA> A future Peacock government would take tough decisions on welfare cuts, the federal president of the Liberal Party, Mr John Elliott, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Elliott said the Liberal Party's position was that there were probably too many people dependent on the welfare system, and `that'll have to be changed'.</PARA>
<PARA> About 30 per cent of the population received some form of government hand-out and people had the mentality that `basically we deserve a piece of the welfare cake'. </PARA>
<PARA> Free health care and dole payments without the requirement of work were evidence of `this malaise that government knows best'. </PARA>
<PARA>In August, John Elliott was joined by the ever helpful Senator Stone who spoke of the `shackles of welfare'. Senator Stone complained that the growth of the welfare state has eroded Australia's level of savings. Senator Stone said that 20 years ago Australia had a very high level of savings. What had changed since then, he said, was that Australia had become a welfare state. Senator Stone claimed that people did not need to save for retirement because of the age pension, did not need to worry about unemployment because of the dole, did not need to put away a nest egg for the rainy day if they got sick because of Medicare and did not need to save to educate their children unless they wanted to send them to private schools. Senator Stone obviously wants to cut out all of those important benefits provided by government. </PARA>
<PARA> And so the charade went on during the winter break. On 2 August, shortly before we resumed for the Budget session, the Opposition social security spokesman was subjected to some questioning on the AM radio program on the proposed social welfare cuts. Peter Thompson of AM said to the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly):</PARA>
<PARA> Let's turn to social welfare cuts because it's been suggested by a number of sources in your party, including Senator Stone who talks about shackles of welfare, and by Mr Elliott, that there will be substantial cuts in welfare if the Liberals are elected. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Bradfield replied:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I can assure you they will not be substantial, but of course that's a value judgment as to what you mean by substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is the answer from the straight-talking honourable member for Bradfield. What a mess the Opposition is in on the subject of spending cuts. On the one side we have the cutters: the shadow Treasurer, the Federal President of the Liberal Party and Senator Stone. On the other side we have the shadow Ministers for education and health defending their areas. Somewhere in the middle, sitting on the fence, is the shadow Minister for social security. What was the response of their new Leader to this dilemma? How would he resolve that and sort his people out so that the public would know what the Liberal Party stands for? His answer was, basically, to con the public. It was revealed at the end of July that, in fact, the Leader of the Opposition had two lists of expenditure cuts, one public and one secret. Let me read from the Sydney Morning Herald of 26 July an article by Milton Cockburn:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Opposition has decided not to release all its proposed spending cuts when it outlines its taxation and expenditure policies after next month's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It has decided, instead, to draw up two lists of spending cuts: one for public release and another, detailing more severe cuts, which will be kept secret. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision is likely to be controversial-</PARA>
<PARA>which is an understatement-</PARA>
<PARA>since the Opposition has consistently called on the Government to make further cuts in government spending in order to reduce interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, is prepared to weather criticism that the proposed cuts do not go far enough and do not match its rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> Key shadow ministers have decided this is preferable to the Opposition revealing all its cards now and finding itself the target of disaffected interest groups which will be hurt by the proposed cuts. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the response of this new Leader who was elected by his Party on 9 May to offer the Liberal Party a new image. The Opposition plays the same game with the public as the honourable members for Ryan (Mr Moore) and O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) played with their former Leader. They play the same game with defence spending. The Liberal Party Federal Council was quite happy to vote for an additional $9 billion of defence expenditure, at the same time as its leadership was calling for cuts of a billion dollars in total government spending, and hopes to get away with it. The Opposition cannot come clean on spending and it cannot come clean on tax, the second of its major problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In June the Leader of the Opposition promised a flatter, two-tiered tax scale and a mortgage relief scheme. By 3 August he had backed away from the mortgage relief scheme. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 3 August stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, said yesterday he had dropped an earlier commitment to announce some form of mortgage relief scheme after the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite cannot decide on their tax policy. Under the Liberals, in the unlikely event that they might be elected some time this side of the year 2000, we do not know whether we will be looking at a top rate of 49, 47, 39 or 30 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition in his reply to the Budget said, `We will ensure that the top rate for individuals is not higher than the company tax rate', but a day after that he was backing away from that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a similar story with his ill-fated inflation adjustment scheme for savings and for borrowings. This scheme that was run around the country by the Leader of the Opposition as part of the mock election campaign has vanished without trace. Quite correctly it has vanished without trace because it is a dishonest proposition that clearly has not been thoroughly thought through by the Opposition. On the question of taxation, the Leader of the Opposition is trying to win with waffle. But the Australian public knows better than that and will demand better than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The third problem faced by the Opposition is a problem of timing, because not only do we not know what the Opposition stands for; we do not even know when it will know what it stands for. We do not know when its policies will be released. Let me read briefly from the transcript of AM on 1 August to give an idea of the confusion that the Opposition is suffering on the question of timing. This is an interview by Peter Thompson with the shadow Treasurer. Peter Thompson asked:</PARA>
<PARA> When will you be ready to announce this one way or the other, whether this is going to be policy?</PARA>
<PARA>They are talking about inflation adjustment. The shadow Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is just depending on the final costings, now. So what we are saying is we are investigating it at a fairly advanced stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Peter Thompson asked:</PARA>
<PARA> But how soon is that?</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, I can't put a date on it, I'm sorry. </PARA>
<PARA>Peter Thompson asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Why not?</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA> It depends when the costing process is complete. We are not far away, and it is in that context that it's been raised. </PARA>
<PARA>Peter Thompson said, `All right'. He was obviously not going to get anything out of him on the question of timing, so he moved on. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I want to raise again the issue of fairness. It seems to be central to the Liberal Party campaign for this next election. </PARA>
<PARA>It certainly is. The Liberals are campaigning on the slogan of `A Fair Go'. It is an interesting concept of a fair go that this Party of incentive believes that you give rich people incentive by giving them more and poor people incentive by giving them less. The slogan of `Fair go' is supposed to tap an important vein in the Australian consciousness. I hope also that it taps a vein within the Liberal Party. Certainly those groups of people who went to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) on the evening of 8 May believed in the concept of fair go. They said to the honourable member for Bennelong and the right honourable member for New England, `We will be fair and you can go', and certainly they went. There is an equally important Australian value that I think ought to be tapped as well, and that is the concept not of fair go but fair dinkum. The Australian people have shown over many elections that they will not vote for a party that is not fair dinkum. It is clear to me-it is clear to anybody who has observed politics for any length of time in this country-that the Liberal Party under the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) since 9 May and the National Party under the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) since 9 May, are simply not fair dinkum with the Australian public; they are not fair dinkum even with themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, it has been a great pleasure to take part in the debate on this the seventh of Labor's Budgets. I look forward at about the same time next year to participating in the debate on Labor's eighth consecutive Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Iraq's Minister for Agriculture arrived in Australia on Friday, reportedly to buy $300m worth of wheat and to ask the South Australian Government to resume its agricultural development program in Iraq. The Minister was greeted not only with the pilots strike but also with a four-hour delay because Sydney baggage handlers had decided suddenly not to unload bags from numerous international flights which had arrived in Sydney at that time. It is as though elements of our work force have a death wish. Imposing bans on incoming tourists and businessmen who actually want to give us their money is beyond belief. But that is exactly what is happening, and until we change the system it will continue to occur. Never has it been clearer that the current system has had it. Pilots strikes, baggage handlers in Sydney, international mail handlers in Melbourne, and tomorrow meat inspectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, of course, has steadfastly refused to bite the bullet. Instead it seeks to shoot the messenger. Instead of trying to torpedo Moody's Investors Service, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would better serve the nation by taking action in concert with his colleagues to resolve the problems confronting the nation. Moody's said that `the persistence of structural weaknesses embedded in Australia's domestic and international position, such as intransigent rigidities in the local labour and transport market' were constraining international competition. They are right. We all know they are right. Whilst there has been a revolution in industrial relations in the rest of the world, we in Australia are stuck with a nineteenth century system. Our economy is being strangled by this Government's inability to initiate the changes necessary for the nation to shake off the shackles of our antiquated industrial relations system. Unless we immediately step up the rate of change and internationalise our economy we will confirm our position as a stagnant backwater in world trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims it has the runs on the board because it says, `Well, we deregulated the exchange rate and the banks'. But that is only one side of the coin. The Government has refused to go on with the job and allow our industries to internationalise through industrial relations reform. Moody's correctly pointed out that it is the continued slow pace of structural adjustment which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in the foreign currency debt. Further, it said there was insufficient progress in generating additional export earning capacity and in restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains. Moody's is right. Everyone but the Government admits it is right. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's industrial relations record is a disaster. It started out with a policy of consensus which ensured the existing rigidities and inefficient work practices were maintained. Secret backroom deals between the Government and the unions were made with a premium on peace and little or no regard for our competitiveness. The result is that we have the worst balance of payments ever, the highest foreign debt ever, and our credit rating is on the slide. The real advances made in the industrial relations field have been made not with the Government's assistance but despite the Government. Where the Government has intervened it has been a disaster. This Labor Government's record has been to avoid significant changes and to maintain the status quo because its union mates have become comfortable and the last thing they want is change. </PARA>
<PARA> Nearly everyone in Australia now agrees that reform is necessary and nowhere is it more urgent than on the waterfront. Substantial featherbedding developed on the waterfront in a period when our great rural and resource exports were at their premium. The rorts are now so bad they are actually undermining our ability to compete. Urgent action is required. Instead of immediate remedial action the Government, unwilling to upset its union mates, has gone for a gradualist approach-the gradualist negotiated change approach. It is expensive and provides no guarantee that the much needed fundamental reform will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> A key issue to fundamental reform of the waterfront is that employers and employees must be free to negotiate their own pay and conditions. Until that is the case, pay and conditions will continue to be uniform among companies and competition will be restricted. Without real competition in all aspects of the operation of the waterfront there is no guarantee that improved cost effectiveness will be passed on to the users of waterfront services in the form of lower prices. An environment must be created wherein different companies are able to hire and fire employees, operate different work practices and rostering arrangements and eliminate artificial labour demarcation. This will require changes to industrial legislation. Those changes must allow for voluntary agreements, changes to union coverage arrangements, voluntary unionism, improved dispute resolution mechanisms, effective compliance provisions, essential services legislation, and secret ballots before strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be greater competition between ports. Potential competitors are often run by the same port authority. For example, the Port of Melbourne Authority runs both Westernport and Melbourne. Port authorities should be operated under specifically commercial charters, run mainly by the users-the importers and exporters-who have vested interests in a cost effective, reliable operation. Within ports, there should be greater competition between companies providing the services, such as the stevedores and those who provide the towing services. That competition may have to be achieved by a tendering process, those tenders being for relatively short periods</PARA>
<PARA> The area with the greatest potential for improvement through competition is in the area of employment, and the role of the Waterside Workers Federation monopoly in this area is all important. Employers should be free to determine how many employees, including casuals, they require. They should not be required to recruit new employees from the Waterside Workers Federation registry. The Inter-State Commission and the Government's reform package anticipate a significant role for the Federal Government. A reform program that has to rely on government intervention to tackle directly such fundamental reform issues as the high level of disputation, restrictive work practices, manning levels, training arrangements or the level of redundancy payouts, is fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> The most telling indication that the Government's reform program does not go to the root issues is its promise that, if the reform program does not result in lower costs to the users of the system, the Government will use its pricing authority to achieve that end. The waterfront does not need another set of regulations, even if those regulations are intended to produce cost reductions. The role of the Federal Government should be to provide an effective legal framework preventing an abuse of power and allowing forces of the marketplace and competition to prevail. The federal and port coordinating committees should be dismantled and the special jurisdiction of the Industrial Relations Commission in waterfront matters should be abolished. Cross-subsidisation between ports should be abolished by the elimination of the levy arrangements. Individual employers would then be directly responsible for the employment conditions to which they agreed in respect of their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the country's need to improve its trade situation there is a desperate demand for fundamental reform on the waterfront. The urgency is there. The Inter-State Commission has focused public attention on the abuses of the waterfront. The time and climate for fundamental reform are ideal. The various reports of the Inter-State Commission which analyse past attempts at reform on the waterfront show that negotiated changes and externally imposed programs may work for a little while, but the waterfront gradually reverts to the situation that we face today. In other words, once the heat and glare of the national spotlight are off, then overmanning and restrictive work practices are likely to re-emerge. Therefore, we should be funding a program of fundamental reform which does not rely on externally imposed measures and does not maintain the same structures which gave rise to the current problems. I fear that the $190m we are about to commit to waterfront reform will eventually be wasted and, what is worse, we will lose this opportunity for the reforms we so desperately need. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Hawke-Keating Government is backing away from meaningful reform on the waterfront. It opposes meaningful restructuring of our abattoirs and now it has inflamed and exacerbated the pilots dispute. Where is the great negotiator? Instead of consensus in bringing the pilots and airlines together, the Prime Minister has gone out of his way to set them apart-resulting in one of the most expensive industrial relations stand-offs this country has known. But then again, consistency in industrial relations is not the strong suit of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> National interest and our international competitiveness play little part in the secret deals done by this Government with its union mates and, in some cases, its employer mates. They perpetuate a centralised wage fixing system which encourages flow-ons and secret deals, which are at the heart of our industrial chaos. The community is fed up with this outdated system where we seem to be on strike more often than not and where our standard of living suffers as a result. The old industrial relations system must go. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age today both report on the loss of support for the existing industrial relations system. Let me quote from the Sydney Morning Herald. The headline reads `Support Falls for Industrial Commission'. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a significant decline in public support for the Arbitration Commission in the past eight years, the latest Saulwick Herald poll has found. Only half the voters believe the Commission, now called the Industrial Relations Commission, should continue to have a central role in fixing wages compared with 69 per cent of voters in a Herald poll conducted in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Further proof of the unravelling of the current system is evidenced in the Australian Financial Review report today which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The vulnerability of the wage fixing system has been exposed in the ACTU's postponement of a special unions conference for a week after failing to make sufficient headway with agreements in five key industrial awards. </PARA>
<PARA>We cannot go on trying to bandaid together this hopelessly irrelevant industrial relations system. Only when the existing system is replaced by meaningful employer-employee enterprise-based negotiations, with pay increases related to productivity, will we as a nation get back on our feet. Under Labor our industrial relations system has effectively conferred on the unions monopoly or near-monopoly power. These monopolies have sapped business of the much-needed will to innovate. They have made us internationally uncompetitive and they have institutionalised outrageous rorts, especially on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed to lead the nation out of this morass is a program of reform which is radical and forward thinking enough to break down the barriers to competition and thrust us into the twenty-first century of world competition. This Government will never be capable of conceiving or implementing such a plan because it is tied to its union masters. The coalition has the policies, and after the next election it will implement those policies to achieve those goals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major flaw in this year's Budget was its failure to effectively address the long term need for restructuring and micro-economic reform of the Australian economy. Not surprisingly, I want to address my remarks on the Budget tonight to the searing effects on the Australian economy and on the livelihoods of many hundreds of thousands of Australians and their families of the crippling air pilots strike which has now been going on for almost three weeks. I have said on other occasions that the highest unclimbed peak of economic reform in Australia is the deregulation of our rigid centralised industrial relations system. I commend the remarks of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), not only in relation to the strangulation of our waterfront but also on the need to bring about industrial relations reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is now happening with the pilots dispute is absolutely seminal to the future of industrial relations in this country. It is a watershed in the industrial relations experience of Australia, and the shriller the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) becomes, the more he shouts-and I am reminded of that beautiful comment of Patrick White of somebody screeching like a galah or a cocky when I hear the Prime Minister at Question Time-the more hectoring he becomes, the more convinced I am that he is in bother. There are many ironies about the pilots dispute, and the greatest irony of all, of course, is that the Prime Minister is now on a course of action that has as its almost inevitable consequence a fundamental weakening of an industrial relations system that he has spent all of his adult life championing, because bit by bit, day by day, abuse by abuse, he is driving the parties to a situation where this dispute can only be settled by voluntary agreements outside his beloved centralised wage fixation system. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no argument that the Prime Minister has deepened this dispute by his unreasoned and intemperate language. Not only was he needlessly abusive to airline pilots, but he was positively patronising to bus drivers. What earthly right has this man, who once led the trade union movement of Australia, to talk as though some occupation in life was so low that you could compare people that you were abusing with that occupation? But that is what he did. </PARA>
<PARA> But more seriously than that, the fatal flaw of the Prime Minister in this dispute has been to equate the national economic interest with preservation of the centralised wage fixation system. At every stage of the dispute the Prime Minister has put preserving the system above anything else. No system known to man is so perfect that it becomes an end in itself. An industrial relations system is not an end in itself; an industrial relations system is a means to procuring a more productive and a more competitive economy. When it cannot deliver the goods, one changes the system. One does not impose the system in a rigid fashion upon our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk for a moment about the industrial relations policy of the Liberal and National parties. I have a copy of it in front of me. It is pretty relevant to this debate because it addresses this problem. Under the paragraph headed `Voluntary Agreements', the policy says:</PARA>
<PARA>A principal objective of this policy is to return the primary responsibility for industrial relations, including the determination of wages and conditions, to employers and employees at the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister ought to read that over and over again. When he does so, he might have some of the elements for understanding what is involved in this particular dispute. Our policy does not say that the system is more important than the economy. We do not say that we want to preserve a system irrespective of its consequences. We believe in allowing employers and employees to bargain at an enterprise level, because we believe that those bargains are more likely to produce productive outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fallacy in modern industrial relations to believe that any given level of wage increase is unsustainable. It is only unsustainable if it cannot be afforded, if it is not matched by productivity gains. At the end of the day, I believe that this dispute will be settled on the basis of an increase for pilots in return for an increase in productivity. That, of course, is the industrial relations policy, not of R. J. L. Hawke or of Bill Kelty, or of the Australian Labor Party or of the Government of this country; that is the industrial relations policy of the Liberal and National parties. That is why this dispute is so supremely ironic. We have heard the Prime Minister shouting at the pilots. When one is a national leader and one has nothing left to do except shout, one has a real problem. That, of course, is the dilemma of the Prime Minister in this particular dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> That infamous German propaganda Minister, if he were around today would be proud of this infamous attempt by the Government to say that the dispute, the strike, is in some way the fault of the Opposition. No doubt the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) will talk parrot-like about that. At every Question Time the Prime Minister says, `Oh, it's the Opposition that has caused this strike'. What an incredible proposition! This dispute, which is driving thousands of small businessmen bankrupt as I speak, is occurring because the Government's system has failed, and because the Prime Minister has failed in his responsibility of national leadership. We do not have it because of the policy of the Opposition. If the policy of the Opposition were listened to by the Government it might have created a better climate for solving the dispute than it has to date. </PARA>
<PARA> What is wrong with the pilots and the airlines talking directly? What is wrong, as suggested by Dr Henderson of the Sydney Institute, with the parties using a private negotiator or arbitrator? He suggested somebody of the standing of Sir Laurence Street, the former Chief Justice of New South Wales. Plenty of private arbitration and negotiating is done in the United States and in other parts of the world. Why can we not be imaginative enough and radical enough to embrace that as a solution? Why are we so hidebound and, on this issue, so conservative? I am a great conservative on certain things, but when it comes to cleaning up a rotten, crumbling industrial relations system, I am a radical, because I think we need changes to our system. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to be part of the new Pacific rim, if we are to have a truly productive and competitive economy, we have to get a better industrial relations system that rewards people when they work harder and is based upon the principle that there is nothing wrong with a wage increase provided it is based on productivity. That is the fatal weakness of this Government. It cannot see that, and it is clinging to a demented legalism. For a non-lawyer, the Prime Minister has a manic preoccupation with form over substance. He has a total preoccupation with the form of the industrial relations system, to the detriment of the substance. That is why he has bungled this dispute from start to finish. That is why he has attempted, as a palliative, to misrepresent the policy of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of the Opposition is built on two principles. It is built, first and foremost, on the practical recognition that we will never permanently and enduringly free the labour markets of this country until we permanently and enduringly reduce the unfair share of power held by the trade union movement. Any people who believe that we can have a decentralised industrial relations system without, at the same time, reducing the legal privileges of the trade union movement are kidding themselves; they are trying to have their cake and eat it, too. We have to take away the legal privileges of the trade union movement. We have to break the mentality of the report of the Hancock Committee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems that said that we cannot treat the trade unions like everybody else because they are too strong. What an incredible proposition! That, of course, is what the industrial relations system of the present Government is built on. The Prime Minister is not doing the bidding of the average Australian family in this dispute. He is not doing the bidding of the tourist industry. He is not doing the bidding of the airlines. He is doing the bidding of the mandarins of the industrial relations club. That is why he is taking the attitude that he is taking. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy is built on two principles. It is built, firstly, on a recognition that to permanently and effectively free the labour markets of this country we will need to reduce the legal privileges enjoyed by the trade union movement. I am not wanting to exterminate the trade unions. The union movement has a legitimate role in the fabric of national life in Australia. But I will never accept the proposition that it is entitled to legal privileges that nobody else has. That is the situation we have at present. That is the first principle on which our policy is based. </PARA>
<PARA> The second principle on which we base our policy is that very simple and important Liberal notion of freedom; that is, that individuals should have the right to bargain in terms of how they make their arrangements. The only way we will have a more productive Australian nation is by allowing free men and women to work together and to have an industrial relations and wage fixation system that says that a wage increase that is earned is a wage increase justified and a wage increase that is not earned is not a justified wage increase. That should be the simple proposition of our industrial relations system. It ought not to be complicated. It ought not to be beyond the wit of men and women to ensure that over time a system like that can be worked towards. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I regard this pilots dispute as being so important to the industrial relations future of this country. I do not think industrial relations in Australia will ever be the same again, as a result of this dispute. It will go down with the gaoling of Clarrie O'Shea and some other events as being one of the truly seminal occurrences in our industrial relations system, because what it has done is that it has exposed a fatal weakness in the system that has been the Holy Grail of this Government for 6 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> What it has done also is propel the Prime Minister of this country on a course of action which is leading inexorably to the adoption of the very policy of the Opposition that he day by day despises. It is not the Opposition that is in the dock. It is not the Opposition that ought to be cross-examined and pilloried by the media on this matter. It is the Government. It is its system that spawned this strike. It is its system which has led to a state of affairs where people are going out of business. It is its Prime Minister who, by his intemperate and abusive language, has exacerbated an otherwise, in any event, very difficult and tragic dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the House that it is time, remembering a very important document in the political history of Australia, for plain thinking. The plain thinking that is needed in this dispute is to understand first of all that it is a product of the Hawke-Kelty-Keating centralised industrial relations system. It is not a product of the industrial relations policy of the Liberal and National parties. That is bit of plain thinking No. 1, The No. 2 bit of plain thinking is that the Prime Minister of this country, who won his spurs as the great conciliator and negotiator, bringing together bruised spirits and egos, has performed abysmally. He has forfeited the most precious gift of a national leader, and that is that capacity to retain an aloof detachment. He has forfeited the authority of his office by becoming so partisan and so hectoring and so involved that he is no longer trusted or believed by a large number of people who are involved in this dispute. The essential prerequisite, even if one does not like a Prime Minister because of his politics, is to believe that at the end of the day he will be an honest broker in the national interest. This man does not sound like nor does he act like an honest broker in the national interest in this dispute. He sounds like a screaming trade union official on the back of a truck, and that is a manifestly inadequate contribution to this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that I regard this strike, this dispute, painful though it is for many tens of thousands of people, as a dispute that at the end of the day may provide a way out of a crumbling and increasingly flawed industrial relations system. I predict now that this dispute will end up as having been a landmark in the hard march towards a freer, more flexible industrial relations system. The supreme irony is that one of the great facilitators of that will have been the Prime Minister of Australia, who spent all of his adult life defending and preserving and championing an industrial relations system that is now crumbling in front of his eyes. Of course, the greatest irony of all is that I do not think he quite understands that that is what he is doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I came into the House hoping to hear the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) speak on the Budget. Instead I heard a raving speech about the pilots dispute and the industrial relations system. Therefore I am obliged on behalf of this side of the House to answer the various claims that were made by the honourable member for Bennelong. On every point the honourable member obviously has no historical memory. The industrial relations system which he wants to bring back is the one which destroyed this country in 1981-82 and led to half a million people being unemployed. The honourable member has forgotten about that. He has forgotten that it was the laissez-faire system that the Opposition is proposing now, getting rid of the Industrial Relations Commission, reducing the power of the Industrial Relations Commission--(Quorum formed). I was replying to the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong, who tried to lecture us on industrial relations in talking on the Budget and tried to tell us that we ought to adopt the Liberal-National Party policy, which is the very same policy that destroyed this country in 1981-82 and created half a million unemployed people. He said that the pilots should be allowed to go outside the system and to negotiate directly with the employers even if it means 30 per cent, 40 per cent, 50 per cent, whatever rise they might want. He said that it does not matter what the wage rise is; whatever rise people can gain from their employer. That is exactly what happened in 1981-82 when the then Government got rid of the centralised system and there were very big wage rises across the board, throughout the nation. Inflation went through the roof and unemployment rose, and it rose and it rose, and in one year half a million people were out of work. Unfortunately, Malcolm Fraser listened to the honourable member for Bennelong, John Howard, in those times. As a result, all those people suffered poverty and unemployment. The honourable member ought to be ashamed of himself for giving people lectures about economics after what happened in that period of his government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember very clearly what was happening in our electorates at that time with all that unemployment and poverty. The honourable member comes into this House and says, `Let's do the same thing again. Let's bring in this industrial relations system. Let's destroy the nation'. That is not to mention the huge industrial disputation that occurred and all the lost time in productivity. The honourable member talked about productivity. Does he really think that if the unions are left in this situation of total across-the-board laissez faire, being able to argue with every employer, that will create some kind of industrial relations stability? It would create chaos in this country. The Opposition has only one recipe for the current economic situation, and that is a recession and a depression, with more and more unemployed people. That is what the honourable member for Bennelong is arguing for in putting forward this formula. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talks about the pilots as if the situation they have brought about is totally justified. He did not say a single critical thing about the pilots. He did not say a single thing about the fact that what they are claiming, an increase of $30,000 a year, is equivalent to the average wage of the average Australian. The honourable member suggests that the pilots were entitled to argue with their employers. Of course, the employers in that circumstance, not having the protection of rules or of the Arbitration Commission, would probably have been forced to give in to them. Who would have suffered? The whole of the Australian community would have suffered, because the consumers of the airlines, the travelling public, the tourism industry and, of course, the ordinary consumer whose products have to be transported by air-everyone would have suffered because the cost of all these things would have increased. The honourable member for Bennelong dares to come in here and try to lecture the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and everyone else in this House about how to handle the pilots dispute, by referring to the Opposition's nonsensical industrial relations policy which has proved to be a disaster, as I mentioned, not only in Australia but overseas. The same policy was attempted by Margaret Thatcher in England and led to a situation where unemployment jumped from fewer than one million people to more than three million people. There are more than three million unemployed under that industrial relations policy in Britain, not to mention the huge level of industrial disputation that occurred in those early days when Margaret Thatcher was attempting to implement the policy. Of course, she finally gave it away as a bad joke. She has a different policy now. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we get from the Opposition? Ideas which are 10 to 15 years old, which have been abandoned in most countries of the world. They are put forward here by the honourable member for Bennelong and others as if they are original. If the honourable member for Bennelong thinks he is going to get back on the front bench by putting forward proposals like this, I say to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) that it is time he rejected not only the honourable member for Bennelong, but also a lot of the policies which were drafted during the period when the honourable member for Bennelong was leader. The reason why the Opposition is down to a popularity rate of less than 20 per cent in the polls is that the Australian people do not want any of its policies. The Australian people understand what it stands for. It is not enough to change the face, to put in Andrew Peacock instead of John Howard. It is necessary also to change policies and to get some constructive alternatives. We are certainly not getting that from the Opposition at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is absolutely correct on the pilots dispute. The Opposition is all over the place. The Leader of the Opposition says he does not support the pay claim. The honourable member for Bennelong says he does. Half of the front bench say they do; the other half say they do not. What is going on here? Is this a group that wants to govern Australia? What nonsense! The honourable member for Bennelong said, `Of course, we have to match pay rises with productivity gains'. Let me point out a couple of things. The policy of the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions-the accord-has provisions within it which allow for increases based on productivity. But the point is that one must show those to an independent commission. One must go to a commission and argue for a productivity increase. Under the proposals of the honourable member for Bennelong, all one would have to do is go to one's employer and say, `Look, we believe we have a productivity increase; give us the money or else'. That is what would happen in terms of industrial relations. One would not have to prove to anyone that one has any productivity increase. </PARA>
<PARA> If the airline pilots believe that they are capable of productivity increases, let them go before the Industrial Relations Commission or let them work out some way of going before the Commission. Even if we have to work out an intermediate process, the Government is willing to listen to proposals that are sensible in terms of the guidelines. If the pilots had, from the beginning, gone before the Commission and argued on the basis of productivity increases and on work value, they would have got some increase. There is no doubt about it. Instead, they chose a course which was intended to challenge the whole system of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot afford to allow that system to break down, for the very important reason that it is the basis of the accord between the union movement, the Government and the employers which has allowed this country and this economy to be guided through some of the most difficult periods in its history. If it were not for that accord there would have been a recession as a result of the loss in consumer prices in 1986. We would definitely have fallen into a recession if it had not been for the cooperation of the trade union movement and the accord. If it had not been for the wage-tax trade-off for this year we would not have been in a position to achieve the kinds of gains which we will achieve as a result of this Budget. That is the point I wanted to talk about at the beginning of my remarks, before I referred to industrial relations issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to what the honourable member for Bennelong said, let me say that the Government is not on a course of trying to break the pilots, bring them down or anything of that kind. It was the pilots who decided to go outside the system. It was the pilots who decided to resign en masse. They were not sacked; they resigned en masse. It was the pilots who decided to adopt a confrontationist tactic. That does not mean that we are totally inflexible and are not willing to discuss ways of resolving this situation. Of course we are. The Prime Minister indicated so yesterday and today. Let the pilots, through any medium they choose, indicate that they are prepared to go before the Commission and argue their case on the basis of productivity, as every other worker in this country has to do. They will be considered, and they may be able to achieve a wage increase-perhaps not 30 per cent, perhaps something less, but nevertheless something which is reasonable and which will allow for an increase in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the pilots recognise this fact there can be no solution. The Government cannot allow a group to go totally outside the guidelines and demand a pay rise of 30 per cent, irrespective of productivity. To do that would be to undermine the very basis on which we have guided the economy in the last few years. That is not to say that workers will not get wage increases. Of course they will. We have in place the most revolutionary award restructuring process in the history of this country. This process not only will allow workers to enter higher categories of work; it will provide for more broadly based and more fulfilling work, and it will allow them a wage increase. That is what we have put in place. The award restructuring process is going on right now. So we are not opposed to wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, workers can go to the Commission and, if they can demonstrate productivity, get additional increases. All these things are possible within the system. As one nation we must be capable of working within the one system if we are going to be capable of guiding this economy through the present difficulties. And we are going to guide this economy through the present difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget contains positive elements which will guide the economy through its recent difficulties. The economy will be slowed but, as most of the commentators are saying, the Treasurer will achieve a soft landing, something which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) could not do when he was Treasurer. Instead, every time he tried to slow down the economy, what happened? There was a recession. There was unemployment. There was not a slowing down process at all. We almost had a depression in 1981-82. We are going to achieve this soft landing without the creation of unemployment, without severe difficulties. When we do so we will be better able to deal with our present current account problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The most revolutionary changes that are taking place besides the award restructuring changes are the superannuation changes announced by the Treasurer. The honourable member for Bennelong did not even mention those changes. In fact, most of the speakers on the other side, commenting on the Budget, did not even mention the superannuation changes. What will those changes mean? In addition, as I said, to workers improving their position by getting wage increases, they will also receive additional superannuation payments. This Government is the first government in the history of Australia that has enabled every worker to go into a superannuation scheme. That is what we have done, through the agreement with the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we doing with this Budget? We are making major concessions to the superannuation funds to enable them to expand their schemes. The superannuation funds will increase in size and their role in the economy will become more important. Their capacity to deal with the savings problem will increase-a problem that was referred to by some members of the Opposition. But Opposition members had no suggestions. They had no ideas about how to deal with the problem of savings. We had a nonsensical idea from the Leader of the Opposition. He suggested that we might not tax part of the interest on savings. But when he was asked to give specifics on that matter, he ran away. He could not give specifics. Every specific he could come up with would have been disastrous. The scheme was not fundable, and the Leader of the Opposition was made to look a fool in the media because he could not come up with a scheme that was any good. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we done? With this Budget we have put into place revolutionary changes on superannuation which are going to increase the total net savings of the nation by a dramatic amount. That will be a very significant change for this country. What are we going to do as time goes on and we approach the next election? The changes announced in the Budget will bite and they will have a significant impact on the economy. The Australian people will be able to see a gradual reduction in interest rates, not as a result of some ad hoc policy but as a result of the macro-economic strategy that has been adopted by the Government, including the changes on superannuation. The people of this country will be able to see that they have in the medium and long term a very secure future in terms of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things about the superannuation changes is that they are going to encourage superannuation companies to invest in Australian corporations and in Australian productive enterprises. That is one of the things which for many many years we have been saying need to be done, but nobody on the other side has done anything about it. During the period in office of those opposite half of Australia's manufacturing collapsed. We have been picking up Australian manufacturing in every part of Australia, and now with these changes there will be an even bigger boost in investment for manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> We totally reject the arguments of the honourable member for Bennelong. He should be ashamed to put forward those arguments in support of what the pilots have done in going outside the system. We call on the pilots to get back into the system and we will be ready to help them and to negotiate a solution as soon as possible. We certainly reject the outrageous claims being made about the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sterility and rigidity of the prejudices of the Labor Party have never been better demonstrated than in that sad speech by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). If he were of some consequence I would respond, but the point of it all is that unfortunately he echoes so much of the sentiments of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Rather incredibly, without consultation, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who preceded me on our side of the House in this debate, have, as I see it, perceived what is the core of the absolute failure of the Budget on this Tuesday only three weeks after it was first presented. It is incredible that we have a strike, if one wishes to call it that, such as this. As I see it, we have a dispute that is now drawing its ever tightening reins around the whole economy and the Government is walking away from doing anything about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At Question Time today we heard the Prime Minister say they were prepared to do something within the system. They are not prepared to do anything outside the system. We have seen a climate where not only in the airlines but in the tourist industry and in all those who service the tourist industry unemployment is growing, casuals have already been stood down, and occupancy rates in hotels and motels are minimal. The whole of the system about which there were proud boasts by Government Ministers only a few weeks ago is now grinding to a halt. We have heard from successive members about the number of overseas tourist operators who cancelled their journeys to Australia. It is all happening while the Prime Minister sits back and says, `It's all too hard; it's all got to be dealt with within the system'. </PARA>
<PARA> In a few words on the Budget tonight I want to look at how I believe that dispute can be resolved. I also want to say that as far as I am concerned a significant part of the blame for the dispute and the deterioration of employment and the prejudice to Australia's present tourist income and its potential tourism in the future lies with the Prime Minister himself. There are three things the Prime Minister has done. First, he made that incredible statement about bus drivers, and we heard about that tonight from the honourable member for Bennelong. Not only was it belittling the bus drivers but also it was totally prejudicial to the highly sophisticated skills that airline pilots must have to pursue that very excellent safety record that is really something that we on this side of the House wish to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, he carried on about learning to fly in seven hours when he was at Oxford. The reality is that, whatever the Prime Minister did at Oxford, the difference between his level of flying skill and that of airline pilots is really as great as the demonstrable difference in skill that I can see between preceding Liberal-National Party Prime Ministers and the present Prime Minister. Unfortunately he was a high flier then and he has been pretty low flying ever since. The third thing he did was to exacerbate the whole of the dispute. In my view offering the carrot of compensation to the domestic airline operators was as catastrophic as the things he said about the airline pilots themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The airline operators, if they believe that the Government-rightly or wrongly-is going to provide compensation, of course are going to feel that they can accept the dictates of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and Bill Kelty. How incredible in this dispute to have the leader of the ACTU saying, `You cannot stand down any of those people who are affected by this airline dispute'. And why not? The only reason is that a carrot of compensation has been offered. Of course the Prime Minister has come in here and said, `No, we have not yet provided any compensation. We have not taken any decision'. There has been far more than a nod and a wink, and the media of Australia have trumpeted forth. What we have got to do in order to resolve the dispute is have a look at how we can overcome that situation which is specifically the responsibility of the Prime Minister, that is, his comments about the bus drivers, the Oxford comment, and the carrot of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> What has he done? What he has done is just as bad as those stimuli to going out. The first thing was that he said, `We are going to have service pilots flying commercial aircraft'. That was stillborn. Even if the Prime Minister did not realise it, those who can fly one type of aircraft need to be accredited to another type of aircraft. Service pilots might have thousands of hours in other types of aircraft but they cannot automatically walk in and take over the controls of a modern commercial airliner. </PARA>
<PARA> But not only that, having offered Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) planes he then found that there were problems about compensation. Unfortunately, as far as domestic airline operators are concerned, they cannot just put passengers on board and accept the disciplines that apply to the service aircraft. They had to introduce properly signed and agreed legislative offsets against the compensation that would be payable in the event of any sort of an accident happening. So 24 hours after he offered the RAAF aircraft, they were finally available. Then what happened? The RAAF is now carrying about 2 per cent of passengers. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have got to understand is that the offer of the Prime Minister with respect to the Australian Services did not pick up the equivalent of the ordinary commercial intermain trunk route services around Australia. All it did was provide some slight amelioration to a quite critical problem, and nobody travelling around Australia can rely on there being an aircraft to bring him back if he gets to that destination. So that was the second thing. Service pilots have failed, the RAAF was 24 hours late and it is carrying only 2 per cent of passengers. The Air Force does not pretend to be taking over the full passenger carrying capability of the commercial airlines. Thirdly, of course, he said that there would be interlining. Of course there has to be interlining. On this side of the House we welcome it. I understand it is carrying about 8 per cent of the passengers and beyond that it is something I am delighted to see that the pilots at last have also accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, he said he was going to advertise overseas for pilots. We heard today a little bit about it in Question Time, but the point is: how many pilots have accepted the offer? Are there any pilots now flying? Of course at this stage there are not any. So the advertisement really has not generated any resolution of the problem. The fifth thing is, of course, that he said there would be overseas charters. Apart from an airline operator that is carrying some freight-questions were asked here the other day and quite properly worries were expressed about the safety record of that airline company-there is in fact at the moment no overseas charter operator carrying passengers. We were told a Polish aircraft might come in, perhaps a Russian aircraft, but at the moment there is no overseas charter operator. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to say two things in talking about the airline dispute. The first is that people in this place need to understand that there is such a thing as an industrial reality. We hear a lot of this from the Prime Minister. He talks about ambit claims and things being on the table and all the rest of it. He grew up in the field of industrial relations but one would not know it from his mishandling of this dispute. In my mind there has never been a worse example of an intervention by a political leader of this country in an industrial dispute than that by Prime Minister Hawke in the airlines dispute. As far as I am concerned it is he and he alone who is now preventing any negotiations to try to resolve this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just a matter of pilots having resigned, it is not just a matter of possible compensation for the airline companies, as one of my colleagues, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), said yesterday; it involves also the tourist operators, and all those who are involved in other sectors of the tourist industry. If we are going to give compensation, we have to give compensation to them. But the reality is none of that is on, and I put it to this place that if we were in government we would approach this entirely differently. I totally endorse the analysis of our industrial relations policy given by the honourable member for Bennelong a moment ago. The reality is there are things that could be done now, that should be done now, and if they were done we would get those trunk routes operating again. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three things I would like to put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The first is that the pilots should be told to resume flying-and they should resume their flying on exactly the same basis as applied when they went out and resigned-and they ought to be told that within one month a resolution will be found to their industrial claim. So we would then get the business of flying, the business of transport, going again. Ask those small businessmen who are the tourist operators. They do not give two hoots about the system-they care about going bankrupt, they care about unemployment, they care about going backwards, they care about trying to work for the tourist industry which over the last few years has augmented our gross export earnings so significantly. They care about trying to keep that tourist industry alive. </PARA>
<PARA> So what do we do? The first thing is we get the planes flying and we do that by telling the pilots that we are going to reinstate them on their old contracts at their present rates of pay and on present conditions of employment while we attempt to get a resolution, and we guarantee that we will get that resolution within one month. The second thing is we tell the airline operators and all those who are involved, whether they are tourist operators or anybody else, that there will be no taxpayer compensation available for them. It does not matter what sort of a nod and a wink has been given, that has to be put to one side. So the two parties are forced to negotiate and even if it is within the system at least they are not in a position where they feel themselves in some way insulated against the commercial pressures that should apply in the marketplace. The third thing we have to do is tell the employers-even if it is Australian Airlines, government owned as it is-to negotiate with the pilots. We have to get the airline operators and the pilots talking together on the basis of a pay claim based on a productivity gain. </PARA>
<PARA> We all accept that the pilots can apparently fly more hours. We all accept that seniority in rosters is prejudicial to the efficient operation of airline operations. But if we were to follow those three points and a productivity gain were offered in return for some increment in pilots' pay, in my view we would be in a position where the Government could say, `Look, we are doing what we can to restore profitability in our tourist industry; we are getting the Australian aircraft industry back where it should be'. Until those three things are done, we are not going to get anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if we were in government those things would have been done because our policy allows for that sort of negotiation. But we hear this nonsense from the Prime Minister, saying the system is more important. The point is that Australia is more important. The normal conduct of commercial operations in Australia is more important. The Prime Minister himself deserves to be condemned for not being prepared to understand that people get unemployed, people go broke, people lose their income, in circumstances where the Government through its prejudices is not prepared even to consider sympathetically a reasonable alternative. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that three-point plan, even within the system, would get Australia flying again. </PARA>

<PARA> Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was talking about matters pertaining to the Budget. Whether one is a rural Australian or a city Australian, the airlines strike is a mess. This morning, fifty years ago, Australia woke to the fact that it was at war. Today, we are still at war. This war is caused by the man who is sitting on the treasury benches next to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He is to blame for the whole jolly thing. If he had the wit and wisdom, the comprehension and the understanding, there would have been a resolution of the problem. The front page of the Melbourne Herald says it all: `Solve it all now'. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I told him how to resolve it. I put again to the House the three-point plan: Firstly, ask the pilots to resume work on their existing terms and conditions and assure them that there will be a resolution within a month. Secondly, tell the airline companies and the tourist industry that there will be no subsidies and any bets that were on as far as offering some sort of compensation are off. Thirdly, call in an independent arbitrator, as the honourable member for Bennelong said. Whether it is Mr Justice Street, the former Chief Justice of New South Wales, or whether it is the Chairman of the Industrial Relations Commission, Mr Justice Maddern, I do not mind. </PARA>
<PARA> The conciliation and arbitration commission system-the central wage fixation system-has failed. I believe that it would be better if it was scrapped, but I accept that the Government is committed to the `system' as the Prime Minister calls it and, in that climate, if he wishes he could get the Chairman of the Industrial Relations Commission, Mr Justice Maddern, to chair a meeting between airline operators and pilots and try to come to conditions of settlement which allow for productivity gains, disposal of the roster by seniority and a recognition that more hours at the stick could be achieved. That achievement could be matched with the productivity gains of the airline companies and some increment provided. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems, however, that flow in other sectors. I am told that at the moment, for example, the commuter airlines that are providing an excellent service-many of them are still operating-have problems. I am told that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has decided that it will try to police the regulations that exist in the civil aviation area to the last degree. Air Navigation Order 48 (1), for example, provides for the hours of duty of a pilot. I am told that it is being quite rigorous in refusing any normal dispensation that would be applied for as a matter of course. I suggest that the CAA is like the Tax Office: One cannot go beyond the limit of one's powers because one is trying to apply the rules, the letter, of the law, rather than the general concepts of the law. I think it is important that commuter airlines be given some additional flexibility to meet the needs of the public. The whole purpose of my proposition to the Parliament is that, unless one meets the needs of the public, the whole public suffers. The Prime Minister does not seem to be interested in people. He is more concerned with the system. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the bush is concerned, micro-economic reform involves several areas. I have mentioned productivity and work gains. I totally endorse the idea of our freeing ourselves from the constraints of our centralised wage fixation process. But if the Prime Minister insists on living with the system, if we are to get the pilots and the aircraft flying and stop the unemployment and all the difficulties that will flow in the tourist industry, we have to follow the system. My three-point plan, I suggest, would meet that requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> In the bush we have a few other problems, such as wheat handling. I feel quite strongly that the Grains Council and the National Farmers Federation had the right message. I want to try to dispose of the unnecessarily restrictive work practices pursued by members of the Waterside Workers Federation in the Fishermans Island dispute in Brisbane the other week. I accept that the Australian Wheat Board has said that it is prepared to abide by these guaranteed modifications by 30 June 1990. They have to be achieved and unless they are achieved everybody in Australia will suffer. Not just the wheat growers but primary producers generally suffer, because of our goods handling procedures, which should be contrasted with goods handling procedures in every other competitive country. If we are going to try to achieve some sort of competitiveness, we must understand that until we do something in micro-economic reform, not just the agricultural sector, which at this time is providing our best cash flows in export earnings, will suffer; manufacturing and service industries will also suffer. We have been talking about the tourist industry, which also suffers. </PARA>
<PARA> There has to be a recognition that the accord has failed. This Budget has brought down record taxation revenue and a record level of overseas debt. It recognises that unemployment will increase and interest rates will continue to be the major arm of economic policy by this Government. We are not going to get anywhere until these problems are dealt with. What the Government must do is recognise that it must pursue micro-economic reform. It must get rid of restraints imposed by unduly excessive regulations in our community. I mentioned the difficulties in the commuter airline field. They apply equally in every field affecting the licensing and registration of small business. Unless we recognise the problems-whether it is in regard to wheat handling or the pilots dispute-as being a product of non-competitive practices, the chance of Australia again getting into the ball game of being internationally competitive and getting our economy in order is very slight indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In rural Australia the Budget fails on a whole range of issues that I do not have time to address. Our roads are disastrous. I say to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) that if he tries to drive around rural Australia at the moment he will not be able to get anywhere. Not enough Federal money is spent. State money is about to be spent to help improve roads in New South Wales, but they are disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), who is at the table, is responsible for endorsing a decision by the tribunal determining entitlements to pharmacists. There is no doubt that, as far as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal conclusions are concerned, in rural Australia many pharmacies will close. This will occur in the cities and suburbs. The Minister must accept responsibility for this. It is no use walking away from it. Pensioners, the aged and the infirm are the ones who will suffer. Pharmacists provide an alternative medical service. There are already 100,000 people on waiting lists for public hospitals. Public hospitals cannot provide the services. General practitioners are overworked; they cannot provide the service. Pharmacies are closing, and the Government has some concept that will provide some sort of supplementary aid for non-viable pharmacies. I tell the Minister that those pharmacies will close before they ever get any supplementary aid. Another fundamental problem that I would love to talk about is aggregation and what is happening in that regard. Channel 10 is a very good example of how this Government's broadcasting and television policy has gone mad. The Government has failed in every direction and so too has this Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Mr Speaker, I would like to support the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in congratulating you on your elevation to the high office of Speaker. Obviously it is a very honourable position to hold and we look forward to your impartial chairing of this chamber. I would also like to thank the previous Speaker, the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). Joan and I have been great friends for many years. I know it was noted that I gave her flowers when she was elected to the position of Speaker, and I intend to give her some when she departs from this House. Unfortunately, I felt that it was not so much the state of her health that led to her resignation, but the fact that the factions seemed to squeeze her out. On behalf of the constituents of Maranoa I would like to wish her well in her retirement and thank her for all the difficult things she had to do while she was in the chair. As the first woman Speaker of this House, she did an excellent job. As you well know, Mr Speaker, from the short time that you have spent in the position, it is not a very easy task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was to have spoken on an earlier occasion in this debate on the 1989-90 Budget, but unfortunately, because of the tragic national airline strike that is on our hands, I was not able to do so. I would like to note the fact that 50 years ago last Sunday the Second World War commenced, and we have had a minute's silence in this House in remembrance. I did not have many family members who went to the war. I had an uncle, Mr Laurie Lahey, from Cadilla at Hannaford, where I was brought up, who was a Pathfinder and who spent a number of years in prison. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember as a small boy the troops returning from the war. I also remember the United States servicemen who helped us defend this country against the Japanese. At the property on which I lived at the time, west of Tara, we used to have the servicemen out for rest and recreation leave. Most of the products in Australia were rationed and we could not get sugar, but the servicemen used to bring us lumps of sugar which we would feed to our horses. They would do low level bombing runs over our property. We would go out and put a sheet on the front lawn and they would drop us chewing gum. I guess it was that sort of public relations goodwill that the Americans showed towards Australia at the time that allowed us to defeat the enemy. I think that is well worth mentioning at this time, remembering the many people in my electorate of Maranoa who paid the ultimate sacrifice. I have been very proud to represent members of the Returned Services League, and I attend many of their meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Budgets come and go; unfortunately this is probably the last one I will speak on. The factions got at me in Queensland and I will not be continuing in the House. I think there will probably be a mini-Budget before the election, but this is probably the last annual Budget I will be speaking on. Unfortunately for us taxes continue to rise and we are now collecting $91.3 billion in this Budget. That is up 9.7 per cent, which is a real increase of about 2 1/2 per cent. For the Labor Party to tell us that taxes are not increasing is an absolute nonsense. It now has a record surplus. I have spent many years in local government and in the Federal Parliament, and I do not believe we ought to be running massive deficits or surpluses. Really, $9 billion is more than a 10 per cent surplus on the total figure of $91 billion. A $9 billion surplus is an enormous amount of money to drag out of the economy, and unnecessarily so. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I must congratulate the Government. Apparently it is its intention to pay back some of our debt, some of our borrowings, from past years. Most of the borrowings are the Government's, of course. When the Labor Party came into government it borrowed massive amounts. Gough Whitlam tried to do the same thing and he got turfed out of office. This Government learned a little from Whitlam's experience and it has done it through the back door and done it gradually and got away with it. It has borrowed huge amounts of money. The Government might argue that the Commonwealth itself has not done much of the borrowing, but what it has done is to force the States and the Commonwealth's statutory authorities as well as the States' statutory authorities, which have been starved of funds from the central government here in Canberra, to go out and borrow massive amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA> This state of affairs continues because the States, local governments and statutory authorities, even the airlines, are desperate to raise capital to re-equip. The Government is saying that they cannot have any, so they have to borrow it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government operates and owns Qantas Airways Ltd. Bob Hawke is the managing director and members of his Cabinet are directors. It is their responsibility at the end of the day to look after the interests of Australian Airlines and Qantas. They will not sell those companies off so that private enterprise and local people can put some revenue into the companies and they will not allow them to borrow the sorts of funds that are needed. So the companies are in a real quandary about what to do. Our policy on this side of the House is to involve employees and to sell off as much of the capital in those companies as possible so that they can get back on a decent footing and compete internationally as well as locally. </PARA>
<PARA> The total amount of personal tax is $51.3 billion, that is, up 8 per cent, which is a 0.5 per cent increase in real terms. On this side of the House the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) put forward the suggestion that our savings should be indexed to inflation and that interest rates should also be indexed to inflation. But unfortunately the other equation he did not use and go on with was that personal tax should be indexed to inflation as well. I see the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), sitting there. It is a fact that the Department of the Treasury, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when he was Treasurer, and Malcolm Fraser in his day indexed personal tax to inflation but unfortunately for all Australians that lasted only about six months. There was an enormous loss of revenue at the time the Treasury hit the panic button and it did not continue. </PARA>
<PARA> All I would like to do is put forward to this House the facts. The indexation of interest payments perhaps should be carried into the company tax area, although I agree with some of the captains of industry who are now suggesting that company tax ought to be abolished. I support that concept. It does not pick up a lot of taxation in the overall sense. One might say that $11.3 billion is a lot of money, but the amount is up 10.7 per cent. In the overall equation I think that company tax could be abolished because so much tax is picked up from dividends and companies are desperate to get this nation up and running again. We are desperate for the exports that are needed to maintain, let alone increase, our standing of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that I said should happen is that we ought, if we are going to index savings and index interest, be indexing our taxation as well. It is amazing how governments are prepared to index all the expenditure. Every pension and every handout we like to name these days is being indexed to inflation, and that is the outgoings. All the outgoings are being indexed. Some of the taxes like excise are being indexed to inflation. Beer taxes and petrol taxes are all indexed. But when it comes to personal taxation-the fact is that government seems to need an ever-increasing share of our endeavour-the Government will not do it. I think it ought to be done. Fringe benefits tax amounts to $1.1 billion. It is up 13.2 per cent. As I mentioned, petrol and diesel excise is $5.6 billion. It is up 9.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these figures because they are all in excess of the current inflation rate and they are all increases in taxation in real terms. Our policy, of course, in the National Party is to put at least 7c a litre of that excise back into roads. The previous speaker, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), mentioned roads. It is one of the major problems that we have in this nation. If we are to continue to export and transfer the goods that we produce, then we have to keep our roads system in the best order possible. Australia is a huge land. It is very difficult for us. There are few of us and it is very expensive for us to maintain the large tracts of roads that we have running from inland to the ports, but we must do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax-the hidden death duties-that has been imposed by this Government has shown an enormous increase. Every Australian from a babe in arms onwards must understand that unfortunately once again parents are going to have to prepare themselves for this capital gains tax. It is a regressive tax. Capital gains tax is quite unnecessary in a new country like Australia where we are absolutely desperate for capital. This Government runs interest rates at 20 per cent and better to attract capital from overseas. There is a hue and cry about the Japanese, the Americans and the Europeans investing too much capital in this nation and yet here we have a capital gains tax. If one happens to make some money out of a capital transaction one is expected to pay a tax on it. There is no incentive for people to invest and to attempt to make a profit from capital. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen an estimated 78 per cent increase in the amount of money that is expected to be collected in the next 12 months from capital gains tax-$500m. This Labor Government has the audacity to tell us that it has not increased taxes. What a lot of absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Some speakers before the dinner break were saying what a great job the Government has done on superannuation. I would argue that there is no net gain in superannuation. Whatever encouragement the Government might be offering for people to take out superannuation, the Government will be taking it back by increasing taxation. All Australians must understand that they are going to be taxed 31 1/4 per cent on any bulk superannuation that they might take out at the end of their working life, on retirement. It is 30 per cent plus a 1 1/4 per cent Medicare levy. The superannuation tax is expected to raise $885m in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned before, interest rates are an enormous burden on all forms of business in Australia. The present Treasurer, Mr Keating, is running an iniquitous interest rate policy. The ANZ Bankcard interest rate is at 24.75 per cent. It is an absolute abomination on the Australian people to expect them to survive when paying that interest rate. That is nearly 25 per cent. Most businesses are paying the prime rate now of over 20 per cent. In my electorate of Maranoa, most primary industries businesses are being charged a surcharge by the banks, which I think is an abomination on the part of the banks. I tell them so continually. One of the safest industries in this country, primary industry, which is exporting and earning more dollars than any other industry, is being asked to pay a surcharge of one per cent on the interest on their borrowings. Most farmers and small business people in Maranoa are paying at least 21 per cent interest. If the Treasurer could come in here tonight and tell me how those businesses can survive for more than 12 months when paying that sort of rate, he would be no businessman. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the trouble with the people who are in power. Any business that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) ever touched went bankrupt. He will send the airlines bankrupt at the rate they are going. The pilots strike is probably the worst strike in terms of affecting Australians that we have had for many years, and we see it continuing, with no prospect of an end. I point out to the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, together with the Minister at the table, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), that they control Australian Airlines. Surely to goodness they could get it back to work. As I have mentioned before, the managing director and the directors of Australian Airlines should direct their company to negotiate with the pilots and get back to work. </PARA>
<PARA> If they cannot do that, obviously they have to find an arbitrator. If they have dirtied their fingers and stickied them too much in getting involved with this strike, then they ought to be looking around for some prominent Australian to be the mediator. Tonight Mr Justice Street has offered to play that role. I would even suggest Malcolm Fraser. The Labor Party seems to be happy with Malcolm Fraser. It is happy to support him in his candidacy for Commonwealth Secretary-General. He has been a Prime Minister and a very prominent Australian. He is the sort of person who should be asked to step in and help to get these two sides together-so that we can get back to work, for God's sake. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs work and production more than it ever has in its history. Our foreign debt now totals $130 billion. Our balance of payments deficit is estimated in this Budget to run at $18 1/2 billion. It is an absolute disgrace for any government to be suggesting we should be running at those sorts of deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I have had some very prominent members of my electorate in the House today: Bill Copeland, who is the south-west local government region president and chairman of the Taroom Shire; John Waugh, who is chairman of the Waggamba Shire; and Mr Rex Smith, who is chairman of the Beardmore Shire. They have given up their time today. They could not fly here commercially; they had to charter a plane from Goondiwindi to fly to Canberra-and they have been here talking. I would like to thank the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), the leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, the Leader of our Party, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Fife) for giving their time and talking to them today. I think we have had very fruitful discussions. Representing local government, they are very concerned about the lack of funding under the Labor Party-about the continuing cuts in real terms for our road building and for our general purpose grants to local government as well as, of course, the general purpose grants to the States. They all have a flow-on effect on all the people who live in these shires scattered throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to run through some of the figures. In 1982, 67 per cent of fuel tax revenue was returned to roads. In 1987 only 27 per cent was returned to roads. They are the sorts of figures we have to look at. Personal income tax returned to local authorities has fallen to 1.46 per cent. When we were last in government we were prepared to return 2 per cent of personal taxation to local authorities. This Labor Government is prepared to return only a little under 1 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The gross value of rural production in this area-south-west Queensland; about 10 shires-is estimated to be $597m, with a population of 35,000. On the census figures put out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for every man, woman and child who lives in the rural areas there is a per capita income level of $34,900. So we can see the sort of income that these people are producing to keep this country as rich as it is. These figures do not include oil production from the area-the Jackson oilfield and the Moonie oilfield in the Roma area, which are estimated to be producing $470m a year. These people are very concerned because they are not getting enough of the funds back into that area. There is a bridge badly needed over Coopers Creek at Nappa Merry-I have mentioned this before in the House. Coopers Creek has been in full flood in the last couple of months. The oil exploration companies have to travel an extra 300 miles to service the oilfields in the Jackson area and in the Coopers Creek area, where they continue to find many small oilfields. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is important that those on the Treasury bench look at devoting more funding to the road system in Australia, particularly to those areas such as in the south-west of Queensland that are badly in need of extra funding, because they are the areas that are earning the export income for this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will concentrate my remarks at the committee stage on the appropriations for the departments of the Treasury and Finance, in particular some of the money that has been obviously expended in those areas in relation to the exercise of forecasting and the preparation of the Budget figuring, per se. On 16 August, in a debate on a matter of public importance, I drew the attention of the House to the fairly innovative accounting of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and his Department in the preparation of this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In particular, I drew attention to the $9.1 billion surplus figure which was erected on the basis of pretty extensive increases in taxation, particularly bracket creep and sales tax excesses and, of course, massive increases in taxes on superannuation. But most particularly, I drew attention to the innovative accounting changes that exaggerated the extent of the $9.1 billion surplus figure in this year. Specifically, there is revenue brought from last year into this year; there is some prepayment of expenditure last year from this year; and there are some revenue changes in the Budget-the payment of company tax and the payment of PAYE tax-which had the effect of bringing forward revenue from next year into this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's response on that particular occasion in the debate on that matter of public importance was to suggest that my remarks were fraudulent, that I had somehow misled the Parliament and the people of Australia as to the extent of that innovative accounting. I thought it was worth drawing the attention of the House to the recently released statement of Commonwealth Government financial transactions for July 1989, which was published on 1 September by the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, in which he makes the point quite nicely for me. In particular, this document suggests:</PARA>
<PARA>the primary reason for the surplus in July is the receipt of $1016m from the sale of the Defence Service Homes Mortgage Portfolio to Westpac. </PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the items I drew attention to which could have been received in June. But receipt was delayed until the middle of the month of July, thereby boosting this year's Budget surplus figure by $1 billion relative to what would have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, on the second page of that document attention is drawn to a couple of other items which make a similar point. For example, the collections from non-PAYE other individuals tax during the month of July were $272m, which is a 260.3 per cent increase above the collections of July 1988. The relevant part of the document states:</PARA>
<PARA>This reflected some slippage into 1989-90 of collections which would normally have been collected in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, company tax collections for July were up 40.3 per cent on collections of July last year. Again the relevant quote is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . reflecting some slippage of collections into 1989-90 as a result of the late issue of assessments last year. </PARA>
<PARA>The figure of $9.1 billion is a total fiction; it is based on a very significant reliance on innovative accounting. This is vindicated by the statement of the Minister for Finance about the delay in the receipt of revenue from last year, the prepayment of expenditure and the bringing forward of tax receipts from next year into this year. One of those in particular that I would like to draw attention to is the change in relation to the payment of company tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt very much whether the Treasurer had any idea what he was doing in bringing forward the payment of company tax, particularly in circumstances where corporate cash flow this year is already going to be very tight, particularly in circumstances where, by his own admission, interest rates are unlikely to fall significantly in the course of this year, and particularly in circumstances when there is already a record number of corporate failures on the books at this time. He brings forward the payment of corporate tax in a way that obviously suits his revenue numbers and his Budget figuring but it will inflict an enormous amount of pain on the corporate sector as a whole, and in particular on the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I will cite just one example of the way this tax will work in relation to companies that balance, let us say, on 30 November 1990 instead of June 1990. They will be required to pay 85 per cent of their notional tax on 15 July. They will be required to pay 85 per cent of their tax in relation to an income year of which they have had only eight months. The Budget Papers say that a penalty of 10 per cent will be imposed on that tax liability if they underestimate the extent of that tax liability. One can imagine the situation that puts companies in. The example I have cited is from the next financial year. That is an extreme version of the problem that will apply generally across the business community as businesses attempt to meet that increased tax burden. How will the business community meet that tax burden? We have estimated from the Budget Papers an interest saving of about $330m for the Government from that moving forward of corporate tax. If we add a reasonable margin for the difference between a private sector borrower and a government borrower, we are looking at the extent to which the interest bill of the corporate sector will be increased in struggling to pay that additional tax. This particular change is on this Treasurer's head. The pain in the small business community will be unbelievable and the number of small business failures in the course of this year will be quite significant relative to the expectations, which were bad enough, just a few months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look particularly at the neglect and ignorance of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to the current pilots dispute and the impact that will have on a large part of the small business community, notably the tourist sector, which is an employer of some 500,000 Australians and a contributor of about $22 billion to our gross domestic product (GDP). The pain from this tax increase for small business in that sector in current circumstances will be staggering. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be my final comment in relation to this Budget figuring. The Prime Minister today made an amazing statement, as reported on Australian Associated Press, apparently in his briefing to Caucus, when he drew attention to the fact that the Government was still expecting a soft landing for the economy provided the pilots dispute did not affect the 7 per cent wages forecast in last month's Budget. The quote, carried on Reuters, that he was reported to have made is in the following terms: `This dispute is serious and as damaging as this dispute is it is nothing as to the disaster that would happen to the economy if we allowed their 29 per cent wage claim to go ahead'. </PARA>
<PARA> In making that statement the Prime Minister shows that he really does not understand very much about the current state of the Australian economy or the potential damage of the continuing pilots dispute. He is wrong on several counts. Firstly, the Budget growth forecasts admit the possibility of a significant fall-off in GDP in the second half of this year. In fact they are consistent with the possibility of a recession in the second half of this year. If Senator Walsh was right in his statements to the National Press Club last week that GDP will be revised upwards for 1989-90, there is already a very real possibility of a recession in the second half of this year. So if in the Budget figuring the economy is admitted to be teetering on the brink of a recession, what will be the effect of the pilots strike if it is allowed to continue?</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the quote from the Prime Minister refers to the wages growth forecast of 7 per cent. If he looks at the numbers, he will see that wages growth is already running well ahead of 7 per cent and is unlikely to be any less than 7 per cent in the circumstances that now exist in the economy. Finally, of course, given that the pilots are now claiming they are willing to negotiate wage increases on the basis of productivity improvements, if those productivity gains are genuine I find it hard to see how the wage increases on that basis would be a disaster for the economy. The real disaster is the Prime Minister. The real disaster is the accord. The real disaster is that the accord has locked our economy into unsustainable growth rates and given us across the board wage increases that are unrelated to productivity such that our inflation rate is now stuck at between 7 and 8 per cent on a fudge basis. The Prime Minister has obviously got no idea of the magnitude of the economic problem he has created for this country by letting this pilots dispute drift on and have its impact on the tourist sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Having listened to the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), in this chamber, it is understandable that the Opposition is in such disarray in relation to its policy position. In a 10-minute speech this evening he has spent half the time trying to make some capital out of what should have gone into last year's surplus Budget and what went into this year's surplus Budget, bearing in mind that both of those surplus Budgets are on record as the most appropriate response to Australia's economic situation that any government has ever put into place. Here we have a shadow Treasurer trying to make comments in relation to the fact that had last year's Budget been a fortnight earlier, the surplus would have been larger and had this year's Budget been a fortnight later, the surplus would have been slightly smaller. I am sure that is a major issue with the Australian public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Australian public knows and understands that this Government has created a climate where we have gone from massive deficit Budgets in the last three years, to surplus Budgets. That is the sort of economic strategy that every person in this nation would applaud the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for. One only has to look at the response of the money markets, of the investors of industry in Australia, to see that they fully appreciate that the policy positions put into place by the Treasurer certainly have the confidence of those who are making those sorts of decisions. Of course, if we were to look at the families in Australia, particularly the 1,500,000 families who now have jobs because of this policy development, they also would appreciate the fact that it does not really make a great deal of difference if it is a fortnight one way or a fortnight the other. The real crux of the matter is that we are running into a position of surplus Budgets and those surplus Budgets are the measures that are required for this nation at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The points that I want to go to deal with the person who leads the Opposition, and that is the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), in relation to what he had to say in his response to the Budget. The item that I want to concentrate on in my short time is that in the taxation area he did make a couple of statements in relation to what the Opposition would do if it were able to persuade the public to give it a majority of votes at the next election. His sum total in that, of course, was that the major area that he was looking at-he listed it at No. 5-was that he would, in a desperate grab for votes, abolish the capital gains tax. Now surely if there is any issue in this nation today that has been put to rest and has been accepted by the community in Australia, it is that those who earn a profit-those who use the facilities and the assets of Australia for their own benefit and those who work hard to achieve it-have every right to make a profit. They have every right to make a good living. But certainly nobody has the right to take that profit as free capital gain and not pay his share of taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet here we have the Leader of the Opposition standing before this Parliament and telling us that he would abolish the capital gains tax. It is of interest that in the last financial year collections from the capital gains tax grew by $180m above the Budget estimates. So $180m was collected from the profits of those industries which take their profits in capital gains. That $180m was over and above the $180m that was estimated. So we have a total of $281m collected, fairly, from those people who made a profit. But the Opposition is standing in this Parliament telling us that we believe that that sector of the economy-those people who took their profit by capital gains-have some privileged position, that they should be allowed to have their money, to earn it and not to pay their share of taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> They do not drive on our roads, do they? They do not use our schools. They do not need our hospitals. No, all they are entitled to, according to the Leader of the Opposition, is to have their profits free of tax. Why? Why, after seven years of hard slog by this Government, would any Opposition think it was going to win votes from the public of Australia by standing in this Parliament and telling the public that it is going to select a specific group of people and tell them that the income on which they paid $181m in tax-bearing in mind that they still had their fair share to live on and to spend for themselves-would be free of tax?</PARA>
<PARA> The estimate in the Budget papers for capital gains collections this financial year is now $500m. If we are going to talk about a figure of that nature, surely the Opposition on the Budget night should have told us just what it was going to do with it. What it is going to do with the $500m? It is not going to collect it, so if the $500m is not in the hands of those opposite but in their friends' hands, then somebody is going to miss out on the other side of the equation. The Opposition never said one word about that. It will not tell anybody just where it would cut in order to make that possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the collections under the capital gains tax head of power were much more limited and there was dispute between the Government and the Opposition as to what exactly would be the cost of modifying this Government's capital gains tax legislation. We have largely removed this doubt by repealing section 26aaa, which did tax short term gains under a different head of power from our 1985 reform. We did have a capital gains tax under the Opposition in government but it was not a capital gains tax that generated any revenue; it was a capital gains tax that enabled people to avoid the system, to develop whatever they were involved in and wait a little while to avoid the tax. With that distinction removed, there is no disputing the $500m estimate in this Budget. In actual fact, collections truly attributable to the capital gains tax are probably even higher. It is beyond doubt that the existence of the capital gains tax legislation chases into the ordinary tax system revenue which in its absence would be taken as tax-free capital gain. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we mean by that? Quite simply, under the old system we had an industry in Australia, the tax evasion industry, whereby a lot of industries spent a lot of time and effort and paid for a lot of expertise to have their accountants develop a system to put them into the tax-free capital gains area. With the law as it is today, the Australian tax system has settled down and industry is developing its accounting and its methods of operation on the basis that there is little need to put a lot of effort into paying for very creative accountants. The system is clean and honest; it has everybody paying a fair share, so that a lot of the revenue today is going into the normal system whereas in the past it would have gone into capital gains. </PARA>
<PARA> There is still every reason why industry can take advantage of the benefits of having a capital gains tax, in the same say as it can take the benefits, when it suits, of a fringe benefits tax. But the taxing system now allows industry and those who are looking at the tax laws to take a position, bearing in mind their own industry, their own business, on whether they pay capital gains tax or company tax; whether they pay pay as you earn tax or are prepared to offer a package of fringe benefits to their employees. At least today, in comparison to the past, every individual who has a tax file number and who is earning an income is expected to pay his or her fair share towards our hospitals, our roads, our total package of services provided by the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In my last minute I want to make this one plea to the Opposition. Why is it that the Opposition wants to select a group of people who are to be entitled to earn income by capital gain and who are entitled when they earn that capital gain to get it tax free? Why would the Opposition expect anybody in Australia to accept that as a policy? I cannot understand why any Leader of the Opposition would put that to the Australian people and expect to get support. It has been rejected in the past. There is certainly no way in the world that the Australian people will go back to that position and redevelop that industry which was the only one developed by our predecessors-that is, the tax avoidance industry. We have a fair system and I believe that fair system must stay in place. I am sure that the Australian people will accept that and will vote accordingly when they get the chance at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 I wish to concentrate my remarks on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC). A total of $80,851,000 has been appropriated for the DPMC, down $7.9m from last year's actual expenditure-due in most part, of course, to the cessation of appropriations for the Australian Bicentennial Authority. However, the overall level of funding for DPMC has increased in line with this Government's big Commonwealth spending policies. I note particularly that the Office of National Assessments (ONA) has had an increase in its budget of $1,092,174, which is an increase equal to nearly one-third of its 1988-89 expenditure. Australia's strategic area of concern is becoming more and more dynamic. It is therefore important that we have in place organisations such as the ONA to enable us to at least try to remain on top of events in our ever changing regional situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As important as the strategic regional situation is our own domestic situation. The activities of hostile intelligence services and terrorist organisations within Australia are of as much importance as the dynamic forces reshaping our region. Having said that, the House will be aware that over recent weeks the Australian newspaper legitimately has been raising serious and quite disturbing matters concerning the activities of the Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS) in Australia. In 1977 some allegedly secret government files concerning the YIS were leaked and were subsequently published in the media. The documents say that the YIS consists of three separate organisations, one of which is the DB or state internal security service which even today is still commonly referred to as the UDBA although its name changed some time ago. The leaked documents said that there were five identified and 17 suspected YIS officers in Australia at that time. They further said that the YIS officers were operating under diplomatic and consular cover as well as trade and commercial enterprise cover. Importantly, the point was made that the YIS in Australia did not appear to have embarked upon classic KGB-type espionage activities; rather, it was concentrating on preserving and maintaining internal stability in Yugoslavia. That is, the YIS in Australia concentrates on monitoring Yugoslav migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents identified three general strategies of the YIS in Australia: the acquisition of intelligence concerning the activities of the Yugoslav emigre community in Australia, with particular emphasis on Croatian nationalist groups; the employment of tactics designed to discredit anti-Yugoslav Government groups; and various activities designed to promote the image of the Yugoslav state. So, in effect, the YIS is mounting operations in Australia and against Australian residents. </PARA>
<PARA> A further important point that was emphasised was that Australian officials were surprised at how detailed was the Yugoslav Government's knowledge of the activities of prominent Yugoslavs in Australia. This has obviously not changed, because on 2 May 1987 Mr Jim Duncan, the Second Secretary at Australia's embassy in Yugoslavia, was reported as saying that charges laid by the Yugoslav Government against Mr Draya Pantelich for anti-Yugoslav Government activities within Australia raised the question of whether the Yugoslav Government was involved in espionage in Australia. It is alleged that at least two Croatian political organisations, the Croatian Liberation Movement, the HOP, and the Croatian Movement for Statehood, the HDP, are not in fact Croatian organisations but are organisations set up and run by the Yugoslav Intelligence Service for the purpose of penetrating the Croatian community and running agent provocateur operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the leaked documents raised the possibility that the bomb attacks and violent incidents perpetrated against official Yugoslav missions in Australia may have been carried out by the YIS in an attempt to discredit the various Croatian groups. In fact, police investigations of one shooting incident revealed that the ammunition used was of a type available only in Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, at the document's conclusion, the summary of the YIS's activities in Australia says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>It can be expected that . . . the YIS will continue and intensify those activities. </PARA>
<PARA>In its 29-30 July 1989 edition, the Weekend Australian, in one of a series of articles on the YIS, identified one Yugoslav official currently serving in Australia, namely Mr Ivan Dronjic, as a Yugoslav intelligence officer operating as a consular official in Melbourne. The same article also alleged that dossiers on Croatians in Australia are held at YIS headquarters in Yugoslavia. These dossiers allegedly contain detailed reports on the activities of political organisations, and social, cultural and sporting clubs of numerous Croatian identities resident in Australia. The journalist became aware of these dossiers from a source inside the Yugoslav Department of Foreign Affairs in Belgrade. </PARA>
<PARA> Most disturbing of all, though, is that I am led to believe that several of these dossiers substantially originated from the Yugoslav Welfare Association based at Fitzroy in Melbourne. The Association ostensibly is a non-government community organisation catering for the welfare of Yugoslavs in Australia. Just exactly how these files containing details on Australian residents found their way from Fitzroy to Belgrade is a mystery, but it is a mystery that needs to be investigated as a matter of some urgency. Quite obviously some body or bodies facilitated their transfer to Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning back to Mr Ivan Dronjic, it is clear from a series of newspaper articles and information provided to me from sources in the Yugoslav community that he has a large network of informers in the Australian Yugoslav community. It also seems apparent that he has one particularly well placed informer with whom he seems to work very closely. Indeed, the Australian of 30 August this year said that this informer is attempting to use his influence to block the application for permanent residency of the Yugoslav-born leader of the Footscray Islamic Society, Imam Azam Efindira. This same informant apparently also has a long-standing and close association with the Yugoslav Welfare Association, the records of which have ended up in Belgrade. </PARA>
<PARA> These are serious and disturbing allegations that need to be thoroughly investigated. It seems pointless to spend millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on maintaining organisations such as the Office of National Assessments if allegations such as those raised in the Australian are allowed to pass without any sort of investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, if for no other reason, a thorough investigation must be carried out due to the allegations raised by the Australian newspaper that an informer of Mr Ivan Dronjic is alleged to be a Federal Labor member. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to concentrate also on the portfolio program area dealing with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and in particular to talk about the allocation of funds under the 1989-90 Budget and beyond for women. It is important that this particular part of the Budget receive some attention, simply because, with honourable members' attention being directed at the superannuation package and a range of other areas, this very important part of the Budget and the decisions that have arisen out of the National Agenda for Women, which this Government launched last year, tend to be lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that more than two years of consultation with over 25,000 women underpin the Government's National Agenda for Women program which was released in February 1988. Since that time there has been an ongoing commitment by this Government, by a Federal Labor government, to improving the lot of women in our society by making appropriate contributions through the Budget processes and through the other fiscal and monetary processes available to government through April and May statements, just to ensure that the economic imperatives faced by women are addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take the time of the House very briefly, just to remind honourable members of some of those particular things. For example, the latest labour force figures from June 1989 show that about 51.1 per cent of women aged between 15 and 65 now participate in the paid work force. That compares with about 44 per cent in April 1983. The women's unemployment rate has fallen from 10.4 per cent to 6.6 per cent over the same period. Women receiving pensions and benefits and those on low incomes have been assisted through the introduction of the family allowance supplement in December 1987. That payment, of course, provides additional untaxed assistance for low income families with children. </PARA>
<PARA> The April statement of 1989-the document that was the forerunner to the Budget that we are debating tonight-built upon the Government's commitment to the economic security of women and families. The wage-tax family package included considerable increases in family allowance payments, which I remind honourable members increased to $9 a week for each of the first three children, and $12 a week for the fourth and subsequent children, and an increase in the family allowance supplement. More importantly, of course, these benefits are to be increased annually as required and index-linked to the consumer price index. The tax cuts announced in the statement particularly benefit women workers. The reduction in the lowest tax rates is of most advantage to people on low pay, most of whom are women. </PARA>
<PARA> What we hear is cant and hypocrisy from honourable members opposite, who say that the coalition partners, the conservatives, are the ones that stand for the family; that they are the ones who look after the affairs of the family and the needs of women. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite clearly, as my colleague the honourable member for Perth suggests, it is a fantasy; it is a fallacy and it is ridiculous in the extreme. The 1989 Budget highlights for women build on those measures that were announced in the April statement of this year. I will quickly refer to some of those. The women's health strategy will involve a total expenditure of some $43m from 1989-90 to 1992-93, including a number of cost sharing arrangements with States and Territories on the national women's health program. For example, there will be an increase of some $1m this year, increasing to $6 1/2m in 1991-92 and 1992-93. There will be an injection of funds in the birthing services proposed by this Government-$600,000 in 1989 and $5.84m over the next three years. They are significant contributions to those areas of concern to women in the development of the health strategy for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Part and parcel of that is the ongoing commitment of this Government in respect of women in sport, to build on the success that has occurred at the Australian Institute of Sport. The Women's Sport Promotion Unit will receive an additional funding of $640,000 over the next four years. In particular that unit will further develop a campaign to promote sport for adolescent girls. It has been identified that those girls within our community need to be encouraged to develop in sport so that their awkwardness and their concerns as to how they fit into society and so on are overcome. This is very important to young women of that age. The problem, of course, in this area is not new; it is in fact old. So there will be some research and resources developed to show teenage girls what sport has to offer and to make sport available to them. Secondly, there will be a promotion and community campaign to make girls in the community aware of what they can do and what is available through this program. Those are just some of the things that have been done under the women's health strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be increases of up to $7 a week in child-care fee relief for family day care and long day care centres and an annual indexation of fee relief in future years at a cost of $8.9m this year, rising to $16.5m in future years. There will also be outside school hours care. There will be an introduction of fee relief for low income families, subject to cost sharing arrangements with the States and Territories. Additionally, in rent assistance for pensioners, beneficiaries and low income families in private rental accommodation there will be increases of $5 a week in both December 1989 and September 1990, in addition to those announced last year, and future indexation. Again, all of these matters are particularly relevant to women and all go to the heart of this Government's attitude to social policy and the agenda for ensuring that those in our community less able to look after themselves receive appropriate levels of government assistance. Housing is one of the major issues of concern to all members of this chamber. Mortgage and public housing rent relief funding has been increased by $15m. It applies equally across the board, but nevertheless women are great beneficiaries of that program which has been developed in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> One area of great concern to women is the domestic violence education program. I was pleased to see that in the Budget this year there is additional funding of some $125,000, bringing total funding for this year to $953,000. I think all honourable members would agree that domestic violence in our society is repugnant. I am sure that they all support the Government in its endeavours to eradicate domestic violence and to undertake the appropriate education programs on this very sad aspect of our society. I commend the Government for providing a level of funding commensurate with that problem. As far as family planning is concerned, there has been an injection of $12.142m in the Budget this year. Finally, for family mediation and marriage counselling services $8.824m has been allocated this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are just some of the packages which fall within the portfolio responsibility of Prime Minister and Cabinet because the National Agenda for Women falls under the responsibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). There are many others, however, and I would commend honourable members in this place, and indeed the women of Australia, to look at what this Government has done specifically for them. Too often we have heard those on the other side cry that this Government has lost its way, that it does not have any feeling, that it has lost its social responsibility, that it is not looking after those people that the Labor Party traditionally is supposed to look after. That is nonsense; it is proven consistently to be so, and the 1989-90 Budget clearly demonstrates that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to go to some of the more important Budget highlights for women that have been developed by this Government. There are many others. I could have talked about bereavement packages, the rural multi-purpose health facilities program, the remote area social security client services, the labour market package, the reform package for client services at the Commonwealth Employment Service, training packages, the new social justice strategy, and so on. It is all part of the Hawke Labor Government's commitment to improving the lot in this community of people who need assistance and guidance. It is to be commended. It is a step in the direction of building on what this Government has done consistently over the last seven years, and I commend that particular section of the Budget Papers to all honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to speak tonight on the two key areas of the Budget-those administered by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the real wreckers of Australia. It is just great to be able to deal with these two guys together, because out there in Australia they are real detriments to the Australian Labor Party. They have wrecked initiative. They are out grabbing taxes. They are stealing the Australian dream of the Australian home from the Australian people. They are ruining families. They are the people who thought of the ID card to grab more tax and control society. The Bill of Rights, capital gains taxes-think of anything bad in Australia and it can be sheeted home to the two people responsible for the departments whose estimates we are discussing tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have looked through the Estimates and it is very interesting to aggregate the support that this Government draws from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-in fact, the support and policy advice that the Prime Minister receives. Whilst the total Budget allocation for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is down, the policy advice division is up by 66 per cent. There is a huge increase in the allocations made for policy advice to the Prime Minister-a jump from $10.9m to $18.2m. That is very substantial. One would have to question whether it has any real effect on the Prime Minister or whether he even listens to it. The advice and the assistance of the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC), the economic group that was going to do so much to save the well-being of Australia, has slightly increased. Government support, which is for the Office of the Governor-General and the Executive to assist their efficient operations, has $22m; the machinery of government, $1.9m; Cabinet and Parliament support, which is a specific support program for specific programs, $9.3m; and public administration and accountability, $16.9m-a total for Government support services in this Department of $50.1m. </PARA>
<PARA> That is $1m a week for the type of government that we are getting. I think that that is very expensive, very costly, especially when the Prime Minister can make remarks about airline pilots being equivalent to bus drivers. He denigrates bus drivers in order to equate somebody he does not like with a person that he thinks is of no worth in our community. That is the analogy the Prime Minister drew and I think it is typical of his way of thinking. If one were to extend that process one would say the support services that I have just outlined, for EPAC, policy, government support, machinery of government, the support services and public administration and accountability, should all certainly be part of the processes the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and other members of the Ministry have at their disposal to operate government. </PARA>
<PARA> One would not question the personal allocations to these Ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, of cars, personal staff or residences; I think that is all perfectly appropriate. I then looked at the Prime Minister's salary and found that in fact he has available an amount of $56,931 a year in addition to the normal members' salary scale. I thought: Why does the Prime Minister actually need that additional personal wealth if he has a philosophy that pilots are like bus drivers? I am suggesting that the Prime Minister actually should keep these support services outlined in the estimates but not have that personal wealth, if that is his philosophy. I do not agree with it but it is the proposition that he puts to the Australian people, I believe much to the detriment of himself and his own good standing in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Really, he is saying in regard to the airline strike, `The airline that I operate and that airline of my friend need to have special circumstances apply to the way in which the arrangements are made'. In fact, he is standing between the airlines and the pilots and saying, `I-with my policy advice, funding for which is 66 per cent up this year; with the $1m support for my Government on all of these things that we need-am going to stand between the airline of the Australian people and that of my friend and I am going to prevent these two parties from coming together'. There is one of two reasons that a Prime Minister may have received this policy advice and it may well be that, through the processes of the $9.3m of support for specific services to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for government, the Prime Minister has come to one of two conclusions on this issue. The first could be `I should not let the system fail'-and there may be a number of reasons for that-and the other could be `I and my friend need to have something gained from this process'. There can be no other reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly not, Madam Deputy Chairman. If the Prime Minister, for the first reason, wants to not let the system fail, I believe that could be because he is so much committed to the system and his friends and colleagues from former union days that he does not want to let them or the system down. He wants the game to go on, the old mates to stay in their jobs and the opportunities to continue for them. Or he wants to say, `I need to have a strong union movement in Australia so that the economy is balanced and controlled by government; I need to have a certain power base that I can use', or maybe it is just for the sake of power itself. If, however, it is something that he and the operator of the other airline want for the sake of the aviation industry in Australia, then it needs to be spelt out because it is not clear to the Australian people. It has to be one of those two things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The logic of the circumstances is that the Prime Minister should withdraw from being between the two parties and allow them to resolve the issue.

The 66 per cent increase in policy advice may not be reflected in the current circumstances. On top of that, to think that in resolving the current dreadful situation Australia is in with the airline strike compensation should be paid to either the airlines or any of the other operators is crazy. The Government should get that idea off the agenda very quickly because that will mean that in every circumstance people will come to government. We will not have a Prime Minister and Cabinet estimate of $88m; we will have an estimate of thousands of millions of dollars, because that compensation will come from the Australian people. As I said, that idea needs to be put off the agenda. It is not workable or practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight, as we look at these estimates, we look at the circumstances that have brought Australia to where it is. We see small expenditure by these departments compared with other departments, but they are being run to control other departments. They involve the collection of revenue and the tax laws, areas which are of significance to the Australian people. They are being run very badly because the Australian people are not being considered in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter whether it is the airlines or whether it is the waterfront. We do not hear too much from the Government when there is a waterfront strike, yet there is more money lost in a waterfront stoppage than there is in this dispute. We hear nothing but an occasional bleat from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). These two departments, one for the Prime Minister and one for the Treasurer, are the significant departments of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has little regard for the average Australian or he would not have spoken about bus drivers in the way that he did. That is reflected in the policies of the Treasurer. He is remote and superior in his attitude. He has little regard for the people of Bankstown, Carlton, or anywhere else in Australia, or he would dramatically change the policies this Government has brought forward. It is time for the Prime Minister to stand aside from where he is in the airline dispute, to stand aside from policy decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Real Estate Institute of Australia suggested that first home buyers were moving back. They are not my figures. Let us consider what that means. If I need to outlay $30,000 less to buy a house, that is a significant incentive. While no government pursues monetary policy with a view to being popular, if it is an economic necessity then it is something that we must do. It is a pity that there is not the same sort of consistency of principle on the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not want to raise the airline dispute tonight but it has been raised by a number of speakers in this debate. It goes to the question of micro-economic reform and efficiency in government. Every time we on this side of the House talk about deregulating, the great free enterprise merchants on the other side, the great deregulators, jump up and down and complain, whether the topic is wheat marketing deregulation or the airlines. Indeed, for the last two or three days in this place we have heard the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) complaining about the fact that the two airlines agreement is in place. What he needs to remember is that the previous Government conceived it and perpetuated it. This Government has sought to change it. While I do not always agree with the philosophical view of John Hyde, who is reported in the Australian today, I respect him for the accuracy and honesty of his intellectual argument. What does he have to say about this matter? I quote from his article in the Australian today:</PARA>
<PARA> The Two Airline Agreement is the underlying cause of the air pilots' dispute. Uncompetitive airlines which could pass costs on to a captive clientele all sorts of inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> A militant, monopolistic pilots' union, representing pilots who fly only about half the hours of those in the United States, is but one example. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the Fraser Cabinet given notice in 1980 that it would repeal the Two Airline Agreement, we would not be going through this trauma now. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that is the case. Every time we talk about efficiency and deregulation, the Opposition complains because some opportunistic group or somebody else gets to it and it sees a political advantage in the issue. I want to say only one more thing about the pilots dispute: there are many groups in Australia and many people in the gallery tonight who would like a 30 per cent increase in their wages without doing any more work, but there are very few groups, if any, except for the pilots, that would choose to bring the country to its knees in order to effect their avaricious claims. I think that is the point that needs to be made, and made very strongly, in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the last 6 1/2 years of Budget management-indeed, as we are discussing the estimates for the Department of Finance I would like to focus on that tonight-what we see is a quantitative change in the bottom line of the Budget, one that is more significant than anyone would have believed possible 6 1/2 years ago. We have gone from a deficit of $9 billion to a surplus of $9 billion. Australia was borrowing $9 billion to pay all its bills 6 1/2 ago, and now we have a surplus of earnings over expenditure. That is a significant quantitative change. </PARA>
<PARA> More important than that, there has been a qualitative change in the composition of the Budget. Why have we been able to produce such a dramatic result? I admit there has been significant and continuous economic growth over this time. That has been part of the reason, and we are not totally responsible for that because the international situation has played a part. This surplus is a result of expenditure control, of a decrease in outlays, which has been more significant than ever before in the management of the economy of this country. There has been six percentage points of gross domestic product change in the outlays. We are back now to the spending levels of 1972 and 1973. In two more years, if we continue according to the Forward Estimates, we will be back to 1950 levels of government expenditure. While the Opposition has always talked about small government-it has had a very perverse interest in it-it has never been able to deliver the goods. Indeed, the question needs to be asked: Would it ever be able to? We have never seen it do so. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition talks about program savings and significant cuts in expenditure, whenever some interest group complains, it jumps on the bandwagon and finds a reason not to implement it. There has been significant rigour by this Government when it comes to our scrutiny of outlays. I want to give one or two examples of the sort of savings that I am talking about. The Department of Finance, which has played a most significant part in this program, deserves the credit for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The first example is that in 1981 the Liberal Government, under the guise of making savings, abolished the requirement for people to lodge personally with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) fortnightly continuation of benefit forms. In order to receive unemployment benefits it had been the case that fortnightly one had to lodge a form personally with the CES office. That requirement was removed in 1981 under the guise of savings. At the time, the ratio between unemployment benefit recipients and people who were actively seeking full time work was 98 : 100. So for every 98 unemployment benefit recipients there were 100 people actively seeking work. By June of 1985 that ratio had blown out so that there were 125 people receiving unemployment benefits for every 100 people who were actively seeking work. There was a lack of rigour, a lack of scrutiny over government expenditure as a result of that change initiated by the Liberal Government in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government re-introduced the personal continuation benefit form lodgment and it tightened up a number of other areas under which unemployment benefits were administered. We introduced 20 mobile unemployment benefit review teams and this Budget provides for a further 10 teams to be added to that group. We introduced work intention forms so that only people genuinely seeking work were eligible for unemployment benefits. We made it necessary for applicants to get a certificate from their employer stating the reason and the date on which they lost their job. So no longer was the system able to be rorted and we now find that that ratio, which was 98 : 100, which blew out to 125 : 100, is now back to its original figure. If one does the sums one finds that there will be a cost saving to the Government of $1 billion in this Budget on unemployment benefits that are not being paid now as a result of that financial rigour, as a result of the control over that program exercised by the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at another area-the assets test-which was opposed by the Opposition for puny political reasons, we see it is completely outside any economic rationale at all. What did Opposition members say? Prior to its introduction the proportion of old people who were of pensionable age, that is receiving pensions, was 82 per cent. Since we introduced the assets test that has dropped by 5 per cent. There were millionaires receiving pensions. There were all sorts of people receiving pensions who did not need that assistance from the Government. We look at the saving level within this year's Budget and we find that the saving is $600m. There we have $1.6 billion of savings in this year's Budget as a result of just two programs in which there has been significant rigour provided by the Government. That significant rigour has brought about significant savings, changed the structure that was put in place by the Opposition and made for more efficiency and for more effective targeting of our outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because of that sort of rigour that we now find ourselves in the position where we have a significant Budget surplus. What do we get from the Opposition? Every time that we try to introduce something that is fair and balanced and sensible and efficient, we get hypocrisy, we get carping criticism, we get negativism, we get inconsistency because there may be some puny political advantage for the Opposition in opposing it. There may be some pensioners out there who have been copping plenty, who have got plenty, who are receiving a pension and may be concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about the allocations to the Department of the Treasury and specifically the allocations that relate to the Foreign Investment Review Board which were obviously very small allocations. In that context I shall say something about the attitude of the Government and, more particularly, the general attitude of the Australian community, to the issue of foreign investment. There is no doubt that over many years foreign investment in Australia has been a very emotional issue. Everyone knows that and people on the other side of the chamber have been particularly enthusiastic over the last 30 or 40 years in promoting that debate on foreign investment. I may not be very old by the standards of this House but I can well remember the 1960s when the Australian Labor Party criticised American investment in Australia including, curiously, the investment by the Americans in General Motors-Holden's Ltd. The defence of that American investment in Australia and therefore in Australian jobs with the development of technology in an Australian car industry was put forward by the Liberal Party and the then Country Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We on this side of the chamber know that foreign investment is vastly important to Australia. That has never been truer than it is today during a time of current account crisis for our country. We have an extraordinarily serious current account and balance of payments situation. We have an extraordinarily serious foreign debt situation in Australia as well. Budget Paper No. 1 shows how that foreign debt situation is getting progressively worse. Net external liabilities, Budget Paper No. 1 points out, are now 41 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), which is really an extraordinary figure. The net external liability servicing ratio is 22 per cent of goods and services exported from Australia whereas in the early 1980s when the Fraser Government was in office the figure was only 11 per cent. This is extremely relevant to the issue of foreign investment because foreign investment-capital imports if you like-act as an important offset to this serious current account and balance of payments problem. </PARA>
<PARA> What I do not think is often recognised is that the net position in Australia in terms of capital flows is deteriorating. I am a great believer in free-flowing capital markets, including Australian companies investing abroad. I note that Australian revenue from investments abroad constitutes about 5 per cent of our export earnings, so it is becoming increasingly an important part of our international activity. But Australian investment abroad over recent years has grown by 27.6 per cent in 1984-85, 25.9 per cent in 1985-86, 40.2 per cent in 1986-87 and 16.1 per cent in 1987-88. Total Australian investment abroad by June 1987, which seems to be the latest time for which figures are available, was $60.2 billion as against foreign investment in Australia of $174 billion. So, when people go around saying we have got to put the brakes on foreign investment in Australia, they forget that the net position in terms of investment, in terms of capital flows, while still positive, is deteriorating. If they want to put the brakes on foreign investment in Australia through strengthening the powers of the Foreign Investment Review Board and the like, they will simply exacerbate the economic catastrophe of our balance of payments situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone knows we are a resource rich country and a capital poor country. Our savings are too small; that is an important part of the current debate in the community today. It is worth noting that since 1960 there have been only three years when domestic savings have been greater than total investment. In 1960 savings were about 25 per cent of our GDP; today they are about 17 per cent of our GDP. So we have declining savings. The Government argues that we spend 6 per cent more than we produce, so we need more investment in order to produce more in order to reduce our balance of payments problems. Yet there are people going around in the community, and being aided and abetted by a large number of members of this House, and saying that we need to restrict foreign investment-if you like, restrict investment. Those are the sorts of people who forget that 70 per cent of new manufacturing jobs created in Australia since World War II were created by foreign investment. I have already referred to perhaps the best-known foreign investor, General Motors Holden's Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest debate in Australia on the issue of foreign investment is a peculiarly sad debate because not only is it intellectually and economically wrong-I hope I have in five minutes briefly alluded to that-but it is based on bad intentions because it is generated by anti-Japanese feeling. There are some people who say we have too much Japanese investment in Australia. They are not worried about British, American, Italian, Greek or German investment; they apparently are worried about Japanese investment. Some people even run the incredible argument that it is not discrimination to say that Japanese investment is not wanted but British investment is fine. The fact is that capital, which is what this money is, is owned by somebody. That is how it becomes known as Japanese investment. If people are going to go out into the community and argue that we should restrict Japanese investment, that means they are specifically discriminating against Japanese people, and that I must say is something I find peculiarly abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the figures on foreign investment in any case we find that 34 per cent of foreign investment in Australia comes from America; 29.6 per cent from Britain; only 9 per cent from Japan; and 8.5 per cent from other European Community countries. So whilst Japanese investment has increased very substantially in recent years-but, by the way, not by as much as British investment did over the last year-the fact is that Japanese investment still represents a small proportion of total investment in this country. So I think this has been a very sad reflection on the intellectual debate in this country and the political expedience of some in this House, including the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who have given some sort of tacit and in other cases active support to the feelings against Japanese investment, which are feelings based more on racism than on economic logic or intellectual credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair enough for the Australian community to have some understanding of where investment is taking place in the area of land, and I have no difference with those people who argue that the States should set up land registers of foreign investment. I do not mind that at all. But I do think it is important that we not overreact to that community feeling against Japanese investment and strengthen the powers of the Foreign Investment Review Board and end up simply by first of all discriminating, I think in an abhorrent way, against investment from one particular country; and, secondly, doing something which in the longer term will do this country very real economic damage. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to what I said earlier: the fact is this country needs foreign investment and it needs it desperately to try to build up its economy, to build up the infrastructure it needs, to build up the capital it needs, to produce more and to do it more efficiently and more effectively in order to become competitive in the international marketplace. If we are going to say that we do not want foreign investment, or we are half-hearted about foreign investment, or foreign investment is all right from Britain and America but is not too good from Japan, then the simple message we will be telegraphing to the rest of the world is that we are equivocal about foreign investment. We will live to regret the day we were equivocal about foreign investment because those investors will go to other parts of the world, and increasingly they are starting to do that. They will go into the fast growing, fast developing dynamic European Community. They will go to countries such as the United States, if they are Japanese, or Japan if they are from the United States. They will go to countries such as Canada. They will be the beneficiaries of foreign investment and this country will pay a terrible price for that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to remember we are in the international marketplace to compete for investment, and if we can attract foreign investment in this country that is a sure way of helping us get out of the very serious economic problems we face. I hope that members of this place will in future go out into the community and argue the case for foreign investment, even though it is not popular in some sections of the community, and show a bit of courage, a bit of leadership, and persuade those people in the community that their sentiments-on whatever those sentiments are based-are sentiments that if implemented in terms of policy would do this country very real and very lasting damage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to direct my comments to the expenditure allocated to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which amounts to $172,245,000. That is indeed a large allocation of the nation's finances. I say this in the context that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today is conducting annually some 1,600 to 2,000 surveys per year. Indeed in the month of June Senator Shirley Walters put a question on notice asking the ABS to explain briefly what those surveys are about. Prior to coming to this chamber tonight I contacted her and she told me that they had been unable to provide that information. She had ascertained that by way of a question on notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A couple of years ago I did a check on staff ratios for major nations-namely, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. I believe when the Australian Bureau of Statistics is involved in discussions figures are needed to enable it to understand what one's message is. I established at that time that there was one statistician staff member for every 4,400 Australians, whereas in Canada it was one for every 10,000, in the United Kingdom it was one for every 15,000 and in the United States of America it was one for every 18,500. The latest staff ratios in Australia are one to every 4,600 Australians. The point I am endeavouring to make here tonight is that we are certainly overburdened with the staff component of this particular Government statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> We notice also in the appropriations for this particular Department that running costs now represent some $32m and other programs costs, which went up by a massive 69 per cent, account for some $32m of that Department's expenditure. The total appropriation is now a massive $172m. When this is viewed in the context of those staff ratios I think we can say it is high time that we started to ask exactly what is going on in this country. How reliant are we? How overdone has it become?</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year all members of parliament were advised that the Bureau intended to conduct a national health survey. Indeed, in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Act the Department tabled an indication of this survey, which starts in October. Nevertheless, I wrote to the Australian Statistician, Mr Castles, on 4 May, highlighting the fact that I believed, in view of what the Senate had done in voting that the Parliament may take unto itself the right to declare some surveys voluntary, it was appropriate that this survey be conducted as a voluntary survey. It is to canvass many issues-not just our income levels and how often we attend doctors and the like. It asks women to divulge whether or not they have an intra-uterine device fitted, what are their contraceptive habits, and a whole lot of other questions which I regard in principle as being highly intrusive and indeed highly personal. As I see things, some people are happy to answer some questions like this but other people have an understandable reluctance. </PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to the Statistician on 4 May asking that he not table that survey and that it be conducted as a voluntary survey. I am never critical of his writing ability because, in accordance with my request for a speedy reply, I received a letter dated the same day saying that my suggestion was not accepted. One could only construe from that that whilst it was specified that those women's issues were to be handled in a voluntary way, overall it was to be conducted as a compulsory survey. I have been reasonably quiet on this issue other than to conduct a survey about the survey. I did that in the State of Queensland, and the results of some 605 responses were collated. I seek the approval of the Committee to have this table incorporated in Hansard. It is the result of the survey. </PARA>

The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) must almost hold the opinion that I am in opposition to the ABS because this is the second time in a week that I have sought his permission to incorporate in a speech the results of a survey that I have conducted. Probably the most outstanding aspect of this survey was that some 84 per cent of those surveyed believed that the ABS survey should be conducted as a voluntary survey. There were a lot of people who did not really regard the questions as intrusive-some 36 per cent of the sample. And yet 84 per cent held the view that it should be a voluntary survey. There is a lot of other interesting information in this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 5 May, at about the same time that I was writing to the Statistician about everything, the ABS wrote to the Australian Medical Association asking for its support for this survey. In its letter of that date, a Mr Geoff Sims, the person in charge of this survey said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the AMA is an organisation which the Australian public and the media will look towards for a statement of its views. </PARA>
<PARA>What it is saying is that the Australian public will respect whatever the AMA says. The AMA did give support to the survey. Indeed, it gave support, but on the condition that the survey was conducted as a voluntary survey. And yet we have this same Mr Sims, to whom I alluded a moment ago, writing in a medical journal only a few days ago that the AMA strongly supports this survey. I rang the AMA and said, `Do you know what this survey is all about?', and its representative said, `Yes, we do, and indeed we gave our support on the basis that it was conducted as a voluntary survey'. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday, in light of the advice I gave the AMA, it re-examined the material that was given to it and established that there are grave doubts in terms of how this survey is to be conducted. When I drew this to the attention of my colleagues back in May, the Australian Statistician wrote a letter to all members of this Parliament bucketing me and questioning my integrity for having the audacity to suggest that the survey might have the element of compulsion to it. I had to cop it, and cop it sweet, and that I did. But here we have the AMA now saying, quite logically, that the survey is either completely voluntary or there is an element of compulsion in answering the questions. It then asks: `Are we correct in presuming that if one part is completely voluntary, the other part of the survey is not completely voluntary?'. It reminds the ABS that its support was given `on the definite basis that compulsion was not used in the survey'. I also checked with the Australian Diabetic Association, of which I am a member, because its name was cited in an information paper put out by the ABS in April. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I contacted the Australian Diabetic Foundation because it is cited in an information paper that the ABS put out in April. I contacted the Queensland division. It said to me `Never heard of it'. It checked with all of its staff. So I contacted the headquarters in Canberra and the people there had a memory of it having been raised with them ages ago. They were by no means giving support for a survey which is so intrusive in nature and is being conducted, we believe, in a compulsory way. The Australian Bureau of Statistics talks about seeking willing cooperation, but the truth is that the definition of `willing cooperation' is virtually to hound people, without the ultimate threat of court action. To me, that is not willing cooperation. Willing cooperation is either a letter or a knock on the door, saying `I'm your friendly statistician representative. I am here to ask for your help. You don't have to do this survey but we seek your cooperation'. That is honest. That tells the people who put forward the $172m what their rights really are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying I am deeply distressed at the way in which the Australian Bureau of Statistics is behaving in a less than honest fashion these days; and the way in which it will go to any lengths to get its information and then present itself to the world as a reputable organisation. I do not believe there is any government agency in this country today whose practices, ethics and integrity have as large a cloud of doubt over their head as the Australian Bureau of Statistics. If this national health survey fails in the weeks ahead as a result of its misrepresentation of the Australian Medical Association, it will have only itself to blame. People are entitled to the truth, they are entitled to be told exactly where they stand, and they are entitled to be protected from an organisation that is less than honest. I do not argue with a person's wish to comply with any survey. His willingness is something that can be forthcoming, and it is a matter for him. But people should be told the truth from the word go. On that point, I let my case rest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few things as the opportunity arises to address some of the broad issues of the day. One of the broad issues of the day is taxation reform. We talk a great deal about taxation reform in this country but we tend to do very little about it. I am very glad to see that the Opposition has firmly nailed its colours to the mast of taxation reform. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has stated that it is the Opposition's intention in government to have a flatter, two-level tax system and a top rate of 39c in the dollar. The reason for that is that it will bring the top marginal rate for individuals down to the company rate. The very obvious reason for that is that so long as there is a differential between the top marginal personal rate and the company rate of taxation, of course, there is the opportunity and the desire to minimise taxation by engaging in schemes which would divert income from individuals into companies. That is so obvious that blind Freddy would understand it, yet apparently this Government does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another subject which we have not focused on; that is, the subject of indirect tax. We have a taxation scheme which for the most part relies upon direct tax. We have wholesale sales tax, excise taxes and others, but we do not have anything in the nature of a value-added tax, a consumer tax or a turnover tax, in short, a broad-based indirect tax. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the reasons why we do not have such a tax? In the first place, we seem to be dissuaded from even talking about the subject because on both sides of the House it is regarded as the poisoned chalice. Think about it. Even mention it and one's opponents will say that one is out to rob old ladies, the indigent-everybody who is defenceless-and to change the taxation system so that the rich profit. But is it not a curious thing that, in many other countries where there is great concern for social justice, such an indirect taxation system exists? It exists alongside a direct system of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not arguing for increases in the overall burden of tax; quite to the contrary. I believe that the overall tax burden needs to be brought down. But it is worthwhile looking at the efficiencies and equity-and I stress the word `equity'-of indirect tax. There are, around the country, hundreds of thousands of people who pay little or no tax, not because they do not earn an income, but because they do not return it, because they take their income in cash, put it in their pockets and thumb their noses at the taxation system. It is impossible to estimate the size of the black economy. Some people say it would be 10 per cent; others would give an estimate of 15 or 20 per cent. One thing we know is that it is large. Anybody who has any understanding of life in Australia knows that the black economy is alive and well and growing. </PARA>
<PARA> How do you catch people in the black economy? Forget about doing it through the Income Tax Assessment Act. Forget about adding penalties. The Australian Taxation Office is not particularly concerned, and does not have the resources to chase after the small people, the medium-sized people, who are ripping off the economy-ripping off all of us, because we all suffer-and who are doing it in cash. Resources have to be directed towards the bigger and easier targets. But with an indirect system of taxation, which would be designed to supplement the direct system of taxation and, at the same time, reduce the overall burden, we would bring into the taxation net those who are presently outside it. Is that not equitable? Is it not just that those who are escaping from the taxation burden should be brought into the net? I believe that it is. I think it would be a very good thing for this country if we could have an honest, open, public debate, devoid of misrepresentation, examining the issue of taxation and of how the system worked. On both sides of the House we should have the decency to say, `We do not have all the wisdom on our side, and we understand that everybody here in their own way is trying to get things just a little better for Australians'. </PARA>
<PARA> So the thought that I would drop quietly into the pool this evening is that the time for that debate is overdue. This country sometimes appears to be in a time warp. It is as though we believe we should be debating issues about 20 years behind the rest of the world, in the field of tax, in the field of industrial relations, in the field of reform of our transportation systems. We are in that time warp. It is time that we moved out of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to speak about the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and, in particular, about the Office of Multicultural Affairs within that portfolio. Honourable members will be aware that there exists within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet an office whose function is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To coordinate the development and implementation of Government policies relevant to meeting the needs of the multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA> To develop long-term strategies for meeting the needs of Australians of different ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> To function as a channel of communication between the Government and the community, especially in relation to Australians of different backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> To improve access and equity. . . </PARA>
<PARA> To promote better relations between Australians of different backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the stated objectives of this office. In the context of that, we have seen launched recently by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a document called the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia. It is a significant document and it is one that I would like to speak about in the context of these estimates tonight. The reason I want to speak about it is what we have heard recently the Prime Minister commenting on the Opposition view of both immigration and this concept referred to as multiculturalism. The Prime Minister, notwithstanding comments from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and me, has been throwing into doubt the level of commitment that exists on this side of the Parliament in relation to a bipartisan immigration policy, free from any racial prejudice or preference and also doubt in relation to the extent to which the Opposition is prepared to accept the cultural diversity that exists within this Australian society of ours. </PARA>
<PARA> It troubles me greatly that on the several occasions that the Prime Minister has spoken about this question he has sought to inject a political element into this discussion. He did so as recently as this weekend when he spoke in Melbourne to the first Asian-Australian Consultative Council. When he spoke to that organisation he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The so-called immigration debate of recent times has done Australia and Australians-including Asian Australians-no good at all. Under a new Opposition leadership, however, I think-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise those words `I think'-</PARA>
<PARA>we are on the road back towards a bipartisan immigration policy that is genuinely free of any hint of racial prejudice or preference. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how the Prime Minister can utter those words `I think', when we look at the clear and unambiguous statement of the Leader of the Opposition when he was first appointed by these parties. I do not know how he could, in any way, equivocate about our view on this matter when he understands the nine principles of immigration affirmed by a positive vote of all members of the Opposition which strongly asserts that migration selection should not be on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin or the like. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, when the Prime Minister launched the multicultural agenda he also sought on that occasion to inject a partisan political note which I think, in regard to statements that have been made by me and by the Leader of the Opposition, show that he wants to pursue this matter in a less than bipartisan way himself. When he spoke at the launch of the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>And let me say what a tragic loss it is that the bipartisanship on this issue that had so positively and so constructively characterised Australian politics for so many years no longer exists at the Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains a great source of sadness to me that the Federal Opposition is still unwilling to admit itself openly, honestly and unashamedly to a multicultural Australia, with multicultural policies. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the Prime Minister made that statement to inject a partisan element into the matter. The way in which that launch was conducted was a peculiarly partisan exercise. Yet it is quite clear from statements made by the Leader of the Opposition and me that, in terms of the endorsement of multiculturalism in the way in which it is defined in the agenda, there was absolutely no problem with that for the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition had this to say of the Prime Minister's statement on multiculturalism:</PARA>
<PARA>While welcoming elements of the Prime Minister's statement on Multiculturalism, the Opposition is disappointed that Mr Hawke is playing politics on a sensitive policy area. </PARA>
<PARA> Particularly since the Second World War, Australia has become increasingly a multicultural and a cosmopolitan society composed of people with different ethnic and language backgrounds. As a result we are all the richer. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take the opportunity tonight to put on record again my own statements in relation to the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia. I said when it was launched that we in the Opposition saw the definition of multiculturalism as totally unexceptional. In the statement `What is Multiculturalism?' in the agenda there has been a marked change in attitude on the Government's part, which has not been acknowledged by the Prime Minister in any public way or by Government spokesmen but which I am quite prepared to acknowledge with approval. The policy statement needs to be carefully understood. It is an endorsement of the diversity of the Australian culture and ethic of today. It is also an endorsement of the three dimensions of multicultural policy, that is, cultural identity, social justice and-here it uses words that are almost a direct quote from the Opposition's policy- the right of all Australians to equality of treatment and opportunity and the removal of barriers of race, ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender or place of birth. </PARA>
<PARA> But it also contains what are termed to be the limits of multiculturalism and they are summarised as these:</PARA>
<PARA>Multicultural policies are based upon the premise that all Australians should have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, to its interests first and foremost. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words could have been uttered by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). They appear in this statement and I believe they are appropriate for this statement but the Government does not acknowledge that there was a genuine shift in the debate that occurred last year. The Government should go back and look at its own policies, particularly the only policy that I found that dealt with the term multiculturalism, `Working Together for a Multicultural Australia'. It is clear on the public record to be seen by all who are interested to inform themselves that the limits of multiculturalism as stated in this definition were never part of Australian Labor Party policy for a multicultural Australia and were never included in any of its public statements until the Prime Minister started to talk more realistically about this concept during 1988 and 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that when the Prime Minister spoke to the Cyprus Community Club of New South Wales at the opening of its premises on 12 March he first started to define in a positive way the limits of multiculturalism as stated in this definition that the Government lays down today. It is very important that the Government, in acknowledging that we accept this definition, is itself prepared to acknowledge the considerable shift and development that have occurred in its own views in this area, which give us a basis for bipartisanship. The Prime Minister ought now to acknowledge that and cease trying to exploit this issue in the way in which he did in his statement to the Asia-Australia group in Melbourne last weekend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Chairman, I wish to draw attention to, in total, I think, five separate matters arising under the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department. The first of them relates to the cost of running the various courts and tribunals for which the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) is responsible. I bring this together by reminding the Committee that in recent times we have seen the move of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal headquarters to Brisbane, another move by the Family Court of Australia to Melbourne and a move of the headquarters of the National Crime Authority to Melbourne. This must inevitably involve some quite considerable costs. Although I am sure that there were thought to be, at the time the decisions were made in those particular areas, very good and valid reasons for the moves, one cannot but acknowledge the fact that there are very considerable expenses involved in such moves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question arises-I think it is appropriate that the Attorney-General should on this occasion put on the record the precise reasons-as to why each of those tribunals moved its headquarters. Coming from Melbourne as I do, I am certainly not going to argue that the headquarters of the Family Court should not have been moved to Melbourne. It is probably equally wise that I do not argue against the proposition that the National Crime Authority headquarters should be moved to Melbourne. But it does raise a very interesting situation because the Chief Judge of the Family Court comes from Melbourne and the Chairman of the National Crime Authority also comes from Melbourne and one cannot help but draw from that the inference that that was a factor which led to the moves. Likewise, Mr Justice Hartigan, I gather, resides in Brisbane, which might not be unconnected to the fact that the headquarters of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal went on a migratory course to Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that arises is: when their terms come to an end and other persons are appointed to fill those positions, are we to assume that those headquarters will be moved somewhere else? There are costs involved, and I believe it is appropriate for the Attorney-General to say whether it is a matter of declared Government policy now that the headquarters of such courts and tribunals may legitimately be moved if the presiding officer, head or senior judge believes that that is a convenient course for him or her to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not make any personal criticisms of the individuals involved. Indeed, either during these brief remarks or at some other stage I will draw attention to the recent improvements in the-I do not know whether `productivity' is the right word-general standing of the Family Court and, I believe, in the quality of its work since Mr Justice Nicholson became the Chief Judge. So, I make no personal criticisms whatsoever of any of the individuals involved. But the plain fact of the matter is that there seems to be an enormous amount of moving going on in this area. It should be stated whether it is a matter of declared policy and we should be told what is the cost involved so that we know exactly what we are paying for in return for the benefits which no doubt the Attorney-General will say we derive from this transmigration. Is it the intention of the Government that they will all move somewhere else at some stage or other, when other persons come along and occupy these senior positions which the heads of those three bodies now occupy?</PARA>
<PARA> I was wondering about the headquarters of the Special Investigations Unit, which seems to be somewhere between Saturn and Mars, so far as I can tell, and I will be making some additional comments about that body later. The Australian Securities Commission and its location is an intriguing situation, and I would think this is an appropriate occasion for the Attorney-General to tell us what has happened with respect to the headquarters of that body. I heard one suggestion the other day that it was not to have a single headquarters but rather was to be loosely scattered around amongst various cities. I do not know whether that is the case or not, but if we are to be asked to appropriate large sums of money, as we are tonight, for the operations of this new Australian Securities Commission we should have a clear statement on this occasion from the Attorney-General as to where the headquarters of the Australian Securities Commission is to be located, assuming of course it survives its outing in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I want to draw attention to the quite unsatisfactory situation concerning the imposition of charges, particularly on members of parliament, when the Freedom of Information Act is being used. The Freedom of Information Act was claimed by its original advocates as being a great step forward in public administration, and indeed it had the potential to be exactly that. I regret to say that beyond any shadow of doubt it has not been successful, and one of the reasons it has not been successful is that the present Government has embarked upon a deliberate policy of frustrating the proper working of that Act. It has done that by imposing excessive charges on the use of the Freedom of Information Act, and, more perniciously, imposing them on members of parliament, thereby frustrating members of parliament in the proper exercise of their functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if one uses the Freedom of Information Act, as I do, and reads collectively the letters one gets back from some public servants making decisions under the Freedom of Information Act, one cannot help but reach the conclusion that some of them are simply smart alecs taking smart points, imposing high charges with the deliberate intention of preventing an Act of the Parliament being used properly. I do not make that charge lightly. It is based on about 100 cases of my own actual knowledge, and it is very dispiriting when a situation arises such as one which arose with a colleague of mine in this House. He made a quite simple request for documents which, by coincidence, the Attorney-General maintained were contained in a very few files of the Department. He was presented with a bill for $7,000: `Pay up $7,000 or no documents, thank you very much'. There is nothing free about that and there is nothing information oriented about that. It is a denial of information under an Act of this Parliament when public servants behave in that way. When we look at statements made by people like Senator Walsh, I believe it is undoubtedly done as a deliberate act of government policy to prevent the public and members of parliament and journalists from obtaining access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA> If after overcoming that obstacle race of getting around the excessive charges levied and getting over the technical objections that are placed in one's way one is fortunate enough actually to get some documents under the Freedom of Information Act, often one finds they are not worth getting. I went through my file tonight to bring in one that I got. I will hold it up so that members of the Committee can see it. It is covered in black printer's ink. That is the Freedom of Information Act Labor Party style. I will show honourable members the second page, which is even better. This minute from one of the Government departments is signed-not inappropriately, I suppose-`G. Hope'. It may as well have been signed by Mr Hope because faith and charity are certainly not there. I shall ask leave to incorporate this in the Hansard for historical purposes, if I may, so that we can see the way in which the Freedom of Information Act is being used. Is that satisfactory to the Minister?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps if the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) did not waste so much time waving in the air pieces of paper which are unintelligible to anyone he might have had more time to speak to this chamber on the matters he finds important. Let me say at the outset that I listened with interest to the honourable gentleman's comments as to the headquarters of the National Crime Authority. Of course he does not seem to realise that the National Crime Authority is not a body which is centred in one particular place but rather is a body which distributes its functions to various parts of Australia. If the honourable member had listened to public statements by the new chairman, Mr Faris, he would have realised that Mr Faris has made it quite clear that he does not see the National Crime Authority being centred in one particular place or one particular building because of its national role and its national function. I would say, with all of the good things in the portfolio of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), it is a great pity we have had 10 minutes so far of only negative comments and no examination or discussion in this chamber of the major items which I find very good within the allocation of the appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major items is the allocation of $42.552m for an improved fight against organised crime. These are new initiatives from this Government and from the Attorney who unarguably, and as the honourable member for Menzies admitted, has led the fight against organised crime since this Government came to office. There is no need for me to reiterate tonight the initiatives that this Government has in fact undertaken and the major legislation which has been presented by the Hawke Government in that fight against organised crime. Of course, as many honourable members know, my view is that is a fight we will probably never win. The very nature and structure of organised crime that exists in Australia, indeed in the world, today is such that not one country alone will be successful in suppressing organised crime as we now know it. But it is a battle that no government can afford to let up on, and it is a battle that no government in the world can afford to take lightly. One has only to look at current newspaper reports from Colombia and a little town called Medellin to see the power, the evil, the corruption and the immorality that exists in organised crime. One wonders, one looks in horror, when a group of criminals can in fact declare war on a whole society and can apparently have the capacity to put their threat into effect. That is happening there now. People are being killed, shot; law and order and democracy and the democratic processes are indeed being broken down. So it is a battle which no government anywhere in the world can afford to ignore. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier when I raised the issue of organised crime, it is my view that it is probably a battle that in the foreseeable future no government or country will win. There are many reasons for that; not the least of course is that there is a marketplace out there for such things as prostitution, gambling and pornography. If some people in this House get their way, that collection will include abortion, the market for which organised crime in fact has under control. That is where organised crime gets the large sums of money, the billions of dollars, which fund its corrupt activities in the societies in which it operates. I have a rather strong view that it is time we gave more attention to the demand marketplace. We should spend more time and more effort in reducing demand because, unless we reduce demand the fight, frankly, will go nowhere. We will forever spend more money and pass more laws, but always be chasing our tail while that demand market exists. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) that his private member's Bill will very simply transfer the marketplace for abortion from a system of control to a system of no control, allowing the purveyors of crime to take that marketplace. Again, as a former member of the police force, I can tell honourable members from my experience that it is a demand marketplace, it is market which I may not like, but all you do is simply say to women, `The only market we now give you is on the back streets, controlled by organised crime'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr CLEELAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter which I think many people really do not understand, Mr Deputy Chairman. In reality the demand marketplace is the area where organised crime operates. Whenever we create that demand or move away from controls on areas of organised crime we create further wealth, further profit and further funds, which comes back to corrupt the very societies in which such crime operates. I find that a great tragedy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is very little time left for this debate, but there are several matters in the appropriations which honourable members should find interesting. One is the additional funding for the Office of the Narcotic Control Broad (ONCB) in Thailand. I know that many honourable members have been to Thailand and that many have visited the computer area in the Office of the Narcotic Control Board. Only in January of this year I made yet another visit to Thailand and met with Major-General Chavalit, who heads the ONCB, and with the Australian Government officials who are assisting there. I found that they were having problems in putting the computer language into Thai form. The terminal systems for the new airport in Thailand were not operating correctly. There was no access from the terminals back into the mainframe. I am very pleased indeed to see that the Australian Government is providing an additional $750m to improve the terminal position and that the new Thai code, which brings the Thai alphabet into a form suitable for computerisation, will now be effective, linking Bangkok International Airport to the mainframe computer. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of us know that intelligence work is the means by which most of the world's major drug traffickers are caught. They are caught through intelligence rather than front door or on-the-spot checks of people coming through Customs. The vast majority of the major importers of drugs are caught through intelligence and by means such as the ONCB computer. Our improved computer controls through airport networks will make Australian intelligence so much better and will make the increased presence of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in Thailand more effective. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there is a new proposal in the appropriations to produce a similar sort of setup in the Philippines. Unfortunately, much of our drug trafficking comes through South East Asia. The new measures provided for in the Budget will put a computer system in the Philippines. Again, it will enhance the intelligence gathering activities of the Philippine police and, through the presence of AFP officers in the Philippines, will improve our own intelligence and help in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which I find of great interest is the allocation of $75,000 for a national crime survey to be carried out by the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Australian National University (ANU). One of the matters which concern the Committee which I chair, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority, is the lack of hard research and hard data on what is occurring in the street. It makes it difficult to make reasoned decisions. We will fund an improved survey which, hopefully, will give far more information both to parliamentarians and to other decision making bodies to help them make more rational decisions on the very many crime problems existing in Australia's streets today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the House's attention to a discussion that I had with a number of sawmillers and timber processors in June in the Otway Ranges and in the city of Colac. They raised a number of problems in view of their activities in the very productive Otway Ranges, which provide a great amount of timber for Victoria. The people came from Victree Timber Products Pty Ltd, Adams Sawmill, Colac Pine Plantation, Murnane's Sawmill, Calco Timbers Pty Ltd, Associated Kiln Driers Pty Ltd, Frizon Sawmill, and W. H. Bennett and Sons Pty Ltd. They have been the quiet achievers of rural Australia. They have a concern about the environment. Their general attitude to me was that we should be planting more trees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The city of Colac is the base for timber processing and a great number of jobs in the timber industry have been created. The representatives drew to my attention the problems of the hardwood eucalypt factory of the timber industry. Basically the hardwoods are harvested from the State reserves. There are not enough in the private plantations, there is not enough replanting going on, and there is insufficient regeneration to continue a self-sustaining hardwood operation in the Otways. The other important matter they drew to my attention was the lack of encouragement for hardwood plantations by way of taxation provisions. Sawlogs are becoming scarce. However, the residue from the sawlogs that are now being harvested is being used for woodchips. In the longer term they indicate that the Government's policies need to be adjusted in order to have a better replanting process and an adjustment of the royalty procedures is needed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of softwoods, pine trees provide double the productivity of the hardwoods. I was very encouraged to hear that pine plantations will give a much better commercial return. There is about a 20-year commercial return in rainfall areas of 30 inches and above. Of course, there is much better utilisation of the land used. In my area, in the Otways, there is great argument among the locals as to whether eucalypts or pines should be planted, based on aesthetic and community reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The import bill, as my sawmillers pointed out, is about $1.7 billion, which constitutes 13 per cent of our current account deficit. If we had a forestry policy we could substitute 70 per cent from our own resources. The sawmillers wanted encouragement for private tree planting and a tax system which would be tax neutral so that investors would plant trees in plantations having in mind the long gestation period; pines take 20 to 30 years and hardwoods take 30 to 40 years. Investors are looking for a 7 per cent internal rate of return in the first instance when they apply their funds. They want section 124J of the taxation Act to be amended to allow a deduction on the purchasing of a forest and taxable income on the seller rather than the deduction when the forest is felled which would go a long way to both more establishment and more trading, and a better management of forests-in simple terms, to encourage investors to trade in the selling and buying of forest materials. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue is the spreading of income at clear fell, when 70 to 80 per cent of the income is received. It needs to be tackled so that the tax rate is aligned with the lack of income over such a long period. Finally, the sawmillers were suggesting that there be more rational debate about forests, trees and timber. The foresters and the sawmillers look at forestry in the long term because they take very sound approaches. They want to be around in 50 or 60 years and they want the forests to be regenerated. I draw to the attention of the House a 1987 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts which recommended that private plantations be encouraged and that the taxation provisions applying to plantation forestry be changed to encourage individual investors. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not riveting for the honourable member, but it will be in a minute. The Opposition has always talked about lowering taxes and has given the impression that we are a high taxing country. Today's Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) graph shows that from 1984, since this Government has been in office, to today Australia has fallen from being the sixth lowest taxing country to the fourth lowest taxing country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Between 1984 and 1987, the total tax revenue of all countries in the OECD rose by an average of 1.9 per cent. In Australia it was less than a third of that. It was minus 0.6 per cent. But that is only half the story. When one considers the amount of taxation collected in a country one also has to consider the amount that is actually spent. Not many countries run a perfectly balanced budget. The outlays for the same period, between 1984 and 1987, fell from negative 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to negative 0.6 per cent of GDP. It reduced by 2.6 per cent in Australia compared with 1.3 per cent in the OECD. The negative numbers indicate deficits. That is, governments in those days spent more money than they raised in taxes. This financial year we are in the positive. We are running a surplus, that is, we are not spending as much as we are raising. So, for this year the figure is 1.2 per cent of GDP. That has been a very dramatic turnaround for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When one talks about taxes one should also focus on the amount of money that governments spend. This Government, in particular, has been very successful in cutting its spending. I would like to compare Australia with New Zealand, which recently introduced a consumption tax. In the same period I am talking about, from 1984 to 1987, New Zealand went from being the fifth lowest taxing country in the OECD to the fourteenth lowest. That is, New Zealand went up by about nine spots. In 1984, New Zealand's tax take was 32.9 per cent of GDP. It has now risen to 38.6 per cent of GDP. One of the senior figures in the Liberal Party-that is, Mr Elliott-has been the champion of the consumption tax and he is no orphan on that side of politics. But we can see that if we use the New Zealand experience and if we go down that far in the recent calls by Mr Elliott and others to go over to a consumption tax, it just means that the tax take goes up quite considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I would like to point out is that the coalition, during its whole term of office, always ran deficits. There was not one period between 1976 and 1983 where it ran a surplus on the Budget. It always spent more than it took in taxes. In fact, in its last year in office a massive negative 3.8 per cent of GDP was in its final Budget. As I have said before, that has been turned around to a positive 1.2 per cent of GDP this year. So it really does put paid to the lie that we are a high taxing country. We are one of the lowest taxing countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-the fourth lowest. We have heard from the Opposition about tax cuts. It is always on about tax cuts although we never see the colour of its money. But as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) pointed out this week, if we are going to cut income tax in the way which has been suggested by the Opposition then, of course, the people who are penalised are the poor, and the people who benefit from that particular policy are the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> When Opposition members are talking about taxation policy I would like to hear a few of the figures such as I have quoted here today. In particular, when they are talking about their taxation policy, they might put in some of the figures to show where they are going to cut to pay for those tax cuts. It has been a long time since we have seen a Liberal taxation policy. One was trotted out in 1987. That was full of holes and, as we found out during the 1987 election campaign, it could not stand up. We have been promised a taxation policy at the end of this month. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in the other place yesterday Senator Newman made certain remarks which I feel require a response. The good senator said, speaking of a request she made to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to provide an aircraft to bring a delegation to Canberra to speak to the Prime Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is interesting that Mr Hawke is not prepared to send a plane to pick them up, but he is prepared to send a plane to Hobart to pick up a group of disabled children to send them on a skiing holiday, provided that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is shown on television as a quid pro quo. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook interjected:</PARA>
<PARA>That's a disgusting allegation. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Newman continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely factual. </PARA>
<PARA>The only thing that was absolutely factual was her assent to Senator Cook's proposition that it was indeed a disgusting allegation. I suppose in the good senator's fervid imagination she can conceive of the Prime Minister ringing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Channel 6 local television station in Tasmania and saying, `Look, we will put on this plane to take disabled children who for three years have been planning a trip to the snowfields under the supervision of a number of aides, provided you will televise Duncan Kerr appearing with them'. I suppose the good senator in her fervid imagination, and in terms of what she no doubt conceives to be some small political advantage, could have reached such a conclusion. But only in the most obtuse of minds could such a conclusion have suggested itself, and it is patently false. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that shortly after the pilots strike was coming into effect the organisers of a rehabilitation recreation program in Tasmania contacted my office to say that they had six disabled people, three with spina-bifida, one with some limbs missing, another with some intellectual disability and another disabled person, who needed to get to the mainland. For three years they had been planning, as part of a process of normalisation to make sure that those with disabilities in the community are able to live a full life, a trip to the snowfields on the mainland. This was obviously a case where I thought a compassionate intervention was warranted. I contacted the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). I ultimately reached the position whereby a plane which had come down to Tasmania to bring Senator Richardson, Senator Tate and other members of Parliament was able, on the return flight when it was travelling with less than full capacity, to pick up those six disabled persons and the three people who were to be their aides for the duration of the trip and enable them to undertake the program that had been three years in the planning. Frankly, it is a disgusting and quite baseless allegation that Senator Newman has made. Senator Newman has developed a reputation for making baseless allegations. In this instance it does neither her nor the process of the Parliament any credit to have made such a false and foolish allegation. </PARA>

About 12 months ago John Halfpenny left the Metal Workers Union and went to the Trades Hall Council of Victoria. To my knowledge Transfield is a private company owned and operated by Franco Belgiono-Nettis and a Mr Saltari, I do not know his first name. They are both about 80 years of age, Mr Saltari may be a fraction younger. When Franco was absent his son Marco takes charge. Mr Saltari's son Robert is also involved with the company. John is a close friend of the two older men and a particular friend of Franco's. I have met all of the men. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned Franco makes the decisions, especially on the frigates at John's behest. Franco and John met about three years ago, I don't know where. John knew about the frigate contract at least three years ago. John decided, on his own initiative, to find a company large enough and with sufficient capital to provide for a bid. I know that John chose Transfield. John said to me `Transfield would be the ideal company to be involved with this'. Subsequent to John telling me this, Franco arranged for John and I to meet with him and his wife. John and I stayed at the Hilton in Sydney on this occasion and I know Franco provided the air tickets and the accommodation for our weekend. We had a meal together at a yacht club, near Elizabeth Bay, where Franco is a member. On the Sunday we spent most of the day at Franco's house. All this took place about two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Next thing I remember, an employee of Franco's, Tony Shepherd, came to Melbourne and John and I had several meals with Tony and they, i.e. John and Tony, openly discussed the frigate contract and who Tony should see in Canberra, i.e. which politicians and naval authorities. The naval authorities had to assess the offers being made to build the frigates, who would make their recommendation to the appropriate Minister, in this case, Mr Beazley. </PARA>
<PARA> Franco visited Tony Shepherd in Melbourne to be a spokesperson in the company that John could deal with on a day to day basis. John suggested to Franco that Shepherd be set up in Williamstown in Victoria separate from Transfield in an endeavour to win the contract . . . The idea was that Shepherd did not show the name of `Transfield' in Melbourne as people may realise that John was involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that Franco, John, Tony and John White, a Chairman of Amecon (the company which now has won the contract) set up a consortium and arranged for the bid to be made. There are other people involved but I am not sure who they are. </PARA>
<PARA> After setting up the consortium there was a lot of hard work. There is a company set up in New Zealand; it is Amecon's sister company. John would often go to New Zealand to lobby for the contract. I know that John has travelled to New Zealand with Franco, Tony Shepherd and John White. </PARA>
<PARA> He said `They (New Zealand government) are excited about having me there in New Zealand. They can't do enough for me'. </PARA>
<PARA> John never paid for the trips to New Zealand, it was either the union or Transfield or someone from New Zealand. I told John that I was not interested in going to New Zealand, I did not want to be involved in this type of practice. I would estimate that John travelled to New Zealand at least ten times in the past two years. I would say that this was outside John's employment duties. John argues that he is assisting the workers by getting the contract to Williamstown dock area. But I am sure that John didn't tell any one of the workers that he was representing Transfield. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that John has spoken to the Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, and discussed the Amecon tender. John told me that he did approach Mr Beazley. John told me this at our house months ago. I know that John also spoke to other people in Canberra, in the Defence Department. I know how he operates-he would have spoken to senior public servants and anyone he could lobby with concerning Amecon's tender for the frigate contract. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, tonight I want to raise the Opposition's apparent fear of asking any questions of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) since the Budget was brought down in this House. We have witnessed day after day in Question Time in this Parliament, in a session following the Budget, the Treasurer obviously being ignored by the Opposition simply because the Opposition does not want the Treasurer to be on his feet answering the questions that the Opposition may put forward. He is sitting here day after day in the House waiting for the shadow spokesperson to come forward with some questions in relation to the Budget, and day after day we are watching him being ignored. We would have to ask why this is so. Why are we in such a situation? If you look back over the Hansard records, there has never been a period in the Parliament when a Treasurer has had so few questions directed to him following a Budget. It is obvious now that the Opposition believes that its shadow Treasurer and its leader are so lacking in policies on economic matters, are so lacking in a Budget response, that they have decided that they will ignore the issue completely and fail to front up with any questions whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a strange situation, as we were led to believe when the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) took over from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and appointed the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) as shadow Treasurer that we were going to see some policy development. The policies are not coming forward, and Opposition members have gone into the bunkers completely in relation to their position on the Budget. We have seen day after day an Opposition at the moment throwing its weight behind a group of pilots who have decided to hold this country to ransom, and Opposition members see that support for the pilots as being more important than directing any questions to the Treasurer. It is a clear indication that the Opposition has gone into the bunker, that it has no policies, that it has nothing of any substance to put forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested, indeed anxious, to hear exactly what the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) was going to say. I must say it does not alter anything I said in the House the other day. We are clearly dealing here with two separate issues. One, of course, is a question which, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) properly pointed out this morning, is a matter now for the Federal Police to investigate. The other goes to the integrity of the source selection process for the frigate. What was described here was clearly part of an intense lobbying process, not part of the source selection process of the frigate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The source selection process of the frigate is based not on what lobbying may be done of me, what lobbying may be done of individual members of parliament; it is based on the documentation which is presented to the Royal Australian Navy and taken from the Royal Australian Navy to other sections of the Department of Defence, which consider it. It is taken from those sections of the Department of Defence and the Royal Australian Navy and placed then before several committees of the Department of Defence, which include representatives of not only the Department of Defence but also the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance. After proceeding through that process it goes to a committee which effectively consists of the chiefs of the defence forces and the Secretary to the Department of Defence. What emerges from that is a Cabinet submission which is presented to government. On the basis of those recommendations, the Government considers what course it might follow. </PARA>
<PARA> At every stage of that process-this is one of the most clear cut source selection decisions I have seen in the years that I have been Minister for Defence-the recommendations came forward for the eventual decision that was taken by the Government. I know there have been rumours to the contrary. I know there are constantly suggestions of influence here and there or whatever, but to cast doubt on the source selection process that produced that set of recommendations to go to the Cabinet does not cast doubt on my integrity as Minister for Defence or on the integrity of any other Minister of this Government. It casts doubt on the integrity of the Royal Australian Navy personnel who consider this process, the huge number of people who go through that process of analysis before it finally arrives at government. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a decision which has welled up from this process to the Government, then on the basis of lobbying to be overturned. This is a decision which is a product of a persistent series of investigations and studies of a mass of documentation-hundreds and hundreds of pages, thousands of documents-a process which in the end produces that recommendation for government. The Government did not vary one jot or tittle the recommendation which came from the Navy and from the Defence Department and those augmented committee processes. It came forward from them to the Government and was decided by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens when anything is about to be considered by the Government is that vast numbers of people believe they can influence the project. In the course of the project consideration I, as Minister for Defence, had many meetings not only with the various consortia that were involved-Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd (AMECON) and Australian Warship Systems (AWS)-but also with the principals of the consortia, parts of the companies associated with the consortia, at different points of time the trade union leadership of Newcastle, the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, the Premier of Victoria, Ministers from Victoria, and Mr John Halfpenny on numerous occasions. In that process it was absolutely no different from any other tender process which I preside over as Minister for Defence. I do not sit in an ivory tower. I am open to anybody who wants to approach me on those matters that are before the Department of Defence to discuss those things with me. If I were not to give access to all sides--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The Minister's time has expired. As no other Minister is rising, the Minister may continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were not to give access to all the companies in that particular process, then the complaints would start to roll in in a big way. If people are going to try to demonstrate in this particular instance some sort of change or altered part of that process, I really think that, in a situation where some political intervention has caused the intensely detailed and well-respected processes of the naval establishment and also the Department of Defence to intervene, they have to get into that process in a gremlin-like fashion, and overturn it over hundreds and hundreds of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course there is always debate within the Department of Defence, with the Navy, on exactly what weight should be given to this or that factor. There is never going to be unanimity on this or that factor. The fact of the matter is that on every single committee level at which this was considered, the recommendation came forward to the next level that the eventually successful tenderers should be the people who got it. It does no credit to the process to try to have it smeared in this way. I suppose that if there had been the estranged wife or somebody else associated with the AWS bid or, for that matter, anyone else associated with any of the other many equipment purchases which we undertake on which lobbying is done of us, one would be able to tease out the same set of discussions. One would be able to sit down and hear one group of companies say to another, `Look, we really ought to get into Canberra to lobby Beazley', or `We really ought to get into Canberra to lobby the Chairman of the Caucus Industrial Committee'-`or to lobby the Opposition or to lobby someone else'; because they do. They turn up at our committees. They turn up in my office. They send us documentation on all this material, and they go and openly advocate their wares. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that in connection with the AMECON bid, the Victorian Government, the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the Victorian union movement, the companies associated with the Williamstown Naval Dockyard, all of them got together to lobby here, to lobby in New Zealand, to lobby elsewhere, around Newcastle, to lobby around the country, not disguised at any point of time. Halfpenny and all sorts of other people were up in New Zealand at public forums, along with AMECON and other representatives, making the case for the frigate and particularly making the case for their own particular set of objectives. This is a perfectly normal part of the process. People pursue these contracts passionately. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever might happen to be a question of any particular relationship that Mr Halfpenny might have with any particular company or anyone else involved in the process of the eventually successful tenderer, is, I suppose, along with all those other allegations, a matter now for the Australian Federal Police to consider. But what is not arguable in this process is that it was a process of integrity. The way in which the lobbying was done, the way in which a company might be formed, the way in which a bid might be undertaken, is an issue separate from the integrity of the process by which a decision is ultimately taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not the only one lobbied. Of course people in the Department of Defence are lobbied too, all the time. What has to be demonstrated, if people want to go down that road, is that that process was corrupted. Of course, it was not. The Chief of the Naval Staff, the admirals, the commodore who ran the program, the various individuals in the Department of Defence and who brought that recommendation up to the Government, are not corrupted individuals. That recommendation arrived at the Government from these sources. It was not varied by the Government. The Government agreed with the decision that was put before it. It was a clear-cut winner in this particular case. It was in the end a very easy decision for Government to take. </PARA>
