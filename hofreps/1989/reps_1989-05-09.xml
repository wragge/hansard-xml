<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, in recognition of his responsibilities for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I refer the Minister to a comment that he made on 5 April last that the manufacturers of alternative brand drugs have:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . been able to assure and convince me that they hold ample stocks of the finished product . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not a fact that public evidence has proved that that situation was totally wrong? Will the Minister now give the Parliament and the Australian people a categoric guarantee that supply difficulties with the drugs to which many Australians are now restricted have been overcome and, if not, will he immediately change the Government's supply policy to ensure adequate supplies of these necessary drugs to the Australian public?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I made that statement it was quite accurate, and it remains accurate. The situation is that, when the Government introduced its generic pricing policy, it was part of a range of issues and matters that were put forward. One of those was to develop the Australian generic industry, and also to stimulate the Australian pharmaceutical industry through factor (f). The Government's policy was to have a 20c differential between the price of the cheapest available generic drug and the price of any other drug in that market. What was clearly shown was that, in nearly every case, the pharmaceutical manufacturers of those generic drugs were quite able to provide those drugs to the suppliers. A problem did exist, not in the actual manufacture of the drug, but in the distribution of the drug. That was shown to be the case in a couple of examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as I am aware, there are no shortages of drugs at the moment. No evidence has been put to me at this stage to show that there are any shortages. From all the evidence that is available-and I can refer no later than to the date to which my information applies, and I have heard nothing to the contrary-the generic drugs that are on the list are available and should be available for pharmacists and their patients.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Prime Minister aware of suggestions that the Government's wage-tax package will not improve the living standards of Australians-Australian families in particular? If so, will the Government adopt the alternative prescriptions of those who are making those suggestions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2197" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can say, as a result of the wide ranging visits that I have had around Australia since the Treasurer delivered the statement, that the reaction to the tax-family allowance package has been overwhelmingly positive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am comforted by the fact that we hear giggles from honourable members opposite, because if they go on through the weeks and the months ahead deluding themselves that the package has not been well received, that suits us fine; they are wrong. The only quarter from which there have been suggestions to the contrary is from the Opposition which is now led by the honourable member for Kooyong. It may be noted that in his capacity as shadow Treasurer, he described the Treasurer's wage-tax package as being `devoid of economic structure and rationale'. It is a much more appropriate description of his time as shadow Treasurer. There is no doubt that the package will ensure a very significant rise in living standards for the people of Australia. It is worth noting that, even before we take into account what happened in the tax package, in the period since 1983, average living standards per capita have risen by about 8 per cent per annum. I hope that members of the Opposition will continue to try to dispute that because the facts are indisputable. There has been an 8 per cent increase in real living standards in that period for two reasons: firstly, because of the massive increase in employment and, secondly, because of the massive increase in the social wage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In referring to the package itself, while a single taxpayer on average earnings will receive a tax cut which is equivalent to a wage increase of about $24 a week, families will, in addition, benefit from a very substantial family package. The greatest relative benefits accrue to families in the income range of $17,000 to $30,000 a year which have borne the brunt of restraint in the last few years. For example, a one-income family with two children and on $20,000 a year will be in a position to pay no net tax because the tax that that family pays will be more than offset by the family allowances that it receives. The measures announced by my colleague the Treasurer in the April statement will assist some two million families through increasing rates of family allowance in the family allowance supplement. In fact, in this coming financial year, 1989-90, more than $2 billion will be spent in this area of family allowances and family allowance supplements. So not only have we had that massive increase which will benefit people through the tax package and the family allowance package but also, in an historic decision to index these allowances, those benefits will be maintained in real value into the future.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion may I say that part of the question from the honourable member asked whether we would embrace or consider alternative policy prescriptions from those who are making the suggestion on the other side that ours is not an adequate position. The problem is that there are no suggestions and there is no alternative tax policy from the other side. There is none upon which we could act. The Opposition has elected a leader who, as shadow Treasurer, had two years in which to produce a tax policy. In the language of today--</PARA>

<PARA>That was in April of 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the only numbers that the then shadow Treasurer has been able to get together are the numbers to dump the then Leader of the Opposition. Those are the only ones he is likely to be able to get together because throughout his career he has not had the discipline for hard, constructive policy-making. Nothing has changed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Social Security to a comment made on Monday by the newly endorsed Liberal candidate for Goldstein that it was an absolute disgrace for a country like Australia to have 30 per cent of its people receiving most of their income from government benefits. Can the Minister comment on the accuracy of this statement?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2199" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The newly elected candidate certainly wasted no time in spreading the gospel of the New Right, particularly as that section of the Liberal Party approaches the whole question of income security. The first thing to be said is that the newly elected candidate-another professor being recycled, apparently, in this place-got his facts and his sums quite wrong. Social security pensioners and beneficiaries, rather than increasing under this Government, have decreased as a percentage of the population from 19 per cent in June 1983 to 16 per cent in June 1988. One of the great myths of conservative political philosophy is that governing with any degree of fairness and social justice inevitably will lead to some blow-out in social security expenditure and the numbers on pensions and benefits. Quite the contrary is true. A massive blow-out-the greatest blow-out-in terms of numbers on pensions and benefits occurred during the conservative Government's period of office. That was accompanied by a significant increase in expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one looks at conservative governments, one sees that pattern-not a pattern of reduced expenditure and improved benefits per person or a pattern of reduction in dependency, but quite the opposite.</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Kemp should know also that social security spending as a proportion of real Budget outlays has decreased-not increased-from 24.1 per cent in 1983-84 to 23 per cent in 1987-88. Social security spending is now making less demand on the economy and real social security outlays as a percentage of real gross domestic product have declined from 6.9 per cent in 1983-84 to 6.2 per cent in 1987-88. The number of people who depend on social security as a proportion of every 100 people in the work force-or the dependency ratio-has dropped significantly from 43.7 per cent in August 1983 to 34.9 per cent in January this year.</PARA>
<PARA> When we hear members of the Opposition suggest that somehow social security expenditure would be handled in a more parsimonious manner by the conservatives, we have to say, `Just look at the past'-a past in which, rather than there being reductions and targeting of expenditure, there has been significant expansion. Under this Government we have seen a careful control in relation to our social expenditure and a great deal of targeting which has resulted in quite massive improvements in terms of the real incomes of the most needy groups in the community and ensured that the proper incentives and opportunities are in place for people. One hears a great deal from the conservatives about incentive and opportunity. What incentive and opportunity was there in the massive blow-out in dependency that occurred under the previous Government? We get closer to the mark when we look at the prescription of Mr Porter, a friend of Professor Kemp, for the priorities of the so-called New Right. In his most recent spending and taxes book he has described the social security system as `in part a wasteful middle class welfare system funded by the tax system, both of which discourage self-provision'.</PARA>
<PARA> He continues that the social security system's role can be more effectively carried out if `it is not bogged down churning taxes and welfare through middle income groups'. I have no reason to think that that is not the view of the Leader of the Opposition, because the one thing I recall him saying in relation to the --</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, he recognises the importance of health research in this country and its connection with the health of families. We have always had a very fine record in medical research. I name simply Sir Macfarlane Burnet, the virologist, and Sir John Eccles, the physiologist, both of whom were Nobel Laureates. This country's record in medical research has been very good. The Hawke Government, in its first six years, has recognised that. We have increased funding for health research by 110 per cent in our first six years in government. We have more than doubled it in that period. However, because of the neglect of our predecessors, it was necessary to continue a growth rate in the health research area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday's science and technology announcement by the Prime Minister will ensure a continued and well-balanced program supporting high quality medical research in this country. Indeed, we have tried to recognise the areas which need special attention, particularly personnel, where there is a need to reverse the brain drain. Scholarships and fellowships such as the Eccles awards and the Sir Macfarlane Burnet fellowships are being set up to bring back from overseas health and medical researchers to work again in this country. Equally--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I pointed out some time ago to the honourable member for Gippsland-and he would have known this if he had bothered to listen-this Government has already increased health research expenditure by 110 per cent to make up for the neglect that occurred in the past. We need to bring back these people from overseas, and that is why these fellowships have been established. Equally, at the other end of the scale, we need to get young people into medical research. So our postgraduate scholarships have increased in value and number and, in addition, a series of priming grants to help young researchers to move from the PhD level into the health research level has been established. In addition, there will be extra moneys for medical equipment and medical research because, again, the cost of that equipment has grown rapidly and the need to maintain high levels of equipment for research is recognised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have also tried to identify some of the health research areas which need high priority. For instance, we will be funding a new environmental toxicology unit because a whole range of interests has recognised that as an important area of need for health research. Again, special research efforts will be focused on specific health problems affecting Australia. The National Health and Medical Research Council has identified asthma and menopausal research as two main areas and also the health needs of particular groups of Australians such as Aborigines, people of non-English speaking backgrounds and unemployed young people. Again, we will be placing a major new emphasis on moneys for public health research, which in this country has been neglected for decades. Therefore, particular attention will be given to expanding public health research in this country to lay an adequate foundation, which we do not have in this country, for proper public health delivery.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports that Bond University is seeking additional finance to help with its establishment, given that enrolments seem to have fallen somewhat short of earlier predictions. At the time the Treasurer provided foreign investment approval for investment in the university he did so on the basis that the university would not seek financial assistance from the Commonwealth. I have made it very clear to the university that the Commonwealth will not provide it with any direct financial assistance. In relation to any particular requests, the Vice-Chancellor wrote to us seeking support from the Australian Research Council. I pointed out to the Vice-Chancellor the existing policy, which is that academics, individual members of the university, like any Australian, are able to apply for research grants from the Australian Research Council. However, they are not eligible for such programs as key centres or special research centres. It is perhaps not surprising that Bond University is having difficulty in attracting students because, after all, we have committed enormous additional resources to the public university sector-universities and colleges-and we have embarked on the biggest expansion of the public system in history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the original plans for the Bond University, there may have been an expectation that the level of unmet demand would continue, but as a result of our decisions we have made substantial inroads into that unmet demand, particularly in Queensland where there will be some 10,000 additional places created in the course of the next triennium. So in this area it can be seen that our policies, with our particularly strong support for the public university sector, will ensure that there will not be much room in Australia for the development of private institutions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that tourism has become a major industry in this country and, of course, has boomed since this Government has been in office. This Government has taken many steps to facilitate that development. Amongst those steps has been the facilitation of additional flights to Australia, with agreements being reached with all sorts of countries in relation to travel between ourselves and those countries, the latest of which, as the honourable member for Fadden said, is additional flights between Singapore and Australia and between Thailand and Australia. I think that is evidence of the fact that we have an ongoing program of ensuring that we do have additions to that capacity to bring tourists to this country. For instance, the Singapore agreement means that there will be 3,800 extra seats per week as between Singapore Airlines and Qantas in additional flights between Singapore and Australia which will be phased in over the next year. Obviously, by means of these bilateral international aviation agreements, we are continually expanding the capacity for additional tourists to come to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member suggests, there have been some difficulties in relation to Qantas, particularly with its maintenance difficulties and shortage of skilled personnel. Of course, that partly reflects the enormous growth of Qantas and the enormous growth of the aviation industry, which has meant that there is a shortage of skilled personnel at various levels. That shortage is being addressed as a high priority matter by Qantas and other organisations involved in the aviation industry to ensure that we do overcome those difficulties. These are problems of affluence and have been created by our very success. They are not the problems that the Opposition had when it was in office. We know what happened then. Qantas was laying off staff and even ceased its trading arrangements altogether. There was no growth at all in the industry when the Opposition was in government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much of the emphasis in the micro-economic reform area has been on the big ticket items such as transportation and labour market improvements. But it should not be forgotten that in an economy exposed so much to exports, as ours is, we need skilled private enterprise to undertake these export activities. The Government has made great strides in improving the attitudes of Australian businesses and the public to the need for competitive exports. Trade dependence is the present and future scenario for Australia. The Government has made progress not only through exercising leadership and, of course, setting the right macro-economic parameters, but also through a number of small programs targeted to areas of specific problem. Earlier in the piece we set up the innovative agricultural marketing program and through it we are providing assistance for the development of new export products and markets. I recently met with the administrators of that scheme who estimate that with the expenditure so far they have actually encouraged something like an additional $600m worth of exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are also playing a significant part in improving the skills of managers and entrepreneurs working with firms engaged in exports. We have set up a marketing skills program-again a very small program, but one which provides grants to education and training institutions to run special programs for Australian exporters. At a recent meeting with the program's coordinating committee as well as some of the successful grant recipients, I heard something of the potential for improved performance, particularly with respect to our dairy and horticultural industries.</PARA>
<PARA> Particular effort is also being directed by the Government to agricultural cooperatives, which are a significant factor in farm production and which are now becoming major players with our country's agribusiness exporters and companies. We are encouraging cooperatives through policy work on some of the traditional problem areas for these organisations, such as retained earnings and complementary State legislation, as well as through specific assistance for marketing skills. There is a possibility later this year of Australia hosting a major conference and trade exhibition for cooperatives from the whole of the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA> I also place particular emphasis on the work being done by the Minister for Trade Negotiations in respect of Austrade, which has a number of specific strategies relating to our rural exports. I believe that we are getting better at using our overseas networks and passing the necessary information back to Australian grass roots producers. I do not support the New South Wales Farmers Association's call for the immediate abolition of Austrade.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of representations have been made to the Government on the question of John Shearer Holdings Ltd, and there is a problem. When one is attempting to solve national problems to get a completely national perspective there will be occasional instances where a small regional economy is affected. The Government regrets the decision of John Shearer Holdings to close its Adelaide manufacturing operations, if that is in fact the course it finally undertakes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government does not accept, however, that the April decision to terminate the agricultural equipment bounties is responsible for that closure. They were due to terminate by the end of 1990 in any event. Despite management references to the loss of the bounty and an industrial relations issue, the decision seems to have been made on commercial grounds. The management is entitled to take that decision. For a long time the Government provided substantial bounty assistance to John Shearer Holdings, which has experienced trading difficulties for some years. Despite some improvement in recent times, the viability of the firm's manufacturing operation has always been marginal. In other words, in the long-term--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally, I would not worry much about responding to the fanciful suggestions of Senator MacGibbon which appear from time to time in the Senate. This particular one appears regularly. Senator MacGibbon now finds himself, because of recent events, on something of an even playing field. I thank the honourable member for Brand for giving me the opportunity to respond to some of the points that Senator MacGibbon makes. Even more on an even playing field, I discovered that, while the Leader of the Opposition is unprepared to make announcements about the future composition of his front bench, some of his front- benchers are prepared to make announcements about it to people in my Department, which makes it even more likely that Senator MacGibbon can now consider himself quite seriously to be in the running.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The accusations made by Senator MacGibbon suggest that about three attempts were made to dock the submarine, very substantial damage was done during the docking and a very substantial amount of damage was done to the masts. In fact, the circumstances were nothing like what Senator MacGibbon outlined. In the process of docking the submarine there were some of the sorts of difficulties which occasionally occur-and have occurred before-in operations such as this. There was some minor damage which in no way compromised the submarine and which was repaired at the expense of the organisation responsible for the general refit being undertaken. In the course of that refit there was some damage to some of the masts. But that was not the product of any negligence on the part of the company involved; it was because the Navy had failed to provide appropriate covers. The work to repair that damage was done at marginal expense by the Navy. So, the fact of the matter is that very little of any concern occurred as far as that docking exercise was concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition persist in criticising the changes that have taken place in the disposition of our forces to the north and west of the country under policies which have been established for some years. The constant criticism of those changes is occasioning some concern among Liberal Party members in the north and west of the country who believe that they understand the common sense of the Government's policies in dispersing our forces around the coastline. But the fact of the matter is that if we are to establish a two-ocean navy policy it logically follows that we will have repair and refit capabilities. We do not establish a two- ocean policy on the assumption that we simply send ships over to Perth and park them there. Obviously, it means a great deal more than that. One of the things it means is that there will be adequate repair and refit capabilities in the Western Australian area. If the Liberal Party does decide that it wishes to describe what sensibly follows from a decision, which is obviously strategically soundly based, as pork-barrelling, it is welcome to do that. It will give us something to talk about during the course of the next Federal election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions I have attempted to draw attention to the fact that when one assesses the effectiveness of any government in connection with any of its programs one should attempt to assess the effectiveness of the government over the full term of the government. What I have indicated, and what cannot be refuted, is the fact that, having regard to the six years of the Hawke Government, there has never been in the history of the Commonwealth-as I have said on one previous occasion at least-a comparable period when the level of road funding was as high as it has been over the last six years. During that six years, as the honourable member who asked the question knows, the amount of funding injected into the nation's road system by the Federal Government has gone up by 21.5 per cent in real terms. That represents an additional $250m every year for each of those six years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Acting Speaker, as you and all members know, recently I had the opportunity to introduce a program which would apply $1.2 billion this year to the nation's road system at the Federal level. Not only have we applied $1.2 billion this year, we have also taken the opportunity to index that so that the real level of funding from the Federal Government will be maintained for at least the next three years. I have also emphasised that as a result of the cooperation and participation of the other two levels of government-namely, State and local-in the whole national road funding program, since 1983 not less than $20,000m has been injected into the nation's road system. That has never been equalled at any other time in the history of the Commonwealth. This Government need make no apologies for its outstanding record as far as road funding is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> I have had the opportunity just recently to announce two major programs, one for national arterial roads and one for national highways, both involving an injection by us of $2.5 billion over the next five years-a total of $5 billion. If one includes what we are going to put into State arterial roads and local roads-another $1 billion-one will see that at least $5 billion will be allocated by this Government over the next five years. People right across Australia see that magnificent road construction and maintenance projects are being undertaken everywhere. This Government is responsible for that.</PARA>

However, what the honourable member does not understand is that we are investigating the most modern technology. If the honourable member believes that we can get the same quality of product from an existing mill, just taking out the chlorine process, as compared with a product obtained by using the most modern technology which has been developed overseas, all I can say is that that is an indication of the sort of hopeless economic and technological thinking which has characterised the State Government of Tasmania. It is a stupidity which is manifest on its face. Obviously, a mill which is custom built with the latest technology to produce unbleached paper will be able to produce a much better product than would be the case using an existing mill and just taking out the chlorine part of the process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance has been placed before the House this afternoon by the Opposition because it is one which concerns each and every member of our community. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme-or PBS as it is commonly known-is an enormously important part of Australia's health care system. Since its inception nearly 40 years ago it has been one of the most stable parts of that system. As everybody in this chamber knows-members of the House and the public alike-it involves the delivery of safe, reliable, modern, up-to-date drugs at affordable prices for all of us. The PBS has survived successive changes of government and successive changes in health policy. We raise this matter of public importance because that stability over the last 40 years is now fast becoming a thing of the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout the period of the Hawke Government, the PBS has been subjected to a steady series of unprecedented attacks which have shaken the scheme to its very foundation. The latest onslaught was launched in the 12 April economic statement with the announcement in the fine print that spending on the PBS would be cut by $31m in 1989-90, by $96m in 1990-91, and by $156m in 1991-92. From our point of view, this shortsighted decision on the part of the Government, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister at the table, the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) who is responsible for the PBS, have proved to be the last straw, especially so far as pharmacists are concerned. It is the pharmacists in the community who, over the past six years, have borne the brunt of the Government's constant meddling with the PBS, a situation which has grown steadily over the past 18 months or so. Because of pharmacists' interface with the public, Australian men and women have borne the brunt of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Incredibly, we have reached the point that pharmacists are so desperate that they are even planning a national strike-a withdrawal of their vital services to the Australian community. I hope that, in his 15-minute contribution to this debate, we will hear from the Minister whether he is aware that on Thursday next it is planned that pharmacies across Australia be closed for two hours. This step is being taken by pharmacists to bring to public attention concerns about the way this Government and its decisions are affecting the delivery of high quality health care which we have come to know and take for granted. I hope that the Minister will tell the House how he views such action and, importantly, how he is going to meet the concerns of pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take 30 seconds to think about it, who would ever have thought that Australian pharmacists would go on strike? We are not talking about some radical bunch of unionists who are trying to hijack the wage system to their own advantage; we are talking about the 5,500 pharmacies staffed by men and women across the country-in our own suburbs, in our corner shops, in our small shopping centres or in our major shopping centres. They are the people to whom we first turn when we have minor concerns about our own health. When there has been an accident at home we turn first to the local pharmacist to find out whether the injury is serious and how we should treat it. Pharmacists, especially, are the people to whom we first turn when our children suffer minor complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> The direct result of Government decisions, Government policy and Government action is leading to this incredible situation: this well respected body of professional people has come to the view that the only way in which it can respond to the Government is to go on strike. It has decided that it is the only way in which it can draw the community's attention to the way in which this Government is acting so far as the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is concerned. Pharmacists are tired of talking to a government which does not listen to them. They are tired of being used as a scapegoat for the increase in spending on pharmaceuticals which has occurred in recent years. Pharmacists have found themselves in the front line, squeezed by this Government between its cost-cutting measures and rising community expectations shared by all of us about the power of modern medicine and modern medications. </PARA>
<PARA> What many people fail to realise-and this is the thrust behind the pharmacists' campaign-is that the Hawke Government displays the most outrageous double standards in relation to the delivery of health care. On the one hand, it has promised to deliver a brave new world of health care, with Medicare as the panacea for all ills. On the other hand, this same Government has hacked away, and is continuing to hack away, at the PBS in such a manner as to deny patients the easiest possible access to today's range of increasingly complex pharmaceutical preparations. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing demonstrates this better than last year's debacle over the addition of 53 frequently prescribed drugs to the authority-only list of the PBS. Senior citizens in the public gallery and those listening to the broadcast of the debate this afternoon who have in the past had access to a range of drugs covered by this authority listing will know exactly what I am talking about. The Minister made this claim in his press release of 26 June last year:</PARA>
<PARA>We are simply prompting doctors to think twice before prescribing expensive drugs where there are possible cheaper alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a wealth of evidence that in many cases no such alternatives existed. The Government knew this. Did it take its decision on pharmaceutical, medical or therapeutic grounds? No; it took its decision on one ground alone: for everything over $30-bang it on the list; make it harder for doctors to prescribe it; make it harder for patients to avail themselves of that particular drug. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was forced to acknowledge that in many cases there was no alternative. It had to admit to its mistake. But did it reinstate all 53 drugs? It definitely did not. It reinstated only 34 of them-the cheapest of the 53. Did the Government reinstate those drugs on pharmaceutical grounds, therapeutic grounds or medical grounds? No. It took the cheapest and put them back on the list. Among those left off were seven so-called ACE inhibitors, including Renitec and Capoten, which are at the forefront of therapeutic treatment of high blood pressure. Drugs such as those are representative of the advances which have been achieved as a result of the latest research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that cardiovascular disease brings with it enormous economic and social costs. The Government should be looking at such costs and offsetting them against the benefits of making drugs such as the ACE inhibitors readily available. Instead, it continues to take the narrow view of looking at PBS expenditure in isolation, driven by the Treasurer, and ignoring the savings which can be achieved if a patient's condition can be managed by modern medication rather than extensive hospitalisation or expensive surgery. To compound its faults, the Government chooses to ignore the professional role which pharmacists play in seeing that patients are given appropriate counselling so that they derive maximum benefit from the medications which are prescribed for them by their general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> By virtue of their education and professional role, pharmacists are well placed to assume a principal role in the health care team directed towards the rational use of medicines. We, on this side of the House, regard pharmacists in that way. The Government, instead of recognising this and remunerating pharmacists in a way which will enable the greatest possible use to be made of their professional skills, chooses to treat dispensing as a piecework procedure, with payment being made according to the number of scrips dispensed. We, on this side of the House, clearly recognise the community role played by pharmacies and pharmacists in the delivery of health care. We also recognise that, by spending $1 at that level in the community, we save many dollars by keeping people well and keeping them out of hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> Worse, the Government keeps on chopping and changing the level of the dispensing fee given to pharmacists, something which saw such professional fees reduced by 10c per prescription in January of this year. Decisions such as those are factors which have seriously undermined the practising of community pharmacy in this country. That is why the poor beggars will go on strike on Thursday. In addition, pharmacists are being forced to cope with reductions in wholesale margins; the doubling of quantities of drugs dispensed on a single prescription; limitations on incentive payments for computerised dispensing claims; and delays in the processing of claims which can see a small business owed about $50,000 over two months, funding that overdraft at record high interest rates under the Hawke-Keating Government. All of these factors and others are undermining the viability of pharmacies and forcing closures of pharmacies, especially in rural areas, which depend so much on the services of a single pharmacy in a country town and to look after the wider community around that town. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of all of this, the Government is planning to achieve savings of $31m on the PBS in the next financial year and more over the next two years, as I have said, by imposing further reductions on pharmacists' remuneration. Quite simply, let there be no doubt in the minds of pharmacists around Australia where the Opposition stands on this issue. We think it is a disgraceful state of affairs. The Government, instead of targeting the pharmacists to pay for its own big spending cuts in other areas, should look at its own expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of health, which is directly related to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, what about the estimated $1.1m which the Government set aside to pay the wages of some 48 extra staff for the express purpose of processing `authority only' prescriptions; or the $2m earmarked for the purpose of educating doctors on prescribing practices? Doctors are the very people who are the most highly trained in our community to look after all of us as patients, yet the Government wastes our money directing them, under the heading of `education', as to how they should prescribe for us, their patients. What about the sums of money thrown around on publicising the 1 April switch to generic drugs? Each and every one of these expenses could have been avoided, and each and every one of them represents the kind of gross waste and ineptitude which has characterised this Government's administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It is little wonder that pharmacists are angry-they have every right to be. They fulfil a vital role in delivering high quality health care to the community, and the Opposition recognises that. That recognition stands in stark contrast to the Government and members opposite. Worse than that, there is no hope because the scheme is administered by a Minister who does not have a blinking clue. When asked about the availability of generic drugs he fumbled around and said that there was no problem. Pharmacists from all around Australia have sent me sheets from their suppliers that read `cannot supply', `out of stock' and `unavailable'. So people have not been able to obtain these drugs. Then, the height of absurdity and waste was when doctors were sent a large plastic object in the shape of a pill containing a one page letter that could have been sent by mail for 39 cents. It is a pill from a pill!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) has served Australia well. It has been administered by successive governments over about 40 years. In that time much has changed. Health advances and our ageing population have put tremendous pressure on health care delivery, particularly the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, in Australia. The people of Australia have been very well protected by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme; in fact, very rarely have they been exposed to the full cost of pharmaceuticals. This year there is a subsidy of over $1 billion on the cost of pharmaceuticals. The growth in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the past two years has been in the order of $300m. In 1983-84, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme cost the people of Australia about $500m. In 1988-89 the approximate cost to the people of Australia will be just over $1,000m. In three to four years it is estimated that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will cost the people of Australia, to protect them, approximately $2,000m-in other words, it will double the present level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past six years, under the administration of this Government, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme has made the best drugs in the world available to the people of Australia at a subsidised price. These drugs are at the forefront of technology and many of them cost thousands of dollars each. However, the people of Australia receive those drugs free if they are pensioners, for $2.50 if they are concessionary or for a maximum of $11 under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I think that that is something that is well worth thinking about. When we look at the cost of drugs and the escalation in the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the Government throughout that period has been able to continue to supply to the people of Australia, to the chronically ill and to people who need them at any particular time-whether they are rich or poor-the best drugs at a minimum price. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many changes. If there were not those changes, our pharmaceutical benefits scheme would be cluttered up with drugs of an inferior value and excessive administrative costs. There would be needless prescribing. The effect of that would also be, apart from other issues such as the generics issue, higher drug costs to the Australian taxpayer and the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> The priorities of this Government in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme remain, that is, to maintain effective pharmacy, to supply those best drugs and to protect the aged and chronically ill. It is enormously important on this very important, auspicious day, when both Opposition parties have cleaned out their leadership and changed their structure-I do not think it has happened before on the same day in the history of this country-to focus on the Future Directions document of the Liberal Party in particular. The Liberal Party has no health policy. The much vaunted, much publicised, document Future Directions, put out by the former Leader of the Opposition-I had a quick look through it today and perhaps the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) can correct me-does not contain one single reference to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The document talks about scrips, doctors and services in a couple of lines, but that is about it. I do not suppose one could expect much more. </PARA>
<PARA> What more could one expect from an Opposition which, in its period of opposition, has had seven health policies? There have been three alone from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who was sacked and relegated to the back bench, which is a common feature on the other side of the House. The same fate befell his successor, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), and then Senator Michael Baume-each had one disastrous policy under his belt and each was subsequently sacked. Then the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) wanted to charge pensioners-there is a message here. He was duly demoted for that and a few other issues. We are still waiting to hear the policy of the present shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney. What is he going to do? Is he going to do a cut and paste on all the policies that have gone before?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Tangney says, `Be patient'. I would hesitate to inform him that patience is perhaps not a virtue on his side of the chamber at the moment. There are a lot of things happening very quickly. The former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), put out an historic press release a couple of days ago which talked about a task force on the elderly. It says that the Opposition is going to look at the cost of living, savings, superannuation, housing, pensions, aged care, personal security, transport and special problems faced by the elderly in country areas. It is about time the Opposition had a look a these things because it does not have a policy on health or an aged care policy. It has something that it is very good at-it is a very consistent policy-and that is an aged scare policy. The Opposition goes around scaring old people that they will not get pharmaceuticals, nursing home places and other health care services. That is what the Opposition does. All it is good at is scaring people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By comparison, this Government has built up and fostered the pharmaceutical industry in a way that no other government in the history of this country has done. We now have a pharmaceutical industry that works, produces and exports. Largely, that has been as a result of the actions of this Government. We have the factor (f) under which two major companies so far-Merck Sharp &amp;Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd and Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd-will receive about $74m over the next five years. They are getting that price incentive to be involved in research and development, export and production. As a consequence, we have a generics policy, and this Government is not ashamed of its generics policy. We are not ashamed that when the best drugs in the world no longer have a patent they can be made in Australia. This Government, on behalf of the taxpayer and the consumer, procures those drugs at the best price that it can. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should the Australian taxpayer and consumer pay more for drugs just because they come in a different box? That is what the Opposition would have us believe. That is what it would do with the taxpayer's money. But it will not tell us what it will do to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme; it will not tell us what it will do in regard to aged care or health care. It is silent; it will not take on any role. It just scares people. It talks about pharmacies that are going to close and what pensioners will pay. Under this Government, pharmacies overall have not diminished, pensioners have not paid, and the people of Australia have been protected, and will continue to be protected, under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the assertion, from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the biggest spreader of misinformation of any national organisation in this country, that pharmacies are going to close. What a load of absolute rubbish! It is spreading misinformation on dispensing fees and the closure of pharmacies, and I will give honourable members a good local example of that. The Australian Capital Territory branch of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia said that two pharmacies in the ACT had closed down. It said that these closures were due to the Government's policies. I must admit that one in the Monaro Mall closed, because the whole of the Monaro Mall was being done up, so that pharmacy shifted to another area in Civic. What the Guild did not tell us was that it closed down in the Monaro Mall and then re-opened in another place. The same thing goes for pharmacies all around Australia. Whilst some have closed for a variety of reasons, many more have opened, and the figures speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me mention pharmacy remuneration. I have referred to the rise in the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to about $1,000m, a rise of over $300m in two years. Some of the pharmacists who are going on strike may not even know-such is the level of misinformation that the Pharmacy Guild of Australia perpetrates around this country-that there are two components of the pharmacists' remuneration-a 25 per cent mark-up and a dispensing fee. All we hear about is the dispensing fee. Pharmacists have received the best part of 40c out of every one of those $300m as a result of the pharmacy remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> To say that pharmacists have borne the brunt of the changes is not necessarily true. There have been a lot of changes, but those changes have been made for a very good reason. This Government protects patients, particularly the chronically ill and the aged, by the safety net, by having free pharmaceuticals for some, while those on social security benefits pay $2.50 and others pay $11. The best and most up-to-date drugs in this country are freely available. This Government is not ashamed of any assertion from the other side of the House that we are trying to contain costs. We admit that we are trying to contain costs so that people can receive drugs at the best price, at the price they can afford. We are not ashamed of that. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition going to do? It is going to charge pensioners. It will not tell us about its policy. Under its supposed health policy people will need to take out private health insurance to cover pharmaceuticals, and if people do not take out that cover, they will pay thousands of dollars for pharmaceuticals. That is what the Opposition is talking about. The cuts that are proposed are not based on current income, they are based on forward expenditure, and the Opposition knows it. The honourable member for Tangney knows this very well. He has been in the job long enough. Even if he has not put out a health policy, he knows very well what changes have gone on. He undermines his own credibility. If anyone in the Liberal Party needs credibility, he needs it today. The Liberal Party and the National Party are bereft of credibility. The honourable member's performance here gives him no credibility. He knows that some pharmaceuticals were not taken off the list; they were in fact put on an authority basis. All that the doctor had to do was to ring up and get an authority. They were not taken off the list on the ground of cost. Every drug that is now on authority has been put there on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable member for Tangney wants to criticise in this House the decision to put those drugs on authority, then he must criticise all the people on that Committee. They are not politicians or officers of the Department of Finance or the Treasury; they are appointed on the recommendation of the Australian Medical Association, the Pharmacy Guild and other such organisations. If the honourable member for Tangney wants to criticise them, let him get up here and do so on a case by case basis. Let him criticise their decision to put these drugs on authority because there were cheaper alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member spoke about ACE inhibitors, which are a tremendous advance in the care of hypertension. But taking them is not the only thing one can do for hypertension, as the honourable member for Tangney knows. He is a fit and athletic person and he keeps himself that way probably for one very good reason: to make sure that his heart keeps ticking at the prescribed rate. In other words, to keep his blood pressure in check he uses a non-drug alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many alternatives and methods available for the care of hypertension. For some people, a drug such as an ACE inhibitor is very important and it should be available to them. In fact, it is readily available to the thousands of people who use this very important and very expensive drug. The honourable member says that the Government chops and changes the dispensing fee. I would have thought that the honourable member for Tangney would have woken up by now to the fact that the Government does not set the dispensing fee; it is set by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, the PBRT, which takes account of all the changes that may take place from time to time in terms of labour costs, economies of scale, doubling of maximum quantities, wholesale margins, generic pricing and non-labour costs. All these matters are considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> If members of the Opposition want to come in here and make criticisms of this Government's handling of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, let them tell the people of Australia what they would do and still keep the costs of the PBS under control. They would charge pensioners. With other people in pharmacy around Australia, they would say that this is the way this Government must contain costs under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This Opposition has no credibility at the best of times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is about the Government's administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). In the past two years we have seen a number of about-turn decisions which have been shown to be not based on any factual information and which are evidence of total incompetence in this portfolio area. In the May statement of 1987, 53 drugs were placed on authority. That was a total reversal of the Government's policy of 1985. At that time, in a press release the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Chronically ill patients will be major beneficiaries of Federal Government moves to free up the availability of prescription drugs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Within two years the Government had clamped the restrictions on again and we certainly did not hear the Minister saying that chronically ill patients were now going to be adversely affected. </PARA>
<PARA> Those changes in 1985 were laudable because they meant a reduction in authority prescribing and an increase in the number of repeats allowed. It is sad that that did not last very long. What was the Minister's justification at that time? In his press release of June 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are simply prompting doctors to think twice-I mention that word `think' because thinking does not seem to have occurred on the Government side-</PARA>
<PARA>before prescribing expensive drugs where there are possible cheaper alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>The ridiculous thing is that a large number of the drugs on that list were anti-cancer medications. I have worked in a cancer hospital and seen what anti-cancer medication does. I have seen people's hair fall out and I have seen them vomit and suffer a week's diarrhoea after taking anti-cancer medication. Did the Minister ever seriously think that there would be any need not to prescribe them? Are we going to say, if someone has a cold, `Take this, have your hair fall out and see whether it fixes the cold'? For things such as bee sting venom there are no adequate alternatives. A serious bee sting allergy cannot be fixed by diet or making pensioners run up and down hills, as the Minister was suggesting for hypertension. There is no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>In selecting the specific drugs, the Government took full account of advice from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the shield he tried to hide behind today. The Medical Journal of Australia of August 1988 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This decision did not include any assessment of the efficacy or cost-effectiveness of the drugs, simply their monthly cost. No discussions with the medical or pharmaceutical professions took place before the decision about authority restrictions was made. Although Peter Staples' press release mentioned the advice that the government had received from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, he did not indicate the question that was asked. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is simply being misleading to hide behind advice from the PBAC when all he asked it was what were the most expensive drugs. If the Minister asks that sort of question he will get a response that will suit him. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Minister stated, `Last financial year these 53 drugs accounted for one per cent of PBS prescription costs, but this has risen alarmingly by 43 per cent'. Anyone with a three-figure IQ would be able to tell the Minister that that is because angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were introduced at the beginning of that period. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8E4">Dr WOOLDRIDGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he does not. What was the result of all this? Professor Priscilla Kincaid-Smith, one of Australia's leading physicians and President of the College at the time, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Authority listing for ACE inhibitors is a serious blow to all who believe in preventive medicine. </PARA>
<PARA>What was the Government's response? A member of the Government said, `Alarmist nonsense'. It is that sort of playing the man, or in this case the woman, that the Government has done right through this. In the end the Government had to replace 35 drugs on the authority listing. In 1987 the Government doubled the maximum quantities for some drugs. That is not a bad thing but if there had been a little bit of thinking-as the Minister was asking doctors to do-he would have realised that there were some pretty serious drawbacks. The first one related to eye drops. Eye drops have a specific shelf life. The Minister doubled the quantity of eye drops which meant that people got double that amount, took one home and one to work, opened them both-they both expired in a month-and another double quantity had to be dispensed. The only effect of that was to double the amount of eye drops being dispensed. Obviously that was changed. Again, it amounted to a lack of thinking. It is simply commonsense that any doctor or pharmacist could have told the Minister had he been prepared to consult. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that was introduced in 1987 was the safety net. The safety net in itself is not a bad thing but we have to look at the unintended consequences. It is pretty hard to know what the safety net costs, although I understand from the Budget Papers this year it is $143m, up 25 per cent from last year. It is a bit hard to know exactly what it cost the year before because we were told that the amount for the year before included `a couple of extra months from the previous year'. That is fine, but that was the most specific I could get. I understand that there was a 25 per cent increase in one year. There is no mention of looking at that to see whether it has been targeted properly. If the Minister had thought about it and had asked the people who were dispensing the medications he would have found out that in the pharmacies in Kooyong or Higgins people on $100,000 a year were coming in and hitting the safety net with their first overseas trip for the whole family. Is that targeting it well? Is that worth $150m a year?</PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacists and doctors will tell the Minister that people with chronic illnesses are getting extra scrips before the end of the year because they are free, particularly people with asthma who are getting their extra ventilin inhalers because they have a long shelf life, they store well at home and they cost nothing. It is simple maladministration which is costing a lot of money. What happened in 1988? We have seen the Minister's change to generics. The worst aspects of that are the inaccuracies the Minister has been putting out. I have two press statements here put out by the Minister. On 3 April the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>There should be no problems with the supply or quality of medications . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 April he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Any suggestion of inadequate supplies . . . are also wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>What was his attitude to the person who was saying this? As usual, the Minister played the man, saying, `If Mr Gelb is worried he should not be unnecessarily scaring elderly and chronically ill people'. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite simply, I can tell the Minister that, as of two hours ago, in my electorate there was trouble getting enough Deptran, which has replaced Sinequin. The pharmacists to whom I spoke at lunch time said, `I am paying $2 out of my own pocket for every scrip because either I had to give them Sinequin or turn them away'. It is a great pity that financial burdens are being placed on the pharmacists to cover up the Government's mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's economic statement saw a further change-the Government will save $31m this year and $156m by 1991-92. I am not concerned about that per se; I am concerned that the Government seems to have no idea about how it will do this. The Government's consultation with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia amounted to telephoning it on the day and telling it what it was going to do to pharmacists. Pharmacists had a 14 per cent reduction in income, in real terms, over the 12 months of last year and I am concerned that the Government is now saying that pharmacists will get the same amount of money, in dollar terms, for the next financial year even though they will be dispensing more scrips, because the aged population is increasing, and no account will be taken of inflation. This is threatening the very existence of community pharmacy. The sad fact is that the Government has made, and continues to make, ad hoc alterations to the scheme merely to suit the Department of Finance and with no concern about patient care. The Government has shown repeatedly that it is not prepared to sit down with all the groups that are involved in the scheme to try to work out some rational solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a matter of real concern is the Auditor-General's report which was tabled in this House on 12 April. The comments in the Auditor-General's report are a fairly damning indictment of the Department's administration. Four points were specifically mentioned in the report. First, it said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Department does not have enough detail to know whether overpayments are being made. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, it said that the Department is unable to confirm:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that people who receive free drugs are entitled to them. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, it said that the Department:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . does not record information about the people who receive the drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>Fourthly, it said that the Department:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is not able to verify automatically the entitlement of a patient to free or concessional medication. </PARA>
<PARA>What was the Government's response? It said that no overpayments were being made-although the Auditor-General has stated that, even if there were, the Department would not know. That is a damning indictment of the Government and of the Minister's incompetent administration of the Department. There have been poorly thought out changes, a lack of accountability and openings for significant fraud. In short, there has been maladministration, incompetence and a finance driven scheme that takes no account of the realities of pharmacy practice and no account of patient care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that members of the Opposition are taking the same approach on this area of policy as they have a tendency to take right across the policy spectrum. The first obvious and telling point to make here is that the Opposition is bereft of a policy. It is one thing to come into this chamber and articulate a critique of a policy position; it is a much harder thing altogether to come up with one's own policy and range of suggestions about how people who rely upon the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and related things will benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important point to make here is that this Government, for the first time in the post-war period, has a policy in relation to an indigenous drug industry in this country. Over the past few years, increasingly, international drug companies have held Australian consumers to ransom. The easiest thing to do is simply to sweep that under the table and to have the consumer pay increasingly higher prices. Of course, there are flow-on implications in relation to our current account deficit and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Politically, the hardest thing to do is to take on vested interest groups in this country. One of the single hardest things to do is to take on international corporations. Of course, these drug companies are some of the most powerful companies in the world. They are not just selling merchandise but they are selling drugs that are required by ordinary Australians, vulnerable Australians, who require those drugs to treat illnesses that they suffer. The first step that these companies tend to take, both in Australia and internationally, is a blackmailing approach to consumers. However, they do not blackmail only consumers. The history of this Parliament provides a good example of how those companies blackmailed the Opposition parties when they were in government. But the coalition had a tendency to cave in. I do not believe that this Government should do something that is certainly not in the interests of consumers or, indeed, in the interests of the industry in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is about is, with very great difficulty, developing an indigenous drug industry. What does that mean for ordinary Australians? It means that, over time, a broader range of drugs will be available. It means, by definition, that over time a cheaper range of drugs will be available. It also involves a little bit of national sovereignty. It means that we do not have to go to these international drug companies, that we do not have to jump when they crack the whip. It means that we do not have to pay what I consider to be outrageously high prices for a whole range of drugs. In my view, that is the first and most fundamental issue because in the end it is consumer related; it is about the sovereignty and the well-being of Australian consumers. This is the first Government to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, honourable members opposite come into the House and criticise us but provide no alternatives. Over the 30 years of the postwar period that the Opposition parties were in government, they did nothing other than watch the situation become worse. Honourable members opposite watched as Australians increasingly were held ransom to these international companies. When going about some policy change in such a highly politicised area, what ought the Government be doing? In my view, the Government ought to be bringing about what the opposition claims to be necessary. For example, the shadow Minister for finance, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has said in terms of an overall policy approach:</PARA>
<PARA>My own hard line preference would be to pay for tax cuts totally through spending cuts and keep the surplus intact. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member went on further, but I will not repeat his other comments. However, the essence of the honourable member's contribution is that he is prepared to indicate where the cuts would come from. This is a classic case of where the Opposition has to put up or shut up. It is a difficult area, of course, but let the Opposition outline a policy in this place. I have been through Future Directions, and there is nothing in that document of any relevance to this whole policy area. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), has made a name for himself in the last 24 hours by circulating a petition. I occasionally indulge in numbers gathering in the Australian Labor Party. I can assure the House that the last thing I would do is circulate a petition which, inevitably, in some distant time would become a hit list. I think in future the shadow Minister ought to get the names on the petition, file them away in the old bottom drawer and basically keep his mouth shut about them. But that is another issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important aspect of this debate concerns the extent to which the Government can bring about change whilst insulating consumers from cost increases and passing them on to those who can bear the changes. In this context, I think it is important to talk about a couple of issues. The first one is that the Government estimates-and I am quite happy to debate these estimates in detail-even assuming a margin of error of 10 per cent, show that the average pharmacy remuneration, that is, the average income received by the corner pharmacy, increased in the five-year period from 1982-83 to 1987-88 by 81 per cent. It is unlikely that anyone in the galleries would have received that order of increase in their remuneration over that same five-year period. In the same five-year period, of course, the other major indices, that is, the consumer price index (CPI) and average weekly earnings, increased. In the case of the CPI there was an increase of 43 per cent-as compared with the 81 per cent that pharmacies have received; and in the case of average weekly earnings, there was a 39 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone listening to this debate who is in employment would have received a 39 per cent increase over the past five years-but pharmacies have had an 81 per cent increase. Those figures ought to speak very loudly indeed. In my view, they speak much more eloquently about what the problem is than anything I can say here today. Pensioners and the elderly in our community who come into my office are scared. It is a deliberate Opposition tactic to scare them. It is a bit like the assets test. We all remember the introduction of the assets test and the Opposition saying that the Nazis would knock on doors at midnight. This is the sort of rubbish that people have to put up with from an Opposition that does not have a credible policy framework. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and there was the other line, `Put your money under the bed'. It is obscene in the extreme. It is laughable, except that it does have an impact on elderly people who are vulnerable and who find it difficult to work out what are often, by dint of necessity, very complex schemes. An elderly women came to my office-I can give her name privately to my colleagues on the other side of the House-in tears because she was worried about whether a particular drug would continue to be made available to her. She was told by her pharmacist-and she also took into account Opposition statements in relation to this policy area-that that was not going to be the case. She was, quite mistakenly, as it was proved, in fear of her life. If Opposition members say that that is not abusing the political process, that that is not acting in a way inconsistent with their responsibilities as members of an Opposition, they might as well fly to the moon. There is an absolute lack of integrity, a lack of responsibility and, more importantly, a lack of an alternative policy framework. That is why Opposition members have to get into the gutter outside the pharmacies. That is why they are forced to scare people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the issue that the woman was concerned about-the generic initiative that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) referred to earlier-the interest groups that support the initiative are the Doctors Reform Society, the Australian Pensioners Federation and the Australian Consumers Association. Not one but all of those groups, which are broadly representative and have consumers' interests at heart, have endorsed the Government's proposals. In conclusion, it ill-behoves an Opposition to come into this chamber-and elsewhere-without a policy, and to scare elderly and vulnerable people, particularly when one of its newly selected candidates, Professor Kemp, is on record as recently as yesterday as implying that 30 per cent of Australians ought not receive social welfare. It is a disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That amendments Nos 1 to 5, 8 and 9 and 15 to 28 be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 1 will insert a new subsection after section 41 of the principal Act which deals with fair dealing for the purpose of research or study. The Government sees this amendment as unnecessary because it believes that the special needs of external students can be taken into account before the Copyright Tribunal when determining the copying rate. However, it accepts that the amendment can be accommodated in the Act. That amendment was moved by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment was moved by the Opposition in the Senate. It will insert a new section 103c in the principal Act to provide for an exception to copyright infringement in the case of a fair dealing for research or study with audiovisual items, that is, sound recordings, cinematograph films, radio and television broadcasts. It will mirror section 40 of the principal Act on fair dealings for research or study with literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 were moved by the Opposition. These amendments extend the operation of clause 12 of the Bill, which provides a scheme for the copying of television broadcasts for educational institutions and institutions assisting the visually and intellectually handicapped, to radio broadcasts. The Government opposed the amendments in the belief that the extension of the licence merely to radio was not in great demand by educational institutions. Existing section 200 provides free right to educational institutions to copy radio programs made for educational use. However, the Government accepts that when the amendments are enacted educational institutions will, while continuing to have that free right to copy educational radio programs, require the right, subject to payment of remuneration, to copy any other radio programs made for general consumption which they wish to use for educational purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments that I am now asking the Committee to agree to are amendments 15 to 28. Amendments Nos 15, 16 and 17 will insert a new section 135r (1a), 135zzd (1a) and 135zzw (1a) into the Bill to provide for the Attorney-General to table in Parliament a copy of the reports required to be made to him of the operations of collecting societies under television-radio copying licence, new photocopying licence and blank tape royalty scheme. After the Opposition circulated amendment No. 17 in the Senate the Government agreed with the idea and moved amendment No. 15 and agreed to amendment No. 16. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments Nos 18 and 22 were moved by the Government. They clarify the operations of the definitions of `direct' and `indirect' in section 248a (1), especially where expressions are referred to in the definition of `exempt recording'. Amendment No. 19 was moved by the Opposition. Paragraph (f) of the definition of `exempt recording' in proposed section 248a (1) will effectively be expanded so as to cover recordings and film performances for reporting current affairs in addition to news reporting and criticism or review. The Government took the view that the amendment was unnecessary. It said that news surely would cover current affairs. The amendment is making this exception different from that relating to fair dealings exceptions to copyright for news. However, the Government accepts the amendment to secure passage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 20 was moved by the Government. It makes a clarifying amendment relating to paragraph (j) in the definition of `exempt recording' in proposed section 248a (1). Amendment No. 21 was moved by the Government. It makes it clear that copies of authorised recordings may be made other than for use in a soundtrack or broadcast without the further consent of the performers or performer. It will also enable copies of copies to be made from authorised recordings. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 23 moved by the Opposition relates to the proposed section 248 (2). That section will be revised to make clear that the participation in a performance of a member of an audience does not amount to a `performance'. The Government did not think that that was necessary but the Senate did. In other words, we thought that a member of the audience could hardly be a performer but the Senate took the view, perhaps, that one ought to see the performance in the Senate. </PARA>

Amendment No. 24 was moved to ensure that proposed part XIa, performers' protection, does not apply to performances given before the commencement of the part. For the first time we are giving protection to performers but we are not going to talk about performances before this Act comes into operation. Amendments Nos 25 and 28 were moved by the Opposition. I am advised that they are purely drafting amendments which the Government did not think necessary. The amendments delete the words `a' and insert `that or any other'. We thought that by inserting the words `that or any other', we would pick up `any', which used to be `a'. However, we are agreeing with this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amendments Nos 26 and 27 have been moved by the Government. Proposed new section 248ga will be inserted to provide limited exception to requirements under proposed section 248g (2) (c) to obtain performers' authority to use authorised sound recording in the soundtrack of a film. This will enable a broadcaster to make a copy of sound recording for use in soundtracks solely for the purpose of a broadcast. The soundtrack must be destroyed or delivered to the Australian Archives within 12 months. This provision effectively mirrors the equivalent copyright `ephemeral copying' exception in section 107 of the principal Act for broadcasting sound recordings. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to proposed new section 248p (3) provides a counterpart criminal offence to the unauthorised use provision in proposed section 248g (2) (c) and is consequential on the proposed new section 248ga.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition agrees with the thrust of what the Government has been putting, namely, that the Committee should accept amendments Nos 1 to 5, 8, 9 and 15 to 28. Under cover of that general position may I address a few remarks with respect to some, but not by any means all, of the amendments which it is proposed we now accept. First I would like to address some remarks to amendment No. 1, which relates to external students. In the form in which we have it set out before us this in fact was an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats which was passed when the Opposition parties withdrew their own amendment dealing with the same issue. The Opposition amendment, in our view, was a better amendment than the one which has now been passed. Nevertheless, the amendment we have before us deals with the same subject, namely, the interests of external students. Obviously this applies to students in country and regional districts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite a substantial reform for the benefit of those students. In our submission, external students under the Bill are denied the same copying rights as day students simply because they are external students. They do not have the same access to libraries as do students who are regularly on the spot each day at the educational institution. We have to disagree with the Attorney-General, (Mr Lionel Bowen), with respect, that the interests of external students are not really adequately covered by the Act as it presently stands. We do have some criticism of the Government because we really feel that the denial of the external students' rights so far as copying is concerned is-I do not think it is unfair to say-hidden by virtue of the fact that there was no reference to this change being made in the second reading speech or in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, as we say, provides for copying of printed works. But the external student who is not on the spot is not able to decide what he wants copied. Obviously a practical problem arises. The amendments now give some relief to external students. We are satisfied with that although our amendment would have made the position even clearer and would have been better. We maintain that, as a result of the Opposition's move, a very substantial benefit has been conferred on external students, to which they are entitled, which they previously had and which, but for the Opposition, would not now be in the law. That would have subjected external students to a great deal of inconvience and a great deal of cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 2 will mean that it is not a breach of copyright if there is a fair dealing, as it is described, with an audiovisual item and if the audiovisual item is used for research and study. Here the Opposition took up the suggestion-which, I must concede, came from the university vice-chancellors and from principals of colleges of advanced education-and we moved the amendment. It is an Opposition amendment which was moved in the Senate. I believe that the Opposition can rightfully claim some credit that the amendment will now become part of the law. It will allow research and study to be done with the use of audiovisual materials without fear of there being a breach of copyright. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 deserve some comment because they are related to other amendments which the Attorney-General will move shortly should not be agreed to. I might say in advance that we agree with him: those amendments should be taken out. There was a misunderstanding, which the Attorney-General explained. With respect to those amendments which it is now proposed should be accepted, the situation is that the Bill provides for the copying of television broadcasts by educational and other institutions. It sets up a system for charging for the copying, with the charges being paid to a collecting society and distributed to the owners of the copyright. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments we are concerned with here-amendments 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9-extend these provisions on the copying of television broadcasts to the copying of radio broadcasts. They also will be able to be copied and, of course, recorded. The amendments were suggested by the vice-chancellors and principals of colleges of advanced education and promoted by the Opposition and they gave rise to a great deal of debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Chairman, in case you are about to seek to follow this debate in the Senate Hansard, I deter you from doing so because it is somewhat confusing. After a lot of debate, with amendments being made to the amendments, they were agreed to by the Senate. In the course of doing that, it is really unfortunate that the Australian Democrats did not support the full extent of the Opposition's amendments, as those amendments would have extended this copying entitlement not only to radio broadcasts but also to other audiovisual material. It must be said that this would be a real contribution to helping the educational process. But the substance of it was that the Democrats would not agree to the full extent of our amendments. Therefore, it was finally agreed that the amendments should be confined to the copying of radio broadcasts, adding that, as the amendment does, to the copying of television broadcasts. Instead of the scheme applying to television alone, it now also applies to radio broadcasts. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will also require the Attorney-General to table in the Parliament the annual report of the collecting society. This will enable the Parliament to see how the system is working. To save time later, I might say not only that there is now a requirement for the Attorney-General to table the collecting society's annual report on this scheme-that is, with respect to the recording that takes place in educational institutions-but also that we were successful in obtaining amendments to require the Attorney-General to table the reports he receives annually from the collecting societies under two other schemes set up under the Bill-the first being for the copying of works by educational institutions and for handicapped persons, and the second being the blank tapes scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will recall, each of these schemes requires the payment of royalties. They are collected by collecting societies. As the Bill stood, the collecting societies which were supposed to distribute the takings to the copyright owners had to put in a report to the Attorney-General explaining to him how the scheme was operating but did not have to advise the Parliament. We believed very strongly in each of those cases I have mentioned that the reports to the Attorney-General should be tabled in the Parliament. We have been successful in each of those cases in having that requirement written into the Bill. There really are enough exclusive clubs in Australia without establishing any more. It is very appropriate that the bright light of day should be shone through the Parliament on the collecting societies and their operations. To put it in its proper terms, these amendments will enable the Parliament to conduct an efficient scrutiny of how the collecting societies are operating. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 19 comes in the part of the Bill that deals with performers' protection. The Bill gives performers a right to sue for an unauthorised use of recordings of their performances. Dancers, singers, puppeteers and so on may obtain an injunction and damages if there is an illegal and unauthorised use of a recording of their performance. That is a great reform on which we compliment the Government. The amendment makes an exception in the case of radio or television recordings of news and current affairs programs or programs made for criticism or review. For instance, we would be familiar with programs such as the Sunday program where, when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is interviewed, there is what can only be described as a performance. We think that sort of performance--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. Amendment No. 23 also deals with performers' protection and with the case where it might be said that someone participating in a performance in the role of a member of the audience might have this right and that his performance by being in the audience might be protected. The purpose of the amendment is to remove any such suggestion. I must confess that it was not in my mind and I do not think it was in the Attorney-General's mind that it could be said that someone in an audience was performing, unless he was waving his arms, dancing and singing. It would obviously be impractical to get the consent of everyone in the audience. In some cases it could be said that if what was involved was a recording of a performance by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the permission of every member of the audience might have to be obtained before the performance could be repeated. I do not think that that was the real intention of the draftsman. However, to make abundantly clear that that is the case in all practical senses, the result of this amendment is that members of the audience are not performing; they are sitting there and doing what they should be doing, which is paying attention to the performance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amendment No. 24 removes any retro- spectivity which we believe was there from the operation of the performers' protection provisions. It is important that television stations, radio stations and others know where they stand. There was some doubt as to whether they would know where they stood if they wanted to show a program of a performance that had taken place some time previously. Again, to use the case of the orchestra, it was said that one might have first to locate all of the members of the orchestra and get their consent. That would be a difficult and impractical task. Therefore, we are drawing the line with this amendment and saying, `Very well, what happened in the past is governed by whatever arrangements, if any, you may have made, and what happens in the future is governed by the Act'. That is common sense and sensible. Therefore, there is a case for removing any retro- spectivity from these important provisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That amendments Nos 6 and 7 and 10 to 14 be disagreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>I will deal first with amendments 6, 13 and 14 together. These amendments would replace provisions providing for the declaration of one collecting society for collecting television copying royalties with provisions for the declaration of more than one society. I understand that the Opposition moved these amendments as part of a package following suggestions from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. However, the provision for a single collecting society is seen as of at least as much benefit to educational institutions using the television copying licence, which has now been extended to radio by amendments 3 to 5 and 8 and 9 just dealt with, as it is to copyright owners. It is so much more convenient administratively for these people to have to deal with one society than to have to deal with a number of societies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noted that the Australian Democrats made it clear that they did not support multiple collecting societies and, therefore, the retention of the amendments in the Senate would not attract majority support. Finally, to meet the concern of the Opposition, which promoted it to move the amendments-namely, to keep the administration of copyright owners revenue efficient-Senator Tate, on behalf of the Government, accepted amendments Nos 15 to 17, with which we have already dealt and which provide for the Attorney-General to table in Parliament reports to him by the collecting societies under the various new licensing schemes, including the collecting society for the television-radio copying licence. We understand that the Opposition in the Senate, through Senator Puplick, accepted this proposal. I invite honourable members to look at his comments of 4 May in Hansard at pages 1771 and 1772. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of the amendments being disagreed to are amendments Nos 7 and 10 to 12 inclusive. My notes advise me that the retention of these amendments would create a nonsensical inconsistency in respect of the other provisions in new part Va establishing the television-radio copying licence. So it appears very clear that the Senate does not always get it right when it moves amendments. Whereas amendments Nos 3 and 4 remove reference to `television', wherever the expression `television broadcast' appears in part Va-other than in the new definition of `broadcast'-amendment No. 7 inserts a new definition of `television broadcast'. Also, that definition includes an `audiovisual' item which is not defined in part Va. Amendment No. 10 is consequential upon amendment No. 7, as is amendment No. 11. Amendment No. 12 duplicates what is already provided for in amendment No. 4 and is therefore otiose. </PARA>

I feel that it is hard enough on people in the industry, the public and the courts to understand an Act of Parliament these days when we put into it what we intend to put into it; but in addition to that, when it contains what no one intends, nobody is given a fighting chance. The effect of having some of these provisions will be to put more gobbledegook into the Bill than is already there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am on that subject, I might say-and this is no criticism of anyone in particular because, I suppose, I would be as bad as anyone else, if not worse-that the Copyright Act, like a number of other Acts, really is becoming far too long and complicated. There is quite a list of Acts of this sort-the Broadcasting Act is an example-of which most people who have to deal with them really cannot make head nor tail. These Acts are becoming too long and too complicated. For the life of me, I cannot understand why a sustained effort cannot be made to shorten some of them and make them much clearer. Here we are, after all, with a very significant amendment to the Copyright Act which is held out as something of a watershed. Amongst other things, we now have proposed new section 135zzw. The whole thing really is becoming quite difficult to understand. So, although we compliment the Government on what it has done with these amendments-and they really are very substantial and significant additions to the Act and quite justified in our view-we are once again laying on another layer of complexity whereas with some effort, although I realise it is easier to say these things than to do them, the Act could be made simpler and more comprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have not used up very much time, I will take a minute to say-and I must concede that this does not relate directly to the amendments-that an outstanding problem still arises from the whole series of amendments that were moved, and I refer to clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill. I know that there is a debate and that there are arguments on both sides. The problem I raise relates to industrial designs. Clauses 9 and 10 were designed to give a protection, which we support. But we are very concerned that a number of industrial designs would slip between the Copyright Act and the Designs Act and would not be protected. I think it would be very unfortunate if this resulted in Australian industrial designs not being protected by the law and they were able to be stolen, particularly by overseas pirates. That would be very bad for Australian industry and very bad for those creative people who put their intellectual efforts into these designs. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a battery of correspondence backwards and forwards between the Attorney-General and me, Phillips Fox, a firm of Sydney solicitors, and other parties on this issue. The whole matter has become very long and complicated with the result that some people may have had intellectual victories but the problem is still there. In the Senate, Senator Tate gave an undertaking that this would be looked at. We accept that in good faith because I am sure that it was made in good faith. The reality is that there is a danger. We simply make the point that we really hope that the Government will make every prompt effort to have this matter resolved. Even if there were doubt, we believe that the problem could have been resolved by simply removing that doubt and making some amendment to ensure that Australian industrial designs which were the work of Australian creative people who were important to our industry were not left unprotected by either the Copyright Act or the Designs Act. Further, it is very important that designs not be put at risk of being stolen by pirates, either within this country or overseas. We urge the Attorney-General to pursue this matter. </PARA>

<PARA>Senate amendments Nos. 6, 13 and 14</PARA>
<PARA> These amendments would replace the provisions providing for the declaration of one collecting society for collecting TV copying royalties with provisions for the declaration of more than one society. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are rejected as the provision for a single collective society is at least as much benefit to educational institutions using the TV copying licence (extended to radio copying by Senate amendments Nos. 3 to 5, 8 and 9) as it is for copyright owners. It is clearly administratively more convenient for them to have to deal with one society than to do so with 2 or more. </PARA>
<PARA>Senate amendments Nos. 7, 10, 11 and 12</PARA>
<PARA> Retention of amendments Nos. 7, 10, 11 and 12 would create serious inconsistencies with the other provisions in new Part VA of the Bill establishing the TV-radio copying licence:</PARA>
<PARA>Whereas amendments Nos. 3 to 4 and 9 remove references to ``television'' wherever the expression ``television broadcast'' appears in Part VA (other than in the new definition of ``broadcast''), amendment No. 7 inserts  a new definition of ``television broadcast''. Also, that definition includes an ``audio-visual item'' which is not defined in Part VA. Amendment No. 10 is consequential upon amendment No. 7, as is amendment No. 11. </PARA>

<PARA> That the amendment be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 5 April 1989 and debated in the Senate on 5 and 8 May 1989. The Bill has now been returned by the Senate to the House of Representatives with one small amendment. I am sure honourable members will recall that the Bill contains a number of largely technical amendments to six Acts within the Transport and Communications portfolio. The amendment moved by the Senate relates to the Broadcasting Act 1942. Clause 12 of the Bill contains an amendment to allow limited broadcasting services to be delivered by transmitters, which may include a satellite transmitter. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate debate, Senator Lewis raised the point that the provisions in paragraph 12 (a) of the Bill are unnecessary because of existing provisions. I am advised that there was in fact an oversight in the preparation of these provisions. Proposed paragraph 12 (a) will duplicate the effective provision already added by schedule 3 of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 1988, which is Act No. 146 of 1988. The Government did not see it as satisfactory to leave the redundant provision standing and, therefore, agreed in the Senate to the amendment proposed by Senator Lewis. That amendment simply deletes paragraph 12 (a) of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the amendment put forward today by the Government. As the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) pointed out, the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Lewis, in another place, has highlighted a deficiency-indeed, a drafting error-that has been the principal cause of this amendment being brought back to this House. Of course, it is typical of the nature of honourable members on this side of the House that we are constantly on the ball looking for errors being made by the Government. We are kept very busy in that department, and in this particular instance Senator Lewis is to be congratulated on picking up what is quite obviously a drafting error.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment purports to correct an oversight in the scheme for limited licences which was introduced by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 1988. It is claimed that the provisions will enable the grant of limited broadcasting licences which involve transmissions from transponders on an Aussat satellite. Limited licences allow streamlined licensing of a range of broadcasting services which, because of restrictions on duration, purpose, content or other aspects, do not raise the same public interest concerns as conventional broadcasting licences. For example, teletext services will be authorised under limited licences. I also note that a whole range of groups can apply for these limited licences. For example, if the boy scouts were having a jamboree and wanted to set up a radio service at their camp site during the course of the jamboree, this could be done. It gives some flexibility for the Department of Transport and Communications to licence people who have limited needs for a broadcasting service. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note that the provisions in the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill will allow existing remote commercial television service licensees to seek limited licences to broadcast teletext services to remote area homesteads which have satellite receivers and also will allow licensing, if and when appropriate, of other limited broadcasting services by satellite to remote homesteads. As a member of the National Party and as one who represents a rural area, I am particularly pleased to note that these additional services will be provided to those people who live in remote areas of the country and who, due to their remoteness, do not have normal access to various means of communication, entertainment, the provision of information services and so forth. So there is some welcome news in this regard. As I mentioned earlier, the Opposition does not oppose the amendment. Indeed, it supports the correctness of the drafting error which was highlighted by Senator Lewis, the shadow Minister in another place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and to oppose the second reading amendment moved by the Opposition. We are dealing here with social security and veterans' affairs legislation. By its very nature, legislation passed through this House in these areas deals with income support for many Australian families. At Question Time today, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) outlined the number of families which receive income support by way of several measures which have been in place for several years. In his answer he pointed out that the newly endorsed candidate for Goldstein, Professor Kemp, in his first press conference, had said that some 30 per cent of families were in receipt of these sorts of measures. Of course, he had the figure totally wrong. The figure is now 16 per cent, having come down from 19 per cent since this Government came to power. We can expect to hear many more of these outrageous statements from New Right members of the Liberal Party, particularly after this morning's change of leadership for both conservative parties. It has been a very interesting day in politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Returning to the legislation before the House, I would like to deal with the social security measures, and make some comments in relation to age pensioners. They will receive a boost in their after-tax income as a result of the Government's associated decision to make pensioners' income test-free area 100 per cent tax free. We have had consultations on retirement income, and this has clearly revealed that confusion has been created by the separate free areas for pensions and taxation purposes. The Government has therefore decided to align totally the two free areas; in 1989-90 for married couples and in 1990-91 for single pensioners. Many pensioners listening to this debate today would be aware that the pensioner free area is $40 per week for a single pensioner and $70 per week combined for a married couple. However, in 1988-89 the tax free area, by contrast, is about only $10 per week for a single pensioner, and in 1987-88 it was less than $4 per week. So the difficulty became very obvious for those who had some investments or those who were capable of doing a few hours work a week. If they earned their $40 which would not affect their pension, or their $70 combined as a married couple, that would bring them into a taxation area where they would be obliged to pay some tax on that money. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, this decision will benefit over one million age pensioners. It will free more than three-quarters of all age pensioners, whose private non-pension income is less than the free area, from having to worry about tax, and it will free another 75,000 age pensioners from liability for provisional tax, a major change in anyone's language. The Government's decision actually goes beyond the recommendations of the Social Security Review, which recommended that only half the pension-free area be taxed. Some ill-informed commentators, and no doubt some from the benches opposite, have claimed that most age pensioners are too old or unwell to work to earn extra non-pension income, and therefore will not benefit from the decision. We have heard this from several areas over the last couple of weeks, but this is absolutely incorrect. Let me put the areas and the figures on the record so that no-one will be in any doubt as to how important this measure is to pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The free area does not cover just earned income from paid employment. That is one of the misconceptions that have been put around in the community, that people have to go out to work to get any benefit from this, and why should pensioners have to earn that $40 or $70? It covers all relevant income received by age pensioners, that is, any interest they have from investments, superannuation pensions as well as earnings from paid employment, and that is vitally important to so many people. The figures are, that out of 1.3 million age pensioners, 1.15 million report some such income. I will repeat those figures because I do not think they are common knowledge around the community, and those people listening to this broadcast will be surprised to hear them: out of 1.3 million age pensioners, 1.15 million report some such income; that is, income from investments, superannuation pensions or earnings from paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we have freed the vast majority of age pensioners from tax on any non-pension income that they receive. For them we have made the recent debate about the tax treatment of interest from investments absolutely irrelevant. It is irrelevant to them because we have delivered a more far-reaching reform. We have taken them out of the tax system and made their interest income tax free if their non-pension income in 1990-91 is below the pension free area. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider the example of a single age pensioner whose only private non-pension income comes from interest from investments. In 1989-90 that pensioner will be able to receive up to $25 per week, still get the full pension and pay no tax. In 1990-91 this amount will increase to $40 per week. That means that with a savings investment account paying 12 per cent per annum, such a pensioner could invest up to $10,800 next financial year and $17,300 in 1990-91 without losing any pension or paying any tax. Aged pensioners with several thousand dollars in cheque accounts, or in passbook accounts earning 3.75 per cent interest, now have a real incentive to maximise their investment income. No longer will it be necessary for those accounts to sit there at 3.75 per cent and allow banks to make enormous profits on them. They will be able to maximise their returns from those investments without affecting their pension or without having to pay tax on it in those areas, providing that they have those amounts invested. </PARA>
<PARA> The gains from the Government's April statement measures are not restricted to those age pensioners with private non-pension incomes below the free area. The combined operation of the pensioner tax rebate and the reduction in tax rates means that those pensioners still paying tax will also receive a significant boost in after tax income. For example, a single age pensioner with a private non-pension income of $100 per week will pay $6.75 per week less tax in 1989-90, and $11.75 a week less tax in 1990-91, compared to the current situation. A single age pensioner with a private income of $150 per week will be $7.50 per week better off in 1989-90 and $12.50 per week better off in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare these sorts of policies in action with the platitudes of the Opposition. We have heard a lot about Future Directions from the Liberals. I have a copy here with me. No doubt we will not hear too much about it from some of the speakers on the other side, because at the moment they are probably a bit wary about whether their Future Directions went the same way as their former leader this morning. On page 72 of Future Directions age pensioners are warned that:</PARA>
<PARA>The precise details of our-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Opposition's-</PARA>
<PARA>social security and taxation policies must await our assessment of the overall resources available nearer the time of the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no way that the Australian people will allow that to be a policy of the Opposition. Up to this point in time it has been dodging the issue. It is trying to say that its detail on the virtually important issue, which is the total income support for so many families in Australia, must wait until it assesses the overall resources available. It talks about cutting. What of the Opposition's retirement income policy? It promises nothing concrete on this crucial issue, merely indicating that all aspects of personal taxation which impact upon the retirees, including the tax threshold, will receive sympathetic consideration in the coalition's tax policy. Once again they are just words-no action whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> We look forward to the statement in this area from the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) to see whether he intends to do any better. Looking back on what he said last year, when he promised that he would have a policy by August, the only numbers that were stated in the House today are the numbers in the takeover of the leadership, no numbers whatever in policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with social security concerning families and some of the things in the April statement that this Government has done in the policy area, the policies we will be putting forward. We are saying to the community, `These are our policies, this is what we have put in place. What you need to do is assess what our opponents would do if they were unfortunately elected to the Treasury bench'. Would the Opposition continue with the policies that we have put into place, or would it seek to cut? I am afraid that the movements within the Liberal Party at this stage are such that not only will members of the Liberal Party be totally disappointed with what has happened, but the public at large in Australia will reject them out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Our April statement provides a new and fair deal for all families. Tax scales have been adjusted to make them more progressive, delivering proportionally the biggest tax cuts to lower and middle income earners. Tax rebates for the family, the dependent spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate have been increased. Family payments-that is, the family allowance and family allowance supplements-have been increased. These are vital to those persons in our community who are living on the support of benefits or social security income, such as we are debating here today. All elements of the package that directly affect families-the rebates and the family payments-are to be adjusted automatically for implementation each year. We need only to turn to the Australian Institute of Family Studies, to see what it had to say when that package was delivered. These are some of the comments made:</PARA>
<PARA>The package appears to redress the erosion of family incomes since 1976 through tax bracket creep and the failures to index family benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Social Security can take great credit for the work he has put into this. The comments continue:</PARA>
<PARA> The indexation of family benefits is an historically significant feature which will ensure that these payments will not be eroded in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On the institute's analysis of the Government's package 70 per cent of families will gain more than $1,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>48 per cent of the cost of the package goes to the 30 per cent of households which include dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA>We are aiming and implementing our policies for Australian families. This new and fair deal for Australian families is implemented as part of the agreement between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions-the group that represents more people in Australia than does any other organisation. It is a radical contrast to the only other increases in family allowance in history, which occurred in November 1982 under the previous conservative Government. At that time, unit labour costs had skyrocketed, unemployment had exploded and the family allowance increases were granted as part of the great deficit blow-out of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases in 1989 are part of a package which will ensure that employment growth is not damaged through uncontrolled growth in unit labour costs. These increases have been fully funded by the Government by good management of the economy and by cutting government expenditure sensibly and creating a Budget surplus in excess of $5 billion. Tax cuts and family allowance increases will increase the weekly net income of a single income family of two adults and two children, and on average weekly earnings, by $24. This is equivalent to a wage increase of $41 a week or over 7 per cent for such a family on average weekly earnings. The same family on $340 a week-about two-thirds of average weekly earnings-will receive the equivalent of an 11 per cent wage increase. In percentage terms, the largest increases go to families with children and, of those, the biggest increases go to families with one earner on the lower paid award rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to the Opposition's approach in these vital family policy areas. The Opposition has not said one word on what it would do for Australian families. Its approach can be evaluated or looked at from several aspects: Future Directions, which I have on my desk, and statements by the former Leader of the Opposition, the former shadow Treasurer and the shadow Minister for finance, who is from today the Opposition's Treasury spokesperson. The approach of those honourable members has three elements which are very confusing. First, they promise to cut spending; secondly, they promise to expand spending; and, thirdly, they display a clear lack of understanding of detail of programs. People who follow social policy know that the approach of Labor has been based on rigorous analysis and hard work-and no-one has done more the the Minister for Social Security. This contrasts dramatically with the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote the Opposition's new Treasury spokesperson-and, boy, will we be asking him some questions in his present portfolio. As reported in the Advertiser of 22 January 1988, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I just used to get offended, quite frankly, sitting in the (Fraser) Cabinet room and seeing that, despite all the technical and other analysis that was done and put on the table, quite often a decision was taken on the basis of something a farmer said he had heard in a pub the night before, or that one of his mates had told him. It was government by anecdote rather than analysis. </PARA>
<PARA>The new shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who today has taken over the Treasury area, indicated on the program Face to Face on 12 March 1988 that little has changed on the conservative side of politics. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We'll spell out the cuts, but just to put it in its correct context, we are not so focused on the old idea, if you like, the simplistic notion of just cut, cut, cut and basically what I've got in mind is improved financial administration and that involves cuts of a different sort, and if I could just explain a couple of those. One is clearly the issue of targeting the expenditure, of making sure it goes where you want it to go . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Where the Liberals want it to go or where it is needed? What does he mean by that? He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>and it brings you the results that you want. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again we will be asking the shadow Treasurer where he wants it to go and where the Liberal Party wants it to go. Is it where Professor Kemp or Professor Hewson says? They are professors, mind you! The shadow Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>And there's very little evidence today that the Government monitors that need.</PARA>
<PARA>He says that the Government has not been monitoring that need. We have had report after report. We have evaluated them and put the policies into operation. We have monitored where that money is going and have tightened up expenditure in those areas. He went on to say further:</PARA>
<PARA>I can give you some examples. We spend say about 25 or 26 billion dollars on social security and welfare. Now why do we spend that? The answer is well there are some disadvantaged and needy people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Well how many are there? And you know, with 16 million people, is it one million? Now they're getting about 26 thousand dollars a head if its one million. Is it one in eight? I'm sorry, two million out of 16? I mean they're getting 13 thousand dollars a head. My point is, it's not effectively targeted and that's one issue. </PARA>
<PARA>This is what we can look forward to in this Parliament. This is the new shadow Treasurer. This is the man who now is going to debate social security, perhaps veterans' legislation or Treasury material. And he will talk about these sorts of issues in this light. If honourable members opposite come back into government we will be able to see the new member for Goldstein and the new member for Higgins espousing how they will cut welfare. They will cut welfare. Do not let any people in Australia listening to this debate tonight believe anything different. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a move in the Liberal Party today to go back to the conservatism of the past-to make the poor pay. Honourable members opposite want to take control of the treasury bench. The hard work has been done by a Labor Government and the Opposition wants to repeat history. Let me give a message to all members of the Liberal Party: in no way will members of the Labor Party on this side of the House give the Opposition members the opportunity to turn our good work around so that they can featherbed again those people whom they featherbedded in the late 1970s and early 1980s-the tax dodgers and avoiders. We will fight and fight to keep our position on the treasury bench so that we can keep delivering these sorts of policies. I strongly support the legislation brought forward by the Minister and I reject the Opposition amendment. </PARA>

In so doing I will refer to last night's Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Families in receipt of the family allowance supplement have been for too long the victims of a system which did not allow for regular indexation in line with increases in the consumer price index (CPI). This meant that the results of inflation have put them, in many cases, below the Henderson poverty line and unable to keep pace with the rise in the cost of living and to maintain an adequate lifestyle for them and their families. It is pleasing to note that in the area of maintenance payments recipients will no longer be subject to loss of income because of arrears in the payment of maintenance. This has been a vexing problem for some of my constituents who have had difficulties in meeting their regular routine costs because of the effects of the maintenance income test introduced in June last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the introduction of the new start program is to be commended because of its encouragement to long term beneficiaries of unemployment benefits and their spouses. The psychological aspect of this move alone will give some encouragement to those who, often through no fault of their own-many of them have been victims of retrenchment because of the collapse of some private industries-have been unable to find suitable employment to maintain an equitable and sustainable lifestyle. Our increasing number of senior citizens who have small amounts of money invested to protect them and help with on-going repairs and maintenance to their homes must surely be relieved to know that the income tax free area will be 100 per cent tax free. </PARA>
<PARA> The pension indexation increases will also help ease the stress that our pensioners have borne wondering how much longer they can survive on limited fixed incomes. I am sure that the commendable table that the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) incorporated in Hansard last night will give some security and indication to the pensioners, senior citizens and retirees of just where they are going, what they can get and how they can get it. Much has been said about the back bench committee of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-the Price Watch Committee-and all the lobbying that went on. I support the people who have lobbied, including Grey Power, the South Australian Council on the Ageing Inc., the South Australian Council of Social Service and the Senior Citizens of Australia. It is all right for big business and other corporate raiders to get into bed with governments, so why should not the heritage of Australia? The poor and disadvantaged have suffered and struggled on $124 a week, which is now tied to the CPI. That pensioner lobby group was looking for an increase to a level equivalent to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems many of our pensioners have faced with provisional tax assessments should also now be alleviated. I have often seen pensioners come into my office-and I have made representations on their behalf to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe)-clutching their most recent income tax assessment and wondering just how they are going to pay the provisional tax assessed against their income for that particular financial year. This has happened to them because they have saved a small amount and invested it to protect them against unforeseen expenses in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I support and applaud the Future Directions policy. It will not change; it has been endorsed and embraced by the Liberal coalition. I guess that the media monitoring section of the Labor Party will be trotting out press releases and calling up old statements to see whether it can harangue and harass the incumbent Liberal coalition Opposition. When reading last night's Hansard I noticed that the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey) referred to the assets test. My attitude to that is that we will certainly liberalise the assets test and review the anomalies that the Labor Party introduced. It is at a time like this that the honourable member for Dobell comes in and throws his skirt over his head. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of the famous interjection that the honourable member for Hawker made. She said. `Why should they get special concessions?'. When referring to the market linked investments, the Minister at the table complained in a speech about the protestations of and the complaining by people around Australia who condemned the Government for daring to challenge people with a modest $17,000 investment who put their money into friendly societies and Australian fixed trusts in order to provide for their future. If anything is ever going to come back and bite honourable members opposite, the statement `why should pensioners get special concessions?' will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That interjection is better for Hansard. That will suit me all the more. Cutbacks to benefits paid to veterans is an important issue which concerns people in Adelaide particularly. I say in passing-this was mentioned in the House today-that it is now a matter of public record as a result of Senate estimates committee hearings that the Government paid one consultant over $170,000 whilst veterans were being penny-pinched. This was in relation to the Westpac involvement in the defence service home loan. The Government has cut back in several key areas. The travel allowances have been reduced by half. The subsistence allowance for veterans, including meals and accommodation, has been reduced substantially, resulting in less government expenditure from 1 January 1988. A $5,000 plus statutory patient contribution was imposed on veterans in nursing homes for war-related conditions. There has been a series of cutbacks in the list of drugs available under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, along with an increase in the number of drugs which require prior authority. This has added greatly to the administrative burden. I am pleased that the 2 per cent cut that the Government imposed on the defence force retirement and death benefits scheme has been rectified. For two years the Government breached that contract. It is refreshing to see a positive attitude in respect of giving the heritage of Australia some consideration. A lot of work has gone into this. Pensioners and the senior citizens of Australia can look forward to some security in their retirement years. They know that the Government, the Opposition and the concerned lobby groups around Australia are supporting them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the Opposition say it all the time in many and varied ways. How can we lower this burden? The Opposition begins with the question `How can we lower this burden?' and all of its policies flow from that. I will give an illustration of this view. We on this side start with the proposition of asking why people need the support of the state and how much they need in order to give them dignity and security. We ask people what is an adequate income. For the first time ever in this country's history a government has been able to establish benchmarks which beyond doubt establish minimum standards of income. I am proud to be a member of a government that has established minimum standards of income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we came to Budget discussions, the social security budget will not be left to the end. Any decision to lift the rate of pensions will not be left until the end of discussions when someone says, `How much money is left over?'. The poor old Minister for Social Security will not have to go into the Cabinet room saying, `How much can you give me this time?'. That is old hat. We do not have to do that any more. We set the standards. It is only an Opposition that will degrade those standards. It will do it at its own peril because people now understand that we have almost solved problems entirely in the social security area with respect to minimum incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the proposition about how we have set a standard for minimum incomes in this country and how we have achieved them. The package that was brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) some weeks ago in his economic statement has indicated that the standards for children of lower income working families or families who are on pensions should be equivalent to a percentage of the married rate of pension. That pension has been indexed by this Government. The first thing to recognise is that the standard is safe. We will continue to index that standard and it will never be lowered by this Government. That standard exceeds the Henderson poverty line. Henderson is an academic from Melbourne who, in the early 1970s, brought prominence to the notion by saying that we could measure those who were in poverty and that perhaps there was a minimum standard which all families should achieve. In December 1988 the married rate of pension was about $40 above the poverty line. It is protected from a loss in real value by an automatic twice yearly indexation of the pension. Everyone is familiar with the notion of the age pension and its adequacy. We have held that pension up as the standard for adequacy and it is accepted by the community. We can now base our child payments on that adequate and well accepted standard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has to answer this question: Does it support these new standards? Surely, it does not contend that they are inadequate. However, it is still left with this enduring question: How can we lower the burden on the public purse caused by these people? I can tell the Opposition that from now on its problem will be magnified ten-fold, and that is because the Government has locked in adequate standards. If honourable members opposite ever get the chance to unlock them they will unleash an enormous backlash in the electorate and they will be seen to be doing the wrong thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider some of the attempts that members of the Opposition made when they were in government. Their record in government was to increase payments for low income families once, and once only. That was in 1980, which was an election year. At that time the $7.50 a week payment was increased to $10 a week. The whole notion was that they had better buy some votes on this issue, that they wanted to look good and to soften the Fraser image. So, in 1980, in an election year, members opposite bought themselves some votes. Prior to that, in 1976, which was not an election year, members opposite took a different stance. At that time the Opposition cashed out tax rebates for children into the family allowance. In doing so, total assistance for a first child was reduced from $4.50 a week to $3.50 a week. These critical payments for poor people were allowed simply to be pawns in the Budget and the election process. Honourable members opposite would continue to do that if they were ever returned to the government benches. In 1982, again preceding an election-which was held in early 1983-members opposite increased the family allowance for the first child to $5.25. That meant a net nominal increase in seven years of just 75c. Well, thanks a lot! That is all that members opposite achieved in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to refer to another matter which demonstrates the inability of some members opposite to even conceptualise the problem correctly. In first addressing the problem they say, `Well, who are all these social security pensioners? How can we either throw them off the pension or at least lower the burden that these payments impose on the taxpayer?'. This involves age pensioners, those who are disabled or who for various reasons are unable to work, single parents, widows and the unemployed. As members opposite see it, the only way to lower the burden on the Budget of the payment of age pensions is to lower the real rate of the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible suddenly to define someone as not being sufficiently old-although I remember that in one of the Opposition's discussion documents reference is made to lifting the retirement age for women from 60 to 65. The Government, of course, has bluntly rejected that notion. So, I guess there is a way by which Opposition members could save money on age pensions. Other than that, the only other way that members opposite could do it would be by their traditional means, that is, to not index the pension, to allow the pension to fall behind index- ation, thereby decreasing its real value. </PARA>
<PARA> Statements made by Liberal Treasurers in years gone by have always referred to figures in dollar terms-and inflation has done the work for them. Inflation erodes the real value of those payments. The Government and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) have now defined all payments, measurements and benchmarks-or nearly all of them-in percentage terms. We have indexed all our payments. We have made it almost impossible, politically, for the standards to be lowered. I am glad to say that this will make it tough on any future government to lower those standards. </PARA>
<PARA> As to other people who are involved-such as people who are on sickness benefits or who are permanently ill, or whatever-in terms of the way that members opposite think, how do they consider that the numbers of these people could be reduced? Again, we could cut the adequacy of their payments or we could throw them off the payments. I think we would agree that there are perhaps many people who should return to work. The only question is: How adequate is our retraining to get these people off a pension or a benefit and back to work?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has spent a great deal of money and has put much thought and effort into this area. We are keen to take people off pensions. The ratio of the number of people on benefits and the number of people in work has actually fallen substantially under this Government. One of the reasons for this is that we have been at pains to get people off benefits by giving them adequate training and putting them back into the paid work force, where, of course, they can pay taxes and support those who can never come off a benefit because of age or absolute physical or mental inability, or whatever. The Opposition cannot do a great deal in lowering that burden. </PARA>
<PARA> As to single parents, we are all a little sick and tired of listening to that character who walks into the electorate office and says: `What about the single mums? I can understand a single mum with one child living on a pension, but not a single mum with two or three children. Enough is enough. The pension should be taken off those people and they should be thrown onto the street'. I have to explain to people who say these sorts of things-and I always do it very gently because, obviously, they are not all that bright-that often a woman becomes a single mum because after the child is born the father leaves. Are we to leave that mother in desperate circumstances or should we provide support? It is not a tough question at all. The answer is simple: we must support those mothers. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that many of these people do not stay on the pension for long. It is not a lifelong exercise. They might be on the single mother's pension for three months, six months or a year-until such time as they meet someone else, as many do, and form a new relationship and are supported. Another alternative is that, under our various training schemes, they can enter for the first time, or re-enter, the work force. The children can be put into child care-and we support that. The Government actually provides money for that purpose. Those people can get away from the whole pension game and go back into the work force. So, that a is a good way that we can reduce the burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the matter of the unemployed. The unemployed took great curry and a lot of stick in 1981-82, under the former conservative Government. In 1981-82, the number of unemployed people grew rapidly. Some 200,000 to 300,000 people became unemployed in that time. That is certainly a burden in real terms. People were thrown out of the work force and then blamed because they were a burden. That is a bit tough. What the Government has done to lower the burden is to get people back to work, to give them jobs. The aim has been to lower the percentage of people unemployed and the real numbers of those unemployed. That is the best way to control the number of people on social security. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have an enormous array of programs that train and retrain people. Technical and further education instructors acknowledge a decline in demand for some skills but that there are shortages of skilled people in certain areas. The idea is to take people from the pool of unemployed, train them and fit them into new jobs and new industries. In that way, we lower the burden on the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress this point relating to the absolute separateness of the view that the Government has about people who exist on pensions as compared with the view held by the Opposition in relation to these people. The Government's view is that these people are good Australians in difficult circumstances or who have worked for a lifetime and have now retired. They should therefore be treated as any other Australians and given the best opportunities and a freedom of choice, if you like. This does not relate to the choice given to people in 1981-82: they could either forgo their wage increases or become unemployed. That was a beautiful choice: forgo a wage increase or be thrown out of work. That was the way it was managed in the old days. Our freedom of choice is a little different. We tell people to use the accord-that is the agreement between the trade union movement and the Government-to maintain reasonable increases in wages so as not to put their mates out of a job, to lower real unit labour costs so as not to put too much pressure on the economy and on the job market, in order to arrive eventually at a situation where we can improve the labour market and put more people into jobs. That is the way to do it. That is real freedom of choice, and that is the way it ought to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to make too many more remarks. I am pleased as punch about this legislation, about the economic statement, and about the record of this Government. `What if the other mob get in? What will they do to us? What will happen to all our reforms?', are questions that are debated in Caucus. We have locked in these reforms with brass screws. It will take a good electrician or a good plumber to undo those reforms and wreck them. The Opposition is not good enough, it will not get there, it will never do it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear the comments made by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) and the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham)-and no doubt we will hear later from the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe)-on this legislation. Irrespective of what arguments they might put up in regard to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, what we are considering amounts to an electoral sop to Australia's burdened families, pensioners and veterans. The honourable member for Petrie talked about the Opposition referring to families, pensioners, and others as a burden. He misread whatever it was he was reading because we are talking about the families, pensioners and veterans who are burdened, and have been burdened for some years, by the lack of consideration and concern and by the lack of a general policy framework for their well-being. The Minister for Social Security, who is at the table, has a big job to do. I admit that he has done lots of good things for the social welfare side of things, but he ought not to get carried away because he is not perfect. As I said, this legislation amounts to nothing more than an electoral sop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation puts into place what somebody termed earlier `a too little, too late emergency cash package'. We all know-on this side at least, and I am sure that anybody on the other side of the chamber with a conscience knows-that the chief beneficiary of this package is intended to be not struggling families, not retired Australians, but the Hawke-Keating-Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Government with an election coming up. No pensioner, no family breadwinner, no veteran will knock back the allowance increases and indexation legislated in the Bill before us, nor should they. They are not, however, going to be convinced that the increases in any way compensate for the significant decline in living standards they have experienced over the last six years. There is no argument about that. Nor are they going to be persuaded to forget the track record of this Government which has neglected or penalised those Australians who make up middle Australia's families, a government which has dishonoured the trust which should exist between our veterans, retired citizens and any government. </PARA>
<PARA> Real improvement in the living standards of families and pensioners in Australia will come only when a balanced, plain thinking, future-oriented policy framework is established for Australia. Real improvements and security will be experienced by young parents, mortgagees and the elderly, when an integrated policy and Budget package-which tackles interest rates, inflation, employment generation and productivity, retirement and welfare provision, education and wealth-is put in place which does more than pay lip service to individual freedom, individual incentive and individual security within a stable and happy family life. There seems to be a sad forgetfulness with regard to that last phrase, `within a stable and happy family life'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government seems incapable of developing such a package, but the basics of such a package have been laid out in plain English in the coalition's Future Directions blueprint about which the honourable member for McMillan had some rather rude things to say. It is a blueprint which will be implemented under the Peacock government which will be elected at the next election. Lest some honourable members on the other side scoff at my assessment of that guide for government, that is the Future Directions policy-the Minister seems to be smiling about it-let me quote the Director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, writing in the most recent edition of the Institute's journal, Family Matters. The Institute of Family Studies is a statutory body funded by the Government. The Director of the Institute, Dr Edgar, without doubt a respected and objective commentator, notes that some people portrayed the Future Directions blueprint as a return to the past. He argues, however, that `the thrust of the document is, in fact, towards the future'. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA>It recognises that families have changed, they are not all `ideal-typical'; it recognises that divorce, unemployment, crises of various kinds, adequate child care for workers, retirement, superannuation and care of the aged are the family problems of the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Edgar is referring to the Future Directions document. He further writes:</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, there is nothing at all wrong with asserting the values of responsibility as well as freedom-</PARA>
<PARA>something that seems to be forgotten at regular intervals by the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>of making a contribution to society in return for benefits, of giving priority to families taking on the task of rearing children. There is nothing wrong with setting some standards in education or in moral values that might guide young people through the morass of modern choice. There is nothing wrong with promoting a sense of common interest, a fair go for all, and compassion and encouragement of general community involvement in providing essential support services. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to argue for or against the particular methods suggested in the document to achieve such social goals. It is merely-</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the important part-</PARA>
<PARA>to ask of the cynics and critics what would they promote instead? A lack of responsibility? Unrestricted freedom of the individual? No social contribution? No support for the task of parenting? Low standards in our schools? No models for behaviour? No sense of compassion, common interest or mutual support? Of course not!</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Edgar's comments on the Future Directions document are spot on and non-arguable. I use this quotation to highlight the central weakness of the legislation before us this evening-the lack of an overall and balanced policy framework. As I have said before, the income supplementation and indexation in the legislation is welcome and timely. It is a pity, however, that this Government's strategy for improving disposable income for Australians involves greater dependency on welfare from the state. That is a crucial weakness and highlights the reality that this Government's economic and social policies are fundamentally flawed in terms of their philosophical foundations. Those two words are very critical when it comes to policies that are promoted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw my remarks to a conclusion by saying that not only is the Government not capable of managing and giving direction to our economy; it also lacks an overall policy framework for Australians as individuals and as families which is prudent, compassionate and respectful of individual freedom and responsibility. The relatively minor boost to disposable income via allowances will be welcomed in my electorate by families and pensioners. There is no question about that. It will not, however, convince them that a change of government is not necessary as soon as possible in terms of their own future, the future of their children and the future of this great country in which we live. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the House greatly, but I think it is appropriate to respond briefly to the comments made by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). It is most puzzling that we are being criticised for a failure to have an overall and balanced policy framework. This is precisely what this Government has done for the first time since Federation in Australia. Until Labor announced its families policy, no government had ever set a standard for income support for children and families. Before the families package, the level of payment for children depended on what was left over after the Budget process, not on any predetermined agreed set of standards which evolved from independent inquiries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that, it is an extraordinary situation that we are being accused of precisely what we have in fact done. We have established a framework which, for the first time since Federation, gives to those who are subject to the vagaries of the welfare system an assurance that they will not be treated just on an ad hoc basis but that there will be a reliable and effective framework upon which they can have confidence. All honourable members would be aware that the research that has formed the background to the policy and the framework that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) has established involves in-depth analysis by the Social Security Review of relative income needs of differential families and households. The standards adopted by the Government based on that research are consistent with all available Australian research on the income needs of families with children. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also puzzling that the honourable member for Macquarie has commented on the increased dependence that is alleged to have occurred because of the way in which this Government has moved. That is very puzzling because it conflicts entirely with what the Government has done in fact. Let me take a couple of examples. The family allowance supplement is the first program ever in Australia's history which targets benefits to low income working people, making sure that people in the work force have their income protected in a way that means their children are benefited out without any need to go into a dependent relationship on the state. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, the measures that have been introduced in the jobs, education and training (JET) program, where women are being encouraged back into the work force, matched with the increasing participation rate in employment, all mirror the commitment of this Government to make sure that we move away from models of dependency and back to self-reliance with greater support from the community to assist people back into an independent capacity for self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been said in this debate simply reflects a position of prejudice rather than any study or reflection or knowledge of what the Government has done. It is easy to be critical. It is easy in politics to bag what one's opponents are doing. When the debate is trivialised to the degree it has been today-with claims that so manifestly run against the truth and the fabric of what is occurring under the policy that the Government has established-one has to ask whether there is not only an element of ignorance but also an element of deceit behind what is being said. Finally we are confronted by a claim that these measures are an electoral sop to Australia's burdened families. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us look at that. This Government is the first government ever to index its measures of support to all families that benefit from the social security system. It is important in that regard to contrast the record of this Government, which has been consistent and has delivered year in, year out in every year of its term-not for electoral reasons but because of its commitment to a program, a sensible framework of policy-with that of the Opposition. If honourable members can bear with me for a moment, I will explain. The problems which occurred when reforms were not indexed can be illustrated by the experience of family allowance over the Fraser-Howard years. The Fraser Government introduced an important reform in 1976 by cashing out the tax rebates for children and replacing them with family allowances which also absorbed child endowment, which had been set at 50c per child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the 1976 reforms improved the structure of family assistance, they were marred straightaway by the decision to reduce family allowance by $1 a week for the first child compared with the value of child endowment and the rebates it replaced. But worse is to come. The rates of family allowance were not changed again until November 1982 in the Fraser election Budget. In Question Time on Tuesday, 2 May, the Minister for Social Security, who is at the table, indicated that over the Fraser-Howard years families had lost a cumulative total of $4.4 billion. This was a result, firstly, of the initial $1 a week discount on family allowances and, secondly, of the failure to index the payments. If honourable members want to know who framed policy responses in order to buy votes, they do not have to look any further than the last Fraser response. Until the Fraser Government was driven by electoral imperative, it gave not one cent for Australian children or Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, this Government has increased family allowances in every year of its term. The program that we are seeing put into place now consolidates that and provides a statutory basis for that continuing indexation of benefits at a level which has been established not by drawing straws out of a hat or by some sort of mystical process of guessing what the needs of families are but by very thorough research. If one needs to look at how policy used to be set, we can look across the table at the acting shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who said, `I used to just get offended, quite frankly, sitting in the Fraser Cabinet room and seeing that, despite all the technical and other analysis that was done and put on the table, quite often a decision was taken on the basis of something a farmer said he had heard in a pub the night before or that one of his mates had told him'. That is the kind of policy framework we have moved away from. It is very sad that the contributions in this debate debase what has occurred in the process of rational policy formulation and getting to the needs of those for whom the welfare system needs to be targeted. Nonsense has been spoken in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what this Government has done, one sees that it has addressed precisely the three areas of complaint of the honourable member for Macquarie. It has established an integrated policy. It has addressed the lack of a body of research to establish key benchmarks for payments. It has moved away from dependency. It has created a system that is geared towards the regaining of personal self-support. Far from being an electoral sop, the Government is in fact entrenching in the system-and has done so from the beginning of its term-a commitment to equity, to fairness. This means that the programs will be indexed and benefits increased year by year to protect the real living standards of those whose incomes are dependent on social security. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrast that with the record of the Fraser Government, where for years nothing was given. Then, on the eve of a Budget, there it was-the pudding on the table; the big blow-out. At the time independent observers outside said that the inflation consequences would savagely affect Australia for years to come. This Government is not interested in knee-jerk political responses. It has a program. It has a Minister with a commitment to a vision of how we can reform our social security system. This Government is implementing that in a logical, sensible and clearly understandable method. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to delay the House further, but I thought it appropriate to respond to those issues because there are people listening to this debate or who will be sent copies of this debate who might otherwise be inclined to believe that the kinds of criticisms that have been addressed have some substance. They do not. They reflect precisely what this Government has achieved. In every benchmark test that has been mentioned by the honourable member for Macquarie this Government has delivered. The Minister for Social Security should be proud of the package that has been delivered. It is a guarantee of income security for Australia's children and families. It is a package which is tied in with significant tax cuts. It is also a package which is tied in with a responsible wages policy-a policy which has obtained the assent of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and which prevents there being a blow-out on wages. It is part of a coherent and sensible response to the circumstances of our times and to the needs of those who rely on the social security system. I commend the Minister for the work he has done in this regard and I commend these measures to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst acknowledging the sincerity of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), I must point out to him that many of the great advances he referred to as having been made, particularly for pensioners, have only been the Hawke Government restoring what it had taken away. In the course of my speech I will say a few things about that. A number of the very examples that he gave are actions that were taken to reverse the very bad situation that pensioners in particular were getting into under this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), has moved an amendment to the second reading motion. I support that amendment. I remind the House of its wording:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) is of the opinion that the measure of relief it provides has been made more necessary as a result of the decline in living standards suf- fered by Australian families with children, and pension and benefit recipients, in common with all Australians;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the Hawke Government for presiding over 6 years of these declining living standards of Australian families'. </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage of the debate I do not intend to repeat many of the things that have been said by previous speakers. Earlier in the debate today the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) made reference to the Future Directions document and what it had to say about families. I agree wholeheartedly with him. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time available to me I want to concentrate particularly on pension and benefit recipients, the effect of the actions of this Hawke Government and the effect of the April economic statement. I congratulate the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) on having achieved so many reversals on the previous situation. In the course of my speech I will refer to the speech made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 12 April. I shall also refer to a press statement released by the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) last week when an issue was raised in relation to pensioners and beneficiaries. I shall refer as well to the additional documents that came with the Treasurer's statement relating to assistance for age and service pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Social Security and the Acting Treasurer were asked some questions about benefits for all pensioners and beneficiaries. In the Treasurer's economic statement the section relating to pensioners and beneficiaries appears under the heading `Age Pensions'. On page 59 in attachment C is the heading `Assistance for Age and Service Pensioners'. The press statement released by the Acting Treasurer was headed `PAYE Arrangements for Age and Service Pensioners'. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised a question in which I referred to `pensioners'. There are, of course, more pensioners than just those receiving an age or service pension. I had some concern, for example, about the widow's pension, supporting parent beneficiaries, people on unemployment benefits, and to a lesser extent people on invalid pensions who were receiving extra income not from any earning but from investments that may have been made available to them or investments they may have made themselves. I agree with what the Government has done in terms of the pensioner tax rebate. I agree with the moving of, in effect, the tax threshold for age and service pensioners to the full pension plus the allowable amount of weekly earnings, but I deplore the fact that they have been placed in that position. I am very sorry indeed that it has not happened for other pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Very recently the Social Security Review published a document which related to age pensioners. There have also been documents on retirements incomes. The Government, in Caucus, then set up something it called a Government task force to go around the country and have public meetings relative to pensions. It was not a Government task force; it was a Caucus task force. I mention that because when that task force came to my electorate a number of people seemed to think that it had some sort of objective status; it did not. Government members were travelling around having public meetings. I went to the public meeting in my electorate of Moncrieff and was very interested in the issues raised. We had brought together substantial number of pensioners, particularly age pensioners but not exclusively age pensioners, who stated very clearly and simply in their own words what was happening to them that they wanted the Government to do something about. All the cases that were raised, certainly that afternoon, were about things that the Hawke Government had done to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioner organisations tend to be very strong in my electorate. In fact, the State president and the secretary of the peak pensioner organisation live in my electorate. They make a major contribution to pensioner policy. They came to me last year and expressed concern that if the Government did not move the tax threshold in the Budget, then, in the next indexation of pensions, they would start paying tax even if all the income they had was the age pension. In the history of the age pension that had never happened. At no time previously had age pensioners had to fear that they might actually pay tax on the pension if that was the only income they had. That in itself is a very clear indication of just how, relatively, pensioners had been moving back. The Government did increase the tax threshold and took care of it. But then pensioners saw themselves as being in the position-with increases of their pension thanks only to indexation because of inflation-of having probably to fight this battle annually. The Government's action, taken in this economic statement, has moved that possibility well away. But it makes very clear how many pensioners are paying tax on their allowable earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> We say to pensioners, `In order to keep body and soul together, we think that this is the minimum amount of money that a single person or a married couple should receive', and that is where we fix the pension. Of course, there are other little benefits around it, too, but that is the amount. We then say, `If you have income from other sources, either because you can work a little bit, because you have money in the bank or whatever, it is okay to have income up to a certain level on top of the pension and now not have to pay tax'. It always seemed to me an enormous anomaly that pensioners were told that they could earn, say, $40 a week on top of the minimum amount in respect of a single beneficiary, and then an amount was raked back in tax. Of course, it was the Fraser Government which introduced the pensioner tax rebate-as it was then-whereby for the first time pensioners had to pay income tax on that extra money. That tax rebate was assessed in such a way that pensioners receiving the full pension and only their other allowable income did not pay any tax. </PARA>
<PARA> What a very different situation we have under the Hawke Government-or had until the April statement. Most pensioners are now paying some form of tax if they are receiving the full pension and their extra income is only that additional allowable amount-allowable in that their pension is not affected by that sum of money. That is a very sad reflection indeed and it is one of the concerns expressed by pensioners at the meeting I mentioned. They thought that it was rather unfair and I agreed with them, and I am glad that the Government has changed it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To me, the principle is the same. A pensioner is assessed at a certain level and, really, it is uniform for all-pensioners and beneficiaries-and there are additions according to individual circumstances in respect of whether the pensioner or beneficiary pays rent or has children. I remind the Minister of something that happened to widows during his time as Minister. I refer to the compulsory retirement of these people from their full time occupation of widow when their youngest child reached the age of 15 years, with no regard to whether that child was still fully dependent and requiring their full time parental support in a family situation. Widows were forced on to unemployment benefits where a whole lot of other tests apply to income. They were much worse off. This Minister compulsorily retired those widows who were full time carers for their family. The 15-year-old could still be a full-time student needing that sole parent's care and support for some time into the future. That change was not so good, either. So, at the end of his speech the Treasurer slipped in something under the heading `age pensioners' in relation to new payment arrangements. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>These new payment arrangements will apply to all pensioners and beneficiaries and will compensate for price rises much more rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that that is the only time in his speech that other pensioners and beneficiaries are mentioned. All other references to these benefits are for age and service pensioners. The Treasurer then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, Madam Speaker, the 2 per cent discount imposed in 1986-87-</PARA>
<PARA>under the Hawke Government-</PARA>
<PARA>for Public Service and Defence Force pensioners will be restored from November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another restoration so there has been a restoration of indexation, a restoration of the non-taxation position, and a restoration of the two per cent taken off Defence Force pensioners and public servants by the Hawke Government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very correct: just giving back what they took away. That needs to be pointed out. It is also interesting that that was slipped in as just one reference when all the other benefits clearly do not apply. It should be pointed out that, when it comes to the restoration of indexation, pensioners and beneficiaries will not even be back to where they were when the Hawke Government moved back the indexation of pensions until April 1990. It was announced in April 1989 that indexation will be moved forward four weeks in November 1989. It must be remembered that it was the Hawke Government that moved back that indexation six weeks and gave pensioners a Christmas present in 1986 of a little bit less money than they might otherwise have had. In April 1990 indexation will be moved forward eight weeks and at that point pensioners will be better off, but it will not be until then that they will be equal to where they were when the Hawke Government moved back indexation. So, again, it is just a restoration. It really warms my heart to read the following statement in the Acting Treasurer's press release:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Tying the pensioner rebate to the income test-free area is an historic achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>It has never been more needed in the history of the age pension. The press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It has the effect of exempting from tax an additional 300,000 pensioners or about 80 per cent in all. </PARA>
<PARA>I am glad for those 300,000 pensioners that that is happening in relation to tax, but I point out that it was this Government which put those pensioners in that position. The press release gets even better, because the Acting Treasurer then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It also means that some 75,000 pensioners will be relieved of provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Talk about brassiness! Six years later this is inflicted by the Hawke Government. It congratulates itself on relieving 75,000 pensioners of a tax that they have never had to pay before-provisional tax that was imposed by the Government. Well done, Mr Hawke and Mr Keating! Further on, the Acting Treasurer says:</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from the enormous benefit of relieving some 300,000 pensioners from the worry of tax, the measures also provide an incentive for pensioners to save to supplement pension income. This year, if a single pensioner obtained, say, $2,000 interest income-</PARA>
<PARA>about $40 a week, in the allowable amount-</PARA>
<PARA>he or she would lose about $540 of it in tax. </PARA>
<PARA>That is $540 that the actions of this Government would have taken from them and, of course, which is still being lost by other pensioners and unemployment beneficiaries. So, if one wants to know, in the simplest terms, how much worse off those other pensioners and unemployment beneficiaries are-and I refer to those on the minimum amount-one has only to read the Acting Treasurer's press release. Some would call it a freudian slip. I find it quite incredible that the Acting Treasurer could have possibly been congratulating himself and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Macquarie says, perhaps he had not read it-I do not know. That is possible but I would not be surprised if he had read it and, given the personalities involved, still thought that it was good news. Finally, in Attachment C, which I have referred to, there are some other fairly startling figures. The estimated cost to revenue of raising the rebates from the 1988-89 level of $430 is $50m in 1989-90, entirely from reduced provisional tax collections. That is the rate at which this Government has been socking it to the pensioners. It will be $185m in 1990-91 and $400m in 1991-92 when the complete measure is fully reflected in revenue forgone. When one looks at the list of measures that the Government has taken here-I am very pleased for the pensioners and for those for whom it has happened and rather sorry for those for whom it has not happened-one starts to realise a little of the significance of Grey Power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Grey Power played a very significant role in the Western Australian election. One could speculate that perhaps there is an honourable member here who could tell me what role Grey Power is likely to play in relation to the fortune of the Australian Labor Party in the Tasmanian election next week and, most importantly, the role it is likely to play in relation to the next Federal election, whether it is in 1989 or 1990. I think that Grey Power was fairly well indicated in the meeting that I attended in my electorate of the corporate task force on pensioners. I dare say that the same thing was demonstrated at every electorate that it visited around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government sent out its group of honourable members, representatives, and tested Grey Power Australia-wide. It got the message very clearly that day in Southport when I was there and the message is reflected throughout this economic statement. As I said at the beginning, I am pleased that some will be a bit better off. But I agree wholeheartedly with the amendment moved by the shadow Minister for social security and I believe that the House should deplore the decline in living standards suffered by pension and benefit recipients in common with all Australians under the Hawke Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the more unusual features of this debate is that the shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), has moved an amendment concerning pensions but during his speech in the second reading debate not one word was devoted to the welfare of age pensioners. I can understand that backbenchers on both the Government and Opposition sides of the House might decide to speak to particular topics in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, but one would have thought that a shadow Minister for social security, charged with the responsibility of putting forward the policies of the coalition parties on this important Bill, might have addressed even one minute, let alone one word, to the issue of age pensions. Unfortunately, that is the level of debate coming from the other side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is about placing Australia's children first. It is also about placing Australia's families first. This Bill is recognition by this Parliament that the children of Australia are the true wealth of this country. From the beginning, the Hawke Government has sought to secure a fair deal for families with children. It has worked tirelessly to obtain a statutory guarantee of adequate standards of income for Australian children. This Bill will, for the first time, maintain the real value of family payments. Pensions and benefits will be indexed, thereby protecting the weak and poor from arbitrary action by heartless and uncaring governments. For far too long many children, particularly from one income families, have had their lives clouded by poverty. The Hawke Government's action in providing increased income support for families, both by tax cuts and also by increased family allowances and income support, will remove this cloud and provide parents with vital help in the care and nurture of their children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government, since it was elected in 1983, has striven to correct the injustices, heal the divisions, and produce a sense of reconciliation in Australian society alienated during the years of Liberal- National Party rule. At the same time, the Hawke Government has striven to ensure that people in the welfare system, particularly the poor, become part of the mainstream of the community through a wide range of measures designed to enable them to participate fully in all opportunities offered by this nation. Labor came to office at a time when the dole queues had swelled by a quarter of a million in a single year and the unemployment rate had hit 11 per cent. Who can ever forget the legacy of despair, deprivation and division at that time. No Australian will ever forget the massive unemployment resulting from the prolonged recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members remember the huge numbers of people of work force age who were denied the opportunity to become productive and skilled members of the community? Tens of thousands of young people were offered nothing and were in a limbo world of no jobs, no education and no training. Think of the thousands of sole parents, often with young children, who did not have the education, the training or the background to move easily into the work force. In part, this was because payments and rebates were not adjusted for inflation. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA>For low income families the absence of that adjustment was devastating: 800,000 children . . . were forced into poverty. Payments for children in low income families were increased in nominal terms only once in seven years-from $7.50 to $10, a real decline of 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The taxation system had been corrupted. The payment of taxation became optional for the more wealthy. There was a massive decline in the capacity of Australian industry to produce jobs so desperately needed by the unemployed. With the collapse of public morality through the promotion of taxation evasion and with an economy in ruins, hundreds of thousands of Australians in the prime of their lives were thrown increasingly on an inadequate social security system. They became the new poor. For the first time in Australia's history, the Liberal and National parties had created the beginnings of a mendicant society in the lucky country. It was a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> The imperatives of the Hawke Government immediately on its election in 1983 were recovery, reconstruction and reconciliation. A social justice strategy was established and a fairer taxation system was put in place to lay the foundation for building the fabric of social programs that could be targeted to those in most desperate need. I mention just a few initiatives of Labor's social justice strategy. The success of the prices and incomes accord between the Federal Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions can be measured by the fact that, under the accord, well over 1.2 million jobs have been created in the Australian economy at a rate of twice that of the rest of the western industrialised world and four times that of the previous Liberal-National Party Government. At the same time, this Government restored Medicare. We have massively expanded child-care places and extended care for the elderly in their own homes. We have improved education and training opportunities for young people. We have increased social welfare payments to those in greatest need and we have increased the aged pension in real terms. Whilst these are accomplishments of which all Australians can be proud, the pursuit of social justice must never cease. Australians have always believed that it is the compassionate and decent thing to help their fellow Australians when they are in need. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures outlined in this Bill graphically illustrate the focus of the Government's intervention to assist and support the Australian family unit and to direct the resources of welfare to the areas of greatest need. This is a Bill which accords with the very essence of social justice and reflects the traditional values of Labor governments which have always had as their foundation the commitment to support and strengthen family life and to achieve a fairer society, whereby the less wealthy citizens of Australia might gain a fairer share in the distribution of the economic resources of this country. The measures in this Bill will help develop and foster the abilities and talents of all Australian children. The support for families contained in this Bill will provide, particularly for one income families, a greater sense of freedom from want with its accompanying stress and strain. This in itself will result in a more humane society. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer the the specific measures which will provide increased benefits for almost two million Australian families with over 3.8 million children. From July 1989 family allowances are being increased to $9 a week for each of the first three children and to $12 a week for each additional child. From July 1989 family allowances supplement is being increased by over $3 a week to $34.10 for each child aged between 13 and 15 years.

<PARA>ensuring that the aggregate payments for older children attain a benchmark of 20 per cent of the combined married rate. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . That promise was made because of our firm belief that the greatest scourge facing our nation is child poverty, that we must put an end to that, and that there is only one way to do that: to guarantee adequate income for all children. This Bill delivers on our promise-putting behind us the scandal of child poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The levels of child payment set by this Bill are consistent with Australian research on the income needs of families with children. For the first time in Australian history a government has set a standard for child payments that is adequate and will be maintained in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA>We on this side of the House, and I am sure all Australians, are proud that those most in need-pensioners and the poor receiving social security payments-have received substantial real increases in payments under the Hawke Government, in contrast to the seven years of neglect under the Liberal Party and National Party of Australia when they were in government. Only the Hawke Government has the stability, the economic and social policies, to give Australian families a better future and to treat those in genuine need with compassion. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with the words of the Prime Minister in his speech at the launch of the social justice report on 2 May 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>When people are unemployed, living in poverty, or prevented by discrimination from taking their rightful place in society, that is a tragedy for the individuals concerned. But it is a tragedy for the rest of us as well. Because we are all the poorer as a society when any one of us is unable to contribute fully to the productive effort of the nation. But if we are able to create jobs, reduce poverty, prevent discrimination, we will all be the richer. That is why Labor is proud of its social justice achievements and determined to pursue its social justice aspirations-to create a more harmonious, a more just and a more prosperous Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very appreciative of the contributions made by most honourable members on both sides of the House to this debate on this important Bill, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. I particularly appreciated those contributions that addressed the policy issues involved in this piece of legislation. It was suggested by some honourable members that the Government had introduced the measures in this Bill for opportunistic reasons. But the fact of the matter is, as I pointed out in the second reading speech, that the Bill is really the outcome of an extensive period of reform which certainly goes back to the last election. But in terms of the capacity to achieve that reform, we need to go back 6 years to the origins of the present Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there were two speeches that particularly annoyed me in this debate, they were the speeches of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). It is extraordinarily difficult in the area of social policy to achieve significant reform at a time of great fiscal restraint. The fact is that this nation needs to match economic and social policy. We have had a period of significant structural change and we are looking forward to a decade of structural change through the 1990s. For the honourable member for Gilmore, who is at the table, to come into this House and suggest that the Government was cheating pensioners in terms of its fiscal policies, that rather than adopting policies of fiscal restraint it was singling out particular groups of people to take more than their fair share of the fiscal burden, is not only wrong but quite malicious. I think this indicates the great problem that the National Party of Australia has had and will have in the future in this Parliament. On the one hand it wants to preserve a populist base, from which it can go out and tell people exactly what they want to hear and nothing different; on the other hand it refuses to face up not only to hard issues in relation to economic policy but also to hard issues in relation to social policy. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time of fiscal restraint, the Government has had to set priorities. It has had to ensure that over time we achieve assistance for those who are most in need during a very difficult economic period. Also it has had to try to match that setting of priorities, seeking to assist those who are most affected by structural change. At the same time, it has had to work to put in place a more adequate and effective system in terms of the opportunities it provides. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) regrets the fact that from time to time I have referred to the period of the previous Government as one of significant economic and social tragedy. I do not make any apology for that. The previous Government's economic policies led to massive unemployment on a scale that we had not had at any other time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In each of the seven years the coalition was in government, the numbers on unemployment benefit increased. Expenditure on unemployment benefit was about $600m when we left government in 1975. When we returned it was $3 billion. The honourable member for Bradfield and other Opposition members have referred to some commitment to family values. Any reading of Future Directions indicates an acknowledgment that economic pressures that produce very high unemployment in turn affect families. The incredible economic pressure placed on families during the late 1970s and the early 1980s is reflected not only in the unemployment benefit statistics but also in the massive growth in the number of people on sole parent pensions. If there was a problem of child poverty, in a sense under the Fraser Government the children were asked to bear the social costs of the inability of that Government, for whatever reason, to manage the economy with anything like full employment, which, interestingly enough, is a phrase that occurs in Future Directions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cost of that situation for families, particularly very low income families, was quite massive. I make no apology for referring to that fact. In the seven years of the Fraser Government the payment for the children of the unemployed and sole parents was increased only once-in 1980, from $7.50 to $10. So, while those numbers were blowing out year in and year out the Government of the day could not find the money to ensure a more adequate level of payment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to the credit of this Government that before the Cass review we had begun a process of lifting the child payments for the poorest families and were able to build on that base in 1987 and in the years following. Every year we have increased the payments for the lowest income families. As I said, we had to have priorities, and our concern was not simply, in relation to family policy, to build a safety net but also to build in an opportunity structure. It causes me a great deal of amusement when I hear honourable members such as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron), who last night talked about the Liberal Party as being the party of opportunity and incentive. That causes me considerable amusement when I think of the opportunities that were destroyed and the waste that occurred in the late 1970s and the early 1980s-the massive waste of human lives as a result of that inability to manage the economy at that time. Incentive and opportunity-what rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA> The Government was concerned not simply to repair the safety net but also to ensure that we converted our social security system, as I have said on a number of occasions, from a safety net into a springboard, to ensure that an opportunity structure was built into that system as a link with other elements of government policy. So we reduced poverty traps and high effective marginal tax rates and we began to provide substantial assistance not only to people when they are on a benefit but also as they move from that benefit back into the work force. That was the significance of the family allowance supplement. Of course, the Opposition will say that there was the family income supplement, but in many ways the FIS was a very pale reflection of the family allowance supplement. It has nothing of the real substance of that payment because it was set at a level which was so low in terms of income that it simply could not match substantial numbers of people as they moved from benefit into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance supplement, when introduced in 1987, was a path-breaking reform. The significance of that reform was that it represented the first occasion on which a government had established a child payment in the social security system for which a standard was set: a benchmark of 15 per cent of the married pension rate for younger children and 20 per cent for children in the 13 to 15 years age group. Those benchmarks had never before been established in the social security system. Incredibly, we had never set a standard for child payments. This was an incredible reform when one thinks about child endowment in the early 1940s. For over 40 years we had failed to set a standard for child payment; so, when we had the massive explosion of unemployment and the explosion of numbers of families dependent on our social security system, child payments bore no relationship to any reality in terms of the income needs of families. </PARA>
<PARA> Those benchmarks were established on the basis of research. The honourable member for Bradfield referred to the fact that Australia has the second highest level of child poverty in the world. Of course, that was so, and surely the party which was in government for 30 of the 33 years prior to this Government coming to power in 1983 has to bear some responsibility for the fact that it left the social security system in such serious disrepair. </PARA>
<PARA> Those benchmarks or standards were extremely important. They were linked to a commitment to end child poverty-and so they should be-because, whatever else child poverty is, it is a lack of income to support the needs of a child at a certain level. We made that commitment to those benchmarks and implicitly it was a commitment to annual adjustment so that the payments would increase in the future. The Government has achieved those benchmarks within two years if the supplement is taken together with the family allowance. This is extremely significant reform which goes to the heart of child poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some concern about the language that the Prime Minister has used in relation to child poverty. I do not disagree with the remarks of the honourable member for Bradfield when he said that the issue of poverty for families is a much broader one than income support. When in 1970 Professor Henderson said that the conservative government of the day could eliminate poverty-not just child poverty-for $150m, people did not laugh. They accepted the proposition that he was making as a serious one. The Prime Minister has spent much more than that-although, as the honourable member suggests, in equivalent terms it is of the same order-to ensure that we set new standards in relation to child payments as part of our concern for families. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that we in government have to do-and perhaps this is not so much of concern to oppositions-is to concern ourselves with all families. We cannot choose a favourite family type of the 1950s and focus minds on that, whether it be a single income family with two children or whatever. We have to concern ourselves with the vast range of family types including, for example, sole parents. The Opposition's policy at the last election included substantial family assistance which was not to go to sole parents. They were to be excluded because in terms of the Opposition policy they were not a favoured family type. In this legislation the Government is building on the reforms. We went to the lowest income families and to the issue of lower income working families in terms of our policy of encouraging opportunities for people to move back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield referred to the issue of whether there were more families on unemployment benefit under the current Government. Of course there were. They increased as a result of the massive recession in 1982-83 well into the period of the Hawke Government. They certainly have not increased since the family allowance supplement has been in place. There has been a very substantial reduction in the number of beneficiary families dependent on unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not been led into this issue by the bleatings of the Opposition; we have pursued a considered view of family policy based on the first report of Professor Cass as part of the social security review. She said that in the shorter term the Government must focus its assistance on the lowest income and lower income families, which we did. In the longer term, Professor Cass said, the government must look at the question of horizontal equity as well as that of vertical equity. In this Bill we are addressing the issue of horizontal equity. We are dealing not simply with the situation of the lowest income families; 90 per cent of families will benefit from the improvements in the family allowance payments. We are able, in terms of our family policy, to balance vertical equity with horizontal equity-the needs of the lowest income families with the need to recognise that for all families children are a cost. One needs to take account of that in tax or social security policies. Not since 1966, as Professor Cass pointed out, has wages policy taken account of families. It is right and proper that we should achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not simply address the issue of horizontal equity in this legislation. We address the issue of family policy in a way that is sustainable in the longer term. We have moved, having established standards of adequacy, to achieve overall indexation of child payments. It is incredible to think that it has taken 47 years, since 1942, before a government has been prepared to take the step of ensuring that our child payments, whether it be the family allowance, the disabled child allowance, the mothers-guardians allowance, or tax related measures, including the dependent spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate, are all indexed to ensure that they are sustainable and sustained into the future. This is not changed; this is reform. It is quite fundamental reform which a conservative government would simply not be capable of. Look at the pattern: in 1976 the conservative Government moved to form the basis of a great reform of family allowances but six years later it took $4 billion out of the hands of families and destroyed what was a fundamental and important reform which all sections of the community welcomed. That is the difference between the conservative and the Labor side of politics. We are not in the business of social reforms simply for electoral advantage. We are in the business of social reform because we want to build a fairer society. </PARA>
<PARA> I move very briefly to the measures in respect of movements in the consumer price index (CPI) as far as pension indexation is concerned. We have not simply restored what was taken away in 1986 in a very difficult Budget. We have gone beyond that to achieve our objective of moving the pension increase to the closest possible point of actual occurrence in terms of CPI rises. We will come back a total not of six weeks but of 12 weeks so that from April 1991 payments will be made in April and September each year. That is very much closer to the actual movements in the CPI. It is a very significant reform which has been taken together with the reforms which are not part of this legislation but which are part of the consideration of the Cass report on retirement incomes-the recognition of the need to ensure that we have a much simpler interaction between the tax and social security systems. Why did the honourable member for Bradfield not address himself to this issue? It is quite fundamental: there was not sufficient priority given to the aged. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to the reform which ensures that close to 90 per cent of pensioners will not pay tax. There is a relationship between the income test-free area and the tax free area. That is an extremely important reform. It lays a basis in many respects for what we need to do if we are to build a long term retirement income policy and put it into place. The Government is not concerned about the immediate impact. It is concerned about planning to put in place sustainable social policies that will last for many years. That is what government must be about. That will be the great challenge and the significance of today's events. The Liberal Party has decided today to move towards opportunism, away from longer term direction and policy. One might decry the views of right wing people within the Liberal Party but at least they have views, they are prepared to state them and we can have genuine policy debate. That debate is not about society for the next two or three years but about society in the longer term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall commence by moving an amendment to the second reading motion. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's failure to specify or detail the exact nature or extent of the community services obligations of Telecom'. </PARA>
<PARA>I also foreshadow that the Opposition will be moving amendments during the committee stage of the debate later this evening. I also want to point out that this evening I am representing the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Lewis, who of course is in another place. He would normally have been represented in this chamber by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), but as we are all aware he is enjoying somewhat changed circumstances this evening. As a consequence, I have been asked to take the carriage of this legislation on behalf of the coalition parties. The opportunity to do so was offered to me only a short while ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only briefly assessed the legislation, but I will do my very best on behalf of the Opposition parties to outline our various views in relation to the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Bill 1989, the Telecommunications and Post Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989, the Telecommunications Bill 1989 and the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill 1989. I also add that, when this legislation goes to the Senate, Senator Lewis will outline the Opposition's position in a far clearer and more precise and succinct fashion than I will be able to do this evening. That is the background to my presence here. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that, despite the fact that the Government has had 12 months to prepare this legislation, it has given the Opposition very little opportunity to deal with the legislation that it has presented to us. I understand that the Bills were only presented to the shadow Minister and to the coalition parties on the Thursday of the last sitting fortnight. As a consequence, we have not had an adequate period of time to properly analyse the full ramifications of the legislation. This is despite the fact that the Government had a full 12-month period during which to prepare the legislation and to present it to the Opposition, to ensure that democracy is carried out properly and that fair and precise analysis of legislation occurs. This enables the Opposition to function adequately, as a consequence of which we do the Parliament a service and indeed in this instance we do all those people in the telecommunications industry a service as well. Our detailed analysis of the legislation will be of great benefit to the Government as well as to the Parliament and the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only earlier this evening that I was speaking to another amendment which had been put before Parliament following Senator Lewis's discovery of a major drafting error in the legislation on communications which has been presented to the Parliament. It was only because Senator Lewis was on the ball that he discovered this drafting error. It had slipped through the fingers of the Department, the Minister and members of the Government. It was our shadow Minister who was able to pick up the failing in the legislation. There is great merit in ensuring that the Opposition has plenty of opportunity to study legislation in detail. To provide insufficient opportunity speaks poorly for the Government and its respect for the institution of Parliament. On this occasion it has not given us a fair go in terms of looking at this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion we find that the way these Bills have been drafted highlights a number of serious omissions and errors. Despite the very short time that the Opposition has had to consider this legislation, it has been able to find once again in these Bills errors, omissions, ambiguity and wide open spaces through which one could drive a truck. As a consequence, the Opposition will be moving a whole raft of amendments to the Bills in order to tidy them up. We want to ensure that any ambiguous provision is made precise and that any abuse of the system will not occur. We shall be doing for the Government what it should do for itself, particularly with all the resources that it has with all its departmental officers. However, through our own efforts we will ensure that this legislation will be better and that the people within the industry who will be studying it will have the opportunity to put the measures into practice in their various places of work and industry in a proper way and without any difficulties of interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Opposition proposes to move a whole raft of amendments, we will not be opposing the Bills, principally because we see, on balance, merits in the passing of this legislation. As a consequence, the Opposition believes that the Bills are worthy of support, provided that we can move amendments in committee which we think will substantially improve the legislation. Apart from perhaps some slackness on the part of the Minister in relation to the drafting of the legislation, the Opposition considers that the Bills before us this evening should be amended because, despite the fact that the Government claims that through this type of legislation it is further deregulating the industry, we believe that, on close analysis, the Government is not actually deregulating the telecommunications industry but, rather, creating more regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is the type of approach in which the Government has engaged over the past six years. The Government uses terms that would otherwise be quite pleasing to hear, but on close analysis one discovers that the legislation being brought into the House is indeed a trojan horse. The then Minister, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), in his second reading speech, gave us a feast of descriptions: for example, that the Bill was further evidence of the Government's micro-economic reform and of its desire to implement deregulation. However, on closer examination one realises that the Government is describing its proposed action in one way but doing something else. That is typical of so much of the legislation and talk that we have heard from the Government in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is particularly sensitive in the area of deregulation because, as we know, and indeed as the economic community of Australia knows, an area of very glaring failure that this Government has not been able to improve is that relating to micro-economic reform. As everyone in the economic community knows, micro-economic reform is the crucial area of change needed to our economy in order to bring it into line with the economies of the countries around the world with which Australia needs to compete. Despite this legislation being loosely termed by the Government as deregulatory, the Opposition believes that the Government is only paying lip service to that term. As to the Bills before the House, unnecessary regulations are being introduced, and indeed so much so that virtually double regulations are provided in the legislation in order to protect the various statutory authorities and government business operations that are subject to the provisions of this legislation. In addition, the Opposition will move its amendments because it believes that the Government is not doing enough and that what it is doing is not being done quickly enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to outline some of the aspects that the coalition parties believe are so important in relation to telecommunications policy. As honourable members on both sides of the House would know, over the last year or more, the Liberal and National parties have been putting together a most comprehensive array of policy documents to present to the people at the next election. As a consequence, nearly all of those documents have been prepared and distributed. One of the key elements of that is our policy on communications, a significant component of which relates to the role of government in telecommunications. As this legislation is all about the Government's role in telecommunications, it is worthwhile outlining in this debate some of the highlights of the Opposition's proposals in terms of telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point worth raising is that Telecom Australia will remain responsible for the basic telecommunications network. However, it will be required to compete on normal commercial terms in the provision of the first home phone, small business systems, data transmission and information systems, value added services and maintenance functions. This competition must be carried out in such a way as to protect the technical integrity of the Telecom network and provide appropriate safety measures. The Opposition parties will institute, in government, an effective system for hearing complaints from consumers about Telecom services and charging. The deregulation of these services will open up exciting possibilities for new and existing small businesses and independent contractors. </PARA>
<PARA> As stated in our telecommunications policy, the Liberal and National parties support the development of private networks as this will allow a substantial reduction of business input costs and confer other commercial advantages, thus encouraging investment across the board by business which, in turn, is so vital for Australia's economic recovery. In a more deregulated environment there will be opportunities for revenue growth for Telecom to meet any unexpected revenue losses from private networking operations. That policy clearly and succinctly outlines the approach of the Liberal and National parties to reform within the telecommunications area. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to maintain such things as the cross-subsidy requirement for Telecom. As honourable members on this side of the House would be aware, this is a vital requirement for people, particularly those who live in rural areas of Australia. I know that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, would agree that this is a highly important aspect and our communications policy will enable us to achieve this objective. Without cross-subsidy we will find that telephone bills for people living in regional areas will increase dramatically. The cost of installing a telephone will be much greater. I know, from speaking to Telecom officials in my electorate, just how much it costs to install telephones in remote areas. So, for many people telephones would be unaffordable. The maintenance of the cross-subsidy is vital to our policy as it is to the people throughout the regional areas of Australia. We will ensure that Telecom will operate on a competitive commercial basis. It will have additional competition but the bottom line will be that we will ensure that phones will be affordable for people right throughout Australia on a fair and equitable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out earlier, Telecom will be converted to a public company. That, in itself, will be a welcome improvement. I know that Telecom's senior management officials agree wholeheartedly that this is the way to go in order that they may have the opportunity to properly run their business on a commercial footing. At the same time, we will ensure that a new statutory authority will be established and that that body will have the responsibility for some of the current regulatory functions of Telecom. The bottom line again, apart from the maintenance and cross-subsidy, will be that Telecom will retain the basic telecommunications network and the integrity of its technical network throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy is terribly important. It will ensure that people throughout Australia will get a better, improved service on a more commercial footing and, therefore, at a cheaper price. They are the key elements of our approach to the whole issue of telecommunications reform in the future. Of course, we will also support the development of private networks in the communications area to ensure that Telecom has sufficient competition, that the consumer has a choice of service and that the latest technology is available to people. We believe that through encouraging the development of private networks, those facilities will be provided. The whole thrust of our approach is to increase competition, to ensure that it is on a fair basis, to reduce the regulation of the telecommunications industry and to ensure that there is no undue and unfair legal protection for government authorities such as Overseas Telecommunication Commission (OTC), Aussat Pty Ltd and Telecom. It is that very issue which our amendments will be addressing later tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that concern honourable members on this side of the House is the fact that this legislation gives Aussat, OTC and Telecom a degree of legal protection for actions that could cause problems to their customers or other people who are affected. It will give them unnecessary and unfair legal protection. This, in turn, will not only give the customers of Telecom a more difficult time than they deserve, but also ensure that Telecom, if it is competing against other private enterprise operators, will have an unfair advantage in terms of legislative protection that will exempt it from many aspects of the law that will be applied to its competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) will say that this is not the intent of the legislation, that so many of the points we raise are not the intent of the Government's legislation. But we make the point: if it is not the intent of the Government to allow some of these loopholes to occur, why are they in the legislation? We have looked at the legislation and, on what we believe to be a fair analysis, we see that there are many opportunities for Telecom, Aussat and OTC to break the law yet still enjoy some protection-laws which would put their competitors into situations of having to go to court, being fined or being subject to some other penalty. We think that is unfair if Telecom is to compete on a fair basis in the commercial world. We see some loopholes there. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a comment made by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 April 1989 written by Margot Kingston states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Kelly said the community service obligation of Telecom was its main rationale for retaining its monopoly over the basic telecommunications network and some other profitable services. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not necessarily disagree with that. But we believe that this is taking the need for monopoly protection that is built into this legislation for government business operations in the telecommunications area a bit too far. We recognise that Telecom and those other government services have a role to provide some community service obligations, but we wonder just what sort of a role OTC and Aussat will have in their community service obligations. Perhaps the Minister, in her address at the end of this debate, might be able to inform honourable members on both sides of the House exactly what sort of community service obligations Aussat and OTC will have. Those organisations are receiving some substantial benefits in this legislation that will give them monopoly positions in the market. From my analysis of the legislation I cannot see that OTC and Aussat deserve to have that monopoly protection on the basis that they have some community service obligation. I raise that matter as the Minister is here. She may be able to respond to that point later. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to more specific areas of the legislation. I refer first to the Telecommunications Bill 1989. This Bill provides the regulatory framework within which the telecommunications carriers, Telecom, OTC and Aussat, and the private sector will operate. The legislation defines and entrenches very broad monopolies for Telecom, OTC and Aussat and carefully protects those monopolies. It establishes extensive regulatory and permit systems to burden the private sector in the very limited areas open to competition. It establishes Austel-that is, the Australian Telecommunications Authority-to administer regulation of the industry, not to regulate it. It also establishes and defines two categories of telecommunications services: reserve services-that is, services reserved as carrier monopolies-and value-added services; that is, services which can be provided by both the private sector and the carriers in competition. It also allows Austel to determine technical standards for customer equipment and customer cabling and creates a cabling licensing system for persons to install customer cabling and connect it to the carrier networks. </PARA>
<PARA> Some important points will be dealt with in more detail in the committee stage by way of our amendments. Very briefly, we believe that the Government has failed to introduce meaningful deregulation of and competition into the Australian telecommunications industry in this part of the legislation, and the monopolies proposed for the telecommunications carriers are based on the need for cross-subsidies to deliver community service obligations. The Government has failed to specify or detail the exact nature or extent of the community service obligations of Telecom. No community service obligations are imposed on OTC or Aussat, so there is no justification for those organisations remaining wholly publicly owned. We shall move amendments in that regard later. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that concern us is that there is a clause that says that applications to Austel that are not approved within 30 days will be deemed, according to this legislation, to have been refused and that there will be no requirement for Austel to give its reasons for the refusal of such applications. We believe that this is wrong. We believe it is important that the opposite occurs-that if Austel is not able properly to reply to an application within 30 days, the application should be deemed to have been approved rather than refused. We believe that this is one way of ensuring two things: firstly, that Austel will operate speedily and efficiently and will not delay those people with whom it does business; and secondly, it will ensure that those people who have lodged legitimate applications with Austel will know the reasons why their applications have been refused. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe it is important that all directions by the Minister to Austel be tabled in the Parliament. I understand that the present drafting of the legislation is such that not all directions that will be given by the Minister to Austel will have to be tabled in the Parliament. Some of them will be gazetted, certainly. Some specific areas of direction will be tabled, but not all. We believe that, in the interests of democracy and of knowing what is going on in Government, it is important that all those directions given by the Minister to Austel be tabled in the Parliament so that we can analyse them and people have an opportunity to know exactly what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Another piece of legislation is the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989. This Bill replaces the Telecommunications Act 1975 which provides the legislative basis within which the Australian Telecommunications Corporation-which is now known as Telecom-will operate. Once again, we believe that some amendments are required to the Bill. I will give details of those later. However, we want to delete Telecom's immunity from action in relation to supply of reserved services. We want to restrict Telecom's powers relating to land for things done in connection with the basic network. Once again, the Minister may tell us the Government's intention in this regard. Why is the legislation worded in such a way that certain worrying things can be inferred from it? The Minister is in the chamber. We will give her the opportunity later in the debate to answer these types of questions. </PARA>
<PARA> She will also be able to respond to the last point that I have raised-the powers relating to land and things done in conjunction or connection with the basic network. We believe this gives Telecom the opportunity to have an edge over its commercial competitors. That edge comes from its monopoly position and the legislative protection that will be afforded by this House unless our amendments are picked up and approved by the Government and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Postal Corporation Bill 1989 replaces the Australian Postal Services Act 1975. Australia Post's principal function is to supply postal services within Australia and between Australia and places outside Australia. We believe another loophole in this legislation tonight-once again I am sure the Minister will say, `This is not our intention', but we say, `If it is not your intention, why does the Bill seem to allow it to occur?'-is that it gives operations such as Australia Post, and even, I understand, Telecom, the opportunity to run any type of commercial activity in its various activities around Australia. In other words, if I might give a ridiculous example just to highlight the situation, Australia Post could run supermarkets or liquor outlets under the arrangements presented in this legislation. We believe that this is not right and proper. We believe it does not ensure that the best interests of the small business community in particular are being served. We would like the Minister to state clearly later in this debate that that is not the intention of the legislation. If it is the intention, I think we have a real problem on our hands and the Government will witness a riot throughout the small business community of Australia, particularly in regional areas, in which members on this side of the House have a particular interest. It is just not right, proper or fair to have government statutory organisations operating normal commercial outlets using the benefits of their monopoly, cross-subsidy profits and so forth to prop up those particular activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The second last piece of legislation we are debating tonight is the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill 1989. Once again, we do not oppose this Bill. If our amendments are successful we will have to move specific amendments that are consequential to the successful amendments moved earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The final Bill to which I refer is the Telecommunications and Postal Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989. This Bill enacts transitional provisions in relation to other Bills in this package; repeals the Telecommunications Act 1975, the Australian Postal Services Act 1975 and other Acts; and makes amendments to a number of other Acts. It ensures that business operations of the Government such as Aussat, OTC and Telecom pay local and States taxes and charges. I also understand that, in the process, it protects OTC from legal action in certain areas. This highlights one of the points that I raised earlier. We believe some of the legal protection the Government is giving Aussat, OTC and Telecom in this legislation lifts those organisations above the law. Certainly, the legislation will not ensure that any commercial activities in which the organisations engage in competition with other private sector people are done on the basis of fairness and equality. </PARA>
<PARA> We draw all of these matters to the attention of the Minister and the Parliament. We believe that what the Government is doing is not enough and it is not being done fast enough. Whilst the Government claims to be doing great things in terms of deregulating the telecommunications industry, it is really only paying lip service to deregulation. What it is doing with this legislation is what it has done with a whole raft of legislation throughout this term of the Parliament, that is, using the term `deregulation' to hide additional regulation and additional cost to the business community and to the private sector and ultimately to set in place protections, in the form of monopolies and legal mechanisms, for government business activities that we believe are unnecessary and will place small business on an unfair footing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation that we are debating cognately relates to telecommunications and postal services. The Opposition has moved an amendment which relates to something which, as the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) said, is important to all country members-the extent of the community service obligations of telecommunications. The amendment is somewhat hypocritical, given the policy of the Opposition as espoused by the honourable member for Gilmore. He is a good agrarian socialist, as are his colleagues in his corner of the Parliament. Therefore, he did not deal at length with the Opposition's policy, which is to develop private communications networks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That would, of course, take the lucrative parts of Telecom Australia away from the government service. It would make Telecom less profitable and Telecom would have to take measures which would hurt people, particularly people in country areas. It would have to increase charges or reduce services or the Government would be forced into increasing taxes to make up for lost revenue. The development of private networks would only take away lucrative parts of Telecom and leave the consumer with one or all of those alternatives. We do not want Telecom to reach the situation of British Telecom. People in the rural areas of Scotland are paying three or four times the maximum price that Australians would pay to have a service installed. I would hate to think what would happen to a privatised Telecom in Australia and what would happen to charges in country areas or to taxpayers if we were to get rid of the more lucrative city services of Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with two of the areas of communications which are referred to in the legislation before us. One relates to our oldest communications service-the postal system-and the other to Aussat, a new system of satellites and earth stations. I will deal firstly with Australia Post. In the past few years there have been pressures on the viability of Australia Post. There have not been many closures but closures have been threatened. In my electorate of Eden-Monaro, Australia Post has had to look at the services it provides in places such as Dalgety and Cathcart. I am pleased that it has decided to keep those services going. In some cases the services being provided are very small; yet they are important to local communities. In other words, Australia Post is less viable for a variety of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only have discussions about closures been taking place for some years but also there is the possibility of the status of individual post offices being changed. Some official post offices have been downgraded to post office agencies and post office agencies have been downgraded to community mail agencies. We have even seen the installation of stamp machines where once community mail agencies would have been expected. To people in country areas, and perhaps in some suburban areas, this really means a reduction in services. Sometimes it even means that a service has to leave its existing building and go into a shop. Sometimes this suits local people; sometimes it does not. Sometimes it is quite depressing to see another building in a small village closed down. But there has been a loss of business to Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of services, particularly non-postal services, which used to be provided are no longer being provided. Some services are being replaced. For instance, the facsimile machine has probably taken a lot of business from Australia Post. Telecom used to have almost all its accounts paid through Australia Post, but they can now be paid by credit card and other means. Australia Post has had to look for new business and it has done so very successfully. It has had to look to a range of non-postal services for viability. It has even taken on services for which the private sector has been prepared to pay. I think of the AMP Society and of electricity authorities in the government sector. Applications for passports, which were once dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, can be checked by postal officers or people appointed to look at passport applications. Fewer mistakes are made in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax file number is an option that has been taken up by the Australian Taxation Office with Australia Post. Last year World Expo 88 in Brisbane used Australia Post to do a whole lot of business. It found that it was able to sell many of its tickets through Australia Post. There are other potentials. There are a number of basic services that Telecom can provide not only in the government sector but also in the private sector. There are a number of areas in which advice can be given. Useful contacts can be made through Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore talked about the possibility of the legislation leading to Australia Post being able to take up supermarket and liquor store outlets. I point out that there have been cases where post office agencies, certainly not official post offices, have been able to put in videos, nurseries and produce to supplement the postal services that they provide. This has meant that they have been able to stay viable. This is not intended in the legislation. It is intended that the legislation be as open as possible so that other services can be provided. I think of the Australian Electoral Commission using Australia Post so that people can enrol and have their enrolments checked at post offices. Australia Post could be an agency of the Electoral Office. A number of government programs can be indexed through the computers which are now available and information can be provided about government programs not only to individuals but also to organisations in local communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Employment, Education and Training could use Australia Post for Austudy applications. The Department of Defence could use it for the recruitment of personnel. It is interesting that five or six post offices in Australia have had a trial at providing Medicare agencies. Even important social security services could be provided. Commonwealth Employment Service application forms and basic minimum services could be provided to people who want to enrol or report. This is all open to debate. It needs to be debated and looked at. In conversations I have had with members of Australia Post, they have said that they are prepared to talk about the provision of all sorts of non-postal services which would keep Australia Post viable in a number of areas where it may well be under threat through reduced business. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that government departments and private organisations that make use of post offices should have to pay for those services. No longer can we see Australia Post as just an organisation for free leaflet handouts in local communities. It needs to cover its costs. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) heads a working group which is dealing with this very matter. The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) is dealing with that working group. That is extremely welcome. I believe it will lead to a political influence as well as a public service influence and a community influence on Australia Post to provide the wider range of services that it wants to provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Post offices have a long and vital history of providing communications in Australia. One has only to look at local history throughout the country to realise how vital the local post office was. The original member for Eden-Monaro, Sir Austin Chapman, was a Postmaster-General in an early Australian government. Australian post offices throughout the electorate owe their presence in some cases to his position as Postmaster-General at that time. If Australia Post has a long history, an organisation which has a short history in Australia is Aussat, the system of satellites and earth stations. In Australia, some telecommunication services are naturally more efficiently delivered by satellite. </PARA>
<PARA> Outback residents need services, and they are now getting them. Mining companies need services which they did not have previously, but they are now getting them. Firms with large branch networks, such as banks, were seeking better communication systems, and they are now getting them through Aussat. Many mining companies would appreciate the services provided by Aussat. I understand that Aussat is proceeding with the development of its Starnet V-Sat network, which will provide low cost point-to-multipoint communications especially suited to organisations with large branch networks such as banks. Aussat is also providing innovative solutions to other business communication needs and is working closely with industry on the development of mobile satellite communications technology which will become available from Aussat upon the launch of its second generation satellites early in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Aussat has also enabled the Government to expand the provision of quality broadcasting services to remote areas. While this legislation does not affect this role of Aussat, the decision to reaffirm the domestic satellite monopoly will give some comfort to those broadcasters currently using Aussat and those in remote areas who have purchased receiving equipment. To some extent, all these services compete with services that could be offered by Telecom, but they do not seriously affect the ability of Telecom to continue its cross-subsidy arrangement which funds its community service arrangements. Many Aussat services interconnect with the Telecom network and so contribute to its growth and to Telecom revenues. Others are direct substitutes for leased line services provided by Telecom or are types of services that Telecom could not have provided in the first place. In addition, Telecom provides to its customers the ITERRA service, a satellite based network service that can be provided at short notice and in remote localities. The legislation provides that Telecom and Aussat should together provide Australia's national public telecommunications infrastructure and network. </PARA>
<PARA> The Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) provides Australia's international public telecommunications infrastructure and access to international public telecommunications networks, but Aussat is to have a role in providing private network facilities to the limit of its present satellite footprint, that is, the South West Pacific region. Aussat should continue to have the exclusive right to provide the space segment of Australia's domestic satellite system, and `space segment' refers to the satellites themselves as distinct from earth-based facilities. Aussat is somewhat in competition with Telecom, but this provides a realistic choice to users. Many of the services provided by OTC and Telecom are community services which cost money, and for that reason simple third party carriage or resale of simple transmission capacity are not to be provided by Aussat. There is no doubt that the advent of Aussat has been important in the development of Australia's telecommunications infrastructure, and Aussat will continue to have a major part to play in providing the totality of Australia's telecommunications needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In a speech entitled `New Telecommunications Laws Seminar' of 3 April, the Assistant Secretary of the Industry Policy Branch of the Department of Transport and Communications, Vanessa Fanning, reminded the seminar of the context in which the Government's telecommunications policy reforms and its reforms of Government business enterprises were framed. In describing the Government's third term agenda, she reminded her audience that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had given the greatest emphasis to micro-economic policy, the structural adjustment of key industries and the relationships between them with a view to establishing and sustaining longer term growth. The Prime Minister said that the Government's goal is to ensure that the manufacturing and service sectors in particular become more efficient and so improve our trade competitiveness, reduce our reliance on imports and ensure that the Australian economy has the versatility, adaptability and resilience necessary to take advantage of the rapid changes this nation faces in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> They are very important points that we must continue to observe. I know that this Government observes them, and I refer to the need to balance efficiency and trade competitiveness with important social objectives, including the provision of important services to country areas which are producing a high proportion of our exports. There is no need to remind honourable members, the Government or indeed the National Party of Australia of this although sometimes I wonder whether the dries in the Liberal Party of Australia appreciate that point. So the legislation is in the context of the broader framework of Government policy in increasing efficiency but maintaining services at a beneficial level for all sectors of the Australian community. I welcome the Opposition's support of the legislation and certainly add my support to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The importance of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill and accompanying Bills cannot be underestimated. They set the groundwork for an area of Government policy which impacts right across Australian society. Today, efficient and modern telecommunications are an essential component of economic and social development. We have all seen the initiatives of Telecom Australia on television emphasising the importance of telecommunication services in improving the competitive edge of Australian enterprises. These days it is commonplace for small business to have the latest facsimile machine and private automatic branch exchange (PABX) system, while the manager might have a car phone. Without these tools of trade many businesses would become uncompetitive almost overnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Socially, how effective would the St John Ambulance Service be without the humble telephone? Indeed, many people may owe their life to the telephone. However, while the Australian telecommunications system has served us well, there is scope for a great deal of improvement in both quality and cost of service. Clearly, Australia's telecommunications service is excessively restrictive in some ways, especially in passing on the benefits of new technology to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last year the South Australian Government chose to install a private telecommunications network that Queensland was already using-the private Q-Tel network. The New South Wales and Western Australian governments expressed their interest in setting up private systems for use by their State departments. In spending $7m on a new system, the South Australian Government clearly expects to gain benefits in the long term from the latest telecommunications technology. Initial estimates show that at least $20m could be saved in South Australia alone over the first five-year period of use. The State Government also anticipates improvements in the level of service offered to the public by its authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do the present policies restrict efficiencies, but the standard of telecommunications service also comes under question. With a bureaucracy the size of Telecom Australia, including the management of 90,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $6 billion, and considering the vital importance of telephones in our society, Telecom is bound to fall foul of public opinion from time to time. However, there are indications that the degree of dissatisfaction towards Telecom is justifiably higher than with most other government agencies. For example, the last two annual reports of the Commonwealth Ombudsman showed that the number of complaints against Telecom was 18.6 per cent of the total number of complaints made against government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Telecom received such a high proportion of the total number of complaints is understandable, considering its sheer size and importance. However, it is a disturbing sign that a significantly greater proportion-21.1 per cent-of the number of sustainable complaints was attributable to Telecom. In other words, the ratio of sustainable complaints to complaints lodged was significantly higher than in the case of most other government agencies. Clearly, there is room for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret that the coalition supports moves to make Telecom perform on a more competitive basis within a more deregulated environment. Consequently, I go along with the broad direction of this legislation. However, instead of taking this opportunity to make wholesale improvements to Australia's telecommunications policies, the Government has adopted a half-hearted approach. Apparently, the aim of this legislation is to put Telecom on a more commercial footing. In fact, these Bills confer on Telecom what are referred to as `commercial obligations'. Unfortunately, this obscure definition remains undefined. The coalition recognises the need to preserve certain monopoly powers held by Telecom and Australia Post, including the provision of the basic telecommunications network. We also support cross-subsidy arrangements which have assisted rural and regional Australia over many years. But there are some important operational areas which would benefit from immediate deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government supports the retention of Telecom's monopoly powers regarding the provision of first telephones, public pay phones and mobile phones. While there is talk of deregulation, there is no firm commitment. The Government's so-called blueprint for change is in fact a blueprint for running away from the real issue. For example, in the case of Telecom's exclusive right to provide the first home telephone, the Government has extended this monopoly until 1991-92. Even then, the monopoly cannot be broken until there is a further review. Finally, any decision on that review would be only with ministerial approval. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government's statement on the nation's new telecommunications policies, issued in May 1988, highlights the immediate benefits for customers which would result from freeing up the provision of the first telephone. The statement anticipates that under deregulation a basic telephone could retail for as little as $15. This is less than most people pay for the quarterly rental on their first home phone and offers significant savings to the community as a whole. Unfortunately, this legislation contains provisions which, rather than freeing up the system, would actually be a further burden. Extensive requirements for the new regulations and permits system are required under this legislation. They will frustrate and burden private contractors with the very few areas in which they will be able to operate under the new competition. </PARA>
<PARA> In operational areas which require Telecom and Australia Post to remain monopoly suppliers, it goes without saying that adequate safeguards are necessary to ensure that these bodies remain responsive to community needs. In essence, Telecom could not realistically expect to police its own performance. For example, a lady in my electorate moved house recently only to discover that in her new residence a phone line was in place but there was not a telephone handset. Despite the fact that this lady had nothing to do with the disappearance of the original handset, Telecom demanded a $50 fee before providing another handset. Any reasonable assessment of the facts would indicate that Telecom was being heavy-handed. The Ombudsman has since supported this conclusion and justice will eventually be done. </PARA>
<PARA> But this case raises serious questions about Telecom's ability to police its own affairs. It also raises questions about provisions in the present law which prevent Telecom's customers from taking legal action against it if they have suffered a financial loss caused by its actions. It is very disappointing that a similar immunity is contained in the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill in respect of the supply of services over which Telecom has a monopoly. So it is with a degree of concern that I note that this legislation amends the Ombudsman Act 1976 to make the way clear for Austel, the Government's new regulatory body in the field of telecommunications, to take over the prime role of investigating complaints about the provision of customer equipment or the performance of cabling work. Although Austel would be able to refer matters either to the Ombudsman or to the Trade Practices Commission, the legislation does not oblige Austel to investigate every matter referred to it. Furthermore, where Austel investigates a particular matter, it is empowered to report to the Minister. The Ombudsman, of course, is responsible to the Parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill 1989 removes from Telecom the day to day control of its operations by the Minister and, in its place, requires Telecom to function according to `sound commercial practices' which, as I mentioned earlier, is not defined anywhere in the legislation. It is our view that allowing Telecom to set its own definition of `sound commercial practices' is akin to the fox being the keeper of the chicken coop. Let me illustrate the problem by using another example. It involves a professional builder in his attempt to get a phone put on at his new premises. As honourable members will be aware, for many years 300 metres of cable was included in the cost of having a phone line installed. However, recently Telecom has reduced the length of cabling as part of a standard installation from 300 metres to 30 metres, thus adding a hefty increase to telephone installation costs. Matters such as this will focus attention on the new regulatory role to be performed by Austel. </PARA>
<PARA> Another means of ensuring that telecommunication services are provided in direct response to community needs is to impose on Telecom a social responsibility. Although both the present Telecommunications Act and the new legislation impose a social role on Telecom, referred to as its `community service obligation', this is a difficult concept to enforce. For example, Telecom has announced plans to spend $60m on upgrading telephone exchanges throughout the south-west of Western Australia, principally to enable existing subscribers to have access to new facilities, including more detailed accounts and diverting calls to another location. But while Telecom gears up to spend millions of dollars on these yuppie services, many people in the south-west are still fighting to have their first telephone installed. There are exchanges which presently cannot cope with peak levels of demand. The exchange at Capel in Western Australia handles the communications needs of nearby industries. But the system cannot cope and companies which have important ties with other cities in Australia and internationally are often left stranded. Events like this can only strengthen the call for extensive deregulation and, eventually, the use of private satellite-linked networks. </PARA>
<PARA> When considering the legislation before the House, it is particularly interesting to note that no community service obligation is imposed on the Overseas Telecommunication Commission or Aussat. Of course, this means that there can be no justification for either of these bodies remaining wholly publicly owned. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another crucial aspect of this legislation, and that is the removal of Telecom's existing exemption from income tax. I remind honourable members that Telecom's fiscal performance in recent years has, to say the least, been healthy. After posting a $443m operating profit in 1986-87, Telecom trumped this with a staggering $776m profit in the last financial year . But these bottom line figures do not tell the whole story by a long shot. </PARA>
<PARA> By imposing income tax on Telecom from 1990-91 onwards, the Government is set for a multi-million dollar rake-off. Although, as the explanatory memoranda to the legislation point out, the exact amount the Commonwealth will pick up cannot be quantified, a reasonable estimate would suggest the Government will gain between $300m and $400m annually, on the basis of its 1987-88 financial results. Although Telecom would have to front up with this money, it is a safe bet that the consumer will end up footing the Bill. In fact, assuming Telecom needs to make up between $300m and $400m, telephone charges will go up significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> This is exactly what happened when the Government imposed sales tax and customs duty on Telecom in May 1987. In that case Telecom was faced with a similar impost-around $360m by Treasury's own calculations-and subsequently sought to raise local call charges by 16.7 per cent, and subscriber trunk dialling calls by up to that amount, as well as raising fixed charges such as telephone rentals and connection fees. Of course, it is possible that the Minister may use his discretionary powers to reduce the level of Telecom's dividend payment to the Government to offset this extra tax burden to some extent, but this will depend on the new financial targets that Telecom is required to set under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill provides for a special interim dividend to be paid at the Minister's discretion. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say that this option would be taken up only in extremely limited situations and implies that its main purpose is to assist Telecom's financial transition in the first year of the new arrangements. So it is possible that Telecom will not be faced with a Bill quite as large as the $400m I have referred to. However, as I am sure Telecom's financial planners are well aware, the Government can hardly be trusted over these matters. I remind the House of what happened during 1987-88, after Telecom had been forced to pay at least $360m extra to the Commonwealth in sales tax and customs duty. The Government offered an $80m rebate to offset the cost of this tax hike and, presumably, to safeguard the public from even higher increases in telephone charges. A further $20m rebate was promised for 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the Department of Finance released a report which showed that Telecom would receive only $29m of the $80m rebate that the Treasurer had budgeted for. Furthermore, the $20 rebate for 1988-89 appears to have vanished into thin air-it did not crack a mention in this year's Budget. In other words, the Government promised $100m to offset the extra $360m it imposed on Telecom but, in fact, paid out less than a third of this. Telecom was forced to absorb the remaining $70m, which put further pressure on telephone charges for the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Was this an honest oversight by the Treasurer, or a deliberate attempt to pull in more money from the public purse by forcing Telecom to raise charges to pay its new $360m, tax bill? In the course of a freedom of information request, I came across a minute from a senior Telecom official to the Minister which said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>I should mention that it would appear very difficult to accurately track the additional costs resulting from the loss of the (sales tax and customs duty) exemptions since in many cases it will be suppliers who pay the tax or duty and not Telecom. This means that it may be very difficult for Telecom to obtain the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA>If Telecom knew it would never get the full rebate, we can be sure the Treasurer did, too. So, in the end, the Government got its $360m-which has increased to $500m in 1988-89, by Telecom's estimation-and, as a result, the Australian public now pays more for its telephone services. The Government is expert at passing on costs to the taxpayer using this backdoor method. It has also imposed fringe benefits and payroll taxes on Telecom in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> When I see that the legislation before the House gives the Government yet another opportunity to relieve the taxpayer of more of his or her hard-earned dollars, I am sceptical, to say the least. And what if Telecom was confronted with an extra $400m expenditure? How would this massive burden be absorbed? Again, it would depend on the financial targets to be set under this legislation. Do not be too surprised, Mr Deputy Speaker, if new revenue-raising methods are canvassed. Only recently, Telecom fought tooth and nail in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to keep me from obtaining a top level report which could have shed some light on this matter. I remind the House of this statement made by Telecom's Director of Corporate Strategy in September last year-long after public debate over the timed local calls issue had subsided:</PARA>
<PARA>Timed calls are an important part of restructuring telecommunications prices. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the issue was not dead, that it was only on the `back-burner' and had not, in fact, been completely discarded. At this stage, three things are abundantly clear about the Government's intentions with its new telecommunications legislation. Firstly, it goes nowhere near far enough in letting the public benefit from more widespread deregulation; secondly, it is going to cost Telecom a great deal of money which will go straight into the Government's coffers; and, thirdly, the Australian public will foot the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak in support of the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill and cognate Bills, which I believe are watershed Bills. As the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), who is at the table, said in her second reading speech, these reforms parallel in magnitude those undertaken by the Whitlam Government when it split the Postmaster-General's Department into the commissions that we have today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was disappointing to hear Opposition speakers say that this reform did not go far enough. I ask: What were the reforms that the Opposition put in place in its 31 years in government? The biggest reform it ever made was at one stage in late 1950s, when it decided that we would not call the department the Postmaster-General's Department; we would call it the Australian Post Office, the APO. That was about the biggest reform it ever implemented in its term of office. I sympathise with the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), who responded tonight. It is not normally his portfolio area, and I think it is fair to say that he did not handle it too well. He made a number of remarks that I believe need to be responded to, as did the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). </PARA>
<PARA> What new policies has the Opposition outlined tonight? Does it really have a communications policy? I think we will find that it does not have one, but it has a policy to privatise these proposed corporations that we are dealing with tonight. In fact it was very coy about it. It would not say that it proposed to sell 49 per cent of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC). It said that OTC should be converted to a private company, which we are doing. It said Aussat Pty Ltd should be converted to a private company, which we are doing. But it did not say it intended to sell 49 per cent of Aussat and 49 per cent of OTC, and that is really its principal contribution to the communications policy area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition did say that it would deregulate the first phone monopoly. That sounds very attractive to the people of Australia. The Opposition says, `Yes, we are going to open up this area and you can get anyone to put your first phone on. You can get a phone from Taiwan and have it connected'. Superficially, that is very attractive, but the Opposition did not say what it would cost the customer for Telecom Australia to provide a diagnostic unit to identify whether a fault was in the cabling within the home, whether it was within the handset in the home or whether it was a line fault that was Telecom's responsibility. Will that piece of equipment cost $50, $100 or $200? How much will the customer pay? It did not say anything about that, but it said that it would deregulate that area. </PARA>
<PARA> How disappointing is the Opposition's policy for the industry and the workers in the industry, when this Government has put into place an industry plan-incidentally, one that the industry and the trade union movement support-that will change that longstanding industry into a very outward looking industry, an industry that will have to be export oriented and that will be on the move? There are already signs that industries have welcomed and responded to that plan. I think we will be seeing some benefits through increased exports. The Opposition will wipe that out because it will free up the first telephone and undermine a major sector of that industry. The shadow Minister has an amendment to the effect that the community service obligations should be specified. In this Bill the Government says that they should be transparent. Why have a debate today about what they are? What we really should do is have a debate on the fact that we believe rural Australia-those people living in the cities, towns and villages of rural Australia-should not be discriminated against in regard to basic telecommunications services. That is the position of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition speakers will say that they support that position. I notice that my colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) is here. His experience in New South Wales is that the National Party, whilst always advocating country issues, has not been able to stand up to the Liberals, particularly the dries. I notice that the new National Party Leader considers himself to be a pragmatic dry. If the metropolitan cities have been hit by charges, they have been absolutely steamrolled in the bush. So I say to the people of rural Australia: have no confidence in the Opposition that it will stand up and ensure a bipartisan approach to equality in the bush. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Dobell points out, we do not even know who the new shadow Minister will be. That is correct. In respect of the advocacy of just letting third party networks go willy-nilly, that will eat into the network profits generated by Telecom which make up the rural cross-subsidy. If we do not have a proper basis on which to cross-subsidise, we can have as much public policy about cross-subsidisation as we like but we will not have the dollars to accomplish it. So, the Opposition's position is a phoney one. The privatisation of Aussat Pty Ltd, in particular, and, to a lesser extent, OTC, will mean that there will be network competition. Of course, the Opposition will not have it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most significant aspects of this Bill is the establishment of Austel. One of the features of which I am particularly fond is its consumer protection responsibilities. What did the shadow Minister say about consumer complaints? He said, `We have a policy for it; we believe in it and it should be there'. He did not say that the Opposition supported its being in Austel. Maybe he believes that Telecom could appoint its own internal ombudsman and that that would solve the problems, or perhaps there should be a self-regulating Telecom and industry funded complaints body to handle the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia had a real breakthrough in terms of consumerism because Austel is being set up with very strong consumer powers. There were some mealy-mouthed complaints by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) about the number of complaints in relation to Telecom that the Ombudsman is currently handling. He said that they make up 18.6 per cent of his workload. I confirm that that is correct. But I think the honourable member should ask the Ombudsman the question that I have asked, namely: what has he done to encourage or to force Telecom Australia to patch up some of its systems and change some of its approaches to ensure that these complaints diminish? I think it will be found that that is the kernel of the problem and why we need an Austel consumer body. The people of Australia now not only can complain to Austel in accordance with this legislation but also can be assured that there is a strong body to ensure not only that individual complaints are rectified but also that the system is working and that in the event of any major systems failure action will be taken. So, we will not have a lively complaints industry. The objective will be to minimise complaints. To be fair to people in Telecom, I think they welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true to say that the Ombudsman will still have a role, but I commend the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support for saying in her second reading speech that within two years there will be a review of these arrangements. There may be a rationalisation, but the review will determine how effective those arrangements have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it does not end there. Austel will have a specific pricing responsibility. The people of Australia, through the Federal Labor Government, can be assured that the real costs of local and STD calls and rental will decrease. Just as a review recently initiated by this Government reduced the cost of overseas calls, the Government says that from here on in there will be some increases but they will be less than the rate of inflation. There will not be any real increases. That is a real breakthrough. I would have thought that at least one of the Opposition speakers would have said, on behalf of all Australians, nearly 90 per cent of whom have telephones, `Yes, we welcome this initiative and breakthrough'; but the Opposition did not do that, and I regret that. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the people of Australia, whether they be in Sydney, Melbourne or Newcastle or out in the bush, will welcome and appreciate this breakthrough. Of course, Austel will have some other functions. It will provide protection for the networks, facilities and services reserved to the carriers; protection of competitors from unfair monopoly practices of the carriers; protection of consumers, as I have already mentioned; and the promotion of an efficient and adequate delivery of reserved service including Telecom's community services. One of the functions with which the industry agrees is that we should stop Telecom being the referee and the umpire; so it will now be the technical referee. I welcome the appointment of the pro tem chairman of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Forrest talked about State governments setting up their own networks. He talked about the Q-Tel network. Good luck to Q-Tel! He talked about South Australia moving that way, along with Victoria and New South Wales. The point I want to make is that they are doing this under the current arrangement, even before this legislation is through. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we going to do? We are deregulating Telecom even further. Most business services will now be fully competitive. That has never happened before. Why is this happening? It is happening because we believe that that will act as a catalyst for a more efficient service delivery and a better and cheaper service to businesses and that this whole information technology will power through, providing more jobs and a better economy. I think many people forget just how big the telecommunications industry is. It is worth something like $10 billion. That is not just Telecom, or OTC or Aussat; it is all told, public and private. It is a very significant industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As a government we are keeping to our part of the deregulation and our part of the micro-economic reform. Contrast that with the Opposition. What was the Opposition's biggest improvement? Its biggest change in 31 years was to call the service the APO and not the PMG. That is like `incentivation'. Who can remember it now?</PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member for Forrest made a big statement about the imposition of sales tax. What really amuses me is the hypocrisy of the Opposition in raising this matter. Previously, the Opposition's steadfast criticism of Telecom was that it had so many advantages. It has advantages because it does not pay sales tax or customs duty and because it does not impose rates. The Opposition says, `Why are you not going to do the right thing for those in the telecommunications industry and even up the playing field?'. These are all the whinges and complaints. They have some validity. The Government has picked them up. When we do it whinges about it, saying, `This is terribly unfair. You shouldn't be doing this; this is awful. It is going to have an impact'. But we are doing it because we believe that organisations such as Telecom are going to be able to stand up on their own two feet with the resources of the 90,000 people who are in the main very dedicated in trying to deliver a fundamental service to Australia with no advantages. But this is the Government that is doing it. It is the Opposition that has all the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as the honourable member for Dobell has pointed out, we really do not know who the shadow spokesman is, who will be the puppet pulling the strings. We thought there was going to be an unveiling of a communications policy tonight but it was just a recycling of Future Directions. If honourable members want to read the Opposition's communications policy they will see in Future Directions that it is all about privatisation. It is not a communications policy; it is a privatisation policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are debating five Bills-the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill, the Australian Postal Corporation Bill, the Telecommunications and Postal Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill, the Telecommunications Bill and the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill-which are similar to the raft of legislation debated in this House the other night regarding the revamping of the Australian Wheat Board and wheat marketing. We saw and heard of the hypocrisy to do with deregulation. We are seeing the same sort of performance here tonight. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), said it would not cost the consumer in this country any more to own a telephone. I would like to put forward my views to this House and to the people listening to the broadcast on the radio tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have many pieces of legislation to do with radio and Telecom Australia is involved in sending radio signals across Australia. It is an absolute nonsense to say that these Bills are not going to cost more money. This Government is turning around and imposing a company tax fee on top of the profits that Telecom struggles to make. In previous years Telecom had to show a profit because it had to have capital to reinvest and expand. When we first started to post a letter-I mention that these Bills also cover Australia Post in exactly the same sort of mode-and use the telephone it was paid for out of our personal taxation, out of Consolidated Revenue. That no longer applies. As time has gone by both sides of government have used these massive public services to engage in revenue raising exercises. We have got to the position today where governments are actually milking the sacred cow of Telecom and Australia Post. It has incorporated them-they are no longer commissions-and is charging them tax on company profits. </PARA>
<PARA> Any member of the Australian Labor Party, including the previous speaker, who would like to say that it is not going to cost the telephone and letter users of this nation more money is an absolute idiot. It must cost them more money. These corporations have to employ people in order to offer a service and raise money because they need funds. If they are going to have capital they have to pay company tax first at the rate of between 30 and 45 per cent-it depends on the sliding rate-of gross income which will go straight back into government coffers in taxation. How any speaker can come into this House and say that it is going to cost the users of these services less is beyond me. It just will not. It is important for people to understand that right from the word go. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a series of amendments to these Bills. We do not expect the Government to support many of them, which is a pity, because it ought to. We are supporting the Bills. I would like to think that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), had a bit of gumption and was prepared to accept some of these amendments. It will be interesting to see what happens when they reach the Senate. </PARA>

We in the Opposition are doing our job of putting forward constructive amendments and the Minister is not prepared to accept any of them. What sort of Minister is she? What sort of government is this country getting? Not much at all. All we are seeing from this Labor socialist Government is more and more taxation to help it pay its balance of payments and to help it get itself out of its problem of 20 per cent interest rates. When this Government came to office Telecom was given a discounted interest rate-a 3 per cent interest rate-on the capital it borrowed. It has been slowly but surely hived off on to the commercial interest rate, which is running at 20 per cent. Telecom, being a big organisation, gets a reasonable discount, probably 15 per cent. But only five years ago it paid 3 per cent interest for its borrowings. It was subsidised by the users of the telephone-the taxpayers-but it needed more and more revenue. With its greed to suck in money and spend on unproductive areas in this nation it continued to borrow huge amounts of money-up to and over $100 billion-to stay in business. This practice continues. The Government is desperate for revenue. What is it doing tonight? It is introducing a series of Bills which are going to apply company tax to both Australia Post and Telecom. There is an enormous change taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most Australians own at least one telephone; these days many own two. Even car phones are becoming quite popular. It is advisable for members of parliament not to use one. I use a radio telephone in my electorate, which covers a couple of thousand kilometres. When the Labor Party came to office Mick Young set up one vote one value that gave members of parliament electorates three or four times the size of Victoria. The only way we can talk to people is by radphones in our cars. I operate a radphone through the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Charleville. I am able to speak to some of my very isolated constituents. It is one service that the previous Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, was prepared to give me. A lot of people in my part of the world still have to use radio telephones because it is the only form of communication they have. While the Minister is at the table I would like to point out to her that since the Government introduced assets testing on the isolated children's allowance many families have been forced to keep their children at home. They have been forced onto the radphone system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We cannot use a cheap uplink from Aussat Pty Ltd. I am pointing out to the Minister-she is meant to be the Minister in charge of these things-that it is prohibited to use an uplink with satellite communications. A downlink can be used because we can reflect a signal from the ground off the satellite down but it is very expensive-costing hundreds of dollars-as the Minister knows. In Queensland the National Party, with Q-net and other experimental services that it runs with the satellite for education, is light years ahead of the rest of Australia but it is very expensive. We expect the Government to help us. We expect the Government not to asset test the people in isolated Australia that have to send their children to a boarding school for education and are forced to have them at home and use a radphone-a radio telephone for those who do not know what they are. They are a high frequency radio telephone which operates through the flying doctor bases throughout Australia. It is the only form of communication that these people have. It is important for the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support to understand that it costs a user at least $100,000 to install an uplink to a satellite. They simply do not operate that easily. It is very cheap downwards, but it is very expensive to get a signal up to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom Australia and the big commercial television stations send up signals to a satellite from their bases in Sydney and Melbourne, et cetera; but in isolated parts of Queensland, particularly in the Maranoa electorate, which is even more isolated than most areas, it is very expensive to have an uplink of one's own. Telecom has used some of these facilities. It installed one at Birdsville, for instance. Birdsville no longer uses the high frequency radio telephone that it has had for the past 10 or 20 years. It now has an uplink on Telecom's satellite service. That is quite a feat for Telecom, and I must congratulate it for that. Not many people live in Birdsville, which is a very isolated part of my electorate, but the people of that town now have a better service than they had previously. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills totally reorganise Telecom. The honourable member for Chifley said that this would not cost anything, but even the new arrangement that Telecom has for complaints-which I support-is going to cost money. A whole Bill deals with picking up fees to help pay for this operation. In her address to the House, the Minister pointed out that there would be 70 extra employees just to run this operation. So, the Government cannot tell me that it will not cost more money-because it will. There is always a lot of conjecture about what Telecom's responsibilities are. I think it is important to point out to the House that this new arrangement involves the new concept of Telecom's statutory community services obligation (CSO). This is defined thus:</PARA>
<PARA>Telecom's statutory CSO is the supply of a standard telephone service as efficiently and economically as practicable. This service must be reasonably accessible to all people and on an equitable basis-</PARA>
<PARA>this is all nice, good wording-</PARA>
<PARA>wherever they reside or carry out business within Australia. Also, there is a requirement that service performance standards reasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>We hear all about quality of service, deregulation, and so on, but in reality we find that the people who live in my part of the world are the only subscribers to be subject to a timed local call. I would like to raise this matter with the Prime Minister every day in the House. He promised that we would not have any timed local calls and yet this matter is raised in countrywide calling. I have tabled this material in the House before, and so I will not bore honourable members by doing it again. The Minister is sitting with a nice big smile on her face. I ask her to go back to her room after this debate, pull out the 076 telephone book and actually take note of the fact that people who live in isolated parts of inland Queensland and other isolated inland parts of Australia are being charged for timed local calls. Anyone living outside the black spots that are marked on the map that I have do not get untimed local calls. I think that is a disgrace. I would have thought that the Minister has the ability in relation to these Bills to move amendments to give people equal access if they do not have it at present. There are Australians who are being disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they have. They do have a better service than they had before. They used to have morse code. It was only 10 years ago that they had smoke signals. So, they have progressed from smoke signals to morse code to radio telephones, and now they are using a satellite-I think that is brilliant. So that is one place where things have improved. There are not many constituents there, of course, but it is still a good part to go to. However, people in these areas are entitled to these services. Under the Government's legislation, to which I have just referred, people in these areas are entitled to equal access to a telephone-and that is what Telecom has given them. I support that concept. We cannot operate this form of communication in any other fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The same thing applies to Australia Post. It is laid down in legislation in no uncertain terms that the standard postal rate will continue. We must have a standard postal rate in a nation such as Australia. In New Zealand, for example, everyone is charged the same amount for a local call. In Australia, we had a system where all local calls were untimed. However, we no longer have that system. Rural Australians are being discriminated against because their local calls are being timed. They are the only Australians to which this applies. Millions of other Australians who chat across Canberra, Brisbane or Sydney all day long do not get timed for their calls. But if one happens to live out at Quilpie, Charleville, Cunnamulla, one is charged. Every call that people in those areas make is timed and they are being charged for it. I think that is a disgrace and the Minister ought to change this. </PARA>
<PARA> The other system that we have is still in place. While the Minister is here at the table I would like to tell her that she could institute some moves in her ministry to make changes to the connection fee provisions. If one lives 16 kilometres from any exchange, the connection fee is $25 per kilometre, up to $600 a connection. This is what Australians are being charged in relation to the conversion. We are still converting to automatic exchanges. I think it was here in the House today or yesterday where I heard that Telecom is operating in China, or somewhere. I could not understand how Telecom had actually branched out into that area with telephones, when it has not even completed the equipping of automatic phones in the good electorate of Maranoa. The Minister smiles about that, but she should understand these things. I know that the Minister is fairly intelligent and that is why I am putting these facts forward. However, the $600 fee that is charged is a disgrace. Any other Australian who lives within 16 kilometres of an exchange pays nothing to have his telephone converted. Of course, the connection fee for a new service outside the 16-kilometre radius involves a charge of $50 per kilometre, or up to $1,425. We do have a cross-subsidisation with our telephone system, and it cannot be any other way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for people to argue against it. It is different when it comes to cross-subsidising the bus services in Canberra. They run at a loss of about $20m a year, and no one cares about that. No one cares about it in the Minister's electorate. There is a nice cold cross-subsidisation from the Commonwealth in relation to the extended buses that run around this capital city. As I said, the bus service runs at a $20m loss each year. It is an absolute disgrace. Yet, in relation to telephones, the Government is not prepared to provide everyone with a telephone connection cost that is equal to that paid by people living in cities such as Canberra. The telephones in Canberra were converted from manual exchanges to automatic for nothing, and yet the people out in the bush have to bear the cost, as if they do not have enough things to put up with, such as the heat and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. If people do not have a telephone, how can they do any business? Most people in the country are in business. A farm is a business. These people more than pay the equivalent of a connection fee for their telephone. They make a whole heap of telephone calls out, and then get a whole heap of telephone calls in from businesses across Australia. They are one of the mainstays of Telecom. They keep it in business and enable it to make the sort of profit that it has to make if it is going to continue to capitalise and expand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have continued to see changes in charging et cetera. I might point out that one of the previous Ministers responsible for telecommunications, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), made changes in Charleville when I first came into parliament in order to reduce a lot of these fees. However, we are now seeing a lot of them remaining. I would like to see this changed. I have been speaking to Kerry Jones, the director of the new zone. Zones have been amalgamated, of course. We now have a massively big zone, the 076 zone, in my area. Mr Jones tells me that not only will Telecom be asked to pay taxation but it is now being asked to pay State registration fees. Of course, Telecom employees do not get around on motorbikes. Wherever they move they get around with about 30 vehicles. One vehicle is wanted for each bloke who works for Telecom. I do not knock Telecom, as I think it does an excellent job. But one cannot tell me that it is not overstaffed and overequipped when it comes to putting a pole in the ground. Usually about 30 vehicles and 35 blokes stand around leaning on shovels doing it. </PARA>
<PARA> But Telecom now has to convert from a position of paying no registration fees to a situation of paying State registration fees. Not only that, come 1 July it will have to pay rates to the local shire. I do not object to that, but this is just another cost placed on Telecom which will be put back on the consumer. Any person in the Australian Labor Party who comes in here and says that these changes will not cost the consumers of telephone services and the services provided by Australia Post more money is an absolute fool and an idiot. It will cost the users of these services hundreds of millions of dollars more as time goes by. It will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. It must do that just to pay registration fees. </PARA>
<PARA> I worked out the figures with Kerry Jones. In his area he has anything up to 250 vehicles, with payments of, on average, $400 a year. So there is an increase of $100,000 just in this one zone. Telecom would be paying the same rates to the local shire because it has huge areas of land on which it keeps equipment. In most towns it has people located in residences, et cetera, so Telecom will have to pay more in shire rates. In my area alone, it is looking at about a $250,000 increase in charges. Who will pay those increased charges? The consumers will-the users of the telephone system. All we are seeing is a massive indirect increase in charges to consumers by this Labor Government. It is an absolute disgrace, yet it continues. The Government cannot help itself. It needs funds. Every time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) comes into the House he announces enormous increases in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the only tax Telecom will be exempted from will be stamp duty. That is probably worth while. In regard to Austel, it is amazing that the Ombudsman's position will remain. Why does the Government not abolish that position? It sets up a body comprising 70 people, so surely complaints can be directed to it, and the Ombudsman's position can be abolished, yet I notice in the second reading speech of the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support that the Ombudsman's position will remain. I welcome the complaint mechanism. There are certain areas in my electorate that need telephone connections. All the prickle farmers in the country these days want a telephone after they have been settled for a while. People in Millmerran and Tara in my electorate have made representations to me. These people need telephones. I expect the Minister to ensure that telephones are put on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to focus my contribution to this debate on the overall importance of the package of legislation to the fundamental micro- economic objectives of this Government. In discussing the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill, the Australian Postal Corporation Bill, The Telecommunications and Postal Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill, the Telecommunications Bill, and the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Bill, it is very easy to become distracted, as Opposition members have been in their contributions tonight, by various specific provisions affecting a variety of interest groups, and to forget the overall objective of the exercise, that of micro-economic reform. The overriding objective of micro-economic reform is, of course, to enhance the efficiency and international competitiveness of the Australian economy. Micro-economic reform is about achieving real, lasting and sustainable benefits for Australians as a whole, not just for a few favoured interest groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Micro-economic reform in the communications sector of the economy has been pursued vigorously by this Government for a number of specific reasons: first, its importance as a service industry to the Australian economy with a consequent impact on input costs; second, the rapidity of technological change within the industry and the benefits this has bestowed, and will continue to bestow, on the community in terms of better services at declining prices in real terms; and, third, the massive growth forecast for this industry on a worldwide basis which emphasises the continuing and increasing importance of this industry to the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> These reasons add impetus to the need to reassess the existing regulatory environment, the carriers themselves, and the structure of the industry. This Government did review these in a thorough and comprehensive way, as Senator Gareth Evans announced in his 1988 May statement. The Government's approach to the task of micro-economic reform has been basically two-pronged: first, to reorganise the rules governing industry participation and, second, to review and restructure its business enterprises which participate in the communications sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal changes to industry regulation are set out in the Telecommunications Bill. The new regulatory arrangements will clearly separate the technical and regulatory functions from the operations of the carriers and place these responsibilities in the hands of an independent industry regulator, the Australian Telecommunications Authority-Austel. This is an important initiative in terms of the separation of the previously existing roles of participant and umpire. It will encourage freer and fairer competition. Austel's functions will focus on independent technical and economic regulation. There will be five main functions: technical regulation to guarantee the safety and integrity of the network; administering the boundary between reserved and competitive service; promoting fair market conduct; safeguarding consumer interests; and, finally, promoting, monitoring and reporting on the efficiency and adequacy of the monopoly operations of the carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> Some rules governing industry participation have already been changed. The provision and maintenance of customer equipment has been liberalised to allow additional scope for competition. Private automatic branch exchange (PABX) maintenance services have been opened to competition since 1 January 1989 and from July this year the supply and maintenance of small business systems will be freed up. Competition of this sort will widen customer choice of quality and features and will open up new opportunities for Australian industry to develop and expand. Increased competition in the industry is one spur which the Government is using to maximise the efficiency not only of the industry generally but also of the carriers in particular. However, the principal levers being used by the Government to maximise carrier efficiency result from the application of a unique combination of rate of return regulation and price cap regulation to the public telecommunications infrastructure providers-that is, of course, Telecom Australia and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC). </PARA>
<PARA> The policy intention is that the combination of upward pressure on efficiency via target rates of return and downward pressure through price control should squeeze out available efficiency gains for the consumer. Under the new arrangements, Telecom and OTC prices for standard services will be regulated by a price cap limiting average price rises to a minimum annual percentage below the rate of inflation. That, of course, is known as the CPI `X' formula. The formula is being designed to ensure that the benefits of improved efficiency are shared equitably between business and residential consumers, and that there are no adverse implications for Telecom's community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> To guard against the possibility of these pressures resulting in a sideways movement through deterioration of outward quality the Government will have the ability to establish and monitor service delivery and performance standards. This will be achieved through the enterprise corporate plans and Austel activities. The new price control arrangements, which will operate from 1 July 1989 and be administered by Austel, are designed to restrain prices and to provide an aggregate external incentive for efficiency in the Government's principal telecommunication carriers, that is, Telecom and OTC. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers and the economy generally will benefit from the lower real prices delivered by the new controls and from the gains in efficiency that they will encourage. Although Australia Post is not being subjected to a formal price cap mechanism, its postage rates for standard postal articles and registered publications will continue to be subject to scrutiny by the Prices Surveillance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> In setting a value for `X' in the formula that I alluded to earlier, for the first three-year period, the Government will be seeking a value which reflects available gains in productivity growth and efficiency improvements but which does not adversely affect the carriers' ability to generate sufficient revenue to meet the rate of return targets being set as part of each enterprise's reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> Another element of the Government's strategy has been to reassess its relationships with government business enterprises and the internal structures of each enterprise. This was done in order to ensure that any efficiency gains flowing from the restructuring of the industry were not impeded by inefficiencies in the operations of the major participants, brought about by unnecessary centralised government control-the sorts of things that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) was talking about. It will also ensure that the carriers themselves are put on a sound basis to compete effectively in sectors of the industry which are open to full competition. This Government found that previously the emphasis in government's relationships with these enterprises was on the day-to-day issues confronting them. This often represented direct intervention at the input level of the managerial decision making processes, a case of second guessing the commercial judgment of the enterprise by Ministers and departments. Clearly this had to change to a situation where government was more concerned with bottom line results and the achievements of predetermined objectives. This package of legislation-in particular, the corporations Bills for Telecom and Australia Post-implement the new focus on planning and accountability of the enterprise and emphasise attention to their results or outputs against predetermined financial and operational targets. These are to be brought together in a corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also reviewed a number of major elements of each enterprise's internal functioning-in particular, their financial and operational structures. Decisions were taken on the legal form to suit individual circumstances. The review resulted in the Government's decision to convert OTC into a public company, largely in recognition of its well developed progress to a commercial organisation which also does not undertake explicit community service obligations (CSOs). It also resulted in the restructuring of Telecom and Australia Post into statutory corporations with substantially revised financial and operating charters. These changes are incorporated in the detailed provisions of the legislative package now being debated. As Aussat was already incorporated as a company, no change was considered necessary to its structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially changes to the financial structures of Telecom and Australia Post have involved a number of specific proposals. The first is a change in the processes of the approvals to major financial transactions, with responsibility for these being devolved to the boards and management of those enterprises. The second is a major change in the organisations' financial structure through the provision of a proper capital structure. Third, consistent with the provision of capital, the government business enterprises will be required to make regular dividend payments to service capital, as any other normal commercial undertaking is required to do. Finally, the progressive implementation of all taxes and charges to those two government business enterprises (GBEs) has been proposed. Of course, that is because OTC and Aussat are already required to meet this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The new financial arrangements applying to Telecom and Australia Post provide for a proper financial base and the progressive application of all taxes and charges consistent with economic conditions applying to their competitors. Operationally, the decision making process has been substantially devolved to the board and management of the enterprises, thereby replicating normal commercial conditions by removing additional layers of approvals for normal commercial transactions. The key to this approach is accountability. Boards have been made accountable to the Government for the performance of the GBE's functions and accountability elements are being put in place to keep the Government, the shareholder, apprised of the strategic activities of the GBE. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporate plan represents the key planning document by which GBE advises the Government of its objectives, strategies and policies to fulfil its legislative charter. In accordance with this approach, the rate of return targets of Telecom, OTC, Aussat and Australia Post for the three-year period are being developed within the context of their individual corporate plans. These plans will include values for capital expenditures, borrowing requirements, taxation assumptions, the impact of asset revaluations, changes being made to the enterprises' financial structures and variations in operating costs. Additionally, the carriers will in future be required to make dividend payments of a certain order to the government. The dividend will be determined in part by the level of profitability, which itself will be affected by the level of X in the CPI `X' pricing formula. An appropriate question would be: how and where do community service obligations-that is, CSOs-fit into this framework of price capping, corporate planning and financial targets? The answer is that the financial targets will be adjusted to take into account the costs borne by the carriers which arise from their obligations to meet the Government's non-commercial objectives. These costs include not only those related to CSOs but the costs of residual non-commercial controls which adversely affect profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach involves an extensive exercise in identifying and separating out these costs. An essential ingredient of the new approach is that the Government will determine what CSOs it expects Telecom and Australia Post to provide. This is in marked contrast to the previous situation where Telecom and Australia Post largely were left to interpret the extent and level of support they gave to various CSOs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has a study in hand on Telecom's CSO costs at this time. A similar exercise is also being undertaken for Australia Post. Transparency of the CSO cost is seen as a crucial element of the public policy-making processes in relation to the telecommunications industry. For far too long all parties have known that there is a cost associated with the provision of CSOs but they have preferred an ostrich approach to these costs. This Government considers that by costing these CSOs and making their costs more transparent, better informed and more balanced decisions can be made about the fulfilment of the CSOs themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude my remarks by again referring to the importance of the telecommunications industry to the whole of the Australian economy. This Government in introducing this major legislative package for the telecommunications industry has made important and far-reaching micro-economic changes both to the rules of the game and to the rules relating to major participants. The Government believes that it is imperative that these changes be implemented in order to allow the consumers of these services to benefit from the efficiency gains to be made in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for filling in for me as Deputy Speaker, which will allow me to say a few words on the telecommunications and postal services legislation. I shall be very brief. I consider the legislation before the House to be very important indeed, particularly as it concerns those of us who are representing electorates around the countryside of Australia. I will speak to some of the major issues that I see arising in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I respect the fact that approximately a year ago now the then Minister for Communications announced the packages of actual reform. I think this is the last of those packages to come before the Parliament. The important fact about the legislation is that it sets up Austel. Austel will be the manager so far as Telecom Australia, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission of Australia (OTC) and Aussat Pty Ltd are concerned. Naturally all of us are interested to see how the legislation performs in relation to the administration of these three great organisations. I have great respect for Telecom Australia and Australia Post, but particularly for Telecom. Telecom is a very specialised organisation. Over the years it has, as best it could, kept abreast of the technological changes in this country, in fact throughout the world. This has been to the benefit of those people who consistently use a telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say a few words about the use of telephones and their costing. The fact is that telephone services are very important for industry and commerce throughout this country. This is particularly so for those people who live in their own homes. It is a way of life. It is something that we expect. Maybe we should not expect it as much as we do. We should take more interest than we do in communication. I am sure that as the years progress we will become more and more concerned about our telecommunication services. I will not speak about OTC and Aussat. They provide a service which we hope will continue to be supplied over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me a little that the legislation before the House is virtually putting into practice a system that the Government hopes will remain. It has undoubtedly conferred with the appropriate unions. Even though the Government may be defeated at the next election, it hopes that this will be the platform upon which telecommunications and postal services, particularly Aussat and OTC, will be based. Telecom and Australia Post have a tremendous monopoly on our Australian way of life. As such, we appreciate that they are now to pay tax. They will have to be able to show sufficient profit to be able to meet their capital expenditure, which will be very great. They will have to show sufficient profit to be able to pay their tax and maybe to pay something back to the Commonwealth. We certainly cannot expect the rates to be reduced, let alone stay as they are at present. We can only expect that in the following months and years we will see an increase in general charges for both telephone calls and posting mail. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking of cross-subsidisation, which I know the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) expects me to say something about, members of the National Party of Australia, like Government members representing country areas in Australia, are very concerned that cross-subsidisation remain. As a Government member has said, Telecom and Australia Post must show profits so that they can cross-subsidise. It is so important that the people who have ventured into the outback and into the country areas generally have a service that is economical to them and that there is a basic equality in services and costs. First of all, the service has to be there. They must have an appropriate service to cater for their demands. I pay credit to Telecom for the service it is providing. In my area I am always treated courteously by the regional officers concerned. There are three offices involved-the Kempsey office, the Maitland office and the Mayfield office. I receive the same courtesy from the Australia Post officers. But we expect this because we are very dependent on this service. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now raise a few matters that concern me. The first is public telephones. I do not want a situation to exist whereby a public phone is removed because it does not take a certain amount. At the moment there is a minimum of, I think, $3,000 for a telephone. These public telephones provide a tremendous service to people in small villages and country areas. Although perhaps 75 per cent of the citizens who reside in those areas have telephone connections, having the public telephones is terribly important to them. Tourism is growing. There are more people moving about the countryside today in vehicles. If an accident or a breakdown of some kind occurs it is so important to get to a telephone. If a private telephone breaks down in a community, it is important that there be a public phone to dial from. If removal of a public telephone is threatened, constituents should tell their local member about it. If he is a practical person and if he knows that it is not a paying phone, he can talk to the people concerned and maybe overcome the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> This also applies to our postal boxes. I recently asked for a postal box for a local village, and was refused. It is a growing community along the seaside. Many aged people live there. Forty letters a day have to be posted to make it economical to have a post box. I know that the post box can rust, but surely the materials used can be improved. Australia Post has a commercial charter, which is an important factor. I do not take Australia Post to task for that. Basically, the user pays principle can exist. But in certain cases cross-subsidisation is necessary to help people, industry and commerce located out of the metropolitan areas. I am pleased that the Minister has recognised this in the legislation. She may be assured of the strong support of, particularly, the National Party of Australia. We shall keep our eyes very closely on this because it is very important indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The availability of emergency telephones on many of the major roads throughout the State of New South Wales was raised with me the other day. At Tea Gardens in my electorate there is a Dr Pacey and he and the local Lions Club have erected and paid for the upkeep of a telephone beside the Pacific Highway. Of course, vandals have destroyed it but those people have replaced it. In fact, they have asked me to open the new telephone installation and we will have a ceremony. It is so important that these phones be there to cater for the needs at times. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the requirement of people in remote areas. There is now more to centralisation in our rural communities. People are subdividing land in some of the remote areas of our shires where they are able to do so and when it is approved by local government bodies. The people there want a telephone. I know that it costs Telecom $70,000, $80,000 and even more to provide that service. But in the not too distant future the facility has to be there to provide a service to these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The timing of local phone calls has been spoken of before in this debate. It is a vital issue for the aged people within the community. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has already announced that there will be no timing of local phone calls. For goodness sake, keep it that way. Telephones overcome loneliness for many people living on their own. They should have that service available to talk to their friends and relatives. I believe that it should be a policy that phone calls within any telephone district are on a local charge basis. I would even go beyond that. There may be particular reasons for including in a community of interest people 10, 20 or 30 kilometres outside the boundary. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also say to the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support that she might look at the fact that telephone accounts now go out every two months. There is some objection, principally from people who go away on holidays, to the fact that those accounts must be paid within 14 days. If people are away from home and their telephone account arrives-they may be overseas, interstate or even in hospital-and there is no-one there to pay the account, there should be some discretion so that these people, especially the aged, do not have to worry about their telephone being cut off. I refer also to the need to pay a security deposit. I am not opposed to this, but I am aware of a couple of instances of late where the Credit Rating Authority (CRA), to which Telecom refers all its applications, has been a little tough. I think the Minister should look at this situation and be a little more lenient in respect of policy. I often find that there might have been a trivial problem in the past and, as a result, a person must pay a security deposit. However, that person may not have the money to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up the situation, we will certainly watch the operation of the legislation so far as cross-subsidies and the services available are concerned. We hope that Telecom, Australia Post, OTC and Aussat will be able to keep abreast of the technological changes of the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been an incredible debate on what is most complex and very important legislation, that is, the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill and associated Bills. Some honourable members have noted that it is the most important telecommunications legislation to come before the House since the breakup of the Postmaster-General's Department in 1975 when we saw the creation of Telecom Australia and Australia Post. I agree with that. Basically, it provides for Telecom and Australia Post to become corporations. This substantial legislation also introduces Austel, the regulatory telecommunications authority. Of course, the legislation points out the responsibilities and obligations of Austel in rather lengthy fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has been an incredible debate. We saw the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) come into the House and present the coalition response. On a day when we have a new coalition team, we thought that we would have a new coalition policy. We cannot be that lucky. The honourable member for Gilmore cannot be blamed-he was thrown into it. He presented a speech which I assumed would be presented by the new Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt). I found it quite incredible that the honourable member for Gilmore, as a member of the National Party, said basically three things: he wanted less regulation, more competition and more private networks to compete against Telecom. They were his words; they were the things he talked about. Yet later in the debate the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) said that he wants more regulation. He said, `We cannot have all this deregulating nonsense. We want more regulation. Let us hear no more about putting taxes on Telecom and the authorities. We are paying $60 for certain connections. We do not want any of this deregulation nonsense. We will not go on with that when we are in government'. The honourable member had not spoken to the honourable member for Gilmore, who delivered the coalition response. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) made a very good contribution to the debate. Basically, he supported the honourable member for Maranoa. Indeed, the parties are at various points of the spectrum: the Liberal Party of Australia's response is at one extreme end of the spectrum and the Government is somewhere in the middle bringing these policies together. The National Party response is much closer to that of the Government. Indeed, the National Party has absolutely nothing in common on some major issues-and this is one of them-with its so-called coalition partner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member interjects, but I point out that there is a certain cohesion on this side where we are at least swimming in the right direction. Some members opposite are going out one door and others are going in the opposite direction out the other door. However, all members opposite will go out the same door at the next election. If a disaster occurred and the coalition won government, I would love to be a fly on the wall when it tried to implement telecommunications policy through Cabinet-it could never do it. The deregulators and privatisers in the Liberal Party would never be allowed to get to first base, and that is quite right, too. In that situation we would agree with what most National Party members would say. The Liberal Party goes on with a lot of nonsense, wanting to privatise this and privatise that and deregulate everything that moves. Of course, the Liberal Party has forgotten that in most instances to do that it would have to pass legislation through this Parliament. It has not caught on to the fact that it would not be able to do that. It would then probably try to wrap it up in a Budget statement, but we would not fall for that and nor would many people in the other House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be listening in my retirement. Honourable members opposite have no hope of doing that. But that will not be for a very long time and the honourable member will not be here either, because his Party will not be in government for a very long time. The honourable member need not worry that the new face on his Party will change anything because the people of Australia will see through the retread very quickly and it will be back to the old team trudging along going nowhere very smartly. The parties opposite are supposed to be a cohesive coalition, but it was interesting to hear their members presenting two different policies to the House in the one debate. I felt a bit sorry for the honourable member for Gilmore because it was obvious that he was given a speech to deliver that was not his. In a sense, he was trying to put the best face on it for the coalition. That speech, whomever it belonged to, was totally in contrast to that of the honourable member for Lyne and in particular the honourable member for Maranoa. Where are the deregulators of the Liberal Party? We have not seen many of them tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, this legislation is very important in that it deals with the responsibilities of Austel, the new regulatory authority. It provides for the incorporation of Telecom and Australia Post and, in particular, as the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) alluded to in his speech, the freeing up of government business enterprises. I can talk a little about that because I was one on this side of the House who went through great torture and numerous meetings over a number of years in asking members of this Government to deregulate to some extent to allow government enterprises to compete more freely in certain areas. Many members on both sides of the House could not grasp that until we started to talk more freely about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The body most opposed to it was, if I can say so quite openly, the Department of Finance, which wanted to have its sticky little claws on everything. Indeed at one stage I remember saying, `If you really want your sticky little claws on everything, why don't you be fair dinkum and just say so because we will abolish Telecom and Australia Post and take it back into the Postmaster-General's Department, if you want it to be a department again'. However, it did not want that so I said, `If you do not want it to be a department again, for heaven's sake let the government enterprises compete and do not strangle them with red tape'. </PARA>
<PARA> That formed the basis of long discussions that started several years ago which led to the introduction of this legislation. We have decided to restructure Telecom along the more modern lines of the Federal Airports Corporation, with an appropriate board. The new financial structure will include a number of things. It will include the conversion of 25 per cent of Commonwealth loans to equity. That totals around $4 1/2 billion as at 30 June 1987. Remaining Commonwealth loans will be progressively retired over the next 10 years and replaced as appropriate by private sector borrowing. Telecom subsidiaries and joint ventures will be subject to all taxes. Telecom will be liable to meet State payroll taxes from 1 July. It will become liable for other State and local government taxes and charges from 1 July 1989 and for income tax from the 1990-91 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> We also see the removal of day-to-day controls. These are probably more important. There is a whole list of them, but I will just mention a couple. Telecom will no longer be required to obtain approval from the Treasurer for the terms and conditions of individual borrowings. Telecom will be free to enter into banking arrangements and to make investments without gaining approval from the Treasurer. The requirement that Telecom obtain ministerial approval to enter into contracts will be removed. Telecom will no longer be required to comply with the Lands Acquisition Act except in certain circumstances, and so forth. Those provisions apply similarly to Australia Post. Telecom and Australia Post, the two major corporations, as they will be when this legislation goes through the House, will be freed from many day-to-day controls. Many people did not realise that virtually every time they wanted to sneeze they had to get permission from the Treasurer, the Department of Finance, the Minister for Administrative Services or someone else, depending on what they were doing. Of course, that is absolute nonsense, and the costs and inefficiencies involved are just ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not mean that we are going down the track of privatisation of those major corporations. In fact, our philosophical belief is exactly opposite. The honourable member for Gilmore, on behalf of the coalition, said that he wanted less regulation and more competition for Telecom, which means that Telecom's profits will be sliced. If they are sliced it will not have as much money to put back into capital reinvestment for the network. If it wants to keep its profits up so that it can reinvest in capital expansion, what it will then have to do, if it keeps the cross-subsidy, is lift charges across the board, particularly in the metropolitan area. Urban people will be happy about that. </PARA>
<PARA> If it keeps the cross-subsidy, which is worth about $500m a year now, the alternative to hitting the city people, as the honourable member for Maranoa pointed out, is to lift charges in the rural sector. In other words, the Opposition says, `Let us take the free market approach. It costs $2,000 to put that connection in to that property yonder. We had better charge that person $2,000 or something near it'. That is what it means. That is why the National Party has never bought this privatisation and deregulation of the whole telecommunications system; it never has and it never will. I agree with it. It is nonsense to ask people, just because they live on a bush block or have a property, to pay the real cost of a telephone. That is not on, but that is what the so-called privatisers in the Liberal Party mean. That is their free market attitude. They say that it will all shake out. It will all shake out, all right. Either half the people in rural areas will not have a phone or they will pay about three times more in phone charges than they do now. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Communications, the present Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy), came into the House a couple of years ago at Question Time and, in answer to a question, outlined the cross-subsidies for most rural seats. Funnily enough, the highest figure was in the area covered by the seat of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)-in excess of $500 per person per year. We do not quibble about that; that is there as a deliberate policy. What we are doing tonight, though, is a whole range of things in relation to Australia Post and Telecom. On the one hand, we are freeing them from day-to-day constraints-I have mentioned a few of them-and, on the other hand, we are allowing them to compete more effectively, be more efficient and carry out the community service obligations that they should provide. It is not just a money making concern, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, pointed out in your speech. They have certain obligations and responsibilities to the people of Australia. I am quite sure they will always be obliged to carry them out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications Bill is a very important and very substantial piece of legislation. Indeed, the Bill enshrines certain obligations and rights of some of the corporations such as Telecom, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and Aussat. For example, clause 37 (2), in part, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Telecom has the exclusive right to install, maintain and operate networks to supply public switched telephone services between places within Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 47 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA>Telecom has the exclusive right to supply, install and maintain the first telephone for a basic telephone service. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on in a similar vein about Aussat and OTC, stating quite clearly what their exclusive rights in certain areas are, and what their obligations are. Therefore, as one can see, it is a very important piece of legislation. If someone wanted to go into competition with any of those organisations in those areas, he would have to unscramble this fairly monumental piece of legislation before he did so, because those corporations have the exclusive right and obligation to do certain things and provide certain services to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a very interesting debate. This is a very important piece of legislation. I am pleased that we are having a rather long debate. I am sure there will be another long debate in another place. I sincerely hope that this legislation is passed without amendment by both Houses. We on this side of the House have taken a long time to get it to this stage. We hope that it is perfect. Nothing usually is. We hope that it is right to look at the needs and concerns of the telecommunications system in Australia both today and in the future. </PARA>

We are dealing with legislation which covers a wide spectrum of communications in the field of telephone services and Australia Post. But the particular issue before the House really relates to the operations of Telecom Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the Government members earlier this evening cited the figure 10, and I took his word for it. I hope, if that was an exaggeration, that much of the other content of the debate has not been similarly exaggerated. What I want to say is that the brief recent history of the changes that have occurred in the administration of Australia's telecommunications system shows that on the one hand there is a positive move to try to modernise, to improve the nature of the management, to improve the effectiveness of that management, and at the same time on the other hand, to try to accommodate very significant government decisions since the present Government came to office. I refer to the decision to introduce the duty charges on Telecom equipment, the consequences of what in fact is an enormous tax revenue take from the operations of Telecom. This enormous revenue take introduced by the present Government-I hope the Minister will take notice of this as the new Minister-resulted at once in a very substantial increase in telephone charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following that, we are told in this debate that there will be the introduction of a new system of financing of the provision of loan funds and there will be further provision for taxation at different levels. It was said that in order to cover this there will have to be an improvement in the capacity of Telecom to meet its commitments. In other words, it will be obliged to provide for the Government an enormous source of revenue. One wonders how that can be achieved while at the same time maintaining a reasonable cost level for the users of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The assertion that on this side of the House there is some degree of confusion between the issue of privatisation and the principle of cross-subsidisation and the provision of services, dwarfs into insignificance when we look at the lack of real detail that has been put to this Parliament by the Government in explaining the legislation. I remind the House that about a year ago an announcement was made that the management of Telecom would be restructured, and we have seen that gradually implemented. There is a metropolitan division and a country division, and then a breakup of those divisions in various regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have found a move in my electorate, which has now in fact been carried out, to amalgamate telephone districts on the ground that this would be an economic move. But we find that it is almost a move back to the old era, about 15 years ago, when area management was introduced, simply because it was recognised that the enormity of the business was such that if we had management merely from each of the capital cities, with long lines of communication in the administration of the various sectors of the Telecom operation, it was cumbersome, it was costly and it was not really an effective way of doing the job. So area management was introduced and districts were designed to create a reasonably manageable structure. In recent times those districts have been obliged to show their capacity in terms of profitability, in terms of the utilisation of the resources at their disposal and, of course, the business throughput, meaning the numbers of telephones, the revenue and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The curious thing is that we now have a situation where it is mere geography rather than the actual facts of what has been done; we see a withdrawal of people in, say, the engineering field to cover a bigger territory. We find that there have been changes throughout most of New South Wales, and no doubt in Queensland, because I have heard my colleagues refer to those changes. I do not think we have had a satisfactory explanation of the result of this move. I believe that there is a disadvantage, and there might even be an increase in the cost factors because of the nature and the way in which these changes have been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Minister to have a very close look at this, as a new Minister responsible in this matter. I say that, recognising that the legislation really passes the responsibility from the Government over to another jurisdiction. It might be too late at that stage, because one of the significant requirements is that the new organisation will administer the regulatory requirements, but it will not regulate. I do not quite know how that stage can be reached without causing enormous complexity. Does that mean that no-one has the responsibility in the end? I ask the Minister to have a close look at it before it is too late. On the question of the policies of the Opposition and the Government, I must say that I have been most impressed with contributions made by most of those who have spoken in this debate, except for the honourable member for Isaacs, who got just a little bit heated, somewhat unnecessarily, because there has been something of a bipartisan approach on this issue for a long time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But of course the Minister wants to assert that it is otherwise. I think that that is unnecessary political intrusion at a time when there is apparently a desire on both sides of the House to try to be objective in this important matter. My own firm conviction is that we must preserve at all costs the service aspect. It concerns me that recent decisions have seen a trend away from providing services, not altogether ignoring the cost, but with some of the expensive connections being part of the mix with those that are less expensive. In the last year we have had introduced the requirement that there be a charge for a rural installation, where the line is 300 metres beyond the roadway. That charge can be a very substantial one, certainly often well beyond what an ordinary householder can afford, if we can call them householders, and I think we can. I refer to people who have taken a small block of land and built a modest home on it, where they are not in a circumstance where there is not any income from that particular piece of land and where the family occupying the house earns only a low income. Yet we find that there is a very hefty charge. It has been put to me that we must equate this with what is charged by other authorities, such as the electricity commission, or the council if roadways are required. There certainly are matters that do not equate on simple premises of that kind. The truth is that these charges have been introduced at the same time as the present Government implemented a tax revenue take of, I think, $500m-and that figure is rising annually.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at where the whole matter of deregulation, cross-subsidisation and so on really rests. It comes down to the practicalities of what is required to provide service to the community in an Australian situation. This means recognising that Australia has vast distances, particularly in the larger States and the regions where distance is inescapable. It is a sharp contrast to the metropolitan areas where there is a bonanza for this kind of business-the provision of telephone services and all the ancillary services that can be provided for business, commerce and industry. The revenue take from those charges is an enormous contribution to the overall operation of the telephone system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned for the average householder. Since the decision was made that the first telephone will be provided and serviced but anything beyond that will be at the cost of the subscriber, I have been worried about what that will really mean. Let us not get down to this question of deregulation and competition; let us get down to what is actually happening. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not unusual these days for people to require an extension telephone. It might be that for the well-being of an elderly person an extension to a bedroom is an absolute necessity. The Government espouses policies of keeping people at home in their old age for as long as possible, keeping them out of homes for the aged as long as possible and trying to maintain a more economic approach to the care of the aged. What do we have now? We have a circumstance where an extension telephone is charged for on a capital basis. It could cost up to $200 for an extension telephone. If something goes wrong with it, a charge is made because it is beyond the first telephone and the first point of connection. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Government should clear up these issues fairly quickly, before this legislation takes effect to the point where it is merely a regulatory proposition and no-one is too sure who has the responsibility. It will be found that there is someone there ready to impose a charge. In other words, the principle of `user pays' will apply. Never mind who the user is. If it is an average householder in an Australian community, then that is an imposition. It is an imposition which is the responsibility of the Government now in office. </PARA>
<PARA> It ill behoves the honourable member for Isaacs to come in here and talk about different attitudes on this side of the House. Let us look at the reality of what the Government has done thus far on this and so many other aspects of the provision of this important service: telecommunications, telephones and all that is embodied in that very important element of the needs of our community. My colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) and others referred to public telephones and the problems associated with ensuring an adequate coverage of public telephones, particularly in locations where there is an accident-prone roadway or a traffic situation which creates an accident-prone location and it is a concern of the community that there must be telephones. Some authorities, certainly in New South Wales, have assisted. The Department of Main Roads has borne the cost of providing emergency telephone services on many major road systems. That is fair enough, but it cannot be expected to do that over the road network of every community. Telecom Australia has provided the lines and it has the responsibility for providing the service. I think it is essential that there should be a recognition of community need for the provision of public telephones. By that I do not mean that capital funds should be thrown around unnecessarily, it is a question of a determination of need and of ensuring that the responsibilities are recognised. </PARA>
<PARA> Major issues in the legislation still need to be resolved by the Government. It should make clear statements about what is being done. There are also very major issues as to the real input of the legislation, not only in this area, but in other areas under the several Bills which are before us to which other speakers in this debate have referred this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like, firstly, to comment on the contribution from the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson). I found some of it quite meritorious, certainly in terms of his concern for the delivery of service to people in remote areas. However, I would just like to make one comment on his statements in relation to the contribution of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles). I did not think that the honourable member for Isaacs was at all heated. I think he was acknowledging and pointing out the confusion and the difference within the coalition over the area of cross-subsidisation and privatisation which was also readily acknowledged by the honourable member for Page.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it is stretching a point too far to say that this is another indication of the chasm that exists between sections of the coalition. I do not want to dwell on that particular issue because I want to point out some major positive attributes of this legislation, particularly in relation to community service obligations because they are of particular importance to my own electorate in the Northern Territory. I note that the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), has been at the table. I am sure that he supports the idea of cross-subsidisation and that he would oppose the privatisation of telecommunications services in the Northern Territory. I will explain to him if he cares to listen at some later stage during my address why he should do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to detail some aspects of the Telecommunications Act in relation to the community service obligations of Telecom Australia. I remind the House that the Telecommunications Act established Telecom in 1975 with functions which primarily were `to plan, establish, maintain and operate telecommunications services within Australia'. It imposed a duty, as amended in 1988, that:</PARA>
<PARA>The functions of the Corporation shall be performed in such a manner as will best meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of Australian people for telecommunications services and its telecommunications services shall, so far as it is in the opinion of the Board reasonably practicable to do so, be made available throughout Australia for people who reasonably require those services. </PARA>
<PARA>The functions and duty in the Telecommunications Act 1975 left to the Commission the task of deciding what types of telecommunications service would be provided nationally, who would receive them and at what cost. Similarly, the Postal Services Act 1975 established Australia Post with functions mainly `to operate postal services for the transmission of postal articles within Australia, between Australia, and places outside Australia'. The duties of Australia Post were similar to those of Telecom substituting `postal' for `telecommunications'. Again, it was left to the Commission to decide what level of postal services would be provided and to whom. In 1975 this was seen by the Government to be an appropriate and adequate arrangement. Telecom was involved mainly as an engineering organisation, in building the national communications infrastructure. I am sorry to see the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs leaving the chamber because I did want him to hear what I had to say about cross-subsidisation in the Northern Territory. It is something that he would do well to learn. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 only 65 per cent of houses in Australia had telephone connections, compared with 92 per cent in 1989-the highest in the world. Australia Post had to establish itself as an efficient organisation, able to stand on its own feet after many years of being cross-subsidised by the telecommunications business of the then Postmaster-General's Department. Australia Post is now one of the few postal organisations in the world to make a profit. In 1989 the communications industry is a major part of the national economy. Telecom provides the national infrastructure for the information industry and is a full and competing player in the communications industry. It is simply not appropriate now for Telecom to be both competitor and regulator in this industry. I note the comments of the honourable member for Page on this particular aspect. The package of legislation is designed to remedy this position. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a wider reason to bring in the reforms encompassed in this reforming legislation. It is not appropriate now for government to have little, if any, say in just what it expects of government's communications business enterprises. It is an essential part of the Government's wider micro-economic reform program that all business, private and public, is able to operate on an equal footing and compete equally for the country's resources. `Levelling the playing field' may be an overdone catchphrase but it neatly encapsulates the program of reform now in progress. In this exercise it is important that government business enterprises (GBEs) know exactly where they stand and what obligations the Government will impose so that they can properly operate as fully competitive players in the communications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills establish measures which put the boards in the position of having a clear charter of action set by the Government which the Government can use to measure performance. This arrangement will not be secret. It places the GBEs in a similar position to that of any commercial organisation which is able to get on with its business and is responsible to the shareholder for performance. The charter of the GBEs will be set through the corporate plan. Detailed provisions are in the Bills showing the matters which have to be considered and included by the board in those corporate plans. These matters include the objectives of the GBE and its subsidiaries and the way the objectives are to be achieved with, importantly, a specific statement of the way the GBE is to carry out its community service obligation (CSO). </PARA>
<PARA> The GBEs have three obligations: firstly, to operate commercially. Only by embracing this obligation can the Government be sure that the GBE is performing efficiently. Commercial operation carries its own measures which can be defined, such as rates of return, dividend payments and productivity improvement. However, bottom line performance is not all and the objective to meet social needs is recognised by the establishment of formal community service obligations. These will be determined through consultation between the Minister and his or her colleagues, as appropriate, and the GBE in the corporate planning process. For the first time the Government will sit down with the GBE and decide just what is the appropriate level of service that has to be provided to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For Telecom, the Bill defines the community service obligation as the supply of a standard telephone service through the public switched network, meaning a voice service, as efficiently and economically as possible, reasonably accessible to all on an equitable basis and meeting reasonable standards of performance. From this definition there is considerable work to do in deciding what is a standard telephone service, what is the measure of `efficiently' and `economically', what is meant by `reasonably accessible' and what are the appropriate standards of performance. The Government's telecommunications policy announced on 25 May 1988 reaffirmed the Government's decision to continue cross-subsidisation much of the rural and remote sectors. Under that policy, the Government required Telecom to continue to meet its obligations to provide and maintain services as efficiently and economically as possible to rural and remote areas through cross-subsidisation from more profitable services elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of legislation implements this policy commitment. I make now comment which I think the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs would do well to listen to. In commenting on the confusion and disarray within the Opposition ranks in relation to the issues of cross-subsidisation and privatisation, it is important that the National Party spokesman has pointed out his experience of the continuation of cross-subsidisation. I say that as the member for the Northern Territory in common with the people in the National Party of Australia who are concerned about cross-subsidisation. The Government, I remind the House, has more rural members than any other party in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate the effect of the cross-subsidisation policy, I will compare the costs and profits of services in New South Wales metropolitan areas with those of the Northern Territory. The cost of a service in the metropolitan area of New South Wales is $638. The expense per service in the Northern Territory is $2,291. The revenue for service in the Northern Territory is $1,553. For a metropolitan service in New South Wales it is $908. But the important aspect is the profit. This is the point of which the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and, indeed, the Opposition spokesman ought to be conscious when they talk about privatisation and cross-subsidisation. In the New South Wales metropolitan area the profit per service is $270. But there is no profit for service in the Northern Territory. There is a cost per service of $738 which is borne out of budget by Telecom. There is an important service which is being provided by Telecom in the Northern Territory which, I hasten to add, the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs ought to be conscious of when debating the issue of cross-subsidisation and privatisation and when talking within his own caucus about the provision of telecommunication services in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has instituted the rural and remote area program (RRAP). It is providing national infrastructure which will satisfy in a cost effective manner current and future needs of business and residential customers in Northern Australia. The RRAP program, in particular, is connecting 7,890 people in 21 remote Northern Territory communities to telecommunication services. They are very diverse communities. They are spread right throughout the Northern Territory. What is significant about them is that they are all Aboriginal communities. They are as far apart as Areyonga in Central Australia and Galiwinku, which is an island off the northern tip of Arnhem Land. They include also Gapuwiyak, Haasts Bluff, Hodgson Downs, Numbulwar, Papunya, Victoria River Downs, Warruwi and Yuendumu. These communities have populations which vary roughly from 150 to 200 people to in excess of 1,000 to 1,200 people. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, 3,003 people in six of the communities have now been served. It is certainly the desire of this Government to expedite the provision of those services. Thirteen of the major digital radio concentrator systems or routes being provided under the RRAP program in the Northern Territory have now been completed. The program is due for completion in 1992 in spite of the fact that the estimated cost of RRAP in the Northern Territory increased largely due to Telecom's plan to provide more and, I might say, higher levels of telecommunications infrastructure and services, the rise in transmission equipment costs and, of course, normal cost escalations. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is investigating cost effectiveness of satellite and terrestrial technologies for remote areas. The factors to be considered include the ongoing cost of operating the services as well as the initial provision. In the case of a satellite component, costs include charges in respect of transponder costs which are levied on a fully commercial basis. This is a major innovation in terms of the provision of remote area telecommunication services in this country. I reiterate that, if it were not for this Government's concern for cross-subsidisation and, indeed, for Telecom's concern to maintain its obligations in areas of cross-subsidisation, these services would not be provided. For the information of the Opposition and, in particular, for the Opposition shadow spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, they are being provided for Aboriginal communities throughout Northern Australia. They are provided not only to Aboriginal communities but in this instance the services are particularly for Aboriginal communities. As we all know, in normal circumstances Aborigines are the people most disadvantaged in terms of delivery of services. It is important, therefore, to acknowledge that this is a major step forward in the provision of services for those communities. </PARA>
<PARA> I might point out that the estimated cost of the provision of a new modular service to provide modernised services for these regions is in the vicinity of $44,000. That is in stark contrast to the cost of the installation of a service in the metropolitan areas of New South Wales-to which matter I have referred previously. For Australia Post the community service obligation is defined as being the supply of a letter service carried by physical means-and this does not cover electronic mail-at a single rate of postage, by ordinary post of letters that are standard postal articles. This service is to be reasonably accessible on a equitable basis and it must meet performance standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I am conscious of the time limits on this debate and I am hurrying to wind up. I point out that there is a third obligation on Australia Post and Telecom, namely, to meet the general governmental obligations that are notified to them from time to time. It has been recognised that both these business enterprises are owned by the Government, which has high standards to maintain in its dealings with the public and other government. At times this will mean that additional constraints will be placed on those government business enterprises which will impinge on their ability to act in a totally commercial manner. The costs of meeting these obligations are also to be taken into account either through the financial target or through direct reimbursement. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bills to the House. I point out again that I think that the honourable member for Isaacs quite adequately and appropriately pointed out the division which exists within the Opposition ranks. Contrary to the view put by the honourable member for Page, I do not think his contribution was at all heated. I think he demonstrated the stark contrast in attitudes which exists between those members of the Opposition who are concerned with the provision of services for people in remote areas and those people who come from the north shore of Sydney or the south side of the Yarra and who have no conception at all of the cost of providing remote area services to the people who live in northern Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before making some specific comments, particularly on the contributions that were made to the debate by members of the Opposition, I would like to express my thanks to all members from both sides of the House for their contributions. I must say that people listening to this debate may well have thought that the National Party speakers were actually more gung-ho in their support for this legislation than the members of the Government. All the contributions have been particularly useful. I am faced with something of a dilemma in responding to the position put by the Opposition, because in this debate tonight we have heard two Opposition policies. We have had what was outlined by the Opposition as its official policy from the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), but I suspect that the honourable member for Gilmore did not have his heart totally in some of the comments that he was making about this legislation, particularly when he was referring to aspects of deregulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have discussed these Bills-the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill and cognate Bills-with the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Lewis, and he has told me that it is the view of the Opposition that the legislation does not go far enough, that there is not sufficient deregulation in these Bills, particularly in relation to the Bill to establish Telecom Australia as a corporation. However, from listening to National Party members speak-in fact, all but one speaker were from the National Party-it was apparent that many of them felt that the community service obligation should be preserved and that therefore the Telecom monopoly should be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, I would think that those honourable members want us to go a lot further in preserving that monopoly. That was reflected particularly in the speeches that were made by the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan). National Party members made a strong request for more cross-subsidisation in relation to their country electorates. It is quite legitimate for National Party members to call for cross-subsidisation. They want more cross-subsidisation, more public telephones and more postal boxes. They want better services for the people of Birdsville. They want more charges to be based on local charge rates, they want better services for their country electorates and they want connection fees to be a lot cheaper. But how can all that be done if there is deregulation? The truth of the matter is that it cannot be done. I understand that official Opposition policy supports deregulation, although, as I said, that is not reflected in this debate tonight. If there is deregulation, how can honourable members opposite expect a service to be provided in places like Birdsville? The bottom line is that that just will not happen. Tonight we have seen here no Opposition policy. We have a phoney policy, as the honourable member for Chifley said: or we have two policies, as the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) said. What is the Opposition's policy on telecommunications? Frankly, we can see no unity on that at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to commend the honourable member for Gilmore for his response at very short notice. I appreciate that there have been a few other diversions in the Opposition ranks today. It was difficult, I know, for the honourable member for Gilmore to put forward this theme of deregulation. In the legislation before the House today, we have attempted to get the balance right. The Opposition has no comprehension of what that balance is. Before I get into this issue, I want to take up a point about the consultation that has gone on. The honourable member for Gilmore criticised us early in his comments for not giving the Opposition more notice. The Telecommunications Bill has been subject to a far more extensive public consultation process than most Bills which come before the Parliament. In particular, the Government took the extraordinary step of circulating a draft Bill for public comment in the second week of April. In addition, there have been numerous public conferences and seminars on the legislation. The telecommunications industry has widely and publicly commended the Government for its open and consultative process on this legislation. It is absurd to say that the Government's legislative intentions have not been on the table for an adequate period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the response from industry and the unions is that we have the balance right. I understand that they are anxious for the legislation to go through without amendment so that Austel, the Australian Telecommunications Authority, can start up on 1 July. In terms of why the legislation is necessary, we need to consider the balance. The fundamental objection of the Opposition is that the balance is not right. However, the legislation has been very carefully framed so as to balance the requirement to safeguard the carrier's basic monopolies, which is exactly what the National Party was talking about, against our commitment to promote competition in the non-reserve services on a fair and equitable basis. Again, the Liberal Party's view is that we should have a bit more of that. Obviously, the balance is designed to promote vigorous growth in the telecommunications sector, while ensuring that the Government's social goals continue to be met. </PARA>
<PARA> The retention of a monopoly in reserve services ensures this provision of the universal service, again through cross-subsidies. The Australian community has made it very clear, as reflected in the National Party's contribution, that Government must maintain its commitment to universal service. The Government will not threaten this commitment by adopting measures that would undermine the cross-subsidy funding mechanisms. The legislation recognises the need to secure the orderly and efficient development of the basic network by enabling fullest exploitation of the efficiencies arising from economies of size and scope and by avoiding costly and uneconomic duplication of facilities. Another major objective in having this monopoly is to avoid wasting a lot of community money in providing a number of expensive infrastructures throughout this wide country. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond these essential safeguards, the Government has initiated major regulatory reforms which recognise a need to liberalise what is becoming one of the fastest growing sectors in the Australian economy. The Bill states unequivocally that value added services will be opened to full competition. This is obviously a major reform. As the honourable member for Isaacs said, it is one of the things for which many of us have been pushing for a long time. Again, we have to get the balance right to ensure that those country interests are safeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy on private networks clearly ensures that they do not impinge upon the monopoly services. However, the Opposition, through the honourable member for Gilmore, has stated explicitly that it recognises and endorses the need to safeguard these carriers, but it says, `Let us free up, let us deregulate all these private networks'. How do we get the right balance? Once we started to deregulate we might erode the basic network that is required to provide community service to isolated parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The three areas mentioned by the Opposition-Telecom's first phone monopoly, the mobile phones and the private network policy-have been explicitly targeted for review in this legislation. We are at the forefront of this development and, as usual, the Opposition is behind. The honourable member for Gilmore stated the Opposition's view, which is well behind ours. The National Party is about 20 miles behind us. It is important to keep the balance. Getting the structure right, getting the playing field level, is important so that we can have competition at the same time as ensuring that the important community service obligation is fulfilled. The community service obligation is defined in both the Australian Telecommunications Corporation Bill and the Australian Postal Corporation Bill. As this is the subject of a proposed amendment, we can talk about it later. </PARA>
<PARA> I now go on to the other area where there is a difference between the National Party and the Liberal Party: the contribution government business enterprises (GBEs) should make to the economy and whether they should pay taxes. Many reservations were expressed by members of the National Party about the fact that Telecom in particular will have to pay certain taxes. The question always is: Will those taxes be passed on to the consumer? The important thing about this is a factor that was not taken into consideration by many Opposition speakers: the price cap. We can ensure that these taxes will not be passed on in price increases because the Government provides for a price cap in this legislation. The price cap will be set by the Government at the consumer price index minus X. That means that the cost of a telephone to the ordinary consumer will decrease in real terms despite the fact that Telecom, along with other government business enterprises, will be put on a business footing. Consumers will see a decline in real terms in the price. </PARA>
<PARA> How can we do that? We can do that only by a cross-subsidisation process and by getting Telecom-the focus of attention in this debate-out there competing in the marketplace. We will retain its reserved functions and give it a right to operate in those areas. In the value added areas it can compete in a fair way against the private sector. So it is important that the balance in the legislation be right. It is right, particularly in the area of taxes. It is important that Telecom compete on an equal footing with other sectors of the communication industry. Only in this way can we ensure that Telecom operates effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that Telecom should meet the tax liability that is met by its direct competitors and by other commercial enterprises competing for capital, labour and material inputs within the economy. The taxes being paid by Telecom do not disappear. They are used by government to provide services to all Australians, even, believe it or not, to rural Australia. In this sense it is no different to taxing motorists or beer drinkers. Again, it is important to note that we have got the balance right by insisting that government business enterprises compete on an equal footing and make a contribution. We are preserving the interests of all Australians by keeping the price cap on. I think that the price cap is a factor that did not receive very much attention at all from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some specific points that were raised, particularly by the honourable member for Gilmore, to which he asked me to respond. They are covered in some of the amendments but it might be appropriate for me to cover them now and, by doing so, reduce the time taken for debate on some of the amendments. Firstly, the honourable member is very concerned about the question of immunity from suit. He is concerned about the clauses which grant Telecom, Australia Post and Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) a limited immunity from suit. There is no such immunity provided for Aussat, although Opposition members seem to think that there is. The proposed immunity provisions are more limited than those in the Act at present for Telecom, OTC and Australia Post. They will now apply only in relation to the reserved services, not to competitive areas. Again, I think that gets the balance right. In the case of Australia Post, the immunity is further limited: it will not apply where customers have obtained a receipt from Australia Post. Obviously some degree of immunity is reserved-for the GBEs and the delivery of the reserved services-otherwise they would be open to very heavy damages because of a minor fault. For example, there could be massive claims for damages because uninsured valuables are lost in the post or because a technical breakdown means that a business deal did not go through. What would that cost Telecom or Australia Post? As the immunity is proposed only in relation to reserved services, it cannot give an unfair advantage over competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> As Opposition members have commented, these GBEs will also be subject to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, even though the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) would prefer that to be eliminated. Telecom and OTC will also be subject to investigation by Austel, and this will apply to Aussat as well. The Opposition expressed concern that Austel will be taking over a consumer protection role and that this might diminish the role of the Ombudsman. It will not. Austel will have a complementary and cooperative relationship with the Ombudsman, who will still deal with the day to day consumer complaints about Telecom. But, as my honourable colleague, the member for Chifley, said where the complaints indicate a systematic difficulty of regulatory problems Austel will have the power to investigate consumer complaints and will have very strong powers to relieve those problems, including the power to direct Telecom to provide a consumer service where it has failed to do so. That is a much greater power than exists now. Currently Telecom, basically, is advocate and judge at the same time, and as some honourable members opposite have said, that is a very difficult role. Austel will have an enhanced role to deal with the general trend of consumer complaints. In fact, there will be greater control or a policing role as the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) called it, over the big giants, than existed previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member referred to a few other points. One of them was the deemed refusal application to Austel. The honourable members suggests that the provisions in the Telecommunications Bill that deem an application to be refused if it is not dealt with within 30 days should be turned around so as to deem it approved if it is not dealt with within the 30 days. The provisions are intended to encourage Austel to make its decisions quickly. When I started to look at the Bill I thought exactly the same way. The suggestion is superficially attractive, but I understand that it is just not practical. If, for some reason, a particularly difficult application to Austel could not be determined within a set time-though I think that there would be a very few of those-approval would be granted automatically. I do not think that that is practical. It has to be remembered that, basically, these are class licences. Once a licence is issued, it will have a flow-on effect on everyone else in the same class. Some of them may take some time, but I am making the assumption that all of them will be dealt with within the specified period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be watching Austel's performance very carefully too. If it cannot handle applications with due speed, I will want to know why. I think the deemed refusal approach is a much better way to go about things. Applicants can also appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There are plenty of avenues for appeal without having to change the refusal application around. Frankly, I think our proposal is a better way to go and it is probably more practical. </PARA>
<PARA> I will raise some of the other matters in specific form when the amendments are moved. I want to conclude, because I have not got very much time, by saying that basically the speech of the honourable member for Maranoa, though it was very wide-ranging, when he talked about the need for consumers to have access to local calls rates throughout his whole electorate, illustrates the real problems that we have faced in the Government with this legislation. We felt that we wanted to deliver a service to all Australians so that they could get an equal service. We wanted to have a monitoring agency to make sure that community service obligations were met. But at the same time we wanted to open the area of telecommunications up to competition. I think we have levelled the playing field in the value added services while still retaining the very important service to all Australians, at the same time guaranteeing that in real terms the cost to the consumer in the Telecom area will go down. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate all honourable members, particularly those on the Government side, who have made a big contribution over many months to getting the balance right, beginning with a statement last year from Senator Evans the then Minister for Transport and Communications. Many members of Government have made a contribution. I think we have got the balance right. That is the Government's position, the industry position and also the union position. I hope that it will also be the position of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA>I commence my remarks, as the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) did, by thanking all those on this side of the chamber who have participated in this very interesting debate, quite a deal of which I watched on the television. It was pleasing to see so many rural members participating. As many of us who live in country areas would know, the ramifications of this type of legislation have a great impact on people who live in that part of the world. I would also like to thank the Minister for her summary this evening and for taking time to answer some of the questions and the points that I raised. I know that Senator Lewis in the other place will be most anxious to deal with some of the points that the Minister has made. The Minister was not necessarily all that fair in respect of some of the things she interpreted as being of concern to Senator Lewis. Senator Lewis and the Opposition parties are principally concerned about the unnecessary regulations in this legislation. For that reason, I think some of the Minister's earlier comments are not entirely fair. I will not wander too far from the amendments because I know that time is limited. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with amendments 1 to 3 to clause 16, the side heading of which is `Functions-incidental businesses and activities'. Our amendments are designed to restrict Telecom's functions to matters relating to telecommunications. That might seem an obvious statement but is not as obvious in this legislation as we think is necessary. Telecom should provide functions solely related to telecommunications. We have no arguments with Telecom's desires to expand its activities overseas. We appreciate that in so doing it can earn valuable export income for Australia. We have some concerns about Telecom expanding its activities outside areas relating to telecommunications within Australia and using surplus funds from monopoly areas, in which it operates from a privileged position, to start up other activities not necessarily related to telecommunications and to compete, perhaps unfairly, with other competitors-private enterprise, small business and so forth. This is the detail of the particular concern that we have in respect of clause 16. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that it is important that Telecom's activities be solely restricted to those matters that relate to telecommunications. We believe that the legislation, as is currently drafted, does not adequately deal with our concern. It is for that reason that we have moved the amendments to clause 16.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to the Opposition's amendments. The Opposition proposes to move a similar amendment in respect of Australia Post and it will also be moving a few other consequential amendments based on the particular view it has about the incidental functions of the government business enterprises (GBEs). It is nonsense to suggest that either Telecom or Australia Post could run off and do whatever it wanted to in starting a new business. I think that earlier the Opposition said that one of these enterprises could go off and start a brewery. That is just total nonsense. There is no intention for these GBEs to do that. But we want them to have some flexibility in running as government business enterprises. In each case, the incidental functions are directly related to the principal or subsidiary functions which refer specifically to telecommunications or to postal services respectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, as the owner, expects Telecom and Australia Post to comply with their principal function of supplying telecommunications and postal services. However, it has placed an obligation on them to operate under sound commercial practices. If we want them to deliver the sorts of services in rural Australia that we have talked about tonight, this is the only way we will do it. The legislation will allow Telecom and Australia Post to utilise resources to obtain a return on their capital investment. That is essential for this country's development. Surely, it is not being suggested that significant capital investment should return only a minimum value just so that an organisation cannot ever compete in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Where Telecom or Australia Post wants to engage in a new venture, it has to go through a fairly elaborate process. It has to give prior notification to the Minister and it is also required to outline its future plans in the corporate plan. The Minister may direct the board if the proposal is contrary to Government policy of public interest. The board is held directly accountable for performance. The Minister can dismiss the board or members of the board for underperformance. Also, the Government has appointed to the board an officer of the Department, who is able to advise the board on Government policy. My understanding is that this incidental function can be defined only in terms of the constitutional interpretation that is allowed for it. There are not only constitutional and legal restrictions but also practical restrictions on what business Australia Post or Telecom would be allowed to be engaged in. There are many restrictions on the way they operate. Although I understand the Opposition's concern, I do not believe that it is well founded and I therefore reject its amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> (5) Clause 87, page 25, after subclause (3) add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) For the purposes of this section, the purposes of Telecom are purposes related to, or connected with, the basic telephone service.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment relates to Telecom's power to deal with land. I shall take a few moments of the time of the House to read the clause to which the amendment relates:</PARA>
<PARA>Power to inspect land etc. </PARA>
<PARA> 87. (1) Telecom may:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) for the purpose of determining whether any land is suitable for its purposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) enter on, and inspect, the land; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) do anything on the land that is necessary or desirable for that purpose, including, for example, making surveys, taking levels, sinking bores, taking samples, digging pits and examining the soil; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>To all intents and purposes that sounds very reasonable. This amendment relates to the amendment I moved a few moments ago. The Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) said that the Opposition's concern is not necessary because that is not the intention of the Bill. The Minister may say that it is not the intention of the Bill, but the very point that the Opposition makes is that the Bill, as it currently reads, affords people in the future the opportunity to go against the intentions of the Government by utilising the wording of the legislation to their own advantage. As a consequence, the Opposition feels that the amendments are not unnecessary and indeed are most appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> This clause gives Telecom very substantial powers to enter and inspect land for its various purposes. The Opposition believes that this could-and I repeat could-give Telecom some substantial commercial advantage over its competitors. How does this occur? It occurs because Telecom may have a competitor that some technology or some particular arrangement that Telecom may wish to inspect and, by giving Telecom this power under this legislation, it has the ability to march into its competitor's office and inspect whatever it likes and try to negate the commercial advantage of that particular competitor. The Minister might say that this is far fetched and, indeed, it might well be. Even though it is far-fetched and quite possible unlikely to happen, the fact is that it may happen, given the way that this legislation is drafted, and that is the very basis upon which we move this amendment and a whole host of other amendments that we will be moving tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that there is the opportunity for people to go against the Government's intentions and use these loopholes within the legislation to their own advantage and place Telecom, Aussat Pty Ltd or the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), or whoever it may be, at a distinct advantage over their private enterprise competitors simply because they are protected by legislation, by a monopoly, by a limitation of legal comeback and so on. We move this amendment in the light of those concerns and we hope that the Government will view them in that light. In other words, while they seem far-fetched, the very point is all about the possibility of it occurring, where someone goes against the intentions of the Government and abuses the powers that the Government is giving Telecom under this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not accept the Opposition amendment to clause 87, which is very similar to that to be moved to clause 88. I believe that the Opposition's fears are very far-fetched and could not eventuate under this legislation. I think that one of the disturbing aspects is that, if we accepted the amendment, Telecom Australia may not be able to fulfil its basic community service obligation to provide this basic community service obligation to provide this basic network service throughout Australia. I think that the Opposition amendment indicates a basic misunderstanding as to how Telecom delivers its telecommunications services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To limit Telecom's powers to purposes associated with the basic telephone service would seriously and perhaps totally restrict the ability of Telecom to build its telecommunications network in the first place, because the basic telephone service is run over the same telecommunications network that provides most of Telecom's other services, as well as most of the private network services which are to be fully competitive. The Opposition amendment would mean that Telecom would be restricted in its ability to maintain or extend the telecommunications network upon which most of Australia's telecommunications services, both its monopoly and competitive services, depend. So in the interests of the National Party we cannot accept this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> (6) Clause 88, page 25, line 14, omit ``telecommunications service'', substitute ``basic telephone service''. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) Clause 88, page 25, line 19, omit ``facility'', substitute ``basic telephone service''. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support mentioned a few moments ago, this clause is similar to clause 87 but there are some differences. Subclause (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to subsections (5) and (6), Telecom may, for purposes connected with the supply of a telecommunications service:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) construct a facility on, over or under any land; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) attach a facility to any building or other structure. </PARA>
<PARA>The important thing to stress is the phrase `attach a facility to any building or other structure'. Very broad terminology is used there; terminology which, if one wants to take it in its literal sense, means that if Telecom wishes it may come along to my house and deem it as a handy site to install its new mobile telephone dish. It could place that dish slap bang on my chimney because it is a handy site with a good view and it will mean that Telecom does not have to put up a tower and that will save a heap of money. So, I could come home one evening and find a mobile telephone dish attached to my chimney. Of course, that is a far-fetched example, but if we are truthful in our interpretation of how the Government has structured this clause, the problem can be appreciated. I will read it again, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . construct a facility on, over or under any land;</PARA>
<PARA>or . . . attach a facility to any building or other structure. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the way the clause is written and my example, whilst far-fetched, is not unreasonable if it is taken in its literal sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, we raise this concern by moving these amendments simply to try to tidy up some of the looser ends to this clause in the hope that somebody like me does not come home one night and find that it is attached to my chimney or, some other commercial activity like a shop in town finding something attached to its building. I can assure the Minister that the way I read it-and I do not think I am an unreasonable person in my interpretation of the way this is written-it gives Telecom the ability to do exactly what I have just described. For that reason, we move the amendments, once again, in the hope that the Government will, in its good sense, accept them. </PARA>

<PARA> (5) Clause 18, page 6, lines 24 and 25, omit ``foreign countries and other persons'', substitute ``and foreign countries''. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments relate to clause 16 and clause 18 of the Australian Postal Corporation Bill, and specifically refer to functions, incidental businesses and activities. We believe that the way the legislation is drafted it entitles Australia Post to do what it likes with its leftover funds. We all know that Australia Post, fortunately, operates at a profit. As a consequence of being able to operate at a profit-and, I might add, a great deal of that profit is acquired through its monopoly and privileged position afforded it by this Government-this clause in the legislation enables Australia Post to start up unrelated business activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to ensure that Australia Post is restricted to areas that are related to postal services. Once again, I understand that in this respect Australia Post is similar to Telecom Australia. Once again, Australia Post, by the sheer nature of its ability to earn profits in monopoly positions, can use those profits to start up these unrelated businesses and, in the process, have an unfair affect on normal commercial business activities. For example, in my own electorate-I know other members would have similar examples-Australia Post could set up some sort of commercial activity out of its post office building or could purchase or rent other premises to set up a commercial activity. It could use the profits from its monopoly areas to enable it to reduce the price of those services it provides through that commercial activity and, as a consequence of that, seriously hurt small business. At the moment many people in the town of Goulburn, where I come from, provide services that perhaps Australia Post might want to duplicate. As a consequence, many of those small businesses might be forced either to lose money or go out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> It may not be the Government's intention that this be so. As my colleague the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Lewis, highlights, and the Opposition agrees, the possibility for this to be abused does exist. We would like the Government to clarify the position by accepting the amendments as we propose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept these amendments. First of all, we think that the amendments are unnecessary. As we have already discussed in the Australian Telecommunications Corporations Bill, Australia Post's incidental functions are specifically linked with its principal and subsidiary functions. Those relate specifically to postal matters. This will not allow Australia Post to engage in any business it desires. Its activities will have to be linked with the delivery of its function as Australia Post. Further, there are checks in the legislation, through the planning and accountability provisions in clauses 35 to 41, to keep the Government aware of Australia Post's business proposals. Also, clause 46 requires the Board to notify the Minister of significant business activities and clause 49 allows the Minister to give directions to the Board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must reject the other amendments too. There is a clause which allows Australia Post to sell products through its post offices. The reality is that it already sells flags, for example, and, if I have anything to do with it, it will sell more in future in order to help maintain some of these uneconomic post offices, particularly those in rural areas. One cannot expect them to stay open, keep employing people and provide a service if they have nothing to sell. So there will be functions that will be related in some way to the role of Australia Post. If Australia Post is to take advantage of these opportunities to become commercial, it cannot be totally constrained by nineteenth century services. Australia Post has to be pushed into the 1990s, if it is going to survive and provide the community service obligation that so many people in this House demand of it. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 15, page 13 and 14, omit proposed section 76. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to proposed new section 76 of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission Act. If my memory serves me correctly, it relates to immunity from action. I might just read that proposed section for the benefit of the Committee. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> An action or proceeding does not lie against OTC or any other person in relation to any loss or damage suffered, or that may be suffered, by a person because of any act or omission (whether negligent or otherwise) by or on behalf of OTC in relation to the supply of a reserved service. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, this is a cause for concern on the Opposition side of the chamber. The immunity from action in relation to reserved services concerns us. Let me take a simple example. OTC might be installing a service in a building and, in the process, do damage to the building as a consequence of its own negligence. Because of the legislation that the Government has put forward, the owner of that building would have no recourse to OTC to attempt to recoup the cost of the damages or losses that may have been incurred. I note that the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly), earlier in the debate this evening, spoke about Australia Post needing some immunity from legal recourse. I think the example she gave was a quite reasonable one. In this particular case, once again, I believe there is a requirement for these government business operations such as OTC to be responsible for their own actions, and if they create damage through their own negligence or otherwise, I believe there has to be some legislative requirement for them to compensate people. This would apply in examples such as that which I gave, where an installation occurs and an OTC truck may have come around a corner too quickly and knocked a hole in the wall; or a man might have broken a window because his ladder was not properly fixed to the side of the building or something like that. In such cases, I think there is some requirement for those Government business operations to meet the costs of those damages. I think that should be stated in the legislation, and that is why this amendment has been moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Nationally, there are 23 permanent full-time officers employed in processing apprenticeship rebate claims.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All claims so far received for financial year 1987/88 have been processed.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Staff processing claims are under the direct supervision of a senior officer.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (6) See answer to (2) above. Generally, claims are paid within two months. However, many delays occur as a result of</PARA>

<PARA> Does a person whose tax file number has been wrongly sent to a person other than to whom it applies, or whose tax file number is contained in a communication which has been opened prior to being delivered to the correct address, have the right to have that tax file number cancelled and replaced.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation is concerned that there have been some difficulties with the delivery of tax file number advices. While it is understandable that people would be worried that someone may know their tax file number, knowledge of the number alone will not allow anyone else access to personal information.</PARA>
<PARA> With the introduction of the new tax file number arrangements the Taxation Office's security procedures have been further tightened to ensure personal taxation information is not disclosed to unauthorised persons.</PARA>
<PARA> There are also strong penalties for the misuse of tax file numbers-fines of up to $10,000 and/or 2 years imprisonment. Under the Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Act 1988 it is an offence for a person to, in unauthorised circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA> require or request another person to quote their tax file number;</PARA>
<PARA> record another person's tax file number;</PARA>
<PARA> disclose another person's tax file number; or</PARA>
<PARA> use another person's tax file number as an identity link.</PARA>
<PARA> However, if someone feels that their privacy has been significantly compromised by the relatively few problems with the distribution of tax file number advices they may apply to the Taxation Office to have their file number cancelled and a new one issued.</PARA>

<PARA> This clearance is necessary where access is required to national security information classified `Confidential' and above.
