<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Transport and Communications. On 11 October last year, the Prime Minister said-and I ask the Minister to recall this-that he could:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the intention of this Government to make sure that the coastal shipping industry is more internationally competitive than has been the case hitherto and that, indeed, it is internationally competitive. All the actions taken by the Government have been designed to bring about that result. That, of course, stands in marked contrast to the situation that pertained when Opposition members were in government. Before the present Government came to office, for a period of 30 years out of the previous 33 years, the parties to which members opposite belong comprised the government of this country, and they allowed the shipping industry in this country to be a damned disgrace, and they did the same in respect of the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite now want to pontificate and make great statements about what they would do if only they were back in government. They had 30 years to do something, but they did absolutely nothing about the matter. So they should come in here and take a grander stance than anyone else, saying that if only they were in government they would fix the matter. They wrecked it and created the problem.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JG4">Mr LAMB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Social Security aware of a report of the Australian Institute of Family Studies which analyses the effects on families of the Government's tax and social security package? What are the major conclusions of the report? What role does the sort of research contained in the report play in the development of social policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2095" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me refer to the major conclusions in the report. Overall, the Government's tax package redresses substantially all of the deficiencies in the tax transfer system affecting families and single individuals. Nearly all income groups will pay less tax under the new scale than they would have paid if the tax scale inherited by the Labor Government had been fully indexed. Approximately 60 per cent of the benefits of the package goes to low and middle income families. The changes in the tax scale benefit most those families receiving incomes around $20,000 per annum. The changes were certainly more beneficial than the indexing of the tax scale of 1983-84 would have been. The benchmarks for assistance to low income families were met, so underpinning the income of all families with children. An historic decision was made to index all family payments relating to children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question also referred to the role of research such as this and the role of policy development. The House will recall that on 6 March I referred to the previous Institute report and its recommendations were changed. The Government looked very closely at that report when designing the package. Our social policy has been based on rigorous research of the Social Security Review, the Institute of Family Studies, the Social Welfare Research Centre and, of course, the Department of Social Security. The attention to rigorous research and facts will continue under this Government. It is worth making some, albeit brief, reference by way of contrast to the previous Government and the way that that Government went about decision-making. I need to do no more than refer to the honourable member for Wentworth, who in January last year was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It was government by anecdote rather than analysis.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I just used to get offended, quite frankly, sitting in the (Fraser) Cabinet room and seeing that, despite all the technical and other analysis that was done and put on the table, quite often a decision was taken on the basis of something a farmer said he had heard in a pub the night before or that one of his mates had told him. It was government by anecdote rather than analysis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government, through the Prime Minister's pledge, has forced the issue to the forefront of political discussion. As the Institute of Family Studies reported, the Government's commitment to increased payment for children to specific benchmarks as a measure against child poverty has been fulfilled. These measures, combined with greater employment opportunities, represent a most concerted attack on poverty and the disadvantage of low family income. This Government has identified the issues through careful research. It sought to prioritise those issues, giving priority first to those most in need. It has brought about reform systematically because it has linked research and social policy. It is governed on the basis of firm policy, certainly not on the basis of anecdote as the honourable member for Wentworth reflected on the previous Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some trepidation that I ask my question of the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is it a fact that it is cheaper to ship a car from Melbourne to New Zealand via Japan than it is to ship it directly from Melbourne to New Zealand across the Tasman? If this is the case, what causes this anomaly?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is the case, it has been the case for a very long time. It is something which this Government would certainly be concerned to redress as part of its consideration of this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Ha, ha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a lot of laughter from the Opposition members. It is really laughter to hide their embarrassment at their complicity in what happened over a long period in which they allowed this country to be structurally maladjusted in many respects, including in relation to the waterfront and shipping. Already in relation to the shipping industry, we have taken a number of steps to bring about improved reform. I will be detailing those steps in a subsequent debate. Any action that we will be taking after this, which will be substantial, will be on top of a considerable amount of action, which stands in marked contrast to what was done by the previous Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the trans-Tasman trade, as the honourable member knows and the House generally knows, arrangements in place for many years as a result of a union agreement in New Zealand and Australia have limited the trans-Tasman trade to ships which were crewed by Australians or New Zealanders. That has had the result of excluding foreign shipping which may have been cheaper, particularly with flag of convenience shipping. Whether it is cheaper to ship via Japan or not, I cannot say. I can say that, whereas the Opposition did nothing about it in government, we well be doing something about it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Denison for his question. I can assure him that on my recent visit to Tasmania I got the sense that this is an issue of very considerable interest in his State. I can inform the honourable gentleman that officers from the department concerned and from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation are currently visiting Europe and North America to study the technologies available for modern pulp mills and for the environmental standards and approval processes which apply to the erection of modern pulp mills. I am pleased to say to the honourable gentleman-as he knows, I think-that I have agreed to a proposal that has been put to me by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania, Mr Field, to investigate the possibility of establishing a mill producing unbleached paper in Tasmania and of moving to have both this Government and, when he becomes the Premier of Tasmania after next Saturday, his Government use unbleached paper products. To that end, the terms of reference of the Australian group of officials visiting Europe and North America have been added to to require it to look at the question of the processes for producing unbleached paper and also to examine the question of what enlarged markets there may be for such unbleached products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have agreed that industry will be invited to participate in the next Tasmanian Government's feasibility study into what will be Australia's first mill producing unbleached paper products. May I say-and I know that the honourable gentleman would be interested-that I am pleased with the response that has already been received to that announcement which was made in Hobart on Saturday. Quite clearly there was very broad, positive community response to it, although Mr Groom, the Liberal Party Deputy Leader down there who seems to be running the campaign, was critical of the idea.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also say in conclusion that we were not in a position to know what the reaction of the Federal Leader of the Opposition would be because he is barred from the campaign in Tasmania. The Liberals have put a barrier around him; he is not allowed down there. There is nothing new about that. He was barred from Western Australia, barred from Victoria, barred from Greensborough, and now he has been barred from Tasmania. All we do know--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and also for his continued interest in Telecom. Telecom Australia International is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Telecom Australia. It deals specifically with promoting and selling Australian telecommunications expertise overseas. Just recently, a major agreement-a five-year agreement-was signed with Guandong Post and Telecommunications Bureau, which is a major regional Chinese telecommunications authority. That deal is worth tens of millions of dollars in contracts for Australian firms, particularly many small Australian firms. This is just the second stage of the Telecom Australia International and Austrade China joint venture known as the China telecommunications action plan. This has been very successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year, under the first stage of the plan, Telecom Australia International won the contract to establish and test a digital microwave system between China's two leading cities-Beijing and Shanghai. This second stage comprises seven projects in Guandong involving a range of different technologies, such as optical fibre and a mobile telephone system. Specification work will begin in July this year. Work on the first projects is intended to begin in 1989-90. This agreement is further evidence of the success of the Government's information industry and the incredible export potential that exists in this area of high technology. We are trying to push this area into that region in particular. We have set an export target for Australian telecommunications products and services of $800m by 1996. This deal indicates that that target can be met.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Acting Treasurer to the fact that, despite a 16 per cent lift in our terms of trade, the current account deficit has deteriorated sharply, including as a percentage of gross domestic product. Is it a fact that the current account deficit would have deteriorated even if there had been no growth in capital goods imports? That is, has the jump in consumer and other non-capital goods alone more than offset the strong boost in the terms of trade?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2098" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the National Party of Australia draws attention to something that the Government has been saying for some time, that is, domestic demand is too strong. That is why we have dedicated the arms of Government policy towards containing domestic demand. I think we have said enough in relation to monetary policy, but perhaps it is worth reminding the right honourable member of what the Treasurer said in his April statement. At that time he said that fiscal policy would continue to be very tight, and that is why we have committed ourselves, in the context of next year, to the achievement again of a zero public sector borrowing requirement outcome, of a fourth year of real decline in outlays, and of a surplus which is of the same order as the surplus for this year. That all indicates a very tight fiscal policy in conjunction with a very tight monetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement put down by the Treasurer in April was a very coherent statement of economic policy. If honourable members want to see a really crook and bad economic policy, they should read the one that was delivered in this House on the following night. What the right honourable member must remember, and what all members opposite must remember, is that the Opposition has no basis for dealing with the contemporary problems of the Australian economy. It has a bankrupt record in relation to fiscal policy, it has no wages policy whatsoever and, of course, its particular concern and obsession about interest rates come about because that is the only device it would ever use. It is important to remember that what the Opposition is saying, and the only alternative it can come up with, is to drive the economy into recession. That is the only policy the Opposition knows about. However, that is a policy that would send hundreds of thousands of people on to the dole queues, they would lose their jobs and, as a result, families would be left in distress. That matters not a bit to the right honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Leader of the National Party looks at the progress of the Australian economy as revealed historically in the April statement, he will see that every time there has been a boost in demand it has always been followed by, at least in the past 20 years, a blow-out in wages, and that has led to an immediate truncation of a period of growth in the economy. What we are about, and what this Government will achieve, is a period of sustained, if modest, growth in order that we do not plunge this country into recession in the way in which the Liberal Party and the then Country Party did repeatedly during their far too long term of office. The secret to that-a secret which the Leader of the National Party knows all too well-is a wages policy which he does not have but which the Government does have.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question and acknowledge his close interest in the cattle industry. We have been concerned that the United States-European Community dispute on this matter should not escalate. We have been closely following the activities of the high level US-EC task force that was established last February with the aim of breaking the deadlock within a time frame of 75 days. The task force has been examining options for the export of beef and offal from non-hormonally treated animals which could result in small amounts of beef being exported to the EC. There has been some progress on trade in high quality beef from untreated animals which could result in small amounts of United States beef being exported to the EC. That will be done through a producer certification process which will involve approvals by EC officials rather than the United States Department of Agriculture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There appears to be little progress yet, however, on the more important offal trade issues. I understand that honourable members opposite are interested in offal, hormones and things, Kroger's victims. Australia has continued to maintain access to the EC meat market, and I am pleased to inform the honourable member that an EC review team that recently visited Australia to examine our control monitoring procedures was impressed with the operation of the system, as I understand it, and the commitment shown by all levels of government and industry to make the arrangements work.</PARA>
<PARA> I also note in this context in particular the Tasmanian Opposition Leader, Mr Michael Field, in his recent policy launch, undertook to establish a certification scheme to enable chemical free products to be guaranteed in this State. That would be a change for the better and shows that it is possible to come up with the innovative and practical policy options in what is a pretty complicated area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basic decision was taken some time ago in respect of foreign fishing in Australian waters that banned gill nets or drift nets. We are particularly concerned in northern waters with respect to the catching of dolphins. I know of no fishery that is managed by the Commonwealth where we allow drift nets. There are some gill nets used for inshore fisheries in some States, but they are only small in length and, I think, they are quite controlled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The big problem with these drift nets is that, once they do get loose, they just go on drifting through the ocean catching and destroying many fish. They really are a terrible problem. I think we are going to have to take more and more action in international for a to try to see what we can do in the oceanic region in particular. It is bad enough now with some of the big foreign fishing fleets plundering waters in this whole area, but without any international controls on these forms of fishing, and given the enormous upgrading in technology, purse seining and all the rest of it, we will see more and more species wiped out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government remains gravely concerned, of course, at the continuing situation in the Lebanon, in particular the shelling throughout Beirut. Like all Australians, we deplore the heavy loss of civilian life which has resulted. Senator Gareth Evans indicated on 19 April that it must be made clear that after 14 years of tragic fighting no settlement in Lebanon can be imposed by force and that reconciliation and compromise provide the only path to ending the killing and resolving the underlying problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 14 April the Prime Minister and Senator Evans met representatives of Australia's Lebanese community who wished to express their concern, particularly at the recent events in Lebanon. Both the Prime Minister and Senator Evans emphasised the Government's support for Lebanon's territorial integrity and sovereignty and the call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, except those that were there at the request of the Lebanese Government, representing all communities. Following that meeting, Senator Evans instructed Australian missions overseas to explore with other governments what scope might exist for international action over Lebanon. Whilst Australia is not a party principal to efforts to promote a solution in Lebanon, the Government stands ready at all times to assist efforts to achieve a lasting peace; supports and encourages the efforts of the Arab League to secure a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement to the conflict; and welcomes the plan to send an Arab League observer force to Lebanon to monitor the cease-fire.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government also urges all of the parties to cooperate with the Arab League and its planned observer force to achieve a lasting cease-fire. Any solution to a problem of the magnitude of the one referred to by the honourable member will require flexibility on all sides and concessions to meet the long standing demands for a better balance of representation at a political level. The causes of conflict in Lebanon are complex and will not be solved simply through the withdrawal of Syrian forces who were, of course, invited into Lebanon at the request of the previous Lebanese Government. However, in the current situation there is a particular need for Syrian forces to exercise restraint and for Syria to act constructively. At the meeting I referred to earlier, the Prime Minister advised members of the Lebanese community that the Australian Government would respond positively to appeals for humanitarian assistance for Lebanon and Senator Evans is currently assessing options for the most efficient and practical means of providing such assistance.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2101" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did notice some attacks by one of the two Opposition junior shadow Ministers on the subject of the Chief of the Air Staff after he, at no urging from me, chose to defend his service against what he thought were illegitimate attacks both by the Opposition and, more generally, by others in the community. He made it quite clear, when he got up to make his remarks, that he had done what he chose to do on his own initiative and that he thought that what he was doing was essential to maintain Air Force morale. He was also anxious to point out the very substantial and effective work that he and others were doing to maintain the Air Force through some very difficult periods. He was, as a result of his efforts, subject to one of a bracket of childish attacks-it is not as though this is the first instance of it-on his integrity, with a suggestion that the very fact that he is prepared to appear to defend his service in public, at no urging, I might say, from his political leaders, was in itself, according to the advice of Senator Newman who is obviously an expert in these matters, going to have a `disastrous impact on the morale of his Force'. This follows a number of comments from that source.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When last we heard Senator Newman on the subject of what ought to be done with the defence forces, she suggested, without any particular justification but in classic mess bar room-type talk, `Actually, what we need to do is sack half the lieutenant-colonels'. Then she thought it would be a good idea to stand up at some other point in time and say, `Perhaps we should sack all the civilian advisers in the Department of Defence'. The senator is occasionally joined in these forays, which are usually resiled from once criticism is brought in, by the other junior shadow spokesman on defence. She persists with these extraordinarily childish attacks without any development of policy. The Opposition has been given unprecedented access in the history of this country to defence facilities--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And so it should, but it seems that the development of policy and of a proper attitude when dealing with senior personnel in the defence forces moves in inverse proportion to the number of base visits. We have no policy; what we have is a persistent pattern of carping and petty attacks which demonstrate unfitness for office. One cannot lead the defence forces-as one has to politically from this place-if one does it on the basis of that type of childish carping criticism which came from Senator Newman to the Chief of the Air Staff.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell you one thing, my friend: when I was Secretary of the Caucus foreign affairs and defence committee, I had plenty to say about the then Government's defence policy. I did not go down the line which the Opposition now feels it is free to do and indulge in this sort of childish behaviour whereby the Chief of the Air Staff and other chiefs of the defence forces are subjected to this type of personal abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that Opposition members are beginning to make a fetish of attacking senior public servants. That is obviously a reflection of the fact that they have been seven years in Opposition and have forgotten the appropriate relationship between the parliamentary process and senior public servants, be they in the defence forces or Department of Defence public servants. There is always a legitimate role for attacking the Government and, obviously, there is a legitimate role for the two junior defence spokespersons to attack the Government on defence policy. The problem for both of them is that they have long since departed from that course and have long since been able to separate out a legitimate attack on the Government and on the personnel responsible for the management and development of the defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA> This was a most inappropriate comment by Senator Newman, the second of the two junior spokespersons, although she may be the senior one. I noted today that, in the Age, the Opposition comments in the defence supplement come not from the honourable member for McPherson but from Senator Newman, so she may be the senior spokesperson, in which case that makes her comment all the worse. I have complete confidence in the political integrity of the chiefs of our various defence forces-and the Chief of the Defence Force-despite the fact that they are quite clearly under systematic attack from the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Community Services and Health aware of criticisms made at the weekend by the Federal President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), Dr Bryce Phillips, about the Government's new fee arrangements agreed between the Government and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners?

What is the Government doing to ensure that doctors and patients are made properly aware of the new arrangements?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2102" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the rather extraordinary outburst by the President of the AMA on the new proposals. I can only draw the conclusion from those comments that the AMA is more interested in scoring political points against the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners than in championing the cause of general practitioners (GPs) or trying to concern itself with the real improvement in and enhancement of primary care services in this country. Dr Phillips's charges rest with a paper entitled Doctor Education. This document has no status whatsoever. I am informed by the College that the paper is not an internal document; it is the personal view of one College member. It has not been, and will not be, considered by the College, yet the whole basis of this attack on the proposals rests with this document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that the concerns of Dr Phillips and the AMA are that the new arrangements for GPs, salaries and services, negotiated between the Government and the Royal College-and which are to be introduced progressively from 1 August-will prove to be electorally popular for Medicare, for the Government and for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which in recent weeks has demonstrated itself to be the professional medical body most concerned about the welfare of GPs. If that is Dr Phillips's assessment I think he is overwhelmingly correct. The Federal Government certainly does not resile from taking decisions which are in the best interests of the families of this country and which sometimes also happen to be electorally popular; nor does the Federal Government pretend that we and the College will not have to promote these new arrangements. It would be a failure of duty on the Government's part if that were not done.</PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements represent the most far-reaching changes that have ever been achieved for GPs in this country. They reinforce the role of GPs as the gate keeper for primary health care in this country. They give GPs increased status and responsibility; they promote better quality of patient care; and they improve treatment and assessment outcome. GPs deliver 70 million attendance services each year; so it is important that all patients in this country, and all GPs, be made properly aware of these new arrangements which will hopefully cover the great bulk of those 70 million services.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department and the Health Insurance Commission are working with the College on a program to educate doctors and patients about the new arrangements. For GPs it will be necessary to establish a clear understanding of the new fee structure and ensure the enrolment of eligible GPs onto the GP register. For patients, it will be necessary effectively to inform them of the changes to avoid any confusion, especially among the elderly, who are high users of GP services. This is a task which will be particularly important because, as evidenced by the events of the weekend, the AMA is certainly trying to cloud the issues with a lot of disinformation.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the other claims made by Dr Phillips, the new arrangements are not in any way designed to discriminate against or to disadvantage any doctors or patients; rather, they are designed to reward GPs who voluntarily try to improve their skills by taking part in continuing medical education and in quality assurance programs. Finally, these changes are consistent with developments overseas, including in such countries as New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada and a number of European countries. Any attempt to undermine them by the AMA or any other group is an attempt to set back the advance of general practice in this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the question, and I thank the honourable member for Franklin for it. I shall first give a blanket answer, before going to the specifics: not only do I not hate Tasmania but it is the State of Australia where for the past two years, at the end of a long parliamentary year, I have chosen to go to have a brief holiday. The fact that I have chosen it for a holiday place for two years in a row is not consistent with any proposition that I hate Tasmania. On the contrary, I think it is one of the most beautiful States in Australia, inhabited by some of the loveliest people in Australia and, if it makes the right decision next Saturday, it is faced with a glorious future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the specifics of the honourable member's question, firstly, he asked why I stopped the dam. The Government stopped the dam for the very good reason that it was economically unnecessary and environmentally obscene. Indeed, the judgment that we made was subsequently confirmed-and from what source was that? It was from the Hydro-Electric Commission (HEC) of Tasmania. In the period leading up to 1983 it had been saying that it was economic doomsday, that it would be the end of Tasmania if the Franklin River was not dammed and the opportunity for future generation of power not provided. That was what was poured out.</PARA>
<PARA> We were very sceptical indeed about that. All the analysis that we undertook showed that that was not the case. One did not need very much analysis to know that the proposition was environmentally obscene. Of course, it is now a matter of great comfort and joy to us-and I think now to the great majority of Tasmanians-that we took the principled and determined stand that we did because, as I say, the statistics that were produced by the HEC were shonky. They did not stand up and, had we gone ahead with that environmentally obscene proceeding, Tasmania would have been given a source of power generation that it did not need. That is the answer to the honourable member's first question as to why we stopped the dam.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the honourable member asked why we stopped the mill. We stopped the mill for a very simple reason: we were not prepared to see 13 tonnes of organochlorines pumped each day into the ocean. We made the decision for a number of reasons. Obviously, it was environmentally unsound for that to be happening, but we did not rely on our own predilection in that matter. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)-that independent body-provided us with a very clear indication that it would be an act of dereliction of Government duty to allow the mill to go ahead on those terms. On the side of the House on which the honourable member sits, the Leader of the Opposition, when the Government made that decision, said that it was a tragic outcome. On 15 March he made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>It's a tragic result . . . a criminal failure of national leadership. After all, the environmental guidelines laid down by the Tasmanian Government were already very strict.</PARA>
<PARA>That may have been the opportunistic political judgment of the Leader of the Opposition, but much more important to us than that political opportunism was the judgment of the CSIRO that the project would have been environmentally unacceptable. That is the answer to the honourable member's second question as to why we stopped the mill.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the honourable member asked why we went for the unbleached mill. A very sensible proposal has been put to us that we should examine whether it is technically possible and economically acceptable to have an unbleached mill. As honourable members will appreciate, the problem with the current kraft mill process is the chlorine that is used in the bleaching process. If we can take the chlorine out of the bleaching process and have unbleached products, the environmental problem will be resolved very substantially. It makes eminently good sense for us to examine whether it is technically possible to have such a process in Tasmania and, in association with that, whether in economic terms there will be a market for such products. When the Leader of the Labor Party in Tasmania who, as distinct from his political opponents, is concerned with the proper blending of economic growth and protection of the environment, put that proposal, I said, `That makes a lot of sense. I have a team going overseas; I will add to the terms of reference so that it can see whether it is technically possible and whether the market is there'.</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the honourable member asked why we had cut down on Federal jobs. I will tell the honourable member what I have done in regard to Federal activity in Tasmania. When we were considering where we were to put the school for Federal civil aviation air officers, the bureaucrats and, if I may say so without shedding any Cabinet secrets, some of my intensely and consistently economically rational Ministers, said, `The school should not go to Tasmania. It should be kept on the mainland'. In a sense, there was a range of economically rational arguments as to why that course should have been followed. But such was my concern for Tasmania-I remind the honourable member that Tasmania does suffer from some disadvantages including, may I say so, in some of its representation, but we will try, whenever the next Federal election is held, to rectify that problem-that I said that even if, on economic considerations, there were a marginally better case for putting the school on the mainland, we would still have it in Tasmania. As a result of the decision that I took, I received the unqualified praise of the people of Launceston. I am very thankful to them and I hope that in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time they will repay me for what I did there.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come to the question of Soviet fishing. I am not quite sure of the thrust of the honourable member's question.</PARA>

We can now tell the good people of Tasmania that if the Federal Government makes a decision that there will be an agreement between Australia and the Soviet Union which will facilitate Soviet research fishing, and if the Soviet Union expresses a view that it would like to be able to use a Tasmanian port for the purposes of refitting its vessels and servicing its crews, which will bring additional employment to Tasmania, their worthy representative in the Federal Parliament from the electorate of Franklin will take the view that they should be denied that employment opportunity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As never before, scientific and technological developments are altering the lives of every person, changing the face of nations, cultures and the international economy, and even throwing into question the very environment in which we live. Medical discoveries are offering relief for the sick and injured, helping childless couples to have children, opening broader horizons for the elderly. Researchers are providing new drugs and new surgical techniques and are even probing the nature of life itself. New manufacturing techniques are revolutionising the way we work, the way we travel, what we eat, how we live. Computers store and manipulate information in quantities and with a speed that would have been inconceivable a few decades ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rapid communications are delivering instant news throughout an apparently shrunken world, crisscrossed with optical fibre networks and surrounded by satellites. Concepts of warfare today are largely unrecognisable to those who fought in the Second World War. Even the most basic cycle of our climate, the purity of the air we breathe, the very borders between sea and land, seem to be affected by technology. Problems such as the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer are real issues today that even in the last decade would have seemed incredible outside the pages of science fiction. </PARA>
<PARA> One possible response to this vast process of change is despair-the feeling that attempting to control the seemingly remote forces of unleashed innovation is futile. Honourable members who are in contact with their constituents will know that many people, especially many younger Australians, do indeed border on despair when they contemplate the dangers of nuclear war and the despoliation of the environment. A more realistic response is to attempt to understand the nature of these changes and to harness the best endeavours of all people to ensure that the forces of science and technology yield a better future for mankind. </PARA>
<PARA> The march of technological change-where it seems possible that it might lead only to a polluted, clamorous, dangerous and uncertain world-must be made to serve our needs and to create a world in which our children and grandchildren can live at ease. Indeed, if Australians of the next century are to inhabit a prosperous nation and a clean and safe world, we today must grasp the challenge of gaining control of the processes of scientific and technological innovation and ensure that we receive benefit, not disadvantage, from change. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a challenge that confronts all Australians. Australians, of course, are used to enjoying a quality of life equal or superior to that anywhere in the world. But just as we accept that our predecessors had to work extremely hard to build this society, so we must recognise that retaining such advantages, so as to pass them on to our children, will require hard work and constant effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government came to office in 1983, we have been single-minded in our determination to ensure that such an effort is made. A crucial foundation for the pursuit of our wider goals is our adoption of the most wide ranging and comprehensive program of structural adjustment in Australia's history. We have taken the decisions-tough ones, many of them-to create a more internationally competitive economy and to remove the impediments which prevent industries and individuals from making their fullest contribution to national prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> In this endeavour, science and technology continue to have an essential role to play. They can open the way for Australia's manufacturing and service industries to be more competitive, and for the men and women who make up the Australian work force to be more productive. Our agricultural and mining industries, our medical researchers, our astronomers, our communications specialists, are already showing the way, not just with new techniques and new products that can be sold abroad, but with new knowledge, on which no price tag can be placed. This Government is determined that Australia will not fall behind. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing the proven excellence of our researchers, allowing them to further the horizons of basic research and to contribute through their creativity and innovation to Australia's goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming to office my Government has pursued a consistent science and technology strategy. This strategy recognises that crucial elements of research must be supported by public funds. It adopts as two important objectives the pursuit of excellence and the closer cooperation between researchers and users of that research. It recognises that science and technology depend on the creativity of individuals. And finally, it seeks to integrate science and technology into the broader community. In pursuit of that strategy, research into science and technology in Australia is supported by public funds totalling about $1.9 billion annually, through direct funding, through institutions of higher education and through tax concessions. We have introduced new research and development promotion and incentive schemes, and reorganised our research organisations. There has been a massive expansion of higher education places and a dramatically lifted school retention rate. The best Australian research can now receive increased support, as researchers must now win a proportion of their funding by competing with others against a variety of standards, some involving peer review and others commercial criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1982-83, Government support for research through grants, higher education and government agencies has risen by 12 per cent in real terms. Support for industry research and development has trebled in that period that we have been in office. Public funding of research and development in Australia is at about the middle order of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. But private sector support has been near the bottom of the ladder. When this Government came to office, 80 per cent of the nation's research activities were publicly funded, with private industry providing the remaining 20 per cent. By 1986-87, within a substantial increase in total research and development expenditure, industry had increased its share in the nation's research effort to 35 per cent. This is a welcome trend. But with this statement today, the Government is saying that it recognises that more needs to be done. More needs to be done to enhance our efforts in the quest for knowledge, as well as to ensure that a sufficient research effort is directed to areas of crucial application for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The details of the Government's initiatives will be announced directly by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Barry Jones. Let me take this opportunity-an appropriate opportunity-first to pay tribute to this Minister's determined and far-sighted advocacy of these issues. He is a Minister who makes an invaluable contribution to the Government's consideration of science issues and one in whom the science community can place its trust and confidence. The first element of the Government's statement that I wish to announce today is that I will be appointing Barry Jones as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Technology. In this role Mr Jones, who will retain his existing portfolio duties, will exercise, on my behalf, the day to day responsibility for the development and coordination of science policy across the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I also announce the establishment of a new consultative body which will bring together at the highest level all those who have a role to play in setting the nation's priorities in science and technology. This new body will be known as the Prime Minister's Science Council. I will chair it and Mr Jones will be its Deputy Chairman. Its membership will consist of Government Ministers, representatives of the science community and leaders of Australian industry. The first meeting of the Council will be held in October. At the top of its agenda will be a consideration of the status of science in Australia-covering both the state of research in Australia and the nature and effectiveness of linkages between research and industry. The October meeting will also consider the greenhouse effect, to the research on which the Government has recently provided $7.8m. I want my Council to bring a new focus and prominence to discussions on Australia's national priorities in scientific research and a new capacity to make sure that our aims in basic and applied science are properly set and implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist in this, I am appointing Professor Ralph Slatyer as Chief Scientist. He will assist me and Mr Jones on science and technology policy, chair the Science and Technology Coordinating Committee and serve on and be the Executive Officer of my new Council. Professor Slatyer is a scientist of national and international distinction, both in research and in the development of science and technology policy. He has served as Chairman of the World Heritage Committee, President of the International Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment and most recently as Chairman of the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC). The Australian Science and Technology Council, which has been providing analysis of developments in Australian science and technology throughout the term of my Government, will continue to provide this valuable service. Indeed, I expect ASTEC to make a substantial contribution to the success of the new arrangements I have just announced and to enjoy an enhanced role as a result of them. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement is based on extensive consultation with the science and technology community, and on detailed reviews both of specific problems and of the broader needs and concerns of scientists. It brings together, as the Government promised it would, all the strands of the Government's support of science and technology research throughout a number of portfolios. This statement does not represent a conclusion to the debate about science and technology in Australia, nor a reaction to it. It represents a contribution, and I believe a very significant one, to a continuing process of policy development. It provides for the expenditure of an additional $390m over the next five years in order to boost Australia's science and technology performance. Taken with the anticipated revenue forgone due to the extension of tax concessions, this represents a $1 billion package of support for science and technology in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement represents our recognition that the pace of change in this country cannot be relaxed. We cannot rest on our laurels. The world will not let us do so. No Australian wants to leave it up to the rest of the world to make the decisions that are so important to shaping our future. With this statement, we are showing our determination that Australia will be a full participant in the exciting and vital processes of scientific discovery, innovation and adaptation. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This is the first statement to consolidate government policy for science and technology. It involves a number of portfolios and announces substantial initiatives. It will further give Australian science and technology an enhanced capability to support the vision that the Government has for Australia and to respond to the opportunities and needs of the next five years. Science and technology, including engineering, have changed the quality, length and direction of life in the past century far more than politics, education, ideology or religion. Edison and Ford shaped human experience more broadly and enduringly than Lenin and Hitler. Because they are central to our culture and to the success of our economy, governments must be concerned about science and technology and how they benefit us. It is also necessary for people in Australia to be aware of the ways in which science and technology-and I include engineering, of course-is an important factor in our culture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Scientific method is also central to the examination of evidence, developing intellectual rigour and personal autonomy. Society looks increasingly to science and technology to provide knowledge and understanding, to support economic development, to contribute solutions to new and pressing concerns and to help maintain the high standards of living we now enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 the Hawke Government has undertaken a series of major reforms which has moved us away from being a protected, inward looking, insular economy towards accepting the new challenges arising from full participation by Australian industry in the global economy. The Government has given a high priority to structural adjustment. These changes include reduced levels of government expenditure, converting massive budget deficits into substantial surpluses, floating the dollar, reducing reliance on tariffs, bounties and subsidies, reforming the taxation system, and freeing up banking and capital markets. There have also been major reforms in the provision of education, health and social security and defence. Government actions have strengthened our manufacturing base, and revitalised existing industries. Large scale job creation, at the highest rate of any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nation, is recognised as a major achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Having achieved so much, it is now appropriate to place even more emphasis on other areas including our research and skill base. Four objectives have priority: to increase industry's use of technology and investment in research and development; to build a competitive research base that is recognised internationally; to attract high quality people into science, technology and engineering; and to provide coordination and cohesiveness of science and technology in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Investment in Research and Development</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Public funding of research and development in Australia is, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, about the average of other OECD nations but private sector support is relatively poor. Such comparisons are important because Australian industries must compete with those of other countries on world markets. In Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands, the proportion of industry investment in total research and development is 60 per cent, 79 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. In 1978-79, government contributed 79c to the total research dollar, compared with industry's 21c. This ratio was quite unbalanced, reflecting in part the reluctance of a previously closeted manufacturing sector to invest in indigenous research and development. This reluctance was particularly serious in `development', where costs tend to be higher and the process more protracted than in `research'. By 1986-87, the proportion was healthier, with the Government share being 63c in every research dollar, compared with industry's 37c. By the mid 1990s, we should aim for a more even balance of contribution to research and development investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Changing this balance in Australia's research and development spending has been essential, and the trend is in the right direction. However, there are still problems with the overall amount of research which will require a concerted effort by both industry and government. Overseas experience suggests that research and development amounting to 2 per cent of gross domestic production (GDP) could be seen as an appropriate critical mass. If Australia were to achieve a similar figure with balanced contributions from government and industry, industry would need to more than double its research and development funding as a proportion of GDP. In 1986 the Government introduced the generous 150 per cent tax concession in response to the low level of research and development performance by the private sector; particularly manufacturing industry. The incentive has been enthusiastically welcomed by industry, continues to draw strong support and has contributed significantly to the large increase in investment in industrial research and development that has taken place in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> While it was originally intended that the concession would run for five years to June 1991, the Government has decided that it will be now extended for a further two years, to 30 June 1993. Recognising the long term planning necessary in research and development, the incentive will be phased out, operating at 125 per cent for a further two years. To give an indication of the gross cost to tax revenue of this recent decision, revenue forgone is expected to cost about $200m in 1988-89, and of the order of $1 billion over the next five years. The Government believes that Australian researchers should be able to participate as a full partner in international precompetitive research and development programs where the collaboration can help Australian technology enter world markets. The Government has therefore decided to increase funding for international science and technology by $17.5m over the next five years, including additional support for bilateral science and technology cooperation programs, which have been seriously undernourished in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>Core Capacity in Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Support for industrial research and development is a key part of the Government's policy for science and technology, and provision of a sound core capacity in science and technology is another. Recent, and ongoing, debates about science have been marred by over-attention to extremes. In reality, the situation is far more complex. There is no arbitrary line between treatment of and research in cancer or between weather forecasting and upper atmosphere physics in meteorology. The extremes sharpen our perceptions, and provide rally points for intellectual turf wars, but our need is to find ways of bringing together their best aspects to serve our visions for Australia's future. The distinction between `fundamental' and `basic', `strategic' and `applied' research, while convenient, is increasingly blurred in practice because the categories overlap: they are indeed part of a continuum. The labels `long term research' and `short term research' may be more appropriate. The concept of `relevance' in research is also increasingly dubious. When the frontiers of knowledge are pushed forward rapidly, areas which seemed remote or irrelevant a few years ago are now at the forefront of research by universities and corporations-for example, work on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, superconductivity and the greenhouse-ozone phenomena. </PARA>
<PARA> There is growing recognition, both in Australia and abroad, of the need to avoid two dangerous fallacies: first, that research must be required to meet utilitarian goals; and, secondly, that research for industry is inherently second rate and that product innovation is inconsistent with excellence in science. In much research, for example in molecular genetics, work carried out to expand the frontiers of knowledge was not recognised as having economic potential for many years. The award of Nobel Prizes to researchers in the laboratories of IBM, Bell, Du Pont, EMI, Burroughs-Wellcome and other firms confirms that some of the most intellectually challenging work anywhere is being carried out in industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The pursuit of curiosity-driven, basic research is essential to the survival of rich and lively science and technology in Australia. It provides the best training ground to stimulate and enthuse young scientists. However, the relationship between science and technology is very complex. Science provides the foundation of knowledge and skill formation which makes technology possible; it provides the context of continuity with past experience and future capability. Investment in science helps to provide the core capacity which is an essential precondition to the next stage of development in technology. If science is long term and cumulative, technology is immediate and perishable in a context of market volatility and frequent incremental change. There is a complex and unpredictable interaction between long term and short term research and between fundamental and applied research. In addition, there can be important synergistic effects between research projects which are advancing the frontiers of knowledge in different disciplines. For example, interdisciplinary cancer research-including physics, chemistry, biology and computer modelling-appears to have been even more productive than narrowly focused biological or physiological approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has encouraged major science and technology institutions to be more conscious of national needs and their responsibilities. Although much remains to be done, this process is now well under way. Change is never easy for those involved, however, and never free from transitional problems. Morale in some sections of the scientific community has understandably been affected. Redistribution of funding, particularly for the universities following the creation of the Australian Research Council, and for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), have raised concerns. In CSIRO's case, its direct budget allocations have been reduced in real terms both to reflect and encourage a move to greater external funding and industry linkages, and to contribute significantly to the Government's general budget tightening. This has inevitably limited funds for some areas of research. Institutions feel they now lack flexibility to respond to government urgings to re-evaluate priorities. There was some criticism by industry that government was giving ambiguous signals. </PARA>
<PARA> In a process of change there must be continuous monitoring. The Government has recently commissioned a number of reviews and investigations of science and technology capacity that have provided advice and information. These reports presented a number of theses indicating matters of general concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the scientific community there is some apprehension brought about by the changes occurring within science and technology. Although there is broad agreement with the general direction of government policy, some scientists fear that the Government's commitment is lessening and others that their sectoral interests may be damaged. This is related to a general concern about the perceived lack of a clear statement of government science and technology strategy or sufficient mechanisms to coordinate science and technology policy. It is a general view that decades of neglect and insufficient funding have led to a rundown in science and technology infrastructure. Human resources are also of concern with difficulties in attracting young people to a scientific career. It is a matter of grave concern that the numbers in scientific vocations have fallen in recent years, especially in physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering, although numbers remain high in computing and the life sciences including medicine. Equally worrying, as noted by the vice-chancellors, has been the decline in entry scores for students entering science disciplines compared with other areas. This confirms that there has been a loss of confidence about professional prospects in science. Frustration was evident from both researchers and research users about the difficulties of cooperating productively. Research users complain that researchers are not interested in addressing their needs. Researchers complain that commerce is not interested in funding research or in becoming innovative. The Government takes these expressions of concern seriously and has attempted to provide a response through the measures now announced. Policy development in science and technology is a continuing process and the Government will be monitoring carefully the adequacy of the response. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has an excellent track record in strategic and applied research which has largely been earned in the agricultural and mining sectors. Industries in these sectors have been responsible for the creation of much of Australia's wealth and have had a continuous focus on world markets, with all the opportunities and pressures which that implies. These sectors have been continually exposed to fierce competition and, as a result, have felt a strong need to invest in state-of-the-art technology, much of it developed by CSIRO in conjunction with local industry. This research has been widely acclaimed, both here and overseas. The Organisation will continue to provide vital research support for our rural, minerals and energy industries, as well as playing a major role in the development of Australia's manufacturing and information-based industries. These are areas in which CSIRO must play a major role. To encourage the Organisation to improve its links with industry, the Government has set a target for external income-that is, funds from other than its direct Budget appropriation-of 30 per cent. This is a modest target by international standards and recognises that a significant proportion of CSIRO's research is of broad public benefit and the need to maintain a core of long-term, strategic research. To assist it to reach this target, the Government has decided that CSIRO will now retain all external income without reductions in its Budget appropriation. This decision, taken in March 1989, boosted CSIRO's base funding by $2.1m, $6.6m and $11.6m, respectively, in each of 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. As a further commitment to enhancing the strength of the 1989 public research sector, the Government began a program in March to replace obsolete equipment in government research organisations, with $5m for CSIRO in 1988-89. The Government has now decided to allocate a further $90m over the next five years for equipment and priority projects. The allocation of this $90m will be decided by the Board of CSIRO, which is in the strongest position to weigh up the relative research importance of a range of technologies such as gene shears, vaccine and biological control, food processing, and other areas competing for funds. </PARA>
<PARA>ANSTO and AIMS</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Recent government decisions on budget continuity and retention of external revenue have given the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) the ability and incentive to raise revenue from industry and external sources. As part of the March statement to allocate additional funds for equipment in government laboratories, ANSTO received $500,000 and AIMS received $1.1m. The Government has now allocated a further $2.5m to ANSTO and $2.5m to AIMS for new equipment and research over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Marine Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A recent review of Australia's marine industries and marine science and technology capabilities by a committee chaired by Professor Ken McKinnon has identified Australia's achievements, strengths and commercial advantages. I am tabling the executive summary of this report and the Government's response to the recommendations. The Government believes that industry development should be targeted to areas in which Australia has particular opportunity and where industry is a willing partner. The Government has decided to provide an extra $3.9m for these activities, including additional staff and new projects, over the next five years. In addition, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will be announcing details of an extra $2m for the Bureau of Mineral Resources to maintain its marine seismic exploration capability at the highest standard. The Prime Minister has already announced support for a tidal measurement network and $1.8m over four years under the greenhouse research initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Higher Education</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already allocated additional resources to expand the higher education system. During the 1989-91 triennium, an additional $843m is provided to create 49,000 new places in higher education. Growth will be directed primarily towards priority fields such as engineering, computing, business and management studies. Funds of $430m will be provided during the triennium to meet capital requirements. In addition, a one-off special injection of $19m has been provided in 1989 for urgent renovation needs. The Government will increase the resources available for allocation to higher education institutions and researchers on the advice of the ARC. A total of $977.9m will be allocated through the ARC over the next five years, an increase of $466.4m over 1989 funding levels. This will be achieved by a major injection of new funds and by continuing the transfer of funds from institutional operating grants to the ARC. New funds will total $254.4m over the next five years with $56.9m going to increase support for postgraduate research students and the remaining $197.5m to develop the capacity of higher education institutions to support high quality research. </PARA>
<PARA>Health and Medical Research</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Australian medical researchers working in universities, research institutions and hospitals have won international acclaim and earned Australia a proud record for excellent research including the Nobel prizes won by Florey, Burnet and Eccles. Discoveries by Australian researchers have had a major impact on diagnosis and care. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has received increased funding for medical research throughout the term of the Hawke Government. To maintain Australia's very strong international record in medical research, the Government will also provide the NHMRC with an additional $39.8m over five years to upgrade and replace obsolete biomedical equipment and introduce new areas of research. The NHMRC will now also allocate a proportion of the funds which have been transferred from higher education operating grants to the ARC. </PARA>
<PARA>Greenhouse Research</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to support a national greenhouse research program so we can better understand and respond to greenhouse-related climate change. As announced by the Prime Minister, it will provide $7.8m during 1988-89 and 1989-90 for policy support and for research principally by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. </PARA>
<PARA>Human Resources</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the key resource of the science base, its people; researchers, engineers, technicians and students. Science and technology depend on the excellence and creativity of individuals and groups of individuals. Without such creativity no amount of money will produce results. If science and technology is to flourish in Australia, first class minds must be attracted to its pursuit, and they must be offered the chance for intellectual development and a supportive work environment. There is an unfortunate perception that science is difficult, remote, unrewarded and unrecognised. This is unfortunate because the opportunities for using a background in science and technology in interesting careers are much wider than just as professional scientists or engineers. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of initiatives has been taken to encourage students to remain in education and training, particularly in science and related courses. For example, the Commonwealth Government in cooperation with the States is promoting curriculum development in mathematics and science on a national basis. Specific strategies have been put in place to encourage more women to take mathematics and science at senior secondary level. One recent initiative is CSIRO's introduction of a cash bonus scheme to pay a substantial proportion of royalties earned on CSIRO projects to reward individual research scientists and teams for excellent research. The full bonuses under this scheme, which became effective from July 1988, will be paid to CSIRO scientists in July-August this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next five years the Government will upgrade the post graduate awards scheme. In 1990, the Government will make available $31.8m sufficient to provide for 1,450 continuing research scholarships and 900 new research scholarships. From 1990 all Commonwealth postgraduate research awards will be provided tax free at a minimum level of $12,734, equivalent to a taxable level of $15,000, compared to the current level of $10,415. Institutions will have the flexibility to set stipends above this level up to $16,433-equivalent to $20,000 taxed-according to their own research priorities and local needs. In addition, 30 new industry research scholarships will be available each year to link directly with industry. It is intended that by 1992 there will be a pool of about 80 or 90 of these awards. Further details will be given in the statement by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) will be announcing extra support for Australia's health and medical research force, and for postgraduate awards costing $5.7m over five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of public understanding of the central role which science and technology can play in economic growth and improved social welfare has already been described as crucial to the Government's policy objectives. To address these issues, the Government set up the Commission for the Future to study and advise on the impact of science and technology as we prepare to enter the twenty-first century. The Government has decided to support initiatives which further enhance public awareness of science and technology. It will create the Australia Prize, worth $250,000 tax free annually. This prize will be an international award for scientific excellence in promoting the welfare of the peoples of the world. The Government will also increase support for prizes for scientific journalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions with leaders of Australian industry have indicated willingness to become involved in raising the nation's long term scientific capacity and creating the industrial infrastructure needed for the future. The Government has therefore established an Industry-Science Foundation to create a mechanism which will alert business leaders to opportunities for long term patient capital investments in research-based products and services. These and other initiatives to improve the public awareness of science will receive $4m over the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Management and Coordination of Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The breadth of the Government's responsibilities in science and technology has persuaded the Government to review its coordination and consultation arrangements. The Prime Minister has already announced the formation of the Prime Minister's Science Council and the appointment of a Chief Scientist. In addition, at the officials' level and complementing the work of the Prime Minister's Council, the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology will be chaired by the Chief Scientist, with the Chief Science Adviser in the Industry, Technology and Commerce portfolio as deputy chair. I think it is appropriate to announce the appointment of Professor Michael Pitman, OBE, FAA, to that very important role. This Committee will bring together senior officers from all departments with an interest in science and technology to share information about their programs, policies, problems and opportunities. This management mechanism will ensure that coherence of policy is maintained and that government science and technology objectives are achieved efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) will be introducing arrangements for a Primary Industries and Energy Research Council to provide high level representation for research and development in the portfolio and to establish a consultative link with other major science and technology bodies and forums. The Government accepts that its central role in science and technology means that the decisions it takes will be major influences on developments. However, in accepting the responsibilities this role brings, the Government has rejected any notion that it should dictate in detail the pattern of Australian science and technology. The establishment within CSIRO and other research agencies of independent boards of management reflects this policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has aimed to have decisions taken by those best qualified to make the complex judgments required: research managers, researchers themselves and users of research. The Government is keenly aware that the scientific community is capable of offering useful advice and many worthwhile ideas. There are a variety of forums for this purpose including the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), the boards of government research establishments, the ARC and its associated committees and the learned academies. Ultimately, the kinds of efforts required if science and technology are to play the role envisaged for them by government are only likely to be made by people deeply committed to the enterprises in which they are engaged. Funds are limited and we need to make hard choices about priorities. We must be prepared to recognise and support excellence and contribute to world science, as we have in the past. We need far more research-industry interaction, but it must be a two-way process. Government recognises that research is a high risk activity, where final outcomes are uncertain. Funds are limited and we need to make hard choices about priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to clarify the issue of who pays for what. As the work in research and development advances towards production, it becomes clearly the responsibility of industry. Government should provide the national contribution to long term research, while recognising that government research organisations-and higher education institutions-ought to be increasingly involved as a resource in industry collaboration, at industry's expense. In the United Kingdom and Canada there has been an increasing emphasis on ensuring that government expenditure is directed towards long term generic research which contributes to the knowledge base and is generally available, while industry should be taking up and funding near-market research. However, in the United States, Europe and Japan, many major corporations are now undertaking much fundamental long term research in new areas, long in advance of the identification of products or processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly, the economic performance of modern nations is judged on the basis of their capacity to exploit new developments in technology-to capitalise on brain power and scientific expertise. To secure maximum benefit for the community, the importance of linkages between the development of new knowledge and the ways in which such knowledge can be used must be recognised. Innovation is the means by which we capture the benefits which science and technology may yield. The generation of new products and processes requires that research and development activities be fully integrated into the innovative processes of individual companies. The sheer complexity of science, in an age of ultraspecialisation, makes policy responses very difficult. Most Australians would admit to a degree of scientific illiteracy. We tend to downplay the importance of things we do not understand. The result has been that our collective response has sometimes been rather slow: witness our rejection of computers and transistors in the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This statement demonstrates the Government's commitment to science and technology as an investment in our nation's future. Science and technology are an integral part of government policies for structural adjustment of the Australian economy, for education, health and defence and for the environment. The Government's decision to increase expenditure substantially on science and technology by $390m over five years and to forgo significant revenue at a time of financial restraint shows the depth of its commitment, about $1 billion overall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy regarding science and technology is based firmly on achieving a better balance between government and business enterprise funded R and D. The incentives to industry will encourage increased investment in R and D and increased use of Australia's technological achievements. Government policy also recognises the need for high quality long term research to provide new ideas and new industries for the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> In this statement, the Government has made its commitment. Successful implementation of these strategies will need an equally vigorous commitment from researchers and from research organisations, higher education and industry. We need to add science and scientific method to our culture, both publicly and privately, to recognise its achievements and to see its achievers as role models-to talk it up and to make it part of our lives. This statement is the first step. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Science and Technology-Ministerial Statement, 8 May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>I also table the Science and Technology for Australia report and the Government response to recommendations of the McKinnon Committee. For the information of honourable members, I also table the following reports: Research, Innovation and Competitiveness-Policies for Re-shaping Australia's Primary Industries and Energy Portfolio Research and Development, Health and Medical Researchers Funding Paper; and Research for Australia-Higher Education Contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Opposition welcomes the statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones). Although we will have quite a number of things to say about the contents of the statements and about the Government's and Ministers' performances in the area of science and technology, the fact that the statements have been made today and these documents have been tabled increases the importance of parliamentary consideration of science and technology. It lifts the profile of science. It is a recognition, however belated, by this Government of the fact that science looms far more largely in our lives and in the Australian community than has been the case over the last six years. I start by expressing to the House some puzzlement about the apparent conflicts between some of the things that the Prime Minister has said and some of the things that the Minister has said. On page 2 of his statement the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Since coming to office-</PARA>
<PARA>and that is over six years ago-</PARA>
<PARA>my Government has pursued a consistent science and technology strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the bold statement of the Prime Minister, yet the very first sentence of the Minister's statement is:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first statement to consolidate government policy for science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand the Prime Minister says, `Since we have been in power we have followed a consistent strategy' and on the other hand it has taken the Minister six years after this Government was elected-not six months, not six weeks but six years-to say, `We are now delivering a consolidated statement on Government policy for science and technology'. I say to the House and to the Australian people that if there is chaos, if there is disbelief, if there is lack of faith, if there is lack of confidence in the science policies of this Government, they will find the reason in the words of the Minister, because it has taken the Government six long years to make any attempt to consolidate its policy in the areas of science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways, today's statements by the Prime Minister and the Minister represent a Damascus road conversion to the importance of science, certainly on the part of the Government. Nobody doubts that the Minister has had a longstanding interest in science. I would never take that away from him. He has always talked about it; he has written about it; he has pleaded about it; he has been rebuffed about it; he has been earbashed about it; and, at long last, he has a consolidated statement. Let us understand what has gone on over the last few years. This man, who in many ways has made his reputation by being somebody who was interested in science, has been, year after year, monumentally unsuccessful. There was a celebrated late night session between the Prime Minister and the Minister in which an attempt was made by the Minister to threaten resignation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that it is not true. Will he tell us whether it is true that he got an earbashing from the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins)? For years this Minister has been hammering unsuccessfully at the door. I suppose we should express some measure of commiseration with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today's statements-particularly that of the Prime Minister-are a vain attempt to give the impression of activity in an area in which, despite warnings from experts over the years, despite growing community concern, despite a catastrophic drift from science and mathematics in our universities and in our tertiary level institutions, the Government has been largely unmoved for six years. Today we have what is in many ways a piece of cosmetic adhockery. Why, for example, do we need a Science Council as well as the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC)? Why do we need that kind of duplication? If the existing arrangement is not working satisfactorily-and I do not denigrate the quality of the people working in that organisation; Professor Slatyer is a person of great ability who has served governments of all political persuasions in Australia extremely well-why on earth do we need the administrative nonsense of two bodies which will in many ways traverse the same field? That is an example of how many elements of the statements have been thrown together in cosmetic haste to give the impression that the Government is really serious and is doing something about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister knows and as those in the scientific community know, if something has been ignored for six years, and if, year after year, science has been downgraded, it takes years to reverse that process. Throwing a bit of money at it, establishing a few bodies, delivering a few high-sounding phrases, making a few speeches, and tabling a few documents will not reverse the damage that has been done to science infrastructure over six years of neglect and indifference. As recently as Saturday in the Weekend Australian there was some evidence of that neglect. An article on the front page of the Weekend Australian states:</PARA>
<PARA> The most important Federal Government statement on science in 40 years is to be greeted with further wide axing of research programs and mass sackings of scientists and support staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement to be presented . . . by . . . Mr Jones will come too late to save a large slice of research work by the nation's scientific flagship, the CSIRO. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that it is not true. That is always his interjection. The article continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Divisional chiefs have spent the past few days obeying management orders to draw up lists of research programs to be terminated, and names of staff to be dismissed or redeployed. Those lists were yesterday submitted to the CSIRO executive committee. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . the dismissals are now scheduled for a week later to distance them from the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>We will find out in a week's time whether it is true or untrue. In a week's time we will be asking whether these sackings and dismissals have gone ahead. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The terminations and sackings arise from a $14.2 million budget miscalculation for the CSIRO for the coming year, which is expected to intensify the substantial wind-down of research activity over the past seven years. </PARA>
<PARA>That, unrepudiated, is the word of one of the most respected rural writers in Australia. Bearing in mind the crucial role of rural research in the activities of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), that is the legacy of this Government's six years of failure, neglect and indifference. Some fine words, some hastily thrown together bodies, and some ad hoc decisions will not alter that fundamental fact. Under this Government, Australia is not ranked in about the middle of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in expenditure on research; we are now ranked fifteenth out of 24. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right in the middle! Expenditure on research originating from government and business sources in Australia equals 1.18 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. That is compared with 3.19 per cent in Japan and 2.88 per cent in the United States. Unless the Minister thinks he can get away with blaming the private sector, which he really tried to do-both he and the Prime Minister-it is of no use the Minister shaking his head; he and the Prime Minister both bucketed the private sector. They both said that it was the fault of the private sector. In real terms government support for science and technology has decreased by approximately 1.7 per cent compared with the figure in 1987-88.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that until a few months ago when the Government got the wind up because the scientific community started to put a lot of heat on it, the Government could not give a damn about science in this country. That is the reality. It is no good going back into ancient history. The Australian public is getting a bit tired of a government that, whenever it gets into a corner, reaches overseas to blame the foreigners or reaches back into ancient history in order to excuse the state of the Australian nation or the Australian economy. That might have worked a year after the Government was elected, it might even have worked two or three years after the Government was elected, but after the Government has been in power for six years it has got to accept the responsibility for the current state of affairs. To go on blaming someone else-to blame the rest of the world or Sir Edmund Barton or the Peloponnesian Wars or something else-for the fact that Australia is in a disastrous state of affairs is a bit rich. Not only do I think it is a bit rich but the ordinary Australian man and woman thinks it is a bit rich. It is about time the Hawke Government understood that government is about accepting responsibilities as well as taking credit for anything good that happens. This is the real saga of what has occurred in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning, I welcome the fact that the Government has tabled this statement. Any person who cares about the future of Australia recognises the enormous importance that we ought to place on science. I agree with many of the things that the Minister said. In their isolation, I welcome almost all of the initiatives that the Minister has announced. My starting point is that there has been a neglect, that the Government should have faced up to this some time ago and that the Minister was not as successful inside Cabinet as he should have been. I blame the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and the Minister for Finance more than I blame the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. They were the people who presided over the indifference of the Government for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister that a lot of the problems that he and this Government have had are based on the fact that the Government's rhetoric has run a long way ahead of its action and its reality. When one is a high profile, talkative Minister who writes books and establishes something of a reputation in an area, one of the problems is that if one does not deliver the money, the grants and the programs to match that rhetoric, the troops start to get a bit restive. The Minister knows very well that the troops not only have got restive but have started to march in the streets. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes deeper than the deprivation of funds. It also goes to the wind-down of the research capacity in our universities. I welcome the fact that the Government has increased the remuneration and the stipends for postgraduate scholarships. I think that is very welcome. We need a great deal more postgraduate work. I would ask the Minister-and perhaps he ought to ask his colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training-what he is going to do about the woeful salary structure in universities and tertiary institutions. One of the problems that we have in this country is the centralised wage fixing system that this Government boasts about every day at Question Time and says is responsible for any manner of economic, industrial, taxation and national miracles that this country has experienced over the last few years. One of the consequences of that centralised wage fixing system is that the Government is rapidly contributing to the brain drain out of universities and out of government institutions, particularly those which have to compete with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members know, my philosophy and the philosophy of my Party is of the kind that says that what can be done by the private sector ought not to be done by the Government. But there are some things that the public sector has to do. If we ask the public sector to do something, we have to give it the tools to do the job. One of the things that are woefully wrong with the Government's wages policy-and this problem will not be solved unless the Government is prepared to change the policy-one of the reasons that we are losing people and one of the reasons why CSIRO morale is lower now than it used to be is partly due to the lack of funds. In this statement the Government has done a minuscule amount to address that. But the problems are also due to the fact that the incentives to remain in organisations like CSIRO are less now than they used to be because the salary structure is deplorably inadequate. The Government has got to face that. This country has got to face the fact that it cannot go on expecting to have high quality university professors when it pays them about $60,000 a year. The Government talks about excellence, about science and about attracting quality people. We cannot insult the intelligence of people who spend years of their lives doing valuable research and achieving academic excellence and then say to them that we are going to pay them less than many people who work as ministerial staffers around this building receive. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a woefully disjointed set of priorities. One of the ways to encourage a greater elitism, shall we say, a greater sense of excellence, a higher morale and all of the things that will lift the importance of science and of excellence and achievement in our universities and institutions like CSIRO is to recognise that fact. I have had occasion in other environments to talk about this. I repeat that one of the real problems of a centralised wage fixing system-which those on the other side of the House regard as the greatest thing since sliced bread-is that it leads to an increasing impoverishment of the quality of people who are needed in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the great ironies of the economic debate in Australia that the party that so espouses the importance of a strong public sector, the Australian Labor Party, in fact pursues a policy that is doing more than any other party in Australia to undermine and denude of high quality people necessary parts of the public sector. I would say to the Minister that if he seriously wants to address the problem of morale and the problem of keeping high quality people in universities-much as he extols the virtue of private sector research, and I totally agree on that and would be the last not to support maximum incentives to private sector research-he knows as well as I do that the universities will continue to be a major repository of high quality research. Until the Government gets a better salary structure and a better set of remuneration incentives in universities and other tertiary level institutions it is going to continue to have a major problem. I simply say that if the Minister wants to find one of the reasons why science is not as highly promoted in this country, is not held in such esteem, is talked about in the way the Minister described, then there is something wrong with the priorities of a country that will pay its university professors no more than about $60,000 a year and then wring its hands and lament the fact that it cannot get really high quality people. I think that is something that both sides of politics in this country have got to face. The Government will not face it with its rigid, inflexible wage fixing system. It will face it if a more competitive approach is adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say that I had all the sympathy in the world with poor old George Maltby. The Government has treated him disgracefully. That is a very good example of what happens when somebody tries to run a public sector outfit in an efficient manner and to keep some high quality people. The Government knifes him in the back and throws him out. Until the Government throws out that kind of mentality and recognises that it will not get high quality people in CSIRO, universities or anywhere else until it pays them what they are worth and unless it gives to science the dignity of proper remuneration, we are not really going to get over that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the shadow Minister for science, the honourable member for Gippsland, (Mr McGauran), will have a number of other things to say about the detail of these two statements. I simply conclude my own contribution by saying, as I began, that although this statement is little more than a vain attempt to give an impression of concern and activity it reeks of adhockery and the politics of the cosmetic. It does appear to have been thrown together; it cannot repair the damage to science infrastructure in Australia that has developed over the years; it will not satisfy the reasonable demands of the scientific community in Australia. I recognise that, like any other pressure group, some members of the science community make unreasonable demands. Nonetheless, I welcome both statements because they show a belated interest in the issue. After six years the Minister has finally made a consolidated statement on science. I welcome it and I hope it is the beginning of a more mature and sensible debate on science in this country, because it is important to our future and it is an issue that has been neglected for many years. This statement, deficient though it is, is long overdue. For that reason, on behalf of the Opposition I welcome it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For those who care about the future of this country, there is an air of sadness about the statement of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones)-a sadness that will quickly be replaced with anger. So much was promised by the Government. Expectations were heightened to such an extent that the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), as well as that of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, will be bitterly greeted by an utterly disillusioned science community. The science statement also has an air of tragedy about it for those 500 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) officers for whom there is no remission or hope: their fate is sealed. They will soon cease to be employed by an organisation that was once a world leader.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moreover, in human tragedy terms, we have seen the final humiliation of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. He now stands stripped of any pretence of influence or authority within this Government. One needs only to return to the Prime Minister's statement to see time and time again how that humiliation has been completed. The Prime Minister now proudly boasts of appointing the Minister as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Technology. This is an absurdity. Is there a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Primary Industries and Energy? Is there a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Resources? Every Minister who takes the oath as Minister of state contributes to policy formulation. A meaningless title has been accorded to the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. It is a patronising, condescending dismissal of his influence and a confirmation of his inability to influence this Government. It is unique that we have as a Minister assisting the Prime Minister a person who is already Minister for that portfolio. It is simply propping up the Minister. It is a pay-off to him for withdrawing one of his numerous threats of resignation. The Prime Minister in his statement says:</PARA>
<PARA> In this role Mr Jones . . . will exercise . . . responsibility for the development and coordination of science policy across the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>As Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, what has he been doing for six years? He suddenly has this new responsibility of science policy and development. For heaven's sake! On a personal level, my heart goes out to him for having to stand up in this Parliament, before the science community, and accept from the Prime Minister this responsibility for science policy within the Government. I did not think that the Minister could be bought off so easily. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister goes on to say that there will be a new body, the Prime Minister's Science Council. Of course, he will chair it as a temporary, stopgap measure, I have no fear. The Minister will be its Deputy Chairman. In one sense, I welcome this proposal because it has been a coalition initiative to have a ministerial council. I think this will be a watered down version of it, but we will at least give it an opportunity to meet. The Prime Minister tells us that its first meeting will be in October. At the top of its agenda, the very first item, will be-wait for it-a consideration of the status of science in Australia! What events have brought this Government to this House this afternoon to try to explain away its failures over so many years? Indeed, the Minister in his statement following the Prime Minister's statement, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has recently commissioned a number of reviews and investigations of science and technology capacity that have provided advice and information. These reports presented a number of themes indicating matters of general concern. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has to hand all the proof, all the analysis, it needs of the state of science in Australia. If this is evidence of the direction of this new Science Council, science will be no better off than it has been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the present status of science in Australia is akin to the untouch- ables in the caste system of India. It is at the very bottom of the pile. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said, it is extraordinary and it is political ineptness in what is supposed to be a political initiative by the Government to stave off the criticism mounting throughout the science community and the electorate at large for the Minister to say in the very first sentence of his statement:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first statement to consolidate Government policy for science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA>By way of interpolation, the Minister said that it involved five of the most senior Ministers. But that is no better an explanation for the failure of the Government to face up to its responsibilities. Why have these five Ministers not got together previously to provide a coordinated, coherent strategy. The Prime Minister has, in many ways, dumped his Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. There are a number of contradictions in the two statements this afternoon. For instance, the Prime Minister had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We have introduced new research and development promotion and incentive schemes, and reorganised our research organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>That is prior to today's initiatives. What have been the new research and development promotion incentive schemes over the past five years? Let us call the Government's bluff. I want to know what it did before today. The Prime Minister, as some sort of explanation for inactivity over the past five years, thinks he can just come in here and blandly assert that his record is clear and that in the past there have been all these wonderful initiatives. What are they? The only one that comes to mind is the 150 per cent tax incentive introduced in 1986. Whilst the coalition supports the continuation of that, let us not go overboard. If that is the only initiative on which the Government wishes to hang its hat, it will be sadly disappointed. There has been a $423m net increase in expenditure for private sector research compared with a cumulative cost of $310m. Australian science is roughly $110m better off. So we welcome it. But honourable members opposite should not think that that one initiative over a six-year period is sufficient to have us believe that the Government has ever taken science seriously. It took science seriously only when 1,000 scientists marched in pouring rain through the streets of Canberra. The Prime Minister gets serious only when he has a political problem on his hands. The Prime Minister's statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a massive expansion of higher education places and a dramatically lifted school retention rate. </PARA>
<PARA>This has been cleverly worded by one of the myriad speech writers the Prime Minister unquestionably employs. It is supposed to give the impression that there has been an increase, or at least a maintenance, of science students and graduates. That is the implication. Why have this in a science statement if that is not the impression the Government wants to create. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business has more intellectual honesty than the Prime Minister. The Minister says that there is a grave crisis in regard to science students, science graduates and the education system. I will quote exactly from the Minister's statement, which repudiates the glib assertion and political intent of the Prime Minister's comment. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of grave concern that the numbers in scientific vocations has fallen in recent years, especially in physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering, although numbers remains high in computing and the life sciences including medicine. Equally worrying, as noted by the Vice Chancellors, has been the decline in entry scores for students entering science disciples compared to other areas. This confirms that there has been a loss of confidence about the professional prospects in science. </PARA>
<PARA>For heaven's sake, one would have thought that there would be greater coordination between the Prime Minister and the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the supposed initiatives which are contained in the statement billed as the most important science statement for 40 years. This is a double-edged sword for the Government because now that it has failed utterly to satisfy the concerns of the science community it will be impaled on its own rhetoric. Over the years Opposition members have said a great deal in this House about CSIRO. Suffice to say that CSIRO is on the verge of disintegration. Morale is at rock bottom. It does not matter who one speaks to within CSIRO, dissatisfaction reigns across the board. The Government's approach to CSIRO is to provide a total of $90m over five years: on average, an $18m a year increase in funding for CSIRO. Just ask the 500 CSIRO officers who are about to be retrenched whether or not this is good enough. This approach falls a long way short of restoring CSIRO to the level of real funding it received five years ago. Indeed, CSIRO has incurred a 28 per cent loss in funding in real terms over the past five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO, in a submission to the interdepartmental committee which was to report to Cabinet late last year, stated that it needed $40m just to restore it to the funding level prior to last year's federal Budget, and $20m for the immediate years following so as to maintain its funding. This $18m average a year falls a long way short of that requirement. Moreover, we are told by the Minister that this additional funding for CSIRO will go into priority areas. The 500 staff about to be retrenched in the next few days-or, if the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), who has directed CSIRO to halt the retrenchment process, has his way, it will be the next few weeks-are mostly engaged in the mining and agriculture area. Therefore, their training, experience and skills do not allow them to be easily transferred across to these new priority areas which will centre on Senator Button and his Department's obsession with manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret very much that CSIRO will remain a crippled organisation after today. Just this year alone, CSIRO is struggling under a $40m budget shortfall owing to miscalculations resulting from projected asset sales, the Finance Department's efficiency dividend of 1.5 per cent as well as reductions in appropriations. The Government is still taking more from CSIRO than it is handing back. One of the best kept secrets of the past couple of years is that CSIRO has been realising its assets to say afloat. The $14.2m shortfall in its budget, one of the principal causes of the retrenchment of 500 staff, has been caused by a shortfall in its asset realisation program. In order to continue, CSIRO has been selling off its assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look now at higher education. We are told that some $200m will be made available over five years for research efforts within universities and some $55m will be allocated for graduate stipends. How could increased funding be knocked back for graduate stipends? The fact is that the funding for the equipment and research programs within universities will be scarcely improved. So what are the postgraduates to do with dilapidated and outdated equipment and restricted programs? The Smith Report, universally accepted by the science community, recommended $281m over three years, which is $90m a year. Yet, the Government is offering universities only $50m a year which, again, falls a long way short. </PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation of the Smith report has been rejected, that is, that the increase in funding be shared between the Australian Research Council (ARC) and universities with a proven record in research and development. There will be uproar in the universities: they simply will not cop the handing over, lock stock and barrel, of this increased funding to the ARC which they regard as a centralised and bureaucratic-even politicised-body. The universities will respond angrily to today's sadly mistaken intentions-if that is the kindest word that I can find-and certainly failure on the part of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This country faces nothing less than a crisis in its science and technology research institutions. That has been stated by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, whose contribution I found regrettably hollow and somewhat esoteric. Australia confronts a science gap of a similar kind as that faced by the United States of America some three decades ago during the 1950s-a science gap in which our technological skills and international economic competitiveness have been lost to our rivals. When faced with the national humiliation and the strategic crisis brought on by the Soviet technological advances of the 1950s, the American Government was able to respond to the challenge, exercise leadership, win the confidence of its research organisations and higher education institutions and demonstrate the vision necessary to formulate a comprehensive strategy for the future of science and technology for decades to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement we have heard today is a pale and flat imitation of that American initiative. The truth is that the Hawke Government lacks the political vitality to galvanise a nation around a great cause; it lacks the will to triumph over the petty rivalries of Ministers to build an integrated science and technology strategy. As in other areas, the Government stands convicted by its own rhetoric. It has boasted that it is honing the economy to a fine technological edge. It has boasted that scientific innovation will lead to a resurgence in its export competitiveness. It has boasted that all is well with Australian research. Today's statement is proof-if any were needed-of the hollowness of the Government's self-proclaimed triumphs and of the emptiness of its self-congratulatory rhetoric. It is deeply symbolic that the attempted cover-up of the Government's empty commitment to Australia's science capacity comes just as 500 scientists and officers are to be retrenched from Australia's premier research organisation, CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed the next generation of Australians. It has mouthed commitments to the science and technology community but, as the statements read to the House today show, it has proved itself unable to deliver a future for Australians. Instead of policy, the Government presents us with the idiosyncratic Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, whose esoteric interests extend to endorsing programs for nuclear or cold fusion, which every reputable American scientific organisation is currently repudiating. The Prime Minister has appointed the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business as his assistant Minister. One can imagine the Prime Minister with his obsession with matters sporting listening to the poor old Minister rabbiting on about cold fusion and superconductivity. Who is kidding whom? The Prime Minister has dismissed out of hand someone who is undoubtedly qualified to direct science policy in this country. Instead, the Government gives him his head, in the most condescending and patronising way, to pursue phantoms up dry gullies. </PARA>
<PARA> Countries such as Japan and Taiwan have found that one of the key factors in industrial reconstruction and international competitiveness is a commitment by the government and the private sector to sustained and high levels of research and development. In fact, this Government, in complete defiance of international precedents, has structured its supposed great science and technology initiative about an old idea. That idea is simply to extend the existing 150 per cent tax deduction for research and development. The Government has simply run out of ideas. That idea of extending the 150 per cent tax deduction should, at best, represent only one feature of what ought to be a multifaceted, comprehensive strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing inherently wrong with the creative core of Australian science. At the level of human potential, Australian science ranks with the rest of the world. Australians have met with worldwide acclaim for their scientific achievements. Australians have led the world in medical research, mineral exploration and processing, computer software, genetic engineering, scientific and medical research, optical and radio astronomy, and signal processing. Yet the responsibility for our inability to exploit this human resource lies with the Government's failure to create the setting and provide the strategy for science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed is a set of integrated policy initiatives set in the context of a wider realisation of the impact of economic imperatives upon scientific research. The Government, today and in the past, and no doubt in the future, has failed to address the wider relationship between rates of research and development, particularly in the private sector, and its disastrous macro-economic policies. One is delving into the realms of the ridiculous if one thinks that the investment climate that this Government has allowed to spring up in the private sector in any way encourages private sector investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The crude manipulation of monetary policy, which has resulted in record high interest rates and the shortages of venture capital, escalating rates of inflation and frightening fluctuations in exchange rates, has undermined the private sector's capacity to plan in any strategic context. For example, given the relative smallness of our private domestic industries, long term research and development efforts geared to creating export markets are incompatible with exchange rates which have moved between US65c and US90c. Is it any wonder that the private sector is hesitant about commercialising research in such a profoundly uncertain economic environment? The medium term implications of this predicament are alarming. The Government's persistent failure to develop and to put in place an integrated science and technology strategy means that it will simply be impossible for Australia to sustain its economic relevance to the rest of the Asian-Pacific region. In short, it is imperative that we maximise our research potential to increase our productivity and competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Relatedly, if our agricultural and mineral resources are to continue to yield the massive export earnings which currently prop up the economy and to seize markets in the expanding regional economies, it behoves the Government to resuscitate the very rural research programs its policies deliberately have strangled. But in this, as with so many other areas of Australian scientific research, the Government has been driven by short term economic expediency. It is primary industry which provides 80 per cent of our export income. But it is the research effort, which will ensure that this sector remains qualitatively superior to that of our rivals, which has been inexplicably slashed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, today's statement does nothing to even forestall the decline, let alone boost the efforts of the CSIRO. For example, take the rural related divisions of the CSIRO which are of fundamental importance in respect of this country's current accounts earnings. Such divisions as Entomology return huge rates of return relative to government outlays. Yet in 1988 the Division of Entomology lost 20 scientific staff. Similarly, the Soils Division, so crucial to maintaining the productivity of Australian agriculture, has been forced to sack 12 staff, with another eight soon to be made redundant. So the hypocrisy of Government Ministers, such as the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, who parades around this country, pretending that soil degradation is of prime interest to this Government, is revealed. The Soils Division has been slashed to a point that is almost irrecoverable. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking, in order to maintain and extend research on mineral and rural exports-exports to the value of $34 billion per year-the Government spends only $175m in 1987-88 terms. Mineral and rural exports earn this country $34 billion in export earnings. Yet the Government spends only $175m assisting the productivity of those export oriented industries. In other words, the Government reinvests little more than one per cent of the value of its rural and manufacturing exports in research. </PARA>
<PARA> Government policies have deeply comprised technology transfer and alienated us from world science. Let me give some examples: firstly, they deny the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), for ideological reasons only, any role in research into the nuclear fuel cycle; secondly, they show a casual indifference to the proposed national space program, which has the potential to ensure that we utilise our own space science achievements and channel high technology developments directly into Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The scientific community is shedding its most talented scientists owing to inadequate career prospects. The best and the brightest of our disgruntled scientists are being lured overseas at an alarming rate. This is the source of the brain drain. Our scientists are being enticed by higher salaries and more stable career paths offered by institutions and universities which recognise their worth as human resources capable of enhancing national prosperity, be it either in the short or in the long term. Others are falling out of the system and entering non-science professions, simply because research funding for projects dries up with the unending science funding crisis. The word is out about science careers. Australia's youth shuns the prospect of science as being able to provide a viable career. Universities around Australia report plummeting entry scores for science-related courses. In most universities in this country, science is amongst the courses with the lowest entry requirements. The best of our secondary school students do not even consider science-related courses as an option when considering career choices. </PARA>
<PARA> The science inertia has seeped into our schools as well. Australian school students are falling behind the performance levels of their peers in other countries in relation to their familiarity with basic science and mathematics concepts. Over the last decade there has been a drift of 40 per cent of students away from mathematics and science and technology at the completion of their senior secondary school education. They know that there is no career stream for science. </PARA>
<PARA> The collapse of the support infrastructure for research both constrains and humiliates scientists, for they are required to work within laboratories that are dilapidated and outdated. I refer simply to the report of the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) in its very recent study entitled The Core Capacity of Australian Science and Technology. Amongst other things, it concludes that working conditions in our laboratories are quite woeful and confirms that a career in science is no longer attractive for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA> We are witnessing a closing of the Australian mind and the emergence of a new cultural cringe. Is it any wonder then, that this country now produces fewer doctors of philosophy in the core sciences such as physics, chemistry, maths, statistics and computing than it did in 1984, notwithstanding greatly increased levels of demand? We have now reached the stage whereby 20 to 30 per cent of our computer scientists and engineers are imported to plug the domestic shortfall. In short, the crisis in funding continues. This Government has not addressed the most fundamental, basic concerns of the scientific community, and the Australian electorate at large will be all the poorer. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no greater responsibility entrusted to a government than to prepare for future generations. This Government, by turning its back on the legitimate claims of not one organisation or a handful of individuals, but the unanimous pleas of the scientific community of Australia, is condemning Australians to suffer a lower standard of living well into the future. It is therefore breaking the trust that any elected government has, whether it be CSIRO or the higher education research institutions, whether it be individuals employed in or wanting to enter science as a career. There is nothing in today's statement that will alleviate the problems. There is nothing in today's statements that will convince the scientific community that the Government is fundamentally prepared to redress its mistakes of the past. The humiliation, the stripping of the authority of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business is complete, and the political cynicism, by the superficial intervention today of the Prime Minister, is confirmed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It really is a telling mark of the Government's inability to address this issue that this debate is before the House today on a motion of the Opposition. If we listen to the rhetoric of the Government we would expect that every second day in this Parliament we would be debating micro-economic reform, because straight after the 1987 election, and during that campaign, no less a person than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told us that micro-economic reform would be the No. 1 priority of his third term in government. That sentiment was echoed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who said that micro-economic reform was critical to getting the big picture right, and he is totally committed to getting the big picture right. But of course nothing has happened. When have we had the opportunity, at the Government's initiative, to debate these issues in this Parliament? We have not. Of course the press at the time were aware of the importance of micro- economic reform, and of course we on this side of the Parliament understand it only too well. At that time many of the more literate members of the Gallery were writing articles with headings such as `Waterfront reform will be the test for Willis'. I agree that it will be the test for the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis). He has to address this issue, and we all know why, because Australia's macro-economic performance is nothing short of appalling. We have an inflation rate of about 7 per cent, depending on which index we take account of. We have a current account deficit of about $15 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seventeen billion dollars, I am told, and rising. We have a foreign debt of about $100 billion-plus. Of course the position with coastal shipping and the waterfront is nothing short of scandalous, some people say rotten, some people say rancid. But this Government has been in power for some six years; in fact, this is the seventh year of its term in office. Some would say it is getting the seven-year itch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and the Prime Minister came in here today, purporting to do something about science, but in those six years in office the Government has done nothing. There have been about 30 government and quasi-government reports into shipping and the waterfront and nothing has happened. The cost is astronomical. The cost of the waterfront has been estimated at about $850m. A colleague will be speaking about that later. The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) has estimated that coastal shipping is estimated to cost the Australian economy $250m to $550m. The IAC has also estimated that, through transport deregulation alone, savings of some $3.2 billion will be available to the Australian economy. There could be an extra $6 billion in gross domestic product growth, and $1.1 billion of that growth could be available from the waterfront and coastal shipping. That report was done by the IAC at the behest of the Business Council of Australia and a number of other industry organisations. The Government at this stage is, of course, still sitting firmly on its hands, working out how it can do and say something without really doing anything, because to do anything would bring it into conflict with the vested interests and the No. 1 vested interest is the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should have a booming coastal shipping industry. We should have a significant international liner trade, but we do not, and for one reason-labour market inefficiencies. In relation to coastal shipping, just about everybody who can go to some other form of transport has done so. People have gone to rail and to road. Of course this Government is incapable of addressing the problems in rail and road transport. If it understood the matrix of transport, it would understand that coastal shipping can put pressure on State governments to do something about rail inefficiencies and if we take some of the road freight pressure off our road system, it would not fall to pieces as rapidly and the demand for government funding would not be as high. But of course the Government does not understand these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> To give honourable members some idea of how bad coastal shipping in Australia has got, let me cite some examples. It is all very well to talk about the savings that would be available, but let us bring it down to specific examples that people can understand. I asked the Minister a question at Question Time today about this and he said it is probably true. Let me tell him that it is true. He talked about the position of the unions. The position of the unions was validated and supported by a former Labor Minister for Transport, the Hon. Charlie Jones. So it is no good saying that we were in power for 30 years. That little deal was done by the Australian Labor Party and it has been perpetuated for nearly seven years by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking about specific inefficiencies. The Tasmanian Confederation of Industries has told us that it is cheaper for it to ship skim milk powder from Tasmania to Taiwan at $72 a tonne than from Tasmania to Melbourne at $82 a tonne. Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd said that newsprint from a major European port to London was less than $50 a tonne compared with almost double that amount to ship it the same distance from Hobart to Sydney. That is absolutely astounding. The list goes on. It is cheaper to bring coal from South Africa to Tasmania than from Port Kembla. If I did not know better, I could suggest perhaps that that is why this Government is so strong on its trade policy with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that we are totally uncompetitive. I have worked in the alumina industry. Let me cite some figures. It is cheaper to take alumina from Sardinia to Tasmania than from Gladstone. Just imagine how much more it costs to bring it up a bit further from Gove. Australia is a very efficient producer of salt but we cannot compete with the salt market of the Pacific because it is cheaper to ship it from Mexico than from around the coast of Australia. The list goes on. There is a new cement factory in Darwin. The people who run that say that rather than bring their cement clinker from their Adelaide plant, it is cheaper to bring it from Japan. The reason is the cost of shipping, and it has been perpetuated under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is a lack of international competitiveness. Why does that arise? Simply for one reason-we have cabotage. There is no pressure on the system to make it competitive. It is a nice cosy deal which involves the shipping industry, the unions and the Government. Until we get international pressure, there will be no movement. This is one of the issues on which I agree wholeheartedly with the Prime Minister. I wonder whether the Minister at the table agrees with his leader. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia gave the Prime Minister a hard time about his Government's failure to do anything about micro-economic reform. When the Prime Minister and the Government are under pressure they say and do nothing and hope that people do not write anything down and will forget about it. The problem is that people do write things down and they have to live up to their performances or break promises. At the present time, our Prime Minister has broken quite a few promises. On 11 October last year, in a speech to the Business Council of Australia, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can think of no reasonable argument why employers and unions in our manufacturing and export sectors must adjust to international trading conditions while stevedoring and shipping remain shielded. </PARA>
<PARA>Do honourable members know what the Prime Minister was really saying? He was saying, `I am in favour of doing away with cabotage. We are going to allow foreign competition on the Australian coast; we are going to liberalise the waterfront; we are going to have competition in a previously completely protected sector of the Australian economy'. Of course, he has run a mile from that statement since then. What we have not seen is the Minister for Transport and Communications rushing into print and supporting that statement by telling us exactly how he will implement his Prime Minister's promise. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems which we have in the Australian shipping industry come down to manning levels. We have made some progress: they have come down from outrageous levels to about 21 or 23, but the problem is that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is the organisation with which we have to compare ourselves, has come down to 18 and is dropping. At a manning level of 21 or 23, we are just not making enough progress. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other problems facing this country. Australian leave entitlements mean that, on average, 2.2 crews have to be engaged to keep a ship operational all year round, compared with 1.7 for OECD countries; and those countries are making progress in that matter. We also have other problems. There are some outrageous work practices and the rorts available in this waterfront and coastal shipping industry are absolutely legendary. I will not tell the Minister about them because I am sure he has the same document as I have. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to talk about the response by the industry and respected economic commentators to the so-called Deveson task force report. In this place the other day, the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was busy quoting Ross Gittins in defence and praise of the Government. Obviously, Mr Gittins is considered to be an acceptable economics commentator for the Government. Let me quote what Mr Gittins has to say about coastal shipping:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants to squib on coastal shipping, all it has to do is accept the report of the shipping reform task force. It surfaced last week and it's a dud. </PARA>
<PARA>The major failing of this report is that it says as long as the coastal shipping industry `deserves public and Government support, as long as it displays a willingness to improve'. Mr Gittins goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> That might be the right attitude for a confessor-priest, but it's hardly an appropriate way to run the economy, especially since the report itself doesn't attempt to bring about substantial reform in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gittins further said:</PARA>
<PARA> The report shows `a willingness to continue changing at a snail's pace, provided the taxpayer subsidises the change and provided the benefits of change stay in the industry and aren't passed to consumers'. </PARA>
<PARA>The report makes no comment about how cost savings and improvements in efficiency will be passed on to the consumer, that is, the poor users of the shipping industry-the shippers. Obviously, the unions would think that this report was not a bad idea because it could be the basis for another wage claim, an increase in remuneration of some other work practice deal. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recognises the need for competition on the coast, but it does not do anything to achieve it. I apologise to the Minister for citing Mr Gittins because, in this report, he most unfairly refers to him as the `Minister for wimpishness'. That is far too harsh and it prejudges the matter because, in the next session, I am sure that the Minister will deliver a full-blooded robust statement as to how the Government will genuinely increase competition in coastal shipping. If he does not, Mr Gittins will, of course, have been correct. Michelle Grattan, writing in the Age nearly 12 months ago, set the test when she said:</PARA>
<PARA>Coastal shipping is the test for Mr Willis. He either delivers on this or he acknowledges that the Government has no commitment to genuine reform. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is prepared to apply pressure to various sectors of the economy but it is not prepared to take on the trade union movement. The signs are not good. The Minister intervened not so long ago when the waterfront union said, `You have to stop this industrial commission case and have a conference because we are going to lose and we don't want any pressure'. Of course, the Government would like everybody to believe that the industry is happy with Mr Deveson's report, but that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Bulk Commodities Group (NBCG) has written to most people expressing its views. It has expressed major concerns. Only 7 per cent of our coastal trade is in general cargo. The bulk trade is locked into coastal shipping. Bulk traders are still there because they have to be; there is not much else they can do. Most of the general trade goes across the Tasman because not much else can be done about it. In relation to competition on the coast, the NBCG states:</PARA>
<PARA>Competition on the coast is essential to provide the ongoing market stimulus to improve efficiency and to ensure that the benefits of reform are passed on to shippers. </PARA>
<PARA>It says that the task force report acknowledges that. This letter goes on to say that the report does nothing to ensure that criterion is implemented. Another issue which is important in this whole debate is the question of company employment. Mr Deveson in his report suggested that:</PARA>
<PARA>The question of company employment be left on the long-term agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just a euphemism for saying, `Let's put it in the too hard basket because we don't want to address it. The one thing that will happen if we address the question of company employment is that the unions will take their bat and ball home; the Government will have an industrial problem which, in the current climate is a political problem and with an election coming up we cannot afford that'. This report is novel in this area. The Minister knows this and that is why this issue has been put on the long term agenda. The NBCG believes that a move towards direct company employment should commence immediately. The people who use the trade want this and there should be an expectation included in the Minister's statement when it is finally made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister knows exactly what should be done to reform coastal shipping because he has seen our coastal shipping document. I remind the Minister that he has to move immediately to remove cabotage. This is an important issue. There are some similarities and parallels with the Government's quandary over the third runway. The decision on this matter was difficult for the Government which had a vested interest. It was a vested interest for the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch); but, after a lot of public pressure and debate, the Minister and the Cabinet finally decided to take the morally and economically correct decision to build the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA> Exactly the same criteria apply to this decision. The Minister knows what should be done; he knows that his position is to protect a vested interest and he knows that he will have to face the matter eventually. What he should do is address the issue and the need for reform and take the correct decision which exposes the coastal shipping industry and the waterfront to some genuine competition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject which the Opposition has brought on for discussion today as a matter of public importance is, I must say, mightily gratuitous because the Government does not need to be told by the Opposition or by anybody else about the importance of shipping and waterfront industry reform. That is because the Government set the agenda. This matter which has been raised as an issue by the Opposition is not something which the Government has been reluctantly dragged kicking and screaming to address. This is something which the Government set out to address when the Opposition had done nothing about it all the time when it was in government for the previous 33 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To hear the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) speak, we would think that this has been a fundamental part of the Opposition's platform for a long time. The fact is that, for many years, the Opposition allowed the situation to develop in which there was gross inefficiency in the shipping industry and on the waterfront; it condoned it and allowed it to happen. That is the reality of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense, this is a microcosm of the broader aspect of Opposition policy when it was in government during those long decades because basically it allowed Australia to develop in the post-war period in a structural way which is totally inappropriate to the circumstances required by the nation in the 1980s and 1990s-and the Opposition now knows this. The Opposition is condemned by its past. It developed this country on a totally inappropriate basis. It was not concerned about international competitiveness. All it was concerned about was ensuring that there was a good time for manufacturers behind higher tariff barriers, that farmers were able to get good prices for their products and that mineral products could be sold on world markets. Other than that, international competitiveness did not matter. We did not have internationally competitive manufacturing industries or services industries because the Opposition did not do anything to develop them. Part of the reason those industries were uncompetitive on world markets was that the then Government did nothing to ensure that we had competitive shipping industries or waterfront industries. That is the reality of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally untrue for the honourable member for Richmond to say, as he said in this debate, that this Government came into office and did nothing like the coalition parties had done. The reality is that we have done much to address these issues. In relation to shipping, in particular, it has not been just a matter of obtaining reports. Substantial steps have been taken to bring about change already. In relation to the broader aspects of the honourable member for Richmond saying that we have done nothing about micro-economic reform, the reality is that there has been a stack of things happening. The honourable member must have been in cloud cuckoo land for the last half dozen years if he has not realised that there have been--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will name a few. Obviously the honourable member has been there too. There has been a whole stack of government business enterprise reforms-enterprise after enterprise such as Australia Post, Telecom Australia and the Australian National Line. I am talking about micro-economic reform in general, which the honourable member for Richmond addressed. Several of the biggest enterprises in this country have been totally restructured. We have deregulation of the telecommunications industry, in respect of which legislation is about to descend on the Parliament. Deregulation has been announced for the aviation industry, which the previous Government did nothing about and allowed the two-airlines system to operate for many years. Legislation has been brought before the House recently to reform international line shipping. There has been a vast array of micro-economic reform just in recent times. Members of the Opposition apparently have just been wandering around not knowing what has been going on in this place. There has been a deluge of economic reform in this Parliament which the Opposition did not even know has been happening. Obviously, members of the Opposition are wandering around not knowing what is actually going on in this place, so one should not take any notice of what they say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, many things have been happening in relation to shipping and the waterfront. In relation to shipping, in particular, it has not only been a matter of getting the basis for a substantial reform but already reform has been implemented. Soon after we came to office we took action to implement the report of the Crawford Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping. We then set up the Maritime Industry Development Committee (MIDC). This brought about the capacity for further change, which is being implemented. We decided that the pace of reform was not good enough and we requested the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) to undertake an information report on shipping and finally established the shipping reform task force. Action taken in respect of the first two items-the Crawford legislation and the MIDC-has enabled us to reduce crew numbers. The average crew size has been reduced from 33 in 1982 before we came to office to 29 now, and the figure is going down. The procedure is in place, through the MIDC, to ensure further reductions. Under the MIDC, new ship crew sizes on dry bulk ships have been reduced from the high thirties and the best practice of 33 to 21 under the MIDC, a 36 per cent decline. The honourable member for Richmond says that nothing is happening. He does not know what is going on out there. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been able to reduce crew sizes by bringing about reforms on the employment front in the shipping industry, which are leading the way for award restructuring in this country. These reforms embrace the whole concept of integrated ratings, involving crews being multi-skilled so that they can work both in the engine room and on deck. There is also amalgamation in the catering area, so there is multi-skilling in this respect. Career paths have been established so that people can progress up the ladder. This has not been capable of being achieved before. There is a broad banding of classifications so that we do not have the narrow demarcation of classifications which has marked the industry in the past. All that is in place now. It is happening now on the new ships coming in under the provisions of the MIDC. That has been assisted, in terms of development of new ships, by capital grants and tax concessions. A 7 per cent taxable grant and a five-year write-off of depreciation are the beginnings of very substantial reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The MIDC process is far from being the ultimate in our view, but it was a substantial and important development because it built on the initial development of the Crawford Committee which enabled some immediate reductions in crew sizes to take place. There are five MIDC ships on the coast at present. There are 14 on order and more are expected to be ordered. Leaving aside the shipping reform task force, there is in place a process under which crew levels are being reduced from the extremely high levels which the previous Government allowed to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that this is an industry in which there is a lot of industrial disputation. In the last year of the previous Government 1,593 ship days were lost in industrial disputation. Last year there were 72 days lost, not 1,593. This is a dramatic reduction. Every year that we have been in office the figure has been vastly below the level it was under the previous Government. We have seen a tremendous reduction of industrial disputation in this industry. In relation to union rationalisation, the number of unions has been reduced from seven to three. But the honourable member for Richmond says that nothing is happening. That number will be reduced most likely to two in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in cooperation with the industry, has taken steps to achieve very substantial reforms. But we agree that it is not enough. In the circumstances that this country faces, we need to eliminate, as rapidly as possible, the blockages to efficiency in this industry. We sought for this matter to be re-opened and for further investigation to take place to see what further efficiencies could be achieved. We ordered the IAC report which basically said that there were still substantial inefficiencies and that opening up the industry to foreign competition was the best outcome because it did not believe that worthwhile agreement could be reached by the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government took the view that the parties should be given the chance to reform themselves and it established the shipping reform task force. That task force brought forward its recommendations recently. Essentially, what that involves is crew sizes on major Australian trading ships being reduced to an average size of 21 over the next three years by addressing not just new ships but the crew levels on all the existing ships which were untouched by the MIDC process. This involves further re-training of seafarers in the various skills that are needed to reduce crew levels and to achieve more efficient work practices to operate ships with smaller crews. It involves reducing the work force by 1,000 from a work force of less than 5,000 over the next three years. This will be a dramatic reduction in the numbers employed in the industry. This change will be achieved by a redundancy scheme in which the Government has been asked to play a substantial part. If this recommendation is to be carried through, we would see the average crew size drop to 21 by 1992. For MIDC ships it would drop to 18 or less for ships post-1992. In the 1990s we would be looking to new ships coming in with an average crew size of 14 to 16.</PARA>
<PARA> If this report were to be implemented, we would be looking at very substantial reductions in crew levels to levels which would certainly compare well with those of the Organisation for Ecomonic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ships manned by national crews as opposed to flag of convenience ships. Indeed, many flag of convenience ships have larger crew numbers but lower costs in terms of wages. But in terms of getting our numbers down to those of comparable countries, there is no doubt that this kind of reform would achieve that. Does this mean that nothing is happening? Does a report like this mean that nothing is being achieved? Of course it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the waterfront, we have pulled together a number of reports which had been in place, going back to the shore-based shipping cost report of the Commission in 1984 under Ian Webber from Mayne Nickless. That and other reports have been pulled together under the Inter-State Commission. The Inter-State Commission's report, which was brought before us recently, represents the most comprehensive analysis of the waterfront industry in the history of this nation. It suggests a very substantial pattern of reform, which the Government is now considering. Essentially its basic recommendation is that we should have enterprise employment rather than industry employment and that, apart from enterprise employment, we should be able to get a restructuring of the award, so that we can have an increase in work force flexibility. It is recommended that there should be a diminution of numbers in the industry, with a reduction of 2,000 people in the work force. That represents a very substantial reduction in the number of people in the industry, and this would obviously therefore involve considerable increases in efficiency, with improvements in the operations of container depots, port authorities and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to address all the details; suffice it to say that the Inter-State Commission says that if these recommendations are carried out the improvements in efficiency would amount to $620m a year. Does this mean that nothing is happening? What is happening is that those two reports are the subject of Government consideration at present. Before this month ends, I shall make statements in this House about those two reports and what the Government intends to do about the matter. It is an absurdity in the extreme to suggest that nothing is happening in these important areas. In fact, these matters have been addressed infinitely more comprehensively than has been the case with any previous government. Unlike what we have seen under any previous government, we are seeing on the structural adjustment front a cascade of activity the like of which has never occurred in our history. Yet we have people wandering around saying that nothing is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need to be told by the Opposition that we need to address this area. It is being addressed absolutely comprehensively; yet all we get from honourable members opposite is absolute drivel in terms of policy. The honourable member for Richmond produced a policy on coastal shipping which comprised five paragraphs, the rest of it being just window-dressing. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) produced many more pages but with even less content in terms of substantive recommendations. It had virtually nothing to say except, `Let's have more unions on the waterfront'-as though that would address the problem, as though having more unions there would mean that there would be fewer disputes and greater efficiency. Obviously, the honourable member for Flinders knows absolutely nothing about the waterfront. Indeed, he knows nothing about industrial relations, either. The Government totally rejects the proposal. The Government is addressing the issue more comprehensively than has ever occurred before. When I make a statement to the House on behalf of the Government in the next couple of months this will be fully demonstrated to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever we have heard a contribution from a Minister to justify the bringing on of a discussion of a matter of public importance, the speech just made by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) was it. I will not give the Minister a history lesson, but I just remind him that the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) did a hell of a lot more about the waterfront than he will ever do. The last Fraser Government, in doing something about the Stevedoring Industry Authority, did a hell of a lot more for the waterfront than this Government will do between now and the next election. Talk about being out of touch! It was absolutely unbelievable to hear the Minister talking about the waterfront and what he has done. I would be happy to debate that matter with the Minister as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As everyone in the community is saying, the reality is that the matter of competition and who has done the most relates not to the Fraser Government but to our international competitors. I do not know where the Minister is every month when the balance of payments figures come out and show that this country is going down the drain, when the balance of payments figures indicate that Australia must get its act together because it is not competitive. That is the message that the Minister ought to understand. I explain this to people in sporting terms: in 1984 with a good time one might have won a gold medal but in 1988 that good time would not even get a person past the heats. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need in respect of the waterfront shipping, and many other areas that the Government has failed to approach, is a system which has sufficient dynamics in it to enable this country finally to be competitive. The Minister's contribution today failed to address that basic issue. This issue is about competition, and, until the Minister understands that, the charge of being out of touch can be levelled very strongly at the Minister. Around this country, including in Tasmania-people in the apple isle-manufacturers, importers, exporters, pensioners, and ordinary Australians, who have to pay more for goods on the supermarket shelves, are crying out to this Government, `We want this problem fixed'. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the Minister that since the war we have had 12 reports on the waterfront in particular, and this time people are asking the Government to fix the problem once and for all, as it is costing this country a very great deal. Not only is the need very great but I would say to the Minister that he has a golden opportunity on this occasion to do something about the waterfront. The Inter-State Commission report has outlined a means to bring some real competition to this vital industry. There are about 7,000 waterfront workers, wharfies, many of whom have been in the industry and on a good wicket for a very long time. The one thing that one would say about many of them is that they will be very keen to take the $250,000, partly subsidised by the taxpayer, and get out of the industry. To the extent that the industry is massively overmanned, I say that there are people who are prepared to take the carrot, and I hope that the Government gets the situation right-because this needs to be done once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> There still exists on the waterfront such things as `nick-off time'. That means that a person stays and signs off for his mate whilst he nicks off home. The matter of `spelling' relates not to reading, writing or arithmetic but to the practice of someone working while his mate takes a spell. Then there is the practice involving levers-and this is a classic. This relates to the operation of certain shipgear, such as swinging-type derricks. These derricks have only one seat. At the insistence of the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF) there are two drivers to utilise the three controls-because three controls would be too many. Of course, one bloke has to stand whilst the other one sits because there is only one seat, the equipment having been produced for only one worker. The reality is that the need for the Government to get the situation right is very great. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Inter-State Commission report contains many very good features. The emphasis that it places on competition and on structures to maintain competitive forces on the waterfront must be at the core of any sensible reform for the waterfront. The report also addresses a couple of other things to which I want to refer very briefly today. It points out that the industry will never be reformed from within, that the people within the industry will never have the motive and the incentive to reform the waterfront in the sort of way that is needed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a club, as the honourable member for Menzies says-and, of course, the people who pay the subscriptions are the poor exporters and importers, and others. The report says that reform must be undertaken from the outside. In other words, the Government must step in, take a firm lead and see that reform is properly effected. The second thing that the Inter-State Commission report says is that the Government must adopt its report in total. Over an extended period and with a lot of consultation the Inter-State Commission has come up with a package which could be adopted by the Government in full. In fact, the package itself contains a whole series of compromises-which the Commission is quite happy to admit. The Commission has looked at the position of the various parties and it is the opinion of the Commission that its recommendations would be a reasonable compromise to achieve the objectives that every Australian wants to see implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two basic propositions: first, that reform must be imposed from the outside and, secondly, the Commission's report must be adopted in toto. What do we see as the result of the Inter-State Commission's report being handed down? Do we see on the part of the Government a steadfast resolution, in the public interest, to fix this problem? Not at all. Right from the word go the Government has backed down, and the telltale signs have been evident every day since the tabling of the report. Who is it that it is supposed to lead the way on micro-economic reform but who, given an inch, takes a mile and is the first one to back off? It is, of course, none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). At a press conference on 10 April the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>So I believe that it is going to be possible to achieve through negotiation some significant reforms in a way which will not meet the understandable opposition of the Waterside Workers Federation in regard to issues which from their point of view are quite understandable . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Federation has had a gun at the head of this nation's economy for years. We have a sensible report that says, `Adopt it in toto', but the Prime Minister says, `Let's back off. These concerns are understandable'. Of course, he was referring to the union coverage by the Waterside Workers Federation in certain ports. It is an issue of absolutely critical importance to the waterfront. The Inter-State Commission said, `One way of getting competition into this industry is to have competition between ports'. It is very hard to have competition between ports if the Waterside Workers Federation is controlling terms and conditions in both ports. It said, `Let's try to introduce some competition by having an exclusion of the Waterside Workers Federation from certain ports'. That is a sensible recommendation. It is a fundamental recommendation if we are interested in reform and competition. The person who leads the charge for the back off is, of course, the Prime Minister. It is no surprise that the second in line, Mr Kelty, the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), says, `The Waterside Workers Federation is a great union'. He just does not pick one or two things such as stand-downs, coverage or trade practices like the Prime Minister did; he has a more general swipe and says, `The whole approach is infantile'. He also is working away at undermining the Inter-State Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications-the weak Minister-was asked a very simple question at Question Time today. He was asked: `If you are fair dinkum about company based employment, will you give this House an assurance that you will oppose pools?' The Minister ran a mile because last week the Waterside Workers Federation and the ACTU-on Thursday, I think; the Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but his blokes are down there running the show with them-were talking about pools and the Minister has not got the gumption to stand up and say, `We support one of the central tenets of the Inter-State Commission report. `We have a classic-the whiff of a deal being done in a back room. The Inter-State Commission report said, `This lot cannot reform from within', yet we find the Minister's industrial relations consultant holding negotiations with the two principal players, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour and the WWF. The reality is that the Minister has a good report in front of him and he should have the sense to implement it in full. But the Minister, the Prime Minister, and the Minister's ultimate patrons in the ACTU are calling the shots, and the sad loser is this economy at a time when we need the problems on the waterfront fixed immediately. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UF4">Mr COURTICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the Opposition certainly is and that is why it will stay on the other side of the House for another 20 years. The Federal Government has understood that there is something wrong with the industry and has taken constructive steps to improve it. Since coming to office, the Hawke Government has aimed to reverse decades of neglect in a whole range of industries. The shipping and waterfront industries are part of the process. In 1983 the Government accepted the recommendations of the report of the Crawford Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping. In 1987 the Maritime Industry Development Committee (MIDC) was established to examine options for continuing the momentum of the reform built up by the Crawford scheme. The most recent initiative was the Shipping Reform Task Force, which has reported on measures to accelerate the pace of reform. These are constructive measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look in detail at some of these measures. In 1984 legislation was introduced to give effect to the recommendations of Crawford on the revitalisation of Australian shipping. The legislation provided tax incentives to ship owners linked to reductions in crew sizes. Under this scheme, significant crew reductions were achieved on 11 new vessels. The crew on new bulk carriers introduced by the scheme was 26. This is a reduction from the best practice of 33 on existing similar ships of the time. Taking out capital costs, in many cases manning levels are something like 30 per cent of the cost of shipping. So this is a constructive approach to solving the cost of the shipping industry. It is being done without industrial chaos and without using a sledge-hammer. It is being done constructively and with consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure was set in place by the cooperative approach adopted by this Government. This cooperative approach is in stark contrast to the winners in the Liberal Party preselection ballot in Victoria over the weekend. These people have won not on any basis of cooperation. They are the field marshals of the New right who have captured the Victorian Branch of the Liberal Party. They are tramping through Toorak and terrorising the blue rinse set. The winner in Goldstein said in today's media that he would like a return to the Fraser years. What a sad, pathetic start to a political career. The architect of the Fraser years sits on the other side of the House and parades as an alternative Prime Minister. There are not many people who believe that the Fraser years are a model for anything. There was no action then on shipping industry reform. There were, however, high tariffs and a high exchange rate under the former coalition government. They are the very things that made us uncompetitive and the very things we have thrown out in order to regain our competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> There was not talk of cooperation. It was confrontation all the way. We need look only at the last year of the Fraser rule when 220,000 people lost their jobs. We had the highest level of industrial disputation for decades. That is the answer those on the other side of the House have today for the problems in the shipping industry, indeed in any industry at all. On top of that we had a wages blow-out that created a more uncompetitive system. This ruined the employment prospects of Australians. By contrast there is a fundamental difference in Australia today. The Federal Labor Government has restructured industry. We have reformed the tax structure. Family assistance has been introduced to help low income families and 1 1/4 million people now have jobs. With this cooperative approach we will introduce reforms that are necessary to benefit Australian shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987, this Government established the Maritime Industry Development Committee to build upon the improvements made under the Crawford scheme. This saw for the first time multiskilling, with ratings able to work both on deck and in the engine room. That was a great initiative. Integral to the scheme was the establishment of training and retraining courses, and the creation of career paths for seafarers. The scheme established a benchmark crew level of 21 for the majority of ships. At present there are five ships in the fleet with MIDC-type crew levels and a further 14 are scheduled for introduction over the next three years. As a result, crew sizes in the Australian fleet have been reduced on new ships. Of course, some of the old technologies are such that it is not safe to massively reduce crew levels. Unfortunately, the two honourable members on the other side of the House who have spoken are ignorant of this fact. As a result, crew sizes in the Australian fleet have been reduced on new ships. In 1985 the average crew level in the Australian trading fleet was 32. By 1988 this had been reduced to 29. The task force recommendations can see a figure of 21 by 1992. That is a great breakthrough and I would like to reiterate that that has been done without massive disputation. It has been done by working together with the shipping industry, with the unions and with companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The new ships introduced to the fleet have also been more operationally efficient than the ships they replaced. They are larger, offering economies of scale, and incorporate the latest technology in engines and coating systems for hulls and tanks resulting in lower costs for fuel and routine maintenance. For instance, the new coastal petroleum produce tankers currently under construction are about 30,000 dead weight tonnes. They will have MIDC crews of 23 and will use approximately 18 tonnes of fuel per day. This will replace the ships of around 20,000 dead weight tonnes with crews of 37 to 39 and which use around 32 tonnes of fuel per day. Surely this constitutes economies of scale. Again, it shows the constructive role that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) and the Government are playing in reducing our shipping costs. This approach is progressive and is carried out on the basis of cooperation. Industry and unions are working together to create a better system for Australia. Ultimately, by reducing our costs, we are going to become more competitive and, in doing so, will create more jobs in the shipping industry as our trade expands. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like also to give an example of ship days lost. Out of 1,457 ships days lost due to industrial disputes in 1988 only 41 days, or less than 3 per cent, were as a result of actions by the seagoing unions. That puts to rest the rhetoric on the other side of the House about irresponsibility. In fact, the seagoing unions have been very responsible in the restructuring that is under way. In 1980, under the Fraser Government, there were seven unions representing the seagoing work force. At present there are three unions, with the prospect of reducing to two unions-one for officers and one for ratings. This, too, is progress. </PARA>
<PARA> The shipping industry is important for an export oriented nation like our own. We are taking action to bring about sustained reform which is in the best interests of the economy as well as those who work in the industry. The Opposition constantly drags around the place policies for deregulation and reform of industry. However, when asked to put up and support them, it constantly wilts in its enthusiasm. In the sugar industry, reform was introduced which will create more jobs in the industry. Rather than face the reform with intelligence, members of the National Party of Australia in this House-particularly those from Queensland-dragged their feet and opposed the reform. Last week we again witnessed the Opposition split in this chamber because of reform in the wheat industry. There we have it. The Opposition talks about reform but, when it comes to the crunch, it just cannot cut the mustard. It just cannot deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> While I congratulate the Opposition for recognising that reform in the shipping industry is important, I certainly have no confidence that it would do anything in any united way to implement it. In fact, if we talk about divisions, not only do we have the split in the Liberal Party in Victoria but today, while I speak, there is a challenge to the Premier of Queensland by his own Speaker. That shows how united the Opposition parties are. We have a fundamental conflict in this House-a government full of ideas, looking to the future, working in cooperation with all sectors to bring about more competitive industries, and an Opposition bitterly divided, wanting to return to the 1950s, where all the problems began, and failing to convince the National party to do anything that interferes with its commitments to agrarian socialism, sloth and inefficiency. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of logistics and training complex, Stage 1, Bandiana, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>This public work in an area four kilometres south-east of Wodonga concerns a major defence installation which has contained military, logistic and training units since the 1930s. The proposal now before this House is for the first stage of the redevelopment of the Army's logistics and training complex at Bandiana. This two-stage redevelopment will extend over the next 10 years or more. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal is an example of the Government's commitment to improving substantially service personnel's living accommodation and rationalising and modernising the Service's working facilities. Bandiana is presently home to two major logistic units, two major training establishments and three minor units. There are over 1,700 student, Service and civilian staff personnel at Bandiana and between them the two major training establishments conduct nearly 100 different courses a year. </PARA>
<PARA> This complex now comprises a mix of modern, permanent facilities and old temporary structures, many of which date from World War II. Many of these older facilities are in very poor condition, are inadequate for their required use and are not economical to repair or to restore. In addition, much of the accommodation facilities fall short of modern standards. This redevelopment is a substantial project and will involve the following works: the construction of new accommodation for all ranks and the refurbishment of existing substandard facilities; the refurbishment of existing administrative offices and the construction of new headquarters and office buildings for several local army units; the replacement, refurbishment and construction of new training, warehouse and storage facilities; and the upgrading of existing engineering services, roads and landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposed stage 1 works have been divided into two phases which reflect both the Army's priorities for works and funding constraints. The estimated cost of the works, as recommended by the Public Works Committee, is $68m at August 1988 prices. This is comprised of $50m for phase A and $18m for phase B. The bulk of the accommodation, administrative and training works is in phase A, with phase B consisting primarily of store and maintenance facilities which will form part of a new logistics complex. Subject to parliamentary approval and Department of Defence funding priorities, it is intended to commence construction of the phase A works later this year and the phase B works in 1992-93. All the works in the first stage of the redevelopment at Bandiana are planned to be completed by mid-1995. It is estimated that there will be an average on-site work force of about 80 persons during the construction. </PARA>
<PARA> Planning has commenced on a second stage of the redevelopment but its implementation will be some years away. In recommending the development to the House, the Public Works Committee in its report raised two matters which it believed needed further attention. I would like to inform the Committee through this speech in the House today that, in line with its recommendations, the Department of Defence has agreed to a review of the security arrangements at the Bandiana military complex. My Department's Australian Construction Services and the Army will re-examine the proposed location of the logistics complex distribution store. The Committee will be informed of the outcomes of these reviews. I thank the Committee for the support it has given this redevelopment proposal. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

Some of the buildings built in the 1930s are still in use-propped up but still in use. If we are to retain service men and women, it is essential that they be given the facilities which the community enjoys. That is part of this deal.

<PARA> The Minister talked about conducting 100 different courses a year in training establishments. One of the reasons so many courses have to be conducted is that the defence forces are losing people faster than they can replace them. The construction of new accommodation for all ranks and the refurbishment of existing substandard facilities is, of course, vital if we are to retain these people. They will not live in the substandard accommodation which all too often passes for defence facilities these days. We are very pleased to see this money being put into the improvement of facilities for our defence personnel. We support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of RAAF Base, Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>This work is for the replacement and upgrading of facilities at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Wagga Wagga to improve the standard of accommodation and to provide facilities better suited to current training needs. This base was opened in 1940. It is the RAAF's main base for technical and trade training. Approximately 70 per cent of all RAAF ground training is conducted there. Courses provide both apprentice and adult training in a range of technical trades as well as management, clerical, supply and catering areas. It is expected that this year the student population of trainees, apprentices and other personnel will vary between 800 and 1,000. Some of the existing buildings in use on the base neither reflect current community standards nor adequately serve the functional purposes to which the buildings are put. There are many huts dating from World War II that are still in use and are in need of replacement. Over the past 20 years a number of facilities have been upgraded or replaced to improve the standard of accommodation provided and to cater for significant increases in technical training. </PARA>
<PARA> The facilities included in this development proposal are a continuation of this process. The proposal involves the construction of a number of new buildings, the refurbishment of a number of existing buildings and the upgrading of the base engineering services. Examples of new buildings to be provided include a library and study centre and a physical fitness centre. Existing buildings which will be refurbished include the other ranks' accommodation and the central store. The estimated cost of this proposed work as recommended by the Committee is $23.6m at April 1988 prices. This cost, updated to April 1989 prices, is $25.4m. Subject to the approval of the House, it is intended to commence construction later this year. The various works will be completed progressively. Subject to Department of Defence funding priorities, the whole development should be completed by the end of 1993. It is expected that there will be an average on-site work force of around 50 persons during the life of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to inform the Public Works Committee that, in accordance with the recommendations contained in its report tabled last month, first, the Department of Defence is to have discussions with the State Rail Authority on the possible resumption or fencing of the rail easement through the base and, secondly, we are to have discussions with the Civil Aviation Authority to examine the effectiveness of the fire fighting services at the base. The construction program is to be re-examined by the Department of Defence and my Department's Australian Construction Services to determine the Civil Aviation Authority's needs in regard to the replacement of the facilities its members are required to vacate. The Department of Defence has already taken action to site the flammable goods store further away from residential accommodation. We will formally advise the Public Works Committee of these outcomes in response to its recommendations. I thank that Committee for its careful consideration of my proposal. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support the motion. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Wagga Wagga is a very important defence facility and, like most of our bases, has been neglected in recent years and requires an update. It is interesting to note that the expected population of trainees, apprentices and other personnel will be increased. It seems an appropriate time to mention the reason for that increase. I do not want to dwell on it, but it is here in the speech of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West). Since 1983 about 50,000 men and women, over a trained base of 62,000, have left the Defence Force. Fifty thousand-this does not include those under training, which total about another 7,000-out of 62,000 have left the Defence Force.</PARA></TALK.START>

He says this as though it has nothing to do with him and nothing to do with the state and capabilities of the Australian Defence Force when it is happening at the very heart of the Defence Force. The wastage is like a cancer eating away at our capabilities. We intend to keep mentioning it until it is fixed, until the Government takes action to restore these men and women to their rightful place in the community, with a feeling of pride, motivation and dedication which all too often, unfortunately, they lose; otherwise, why would they be leaving the service? We welcome these new facilities for this important RAAF base. I hope that this sort of progressive attitude towards our bases will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleague the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White), in offering the support of the Opposition to this motion and reiterating what he has already said-the work proposed by the Government is long overdue. Indeed, this work is part of a forward program that was announced by the Fraser Government in 1981. I had hoped that this part of the program would have proceeded well before this time but, notwithstanding that, it is good to see it going ahead. The defence industry at Wagga is, next to primary industry, the largest industry in the region. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) may be interested to know that the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Army annually pump $73m into the Wagga economy, which is very important from a local point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also take the opportunity to say that this facility which, as the Minister said, was established in 1940 and is responsible for training 70 per cent of the service intakes, particularly in the trades area, has developed a very close relationship with the city of Wagga. I commend commanding officers, both past and present, those who have served there, and the leaders and community of Wagga for the way in which they have forged this very close relationship. No longer can it be said that the RAAF base and Blamey Barracks at Wagga are apart from the city. They are now very much part of the city and the local community. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Upgrade of Navy living-in accommodation at HMAS Cerberus, Crib Point, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>This public work is the third phase of a staged redevelopment of facilities at HMAS Cerberus near Melbourne. HMAS Cerberus is one of the Royal Australian Navy's main training establishments, with its 12 training schools providing a range of courses from basic training through to advanced technical and specialist training. In March this year, the House approved the second phase of the redevelopment which will provide new communications and recruit schools at HMAS Cerberus. Construction of these works should commence later this year. This Government is committed to improving living conditions for single personnel in the Australian Defence Force and the proposed work now before the House involves the upgrading of Navy single living-in accommodation at HMAS Cerberus. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the existing barracks accommodation at Cerberus was built before or during the 1960s. The standard of accommodation now provided is generally below the current Services scales and standards of accommodation. The objective of this proposal is to provide a standard of living-in accommodation which is as close to the current Services scales and standards as the existing building envelopes and layouts permit. This proposal will provide around 760 upgraded singled rooms in eight buildings. Typically, this will be done by converting existing four-bed rooms to two single rooms. Ablution facilities will be modernised and living areas will be carpeted and modern built-in furniture provided. It is also proposed to construct a new accommodation block for 120 junior sailors early in the project. There will also be a refurbishment of the shower, toilet and laundry facilities in four recruit accommodation blocks. The estimated cost of the proposal as recommended by the Committee is $15.7m at September 1988 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to the approval of the House to proceed, it is planned to call the first tender late this year. The construction of the project will be phased over about five years to meet Department of Defence requirements and funding levels. This will also minimise disruption to the existing accommodation arrangements at the base. I estimate that there will be an on-site work force of around 60 during peak construction periods. I thank the Committee for its prompt consideration of and support for the proposal, and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Australian Defence Force Academy Stage 2 development, Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work now before the House is for the expansion of living, teaching and sporting facilities at the Australian Defence Force Academy here in Canberra. The Defence Force Academy was set up to provide a university education in a military environment, as well as professional military training for officer cadets in the three Australian Services. One of the aims is to increase the number of officers with university degrees. The Academy opened in January 1986 with nearly 800 students and this year there are nearly 1,200 undergraduates and postgraduates studying there. It is now necessary to expand the facilities at the Academy to accommodate the increase in student numbers since 1986 and also the higher proportion of students studying computer science subjects. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed works in this stage 2 development comprise: The construction of four new cadet accommodation blocks, each housing 48 persons; an extension to the computer science building; an extension to the library together with a reorganisation of the existing building and provision of a new audiovisual facility; the provision of air-conditioning to the civil engineering and geography building; and the upgrading of two sportsgrounds, including provision of associated car and bus parking and new change pavilion. These proposed stage 2 works have been divided into three phases. The phase A works, estimated to cost $3.84m, consist of two of the new accommodation blocks and one of the sportsgrounds and change pavilion. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to provide sufficient accommodation and facilities for the cadet level at the beginning of this 1989 academic year, the phase A works have proceeded in advance of the remainder of the stage 2 proposal. The Public Works Committee was informed of this requirement and advised that it had no objection to this phase of the work proceeding. The estimated cost of the remaining stage 2 proposal, that is, phases B and C, is $13.935m at June 1988 prices. The construction of the remaining two phases of this proposal has been programmed to meet Department of Defence requirements. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is intended that work on phase B will commence later this year and be completed by mid 1991. The remaining works in phase C are currently scheduled to be built between mid 1992 and the end of 1995. I table selected plans of the proposed work and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the motion. The Australian Defence Force Academy is now in its fourth year of operation. It is perhaps too early to estimate whether it meets all the requirements of the defence forces at this stage. Evaluation will continue as the Academy gets a little older. One comment I might make is that, as the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) said, it will provide a university education in a military environment. Perhaps some would think that the military environment takes very much a back seat at the Academy. Whether that is good or bad is yet to be tested as we see these young men and women leave the Academy and take their places in the Defence Force of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the objectives of the Academy was to try to draw the three Services closer together. In that objective I would think it is succeeding. There is no doubt that during these formative years young men and women who spend three or four years together in that very close environment get to know each other very well and a lot of those relationships will last for the rest of their lives. That will be a good thing because of some of the debilitating jealousies and fights between the three Services that have characterised the Australian Defence Force, particularly over at Russell, for years. It is not good for the Australian Defence Force and is certainly not good for the people who are involved in those brawls. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Academy has to be expanded, for the very reason that we are losing officers faster than we can replace them. The Australian Regular Army is now some 35 officers short and looking for full time duty officers, reservists, to come back in and help it through Kangaroo 89. That is an appalling state of affairs. The other Services are really no better off. The works which are mentioned in this motion are not going to provide the facilities to produce those extra people in the short term. Nor will they provide the reason, moral and motivation for them to stay in the Services unless the Government acts. </PARA>
<PARA> Just briefly, the other thing on this is the proposal, which many retired and serving officers would like to see, that there should be a longer period of military training before these young cadets go to the Australian Defence Force Academy. It is obviously of little use to the Defence Force if many of them go there just to get a degree without their motivation towards the Services being tested before they are given that degree. Only time and experience will tell whether the curriculum at the Australian Defence Force Academy should be revised in order to incorporate that longer period of military training before young people actually start their academic training.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The changes announced in the 12 April economic statement were welcome in many ways. They were welcome because they came in the seventh year of the Hawke Labor Government, a period which has seen great difficulties for the Australian economy and, because of that, major problems for hundreds of thousands of Australian families. Of course, it is a fact that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and other spokesmen for the Government, have taken every opportunity over recent weeks to emphasise to the Australian people that we have a government that does genuinely care, that it is a government that cares about people and about a fairer Australia. Its own document on social justice measures, an economic statement of April 1989 entitled `Towards a Fairer Australia', outlines in a few short pages-11 to be exact-what the Government really believes and thinks about people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is all fine stuff. It is excellent that at last after so many years something tangible is being done to help Australian families, especially families in need. I reiterate what I have said on previous occasions: for those reasons, and those reasons alone, the Opposition supports the thrust of the reforms contained in the April statement because of the benefits that they will bring in the short term at least to those hundred of thousands of families who have suffered so grievously over the last six years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister will no doubt retreat once again to his defence, which is pointing out the horrors of the Fraser years. We have heard it so often in this place. We heard it again at Question Time today. We heard it on the 7.30 Report the other night. The trouble is that he is talking to an audience which was mostly at school at that time. They are interested in what governments are doing now and are responsible for now. What happened in the past is only ancient history. As I will outline today, the statistics in so many categories when they are compared with the events of the last six years do not show up this Government in particularly good light at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental problem which under Labor for so long has bedevilled this economy and the Australian people has been that they have faced the highest taxing peace-time government in our history. They are now saying, `Good, at last we are getting something back'. Is it any wonder that they are not particularly thankful to the Government, which has ripped it out of their pockets for so long and which, at the same time, has policies which have brought to the Australian economy very high inflation with all the impact that that has on living standards of ordinary Australian people. It is, of course, one of the fundamental reasons why today we have such high rates of interest, which again impact on the capacity of people to own and buy their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see how the Government has suddenly become fascinated by the problems of the family. Of course, the Minister will again claim that this is not new and is something that he has been concerned about for years. No doubt, he will say that his Government introduced the family assistance supplement (FAS), again an initiative which I supported in this House on behalf of the Opposition. But I am sure the Minister will also be prepared to admit, with due regard to the history of this particular subject, that, whilst the much maligned Fraser Government introduced the family allowance, it was seen as a major step forward in transfer arrangements between the Government and the Australian people. The difference was that the family allowance was available to all families with children and was a public recognition that to have children, irrespective of one's income, was an indisputable additional cost. But the Hawke Government reduced that situation and said, `No, we are going to have thresholds and above that you will not get any family allowance'. That is the policy we still have at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Australian population remains appalled. All the opinion polls demonstrate the way in which this Government has ignored the continual erosion of living standards of Australian families since March 1983 when this over-taxing and, in so many respects, this economically irresponsible Government came to office. Accordingly, I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) is of the opinion that the measure of relief it provides has been made more necessary as a result of the decline in living standards suffered by Australian families with children, and pension and benefit recipients, in common with all Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the Hawke Government for presiding over 6 years of these declining living standards of Australian families''. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation before us covers a range of important matters, such as the question of family payments, pension and benefit indexation and a range of other benefits. As I said, we support the improvements which this Bill contains. It is indeed a step in the right direction, albeit taken rather late in the day and undoubtedly influenced by the fact that within the next few months there will be a Federal election. The Government is most concerned, on the basis of its investigations and the reports which come back to it, emanating from the various back bench committees and branches of the Australian Labor Party itself, that in its own heartland the people of Australia are not impressed with the overall performance of this Government, particularly in regard to the influence it has had on their lowering standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition has always known the importance of the family in Australian society. We recognise the changing needs of families in all their configurations. That fact was emphasised in the Future Directions document we produced last November which resulted in this sudden surge of concern which, as I said, I welcome. It is the only way we can give to this country the foundation which we ultimately need. It is an essential requirement to look after the interests of our children. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention the loss of at least $35m to two million Australian families which arose out of changes that the Government made only a few months ago to the family allowance. I seek the permission of the House to incorporate in Hansard a copy of a letter I wrote to the then Acting Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), on the question of the change from monthly to fortnightly payments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An effective interaction between economic and social policy will ensure a fair go for all, and the Government has clearly in so many respects failed to deliver this. I referred a moment ago to the question of the changes to the family allowance. Incidentally, changes were also made to the child disability allowance and benefits received by double orphan pension recipients. What people believe to this day is that when the changes of the payment from monthly to fortnightly were made the overall benefits were reduced. I am not disputing that fact. The simple reality is that those increases are effectively on a lower base than they were before. It is believed by many that the Government saved $35m in payments to some two million Australian families by what is seen by so many, including the Victorian Council of Social Service and Nick Renton, a leading actuary in Melbourne, whose own figures are somewhat higher than my own but emphasise the same point, as a sleight of hand. The Government takes with one hand and gives with the other-some would call it the activity of an Indian giver.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we need a society in which people are encouraged to give of their best and not at the same time encouraged in any way to become recipients of benefits which they do not necessarily need. The objective of a welfare system, therefore, must essentially be to help those most in need and to maintain them at an adequate level of income. Thanks to the Opposition, the Government has now been dragged, as I said, reluctantly but not yet too late, into recognising the fact that Australian families have been bleeding and for too long. The fact is that we have seen in its own documentation Towards a Fairer Australia the rhetoric of what the Government proposes to do, and today we are debating the substance of what it is at least doing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the reality in terms of individual families. For a family with a single average weekly income-a dependent spouse and two dependent children-the real standard of living in terms of disposable income rose between 1977 and 1982, a period which the Minister always reminds us was such a terrible time for Australia because the wicked Fraser Government was in power. That same family in 1977 had a disposable weekly income of $169.60; in 1982 its disposable weekly income had risen to $172.10; in 1987 it was $163.45; and in 1989 it is $165.30. Those calculations are based on 1977 values, and I emphasise that fact. They do not demonstrate a particularly grand performance over the period of this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, however, real disposable incomes have in fact fallen to a critical degree. The tax cuts announced by the Treasurer on 12 April will mean slightly higher living standards for the average family in 1989, compared with the previous year, but will leave them considerably below their real living standard back in 1982, and even in 1977. The tax cuts, totalling some $4.9 billion, are considerably less than the $10 billion the Government has collected through bracket creep alone, not to mention all the other individual taxes which have been increased over the last few years. For example, sales tax has increased nearly 150 per cent under the Hawke Government and it is still consistently rising in accordance with increases in inflation. Australia is now one of the world's highest taxed countries. Yet Australia's debt now totals about $7,400 for every man, woman and child, and the foreign debt has doubled from this time last year. In 1985 we spent 34c of every export dollar earnt on paying our interest debt overseas. Now the first 63c in every dollar we earn is owed to the rest of the world in interest alone. The Institute of Family Studies, on page 3 of the document it released this weekend, claims:</PARA>
<PARA> Families on average weekly earnings have had their tax position considerably restored . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But I emphasise that a family with a single average weekly income would still need an increase of $56 a week to restore its real disposable income to the level obtaining in March 1983. The Government's wage-tax trade-off will not deliver the significant improvements in the living standards of Australian families which, of course, is the other half of the equation which the Treasurer put to us in his April statement. The wage increase will be chewed up by the insidious effect of higher inflation and there will be more tax to pay on the wage increases which will effectively claw back much of the tax cut. Indeed, a family with the above characteristics, which in March 1983 was paying 15.6 per cent of its income in taxation, taking account of income tax, the Medicare levy, the dependent spouse rebate and the concessional rebate, will pay 21.9 per cent of its income in taxation by July 1990 after the tax cuts which were announced by the Treasurer have come into effect. A family with two average weekly incomes and two dependent children now requires $71 a week to restore it to its real disposable income level of March 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Everybody is well aware that government spending has increased from $49 billion in 1982-83 to approximately $83 billion in 1988-89. Despite this, living standards for low and middle income earners are still falling. The Institute of Family Studies claims:</PARA>
<PARA>Nearly all income groups will pay less tax under the new scale than they would have paid if the 1983-84 tax scale had been fully indexed. </PARA>
<PARA>This analysis focuses only on changes to income taxation. It takes no account of the fact that Labor has introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax and of the broadening of the indirect tax base, which affects even low income families, because we all have to pay indirect taxes. For example, sales taxes are expected to rise by 14 per cent in 1988-89 following earlier rises of 19 per cent in 1987-88, 10 per cent in 1986-87 and 15 per cent in 1985-86. Contrary to the myth that Labor has tried to propagate in its various documentation and numerous speeches in this House and elsewhere, the simple fact of the matter is that social justice under the Labor Government has failed because, today, Australia is a less fair society than it was in the 1970s and earlier periods. There is an increasing polarisation between the wealthy and the poor and the disadvantaged have characterised this Government's abysmal record in the field of so-called social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> A study by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne has demonstrated that 13 per cent of income units were in poverty in 1986 compared with 10.5 per cent only four years earlier. Today there are approximately 2.6 million households, one in every eight of which is living in poverty or, as a result of the Government's changes, is now on the edge of poverty. The distinction is quite slight. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the appalling fact is that included in that category are some 800,000 children. The tragedy of child poverty in Australia has become a major issue in both the social and political debate. While the Minister tried to suggest at Question Time today that this problem was with us in the past-and I suppose, as Jesus himself said, `The poor are always with us'-the fact of the matter is that the issue of child poverty has not been as significant on the policy or social agenda of this country at any other time since the Great Depression. Other than during that period, I suppose one could go back to the nineteenth century; but, regrettably, there are no statistics to prove it one way or the other. During the last six years, the issue of child poverty has been placed well and truly on the political agenda. This is something which the recent report on child homelessness demonstrated so clearly was an issue which we must adequately address. </PARA>
<PARA> We have higher child poverty rates than any other comparable Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country with the exception of the United States of America. The tragedy of these children is that they cannot vote, they have no political muscle and no voice in the public arena. They have been effectively ignored by the Government's failure to meet its economic and social responsibilities. The Prime Minister's claim that the Government has eradicated child poverty by meeting its FAS benchmarks, which has been one of the objectives of the Government and certainly the Minister for some time, is not really an adequate response. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very real danger of complacency coming into the system when the problem is met by increased expenditure, ergo there is no problem! Unfortunately, this has been one of the fundamental weaknesses of public debate in our society for so long. The Minister and I know that and anyone who wants to think this problem through would realise that merely spending money on a problem is not an excuse for being able to say, `We have solved it'. It fails before the bar of the Australian people, who do not accept that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Research quoted by the Brotherhood of St Laurence estimates that the introduction of the family allowance supplement has assisted approximately 30 per cent of those 800,000 children and their families. Welfare bodies have estimated that, even with the meeting of the much vaunted benchmarks, some 400,000 children will remain in poverty after housing costs are paid. Of course, this is one of the elements which people tend to ignore. Child poverty has become endemic to Australian society and, simply, will not be remedied by limited income support. </PARA>
<PARA> The real solutions to child poverty require much more than token gestures of financial assistance; they require attention to housing, employment and education, in particular. These are all issues which the Government recognises and some of its programs have been worthwhile-I do not dispute that for a moment-but sadly much has been done too late. This is my primary concern about this matter. As I said, we are about to see the seventh Keating Budget and, for all intents and purposes, it has only been in the last two Budgets that we have seen a major step forward in this area. I compliment the Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Social Justice (Mr Howe) for the role he has played in that area, but it is a pity that more was not done much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the question of housing poverty in Australia which is particularly concentrated amongst families with dependent children, both couples and sole parents, with those in the private rental market being most severely affected. Despite the housing crisis and the existence of 195,000 families on public housing waiting lists around Australia, the Government has not effectively grappled with this problem. It has not made increases in family assistance which are adequate to overcome the major issue. The Minister will no doubt say, `That is so but we are increasing the rental subsidy' and so forth. That is true, but that alone does not direct itself to some of the fundamental strategic problems which are found in cities such as Melbourne and Sydney, in particular. Small increases in rental subsidies do not adequately respond to the problem. Achievement of the benchmarks cannot possibly take account of regional factors which dramatically affect the living conditions of families. For example, one can really say that in no way does the assistance package cover the problems of rental payments in places such as Sydney and Melbourne, where a pensioner who needs those rent increases is not the same as one living in Bourke, Western Australia or Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that there are constitutional problems in this area which I readily accept, but I think we need a much wider approach to this fundamental problem which takes account of specific problems of individual cities and communities rather than a universal approach which does not meet the requirements. In fact, what we have seen is that the average mortgage repayment a month has increased by $500 since 1983. Mortgage interest rates have jumped from 13.5 per cent to 16 per cent. Only last week we saw examples of some companies claiming that they wanted to increase interest rates to as high as 18 per cent. The average mortgage now costs $40 a week or $2,000 a year more than it did nine months ago. Yet, we are told that there is no poverty in Australia any more because the benchmarks have been met and everybody should be happy and smiling about their future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's employment and training initiatives announced in the 1988-89 Budget have not adequately covered the problem of, in particular, sole parents, because sole parents with children have been identified as one of the major long term areas of concern in relation to poverty and the correlation between poverty and unemployment. To have any effect on helping the long term unemployment, programs must give people a range of adequate training which can enable them to get jobs and not just put them into so-called training establishments for a relatively short period out of which they do not receive qualifications of any real benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> As a proportion of the unemployed, those with children increased from 37 per cent to 46 per cent between 1980 and 1986. In particular, since 1982 the greatest proportional increases in unemployment rates have been for families with three or more children. The duration of unemployment for people seeking full time work is now 47 weeks. This means that there has been an increase of 23 per cent from March 1983. The Government claims it has created 1.2 million new jobs. Let us examine that in some detail. I suggest that this ignores the fact that we need at least 60,000 new jobs per year to keep up with population growth and school leavers. So, when we deduct annually 60,000 from 1.3 million or so new jobs, the overall growth is not such an impressive figure after all. I am not denying that there has been improvement, but there needs to be more. I simply want to put in the minds of people these figures in their true perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Family Studies (IFS) also points to an increase in employment which means that many one income families have become two income families. Statistically, that is true but I think it is not unreasonable to make the point that in many families, wives in particular have been forced to go to work because there is simply no other way that they can meet their income requirements for their family and the commitment to keep that family together financially. Despite all its rhetoric, the average unemployment level for the Hawke Government has been 8.5 per cent compared with 6.1 per cent in the Fraser years, those dreadful years of which the Minister for Social Security continually reminds us. It is like going from heaven to hell in his eyes. I remind the Minister of that figure. It is 8.5 per cent today compared with 6.1 per cent for a similar period under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Families have borne the brunt of the unemployment despite an overall trend of reduced unemployment. For example, between 1985 and 1986 the total number fell by 8,000 but the number with dependants increased by 13,000. The number of children in families with an unemployed head increased by 22,000. Nearly 40 per cent of long term unemployment beneficiaries have three or more children. Nobody can dispute that if one is required to live on the unemployment benefit he is close to living in poverty. This is still a major problem with which we have to grapple. The clear response must be that we find more employment opportunities for these people. That is the only adequate response to the problem of unemployment in the longer term. We have the same problem with teenage unemployment, which is still higher than 20 per cent in some places in Australia. In Ballarat, for example, 50 per cent of the unemployed are under 25 and the total unemployment rate for the area is twice the national average. I might add that this seat is held by Labor at present. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need for a more complete policy mix which utilises income supplements such as the FAS, housing initiatives-including adequate public housing and more aid for families buying or renting homes-and more effective employment and training programs. The disgracefully high number of children living in poverty demonstrates clearly that the Government has not yet adequately approached these problems, nor addressed the real needs of so many young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I say for the benefit of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who spoke earlier, that no doubt he has recently gone to places such as Kintore, Yuendumu and some other settlements in the Northern Territory. No doubt he has seen some of the sights that I have seen. If they are not sights of abject poverty, I would like to know what they are. In the Northern Territory I was shocked to find that some settlements are recipients of church aid from overseas. They are effectively beneficiaries of foreign aid in the wider sense of the term. Yet we have in our community a tendency to export aid overseas. There seems to be a marked unwillingness to look at some of our own problems and see how best they can be approached domestically. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer also to another matter which I brought to the attention of the Minister last year. We have a problem of a growing population in caravan parks. I refer specifically to the unbelievably shocking circumstances I found at the Prospect caravan park in the western suburbs of Sydney. The Minister has had a lot to say about the western suburbs in recent months and I agree with some of the views that he has expressed. These are real, substantial examples of poverty; they are not just statistics. Real people, and real children, are suffering from the fact they do not have any prospect of fair access to what most of us would see as an adequate standard of living and opportunities for success in the community as a whole. Above all, they have no capacity to be part of the mainstream of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because of all this that one has to be somewhat critical of the commitment of the Prime Minister in the 1987 election when he said that no child will live in poverty by 1990. Regrettably, it was a sad political stunt. He knew when he said those words that it could not be true because he spent the next two years doing his best to walk away from that specific commitment. The fact is that we have to defeat the problem of poverty in Australia. This legislation is a step in the right direction, but certainly the problem is not by any means over. The journey has only just begun. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. I would like to draw the attention of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) to the congratulations which this Government has received with regard to the measures in this Bill. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We congratulate the Federal Government on its work on child poverty, which represents a historic breakthrough in the national attack on child poverty. The Federal Government has now built a solid foundation of income security for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>This message is reiterated by Anne O'Byrne, the Convener of the National Women's Consultative Council. She has welcomed the Government's support for families and, in particular, the increases to the family allowance and its indexation. The measures which are to be implemented through this legislation are part of a total package and a total approach by this Government to the whole question of income needs of families. The days of policies based on anecdote, of increases based on what is left over at the end of the Budget process, are behind us. Policy is now based on explicit standards that are available for rigorous scrutiny. One sees tonight a government committed to the maintenance in real terms of payments to families with children. We see the indexation of family payments-family allowance, mother's-guardian's allowance, child disability allowance, multiple birth payment and double orphans' pension. The indexation of these payments represents an historical commitment by this Government to families and to those payments. Let us remember this is the first time in our history that this has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield spent quite a deal of time citing figures. Let me remind him that under Labor family allowance payments have increased every year: in 1983 from $10 to $12; in 1984 from $12 to $14; in 1985 from $14 to $16; in 1986 from $16 to $17; in 1987 from $17 to $22 for younger children and $28 for older children; in 1988 from $22 to $24 for younger children and from $28 to $31 for older children. This legislation proposes a further increase for older children in 1989 from $31 to $34.10-historic rises in family allowances for all children. I draw the House's attention to the fact that these payments are real cash payments made to families for the benefits of all their children. We have had a vigorous debate in Australia on the appropriate levels and type of provision for families with children. That debate has to be central to any concern about fairness and equity in our community. Professor Cass said:</PARA>
<PARA>In a period of restraint on public expenditure it is essential to address the matter of immediate priorities for family assistance. This focuses attention on those approaches which provide greater assistance to low income families by improving adequacy of income-tested payments for pensioners, beneficiaries and low income working families and introducing measures which minimise work disincentives and support the transition to employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, this package is a fair, sustainable deal for families. Professor Henderson indicated the need for it 20 years ago; Professor Cass did the detailed work on it; and now we see this Government delivering it. I would like to take some time to draw the attention of this House to the concerns of some of the poorest in our community-sole parents with children-and the way in which the measures will alleviate the whole question of their predicament and provide incentives for their transition to employment. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WF4">Ms CRAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. The measures introduced here initially will alleviate the effect of marginal tax rates on sole parents. The tax free area within the social security system has been substantially increased from $36 per week to $52 per week for a sole parent with one child. The additional tax free area for the second and each subsequent child has now been doubled from $6 to $12 per week per child. Free areas, combined with the 50c taper, are currently at the highest possible level without creating inequities within the FAS system. That means that our sole parents can start to re-enter the work force, find casual employment or pursue some training and employment and still find themselves sustained by the social security system and their children adequately provided for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WF4">Ms CRAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was speaking about those families which are the poorest in our community, that is, the sole parents and their children. This Bill very definitely addresses their needs, through the jobs, education and training (JET) program. This is very much a joint program between the social security, employment, education and training, and community services and health areas. It is part of a total package which seeks to improve opportunities for people and to lessen the disincentives for people who want to get back into the work force. The Bill offers $30 a week additional assistance through Austudy or a formal training allowance for those people who want to re-enter the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some personal experience of what this program can do through my own electorate. I am fortunate that within my electorate there is a pilot program which is in fact a women's only job club. Through this program we have targeted sole parents in our community who wish to return to the work force. In the very first month of the program, 12 people made their intentions known and, of those, 10 people have now returned full time to the work force. In the second month, of the nine people who applied for the program, eight are now in full time employment. Although it is now only 8 May, for the May program two people have already returned full time to the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> This involves people who, on average, have been out of the work force for 15 years and who in fact have been subjected to domestic violence, and, in some cases, to quite insidious family situations. The honourable member opposite spoke about the Government's inability to return people to the work force and to target people within the work force. This simply demonstrates that he does not understand the real situation. The programs involved in this are real programs for real people. They are hands-on programs, involving people returning to the work force who, hitherto, have not had the opportunity to return to the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA> This involves also a spin-off in benefits not only for the women themselves as individuals but also for their children. One of the women who had been out of the work force for 17 years told me that her re-employment meant that her family would be able to purchase a telephone. This cooperative venture, undertaken jointly by the various departments involved, will ensure that very many sole parents, who are acknowledged as being the poorest people in our community, will be able to return to the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only through labour market programs or retraining and reskilling programs that we can break the cycle of poverty. One of the linchpins of the JET program involves the child care situation. This Government has done more for child care during its term in office than has occurred at any other time in Australia's history. It is quite nonsensical for honourable members opposite to talk about an inability of people to return to the work force and an inability of the Government to acknowledge the need for child care. Child care relates not simply to full time child care facilities for people who wish to return to the workplace but also to the provision of occasional care for the children of people who are seeking part time work or part time training. Indeed, for many sole parents it is imperative that they find suitable child care facilities, in terms not only of their return to the work force but also of their own individuality and talent. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard honourable members opposite speaking about women returning to the work force as though this was something wrong and something evil. Why should the Australian community not benefit from the talents of 51 per cent of its population? What sort of community can afford to lose half the talents of its community? It is a nonsense to suggest that and, clearly, the Government must acknowledge the needs and the talents of women in our community and ensure that those women are given every chance and every opportunity to return to the work force, to participate in the work force and to share their talents with us. </PARA>
<PARA> So, I am delighted that this Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill acknowledges the talents of these people and ensures that they can return to the work force. One of the incentives for their return to the work force is the sole parent rebate, which has increased from the level of $713 in 1983 to its present level of $940. This means that a sole parent with a total income of $9,576 will pay no tax. In fact, we are acknowledging that sole parents are very special people within our community-and they comprise a large percentage of the total community. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, when one looks at Future Directions and one sees the picture on the front, one rather wonders what the Opposition has been doing: the two-parent family with children is not in a majority in our community. Indeed, in Melbourne and Sydney over 50 per cent of households are occupied by one adult. What we are talking about and what this Bill addresses is the reality of 1980s Australia and the nature of the people who form the work force and are the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The changing employment circumstances of families have to be addressed. The proportion of two-earner couples has risen. The other thing that has also increased is the employment circumstances of sole parents. Apart from two-parent families, in July 1988, 44 per cent of the heads of other families with children were employed-that is, of all sole parent families, in 1988 44.7 per cent were working, as compared with 36 per cent in 1983. Surely, this is addressing the whole issue of poverty. The figures in the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and the figures in the report by Professor Cass all show that the children in sole parent families who are on benefits are in fact the poorest in our community. Indeed, it is these people, as well as others in our community, that this Bill addresses. We have the family assistance allowances, the family income supplements and, of course, there are the incentives within this Bill to ensure that the people who have talents, who wish to attain skills and who wish to return to the work force, and break the cycle of poverty, are enabled to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> This is indeed in direct contrast to the Opposition's statement which says simply that what Opposition members are looking for is families to be able to look after themselves. This is not what the Government is about. The Government believes in caring for and in having concern for families in a very general and real way. This Bill attempts to alleviate the problems that exist, to assist sole parents in their attempt to return to the work force and to realistically address their financial situation. The Government is addressing this matter realistically and is demonstrating its concern through child care programs, the marginal tax rates, and through other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge that this Bill addresses those matters. This involves, as I said earlier, a total approach. The JET program is an indication for the first time in this country's history that three Government departments are prepared to work together for a common aim-and that is to ensure that children are not left in poverty and that we have adequate incentives for people to return to the work force, and also that they are adequately compensated-hence the cycle of poverty is broken. Children then have ideal role models, they have access to information and, indeed, their education opportunities are enhanced. This relates not only to children but to the enhancement of education opportunities for sole parents. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very proud to be part of a government which demands a secure and fair deal for families with children, a guarantee of adequate standards of income for families with children, and a guarantee of a maintenance of the real value of family payments, with an indexation of pensions and benefits at the earliest possible time. I see the JET program as one of the symbols of the things which are important to us in terms of addressing child poverty and in terms of acknowledging the situation with a total and realistic package. In this respect, real payments have been made to families within the family allowance structure in terms of the marginal tax rebate and the whole tax system. This Bill goes a very long way to addressing the situation by implementing what is acknowledged by the Brotherhood of St Lawrence as a national attack on child poverty. The women in Australia, through the National Women's Consultative Council, have admired, embraced and encouraged our policy of attacking child poverty. They see it as being realistic. Our Government has moved, in an historic sense, not only to acknowledge that child poverty is a problem, but also to implement measures which redress an issue which is at the heart of poverty in this country. Through this Bill and through the programs which will be implemented under it, many will return to the work force. The cycle of poverty will have been broken not only for them but also for their children. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the House is addressing the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989. At the outset, I would like to clarify the fact that this should not be confused with other legislation which is scheduled to come forward on Wednesday night when we will have a cognate debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. This totally separate legislation relates to repatriation cover of our contingent serving in Namibia. I will have more to say about that separate legislation when it comes before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thrust of the Bill before the House tonight relates more to the Government's economic statement. So far as veterans' affairs is concerned, it relates in particular to the spending up of the consumer price index (CPI) increases in respect of the spectrum of pensions provided through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In saying that the legislation owes its genesis to the economic statement given by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 12 April, I make the point in passing that, since that statement, but for one night we have neither seen nor heard him. I realise that he is overseas having chosen, at long last, to attend a meeting of the Asian Development Bank. I realise that it is high time that Australia put more effort, at ministerial and other levels, into our relations with our neighbours, particularly South Asia, South East Asia and the South West Pacific. But the Parliament has been sitting for four days, deliberating on major legislation which was scheduled many months ago. Ministers have the capability of fine tuning their commitments to overseas functions such as an Asian Development Bank meetings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I turn to veterans and war widows directly for advice and response in respect of the 12 April economic statement given to this House. I can tell this House who makes the best judgment by drawing to its attention the fact that some 14 days after the economic statement, which was to do so much for the standard of living of veterans, war widows, aged pensioners and others, 2,000 veterans turned up to a meeting in the Sydney Town Hall. The meeting was not officially organised by the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) but by a group of very concerned veterans outside of the official veterans organisation structure. They came to the Town Hall in huge numbers to register their protest over the treatment they had received from this Government not only over six years but, to be fair, more particularly since the mini-Budget of May 1985 through to this year. I look to those people to give a very accurate response and judgment on the economic statement. If they had thought that the economic statement solved their problems and provided a boost to their standard of living which was so generous that they should not go ahead with their protest, they would not have turned up in those numbers at the Sydney Town Hall. But turn up they did. Two thousand veterans turned up the day after Anzac Day. They were angry about the treatment, the cutbacks and the complex changes which have impacted on veterans over the last four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation was deemed by that meeting to be doing no more than giving a little back to veterans, to reinstate their real position in terms of their standard of living. That is the reality of the situation. This legislation will speed up the passing on of CPI increases to veterans, war widows and other categories of pensioners. That is all it is doing. It is merely reinstating a measure of what the Government has taken away with its 10 big cut backs on veterans and war widows. I can track through the list of those 10 big cutbacks, as I have done on previous occasions and I make no apology for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the claim of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys)-and he is correct in one sense-that expenditure on veterans' affairs has risen from $2.5 billion in the early 1980s to $4.5 billion this financial year. That camouflages what has been happening in the engine room of entitlements to veterans, to war widows and to ex-prisoners of war. The list of 10 is factual, it is accurate. To be absolutely accurate, one of those 10 cutbacks has now been rectified in the details of the economic statement. I refer to the long overdue restoration of the 2 per cent Defence Force retirement benefits cutback which, after a strong campaign by the coalition, the RSL, the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association and other organisations, is now going to be restored, as well it should. That cutback, which was imposed in 1986, was clearly a breach of contract. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not run through the details of these 10 big cutbacks. I remind the House that all this Bill does for veterans and war widows is reinstate a measure of what they have lost under the Federal Labor Government. That fact emerged very clearly in the angry comments, resolutions and speeches made by veterans and war widows at the Sydney Town Hall. I acknowledge the Minister was unable to attend that meeting due to official duties associated with the visit to Australia by Vice-President Dan Quayle, but it was regrettable that no other Minister was available to attend that rally to represent the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) quite accurately summed up the anguish of many veterans. Their country travel allowance when they are referred to repatriation hospitals has been halved; their subsistence allowance has been virtually halved; a strict limit of $300 per annum has been imposed on four categories of dental treatment; war widows have been eliminated from the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The honourable member for Reid quite properly raised these matters in the House on 10 November 1988, by way of a question without notice to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He quite properly detailed the horrific nature of the hardship suffered by prisoners of war and the treatment they have received since World War II. The Prime Minister, in his reply, said that certain general reviews were taking place, that certain other measures would be developed and that there would be a response. That was said in November 1988. It is now May 1989, and the honourable member for Reid had to raise yet again the matter of a fair deal for veterans, and in particular for ex-prisoners of war. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not delay the House unduly with regard to this legislation, other than to say that there is an alternative. The alternative is laid out in the coalition's policy on veterans' affairs. It is all about a fair go for veterans and war widows. I accept the main thrust of this legislation in speeding up the CPI increases for the categories of disability pensions, intermediate rate, special rate, totally and permanently incapacitated pensions, service pensions, and so forth. Equally, I state again that it is merely reinstating that which veterans and war widows have lost under the harsh treatment meted out by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to highlight to the House some statistics relating to the projected age dependency ratios in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. The dependency rate for `old' represents the percentage of the population aged over 65, expressed as a percentage of the population aged from 15 to 64. What we see in Australia is that in 1985 that ratio was at the 13 per cent mark, but in the year 2025 it will rise to the 24 per cent mark-almost doubling. That has been pointed out in official papers by the Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, other departments and in ministerial statements. A great deal of very careful planning is required, especially with regard to veterans' affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> While the service pension and the disability pension have peaked in real numbers and direct expenditure, the treatment side of veterans' affairs and the war widows side of veterans' affairs have yet to peak. The big demand, especially on our repatriation hospitals, will not be reached until the early to mid-1990s. That fact must not be lost as the Government plans for the future, to ensure that we provide to our veterans, our war widows, our ex-prisoners of war, and our ex-service personnel generally, a fair deal and a fair go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in rising to support the legislation before the House. I think this legislation contains a number of momentous decisions for our social security system. They are decisions which provide significant money and for real increases in the level of family allowances. They also provide for an historic decision to index future increases in family allowances and to bring forward by 12 weeks the time period in which pension and beneficiary payments are indexed for the consumer price index (CPI). In those terms, I think this is indeed historic legislation which will provide enormous benefits to families-families with children; working and pensioner families-and to our old age pensioners in particular, throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the financial impact of this legislation, the full year cost in a couple of years time for the initiatives announced here will exceed $1 billion. I believe it is farcical for the Opposition to suggest that this legislation and these decisions are of no real significance to Australian families or to old age pensioners. It is completely out of context in relation to the measures which are before the House. I repeat: these are historic decisions. They not only increase the level of family allowances in real and money terms but also, perhaps even more importantly, provide for the future indexation of family allowances so that families with children, wherever they are in Australia, can know with certainty that their family benefits, their family allowances, will be maintained and will keep up with the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the comments made by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) were totally wide of the mark. Some of them were simply farcical. He did not even dwell on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill-the Bill before the House. He gave begrudging approval for some of the measures contained in the Bill and spoke instead about some alleged cutbacks which he suggests this Government has made to veterans' entitlements. I am sick and tired of coming into this House and hearing Opposition shadow Ministers complain continually about changes that are made-rightly-to government programs. Not once have I seen the Leader Opposition (Mr Howard), the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), or the shadow Minister for finance, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), come into this House and explain exactly what their spending programs are or where the money will come from to pay for the enormous tax cuts which they implicitly suggest will be provided by a future coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> In previous debates in this House I have heard the shadow Treasurer refer to proposed tax cuts in the order of $50 a week which could be provided by the Opposition if it were ever elected to government. The cost of those cuts would be in the order of $16 billion. The Leader of the Opposition promised in August last year to release the Opposition's tax and spending policies. It is now May 1989 and the public is still waiting for them. Honourable members opposite keep coming into this House and complaining about changes in spending programs, but we keep waiting to find out where the money is going to come from to finance the big tax cuts with which the Opposition again seeks to bribe voters in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister for finance has had the courage to say that tax cuts by a future coalition government would be paid for by spending cuts. I ask the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt)-I see he is in the House; he is a previous spokesperson for social security matters-whether the Opposition intends to cut spending on roads, schools and defence or whether it intends to cut spending to the States. If it does not intend to cut spending in any of those areas to pay for its tax cuts, the only areas which are left are areas of social security payment. They are precisely the measures which we are discussing tonight. If the the Opposition intends to promise major tax cuts in the future, I, for one, would like to know where it proposes to make the spending cuts to pay for the tax cuts referred to in its election promises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will certainly continue to address the fundamental issues raised by this legislation. This legislation concerns social security. I was making the fairly obvious point that if any political party goes into an election period promising tax cuts to voters and rules out expenditure cuts to roads, schools, defence and States and states further that the only way it will pay for those tax cuts is by spending cuts, the only area of budgetary discretion left which can be cut is social security. That is the relevance to the Bill before the House. There is a very clear, stark comparison between this side of the House and the other side of the House in these matters. As I said, it is now May 1989. In August 1988 we expected to hear from the Leader of the Opposition his promises and policy in relation to taxation and spending. We are still waiting for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anybody who wants any real indication of the Opposition's attitude to these fundamental matters affecting Australian families need only look to the record of the previous Government, in which the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. I will simply make a few points. I will not dwell on them: they speak for themselves. During Mr Fraser's period in office, when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, the additional pension for children was reduced by 35 per cent, the mother's or guardian's allowance was reduced by 35 per cent, the single rate of adult unemployment benefit was reduced by 18.6 per cent, and pensions for elderly people fell from around 24 per cent of average weekly earnings to around 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. That is the record of those opposite when they were in government. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this debate, people could not help noticing the events which have occurred in recent days. They are part of a longer term plan to change the face of the Opposition parties as we know them. Over the weekend a number of leading economic dries won preselection for the Liberal Party of Australia. I simply point out that there are already on the Opposition benches honourable members who have extremely dry-if I may use that expression-views on social security funding. When he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) said that the Opposition would simply abolish benefits for the long term unemployed if the Liberal Party ever got into power. In what was a weird twist of logic, he said that that would be doing a great deal for the unemployed. I simply do not share that view. Other honourable members opposite, such as Mr Wilson, who is now in the House, talked about the need to privatise big items of government expenditure as well as income security and welfare. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. A succession of Opposition spokespersons have advocated massive cutbacks in the social security budget. I see that the honourable member for Richmond is in the House. He is a former Opposition spokesman on social security. During his period as an Opposition frontbencher, his great contribution to social security debate was to suggest compulsory work for single parents. He thought it was a nice idea. He described it as a way of helping single parents get back into the work force. We on this side of the House simply do not accept the view that we should be dragging single parents out of their homes, putting them into factories, taking their children from them and placing them compulsorily in creches all day because we think it is good for them. I certainly do not look forward to hearing more of those views, but we can expect to hear more of those views expressed in the future because of the drift to the Right which was further accentuated by developments over the weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation before the House is very good legislation. It has been extremely well received throughout the Australian community. Late last year I was appointed a member of the retirement incomes task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). As a member of that task force it was my job to travel widely throughout Australia with other members of the task force to listen to the views of elderly Australians wherever they lived and whatever their circumstances. We listened to the views of thousands of elderly Australians and we attended more than 50 meetings. Some months ago we made a report to the Prime Minister on those consultations. </PARA>
<PARA> The task force visited my electorate of Bendigo, where there was a well attended meeting of about 100 pensioners. Among the issues raised was the question of the delay in time before pensions were indexed to the CPI. General concern was expressed about support for families through the family allowance system. There was also the question of the amount of income that pensioners can earn before they are taxed. I was delighted with the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the April statement that the Government had agreed to reduce the waiting period for the indexation of pensions by 12 weeks. The people who had attended that meeting in Bendigo were also delighted. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also extremely pleased with the decision in the April statement that over the next 18 months we would be extending to $40 the amount that pensioners could earn before they had to pay tax. More importantly, I was delighted with the Government's decision to increase substantially family allowances and to provide for future indexation of those benefits. To give an example of the sort of impact that this will have on families, as a result of these increases in the family allowance payment a family with two children will benefit by about $5 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that since this Government has been in office we have embarked on a policy of directing payments to those in need. The impact of world commodity prices in 1985 and 1986 certainly brought with it a demand on government to scrutinise very carefully every dollar of public expenditure. We responded to that world trade crisis, as it was for Australia, by carefully analysing all of the areas in which we allocate public money and making priorities for those areas in need. We have had to make some tough decisions, but as a result of those decisions we have been able to reduce government outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product and so generate some savings this year which we will be able to spend in areas of priority. A priority area is Australian families. We are doing that by increasing family allowances and we will be doing it in the future by indexing those family allowances. As I said before, these are momentous decisions. It takes a great deal of courage for a government to approve the indexation of future family payments but we will be doing so because we believe that families throughout Australia have the right to government support in the form of family allowances. They also have the right to expect that in the future those payments will be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly support the decision to bring forward the age pension increases through CPI increases. This will further increase the relative living standards of pensioners in the Australian community. Since we have been in government pensions have increased from around 22 per cent of average weekly earnings to the current level of about 25 per cent. As I say, that has been a great achievement in what have been pretty difficult economic times. We have managed to achieve that because it has been a priority area and we have wanted to spend money in those areas of greatest need. This Bill contrasts very sharply with Opposition policy in this area. </PARA>

I would hate to think that any major political party which expects the respect of the Australian people would go into the next election campaign without being specific as to its expenditure and tax policies but, unfortunately, that is certainly the position we have at the moment. That is an unfortunate decision. As I said before, with this shift to the New Right in the Liberal Party I suspect that it will not announce any policies because it is waiting for its new backbenchers to come into this Parliament after the next election. Those who have recently won preselection are certainly well to the right of the Liberal Party and certainly have very dry economic views so, if the Opposition were elected to government, I would be extremely fearful about the sorts of policies that it might inflict on Australian families and elderly Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take part in this debate on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill because it involves some very important issues that affect the future of the Australian nation and, in particular, the future of Australian families. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) commented on some of the remarks that I made earlier. He criticised comments that I have made about the desirability of privatising social expenditures and clearly showed that he is a person who believes that the only way in which social expenditures should be paid is through increased government dependence. I happen to believe that most Australians would like to be independent, that they would like to have earnings from their employment and earnings from their savings sufficient to enable them to provide for themselves, whether they are single or going through the family formation phase of wanting to build a house and pay it off; or the family formation stage of having children, of educating them and bringing them up; and there is also the stage when the children have left home and people have more resources available to them which they would like to be able to save to provide themselves with income in retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The privatisation of all those social expenditures is a dream which, given the intervention of government in the past, will take a long time to fulfil. The intervention of past governments was probably correct in the circumstances and times when governments felt that they should provide a safety net-a safety net which I believe is essential for a fair and equitable society. There was a tendency to believe that the only way to do that was to provide a safety net in a manner which encouraged more and more people to become reliant on that safety net. That structuring of tax and social security arrangements that so encourages people to want their share of the public sector cake has the effect of expanding, as it has over the past four or five decades, the numbers of people in categories that are clearly identifiable as being dependent on the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to believe that, if we changed our social security policy and our taxation policy, we would be able to encourage more and more Australians to be self-reliant through those phases of the life cycle. There is nothing more that Australians would like than to be able to do their own thing and to be able to live at an acceptable standard of living out of the resources that they themselves have earned and accumulated for times of need. The way in which this Government and its predecessors have introduced income tests and means tests has penalised those who save for retirement, and it makes it difficult for those who want to provide for their own family. It then becomes necessary for more and more money to be spent through public sector expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I want to touch briefly on the impact on families. The Government has made some changes. It has increased family allowances for most-but not all-children. It has increased them by bringing them up to a value that is not much, if at all, greater than what those family allowances could purchase when the Government came to office. To the extent that the Government may have marginally increased them, it is crowing that it has improved the level of those family allowance benefits. If honourable members have not understood it in the past, I make it quite clear now that I am one who has believed, and continues to believe, that the tax and social security system, even with the changes introduced by the Government, is still hostile towards families in terms of the allowances that are paid in respect of the bringing up of children. </PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance and social security system-and the tax system in so far as it impacts on families-does not give to all families recognition for the cost of maintaining children at an amount equal to the cost of the state maintaining those children when they are totally dependent on social security payments. While that happens there is within the tax and social security systems a bias which encourages people to change their social behaviour in a manner which continues to make them more reliant on the public sector than on their own resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax system should have within it a capacity to pay principle. The family allowance arrangement should be treated, in relation to 80 per cent of the recipients of the family allowance, as tax credits and not as welfare payments. Those tax credits-those family allowances-should be increased in line with the amount that is now paid to the recipients of the family allowance supplement plus the family allowance. It is only in that way that our social security system would give a full and adequate recognition to all families in respect of the cost of maintaining children. I know it is argued that that would cost a lot of money-and of course it would-but, to the extent to which there is a failure to increase family allowances for all children to the level that I am advocating, there is a level of income being received by an individual or that individual's family at which the children should be treated as a consumption expenditure and not as a significant element in determining the horizontal equity capacity to pay of a family that is paying tax and supporting children as compared with a single person on the same income and supporting no children or a dependent spouse. I know it involves a major change but, until we get that change and level out the tax system in a manner which brings into full account the capacity to pay, the tax system will affect social behaviour in respect of encouraging people in certain circumstances to become dependent on both the social security system and the public sector for social expenditures. In other circumstances we will have them adjusting their family size to take account of that hostile economic environment that confronts them. </PARA>
<PARA> If that means single people with high or medium incomes paying more tax, they should pay more tax. If it means couples who have gone through the phase of supporting their children and now have only themselves to support paying more tax, they should pay more tax. Those who should be supported by way of a capacity to pay allowance through the tax system should be given a fairer tax arrangement. In that regard, the allowances received by 80 per cent of families who are paying taxes and at the same time receiving social security payments in the form of family allowances should in my estimation, as I have said before, be treated as tax credits. To the extent that they are paid to families whose income is not sufficient to render them liable to any tax, they should be treated as a cashable tax credit. If one wants to categorise it as a welfare payment, that is all right by me. But it may be that one should categorise those payments not so much on a year by year basis but on a life cycle basis so far as the individuals within that family are concerned. Only in that way will we get to a situation where families will have fair and equitable tax and social security arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that speakers on the Government side, and no doubt those who follow me in this debate, would say that that will not enable us to do enough for those in need, trying to paint me into a corner as though I am not concerned about those families who are in need. I am as deeply concerned about those families as is any member of the Government. I believe that the allowances that are paid to those families should be adequate recognition of the costs of supporting those children and giving them a fair start in life. That I then go on to say that those same benefits should be available to all families to achieve horizontal and well as vertical equity in our tax and social security system is not to be taken as a lack of concern for those households with very low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said that it is going to index family allowances. I think that is a good thing. I have advocated it myself over a number of years. But it might have been better if we had put family allowances, the spouse rebates and other benefits relating to families on the same indexation factor as we are putting the family allowance supplement. The Government has tied the family allowance supplement to a proportion of pension. It is true that at the moment the pension is adjusting in accordance with the consumer price index (CPI) on a half-yearly basis. But the Government and, indeed, the Opposition have been pointing out the relationship of the age and other pensions to average weekly earnings. So, really, a double benchmark is being used in relation to the pension. Over recent years, because wages growth has been restrained as part of economic policy, there has been an endeavour to make our economy more efficient and competitive with our international trading partners by holding back wages whereas the CPI has gone ahead a little faster than average weekly earnings. It is that, and not any other direct adjustment, which has lifted the percentage that a pension bears to average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the Government's commitments in the past, when it has said that it would like to see the pension relationship tied to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings-indeed, on occasions it has made some favourable noises in respect of many pleas that the relationship should be moved to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings-progress has come about as a result of holding wages growth. There will be times when wages growth will be ahead of the CPI. I would like to see families, to the extent that their family allowances are indexed, given the same benefit as applies to pensioners and recipients of the family allowance supplement. But I emphasise again that the amount paid to families does not overcome the inequities within our system. We should not allow people to be misled into believing that these changes suddenly make the inequities in the overall system fair and balanced so far as the average Australian family is concerned. For the average Australian family which is just beyond the family allowance supplement area, the present level of family allowances and tax concessions, limited though they are, is totally inadequate in terms of giving full recognition to the effect on the capacity to pay tax or the responsibilities and costs of maintaining children. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes that remain, I want to touch on the question of the effect of the proposed changes on age pensioners. These changes have the effect of bringing up to date in a more contemporary sense the CPI adjustment of their pensions. However, the changes still do not make any ad hoc adjustment to determine what relationship pensioner income should bear to the income of the rest of the community. I raise again one or two points that I have previously brought up in debates in this House. I think that the relationship between the standard rate of pension and the married rate of pension does take into account the economies of scale that are available to a family or a married couple living in a house. I seriously question whether only married couples have the benefit of those economies of scale. There are many cases of two pensioners living in a household who have the same benefits of economies of scale. I am speaking of two pensioners who are not married, who are not in a de facto relationship but who get two pensions and have the same economies of scale. Yet married couples, de facto or de jure, are penalised by getting a reduced pension. I believe that we should look seriously at this question and ask ourselves whether the differential between the married rate pension per person and the standard rate pension should not be characterised as a living alone allowance and be made available to those who live alone. If it is argued then that the married rate pension is insufficient for some people, we should look at what its proper relationship should be to average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I want to make, to which the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) has responded on previous occasions, is that age pensioners in particular should be given the opportunity annually to reconcile their income. If at the end of a financial year their income from other sources has proved to be less than they reported to the Department of Social Security, an adjustment upwards of their pension should be made in the same way as one would adjust tax against the pay as you earn (PAYE) tax deductions. Similarly, over 12 months, as a consequence of interest rates perhaps rising and a report not being sent to the Department of Social Security in a timely fashion, there should be an adjustment down in the pension. This should be done in a way that does not deprive those pensioners of the means of supporting themselves week by week. There are already formulas whereby such clawbacks cannot be more than a certain percentage of the weekly payment of pension. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to those people who are virtually on permanent pensions, I still believe that annual reconciliation would be a much fairer system, both for those whose incomes change downwards and for those whose incomes change upwards. In my view they should not benefit from the fact that the adjustment processes forget about increases in their income if they are not reported in a timely fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I would like to stress is that I think the Government should look at part pensioners being enabled, if not voluntarily, as is the case now, even compulsorily, to have a PAYE liability for any tax that might be payable. In that regard, I want to touch on the effect upon pensioners of the Government's announcement. The Government has said that it will lift the tax threshold for pensioners. In my view it should have lifted the threshold for everyone. It would have been far more sensible to lift the threshold even to as high as $8,000 and have the marginal rate of tax at, say, 30c in the dollar, instead of keeping the threshold at $5,100, having a marginal rate of tax of 21c in the dollar and then-through a whole process of very difficult rebates that are wasted because of high marginal withdrawal rates-to exempt a large number of people in that low income bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is unfortunate that the Government, when it realised that it had to exempt certain pensioners from tax liability, did not recognise that it would have been much fairer to have exempted a large number of low income people from paying tax, even if that meant the marginal rate for people on higher incomes was a little higher. Their tax liability would then have been the same as it is now, with their liability to pay tax commencing at $5,100. I hope it will be possible for future governments to look at the rationality of the tax system and get a two-level tax system with a much higher threshold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to rise in support of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. In doing so I would like to concentrate my remarks on the aspects of the Bill dealing with retirement incomes. My colleagues the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) have spoken at length on other very beneficial aspects of the Bill, namely, the effect on families and sole parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very interesting to note that the Opposition spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), in his 30-minute address earlier this evening, made no reference at all to the provisions in the Bill for retired people and for pensioners in particular. This is indicative of the attention which the Opposition pays in general to these questions. Like the honourable member for Bendigo who spoke before me, I have had the pleasure in the last few weeks of being a member of the task force on retirement incomes of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Our consultations with older people indicated a number of things to us, but two of the aspects which have been raised continually at practically every meeting were, firstly, their grievance concerning the six-week deferral of the pension indexation rise dating from 1986 and, secondly, the confusion that existed over the income test-free area and the tax-free area. I am pleased that this Bill remedies those two grievances. </PARA>
<PARA> Consultations with older people indicated that the current 24-week delay between the end of the consumer price index (CPI) period and the passing on of pension increases was viewed as excessive. It undermined pensioners' confidence in the indexation process. A range of official and community bodies, including the Social Security Review, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes, the Australian Council of Social Service and the Australian Pensioners Federation had recommended that indexation be brought forward. The Government has therefore decided to bring forward the indexation timetable by 12 weeks in three stages, over three indexation periods. The December 1989 rise will now occur in November, the June 1990 rise will now occur in April and the December 1990 rise will occur in September. </PARA>
<PARA> The June 1989 rise, contrary to what many people have thought or said, will in fact go ahead as scheduled; on that date, 22 June, the single rate of pension will increase from $124.25 per week to $129.20 per week, and the combined married rate will rise from $207.10 per week to $215.40 per week. From September 1990 indexation will occur each September and March based on the CPI figures for the preceding March-June and September-December quarters. The result-and this is very important-is that we will have thereafter the speediest form of CPI indexation in history. Eight weeks after the release of the June and December quarter CPI figures, pensioners will receive a commensurate increase in their pension; that is, they will receive a higher indexed rate of pension for 24 weeks of each year, compared to the current system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has done much more than simply remove the six-week indexation delay. This point was laboured very much by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) earlier this evening. It has restored it with interest. The reaction to this has been no more than it has deserved. The bringing forward of pension indexation has been welcomed by the Australian Pensioners Federation. In a press release on the night of the economic statement it described the move as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . good news for pensioners . . . particularly those struggling to keep pace with rising prices . . . The Treasurer's reform will do much to allow pensioners to maintain their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, pensioners appreciate the crucial importance of an automatic and speedy indexation system. Not so, however, the shadow Minister for social security, who told a Canberra seminar on 17 April:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the critical situation facing the Australian economy the priority must obviously be to control inflation, but the willingness to do so is seriously reduced if indexation is used as an indiscriminate tool of policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Are we meant to infer from this that the shadow Minister for social security is not necessarily committed to the indexation of pensions? Certainly no commitment in that respect has been given so far. </PARA>
<PARA> The other main aspect of the statement which affects pensioners is that they will now receive a boost in their after tax incomes as a result of our decision to make the pension income test-free area also 100 per cent tax free. Our consultations on the task force clearly revealed the confusion created by separate free areas for pension and taxation purposes. The Government has therefore decided totally to align the two free areas in 1989-90 for married couples, and in two stages, up to 1990-91, for single pensioners. So the tax-free area will be $40 per week for a single pensioner and $70 per week combined for a married couple. This year, in 1988-89, despite the fact that we have raised the pensioner rebate from $250 to $430, the tax-free area is, by contrast, only about $10 per week for a single pensioner, and in 1987-88 it was less than $4 per week. As honourable members can see, that is a very substantial increase in the tax-free area. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision will benefit over one million age pensioners. It will free more than three-quarters of all age pensioners, whose private non-pension income is less than the free area, from having to worry about tax, and it will free another 75,000 age pensioners from liability for provisional tax. Honourable members will know that the question of provisional tax is a very vexing one to pensioners. The Government's decision actually goes beyond the recommendation of the Social Security Review in the Cass report, which was to make only half the income test-free area also tax free. Some rather ill-informed commentators have claimed that most age pensioners are too old or too unwell to work to earn extra non-pension income, and that they will presumably not benefit from the decision, but this is not correct. The free area does not only cover earned income from paid employment; it covers all relevant income received by age pensioners-interest from investments, superannuation pensions, as well as earnings from paid employment. Out of 1.3 million age pensioners, 1.15 million report some such income. The fact is that we have freed the vast majority of age pensioners from tax on any non-pension income that they receive. For them we have made the recent debate about the tax treatment of interest from investments absolutely irrelevant. It will be irrelevant to them because we have delivered a more far-reaching reform. We have taken them out of the tax system and made their interest income tax free if their non-pension income in 1990-91 is below the pension for the income test free area. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider, for example, a single age pensioner whose only private non-pension income comes from interest from investments. In 1989-90, they will be able to receive up to $25 a week and still get the full pension and pay no tax. In 1990-91, this amount will increase to $40 a week. With a savings investment account paying 12 per cent per annum interest, such a pensioner could invest up to $10,800 next financial year and $17,300 in 1990-91 at 12 per cent interest without losing one cent of pension and without paying one cent of tax. Age pensioners with several thousand dollars in cheque accounts or in 3.75 per cent passbook accounts now have a real incentive to maximise their investment income. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is a very important measure because I hear constantly of pensioners in my electorate who have their money languishing in non-interest bearing deposits or, worse still, hidden under the bed or in the teapot because they are afraid of losing some of their pension or having to pay some tax. Now, these pensioners will have a much greater incentive to invest their income properly and not sell themselves short. </PARA>
<PARA> Gains from the Government's April statement measures are not restricted to those age pensioners with private non-pensionable income below the free area. The combined operation of the pensioner tax rebate and the reduction in tax rate means that those pensioners still paying tax will receive a significant boost in their after tax income. For example, a single age pensioner with private non-pension income of $100 a week will pay $6.75 a week less tax in 1989-90 and $11.75 a week less tax in 1990-91 compared with the current situation. A single age pensioner with a private income of $150 a week will be $7.50 a week better off in 1989-90 and $12.50 a week better off in 1990-91. Again, the public and media reaction to this measure has been very favourable.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Adelaide Advertiser of 17 April, a media commentator and financial consultant, Daryl Dixon, said that the pensioner tax changes were the best news of the economic statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Up to 80 per cent of pensioners stand to benefit, which is an excellent change that should be welcomed by all retired persons. </PARA>
<PARA>Compare again the Government's performance on this issue with the platitudes of the Opposition. On page 72 of Future Directions age pensioners are warned that `the precise details of our-the Opposition-social security and taxation policies must await our assessment of the overall resources available nearer the time of the election'. Madam Deputy Speaker, do not hold your breath because the tax policy is now nine months overdue. How much longer do you think we will have to wait for the Opposition's retirement incomes policy? The preview we have had of the Opposition's retirement income policy released earlier this year promised absolutely nothing concrete on this crucial issue, merely saying that all aspects of personal taxation which impact upon retirees, including the tax threshold, will receive sympathetic consideration in the coalition's tax policy which, as I said, was due in August last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another aspect of the April statement which is out of the scope of this Bill, but which I mention briefly. That is the important provision which restored the 2 per cent discount in their superannuation pensions to former Defence Force and Commonwealth Government employees. As you probably would know, Madam Deputy Speaker, and as many of my colleagues would know, these ex-Commonwealth Government employees and their associations have been unstinting in their push for the restoration of that 2 per cent and their strong lobbying and our good housekeeping in having a surplus this year have paid off and we were able to give them back that 2 per cent. We thank them for their past restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Government's complete retirement incomes policy package will be announced in a couple of months time. I stress that the provisions in the April statement are only part of the retirement incomes policy which is still being formulated. I have been pleased to be part of the process at the grass roots and community levels as a member of the retirement incomes task force, but I have also had the opportunity to speak more formally with a number of organisations with an interest in the whole question of retirement incomes. These groups include the South Australians section of the Zurich Insurance Company and members of the International Association of Investment Planners. These encounters were useful to me to gauge the views of the people involved in the personal investment industry, particularly those doing business with retired people. </PARA>
<PARA> One striking feature of these meetings was the generally broad support for and understanding that they have of the direction in which the Government is going and particularly for the general thrust of the Cass report. In particular, there is broad support amongst these groups for the twin pillars of pension and occupational superannuation as the foundation for our retirement incomes system. There is also wide support for the notion of targeting assistance for those most in need and of encouraging superannuation in the form of annuities rather than lump sums. I believe that these meetings I have had with representatives of the personal investment industry have been to both my benefit and their benefit and I hope that the confrontation and enmity which has existed to some extent between the Government and that group is a thing of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear on the radio this morning Mr Bernard Lord, the National President of the Australian Retired Persons Association (ARPA), speaking about their Aged Bill of Rights which has just been released. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Lord a couple of weeks ago when I spoke at an ARPA seminar in Adelaide. He told me about their imminent Bill of Rights. I have not had a chance to look at it in detail; but, from what Mr Lord said, it seems on the face of it a reasonably responsible document. It advocates among other things an increase in the pension rate to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings, which was one of the long-term proposals of the Cass report. ARPA has costed its proposals, which is more than most other aged lobby groups have done-or the Opposition has done-although it is not publicising the cost, which I believe detracts somewhat from the credibility of this document. A more informed mind than mine has put a rough estimate of the cost of these proposals at between $4 billion and $5 billion, but I believe that more detailed costing is being carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> ARPA is one of a number of longstanding reputable aged associations which have become increasingly vocal over the past few months-and quite justifiably so. I and others have been saying for a long time that the aged lack a voice in our society and it is pleasing to see that that is being remedied. As I said, many longstanding reputable aged associations, such as ARPA the Combined Pensioners Association, and in South Australia the Aged and Invalid Pensioners Association, various councils on the ageing, retired union members associations, and the RSL have become more active and increasingly vocal in the past year or two and partisan governments have listened to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there are a number of self-seekers and opportunists who have jumped on the aged bandwagon for party political reasons or to push the barrow of narrow vested interests. For example, there is one group in South Australia led by a former `Joh for Canberra' National Party Senate candidate-who still claims to be non-party political-which was organised initially by the Liberal Party, but I think that the group got so much out of control that even the Liberal Party deserted it. Following a meeting in my electorate the group announced that its priority would be to lobby the Government to abolish the capital gains tax and the assets test. If a group wants to lobby for abolition of the capital gains tax and the assets test it has every right to do so but let it not pretend, as this group is doing, that it is doing so in the interest of all aged people. What on earth is exemption from tax on gains from speculative investments, or from property other than the family home, going to do for the vast bulk of retired people? What is restoration of the pension to asset wealthy people going to do for the vast bulk of retired people? Nothing at all. Every dollar we give to aged people who do not need it is a dollar less we have to give to aged people who do need it. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to read over the weekend that the leader of the Grey Power party in Victoria said that Grey Power is prepared to support the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) in the hope that he may push for the abolition of the assets test. Does the honourable for Goldstein support the abolition of the assets test? I doubt it very much because the honourable member for Goldstein is a very reasonable man. Does the next Liberal member for Higgins, Mr Costello, support the abolition of the assets test? Obviously not, because on the radio this morning he said that he favours increased targeting within the welfare system. The only Liberal member I know who supports the abolition of the assets test is the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt) because he has said often in this House what a terrible thing the assets test is. One wonders which of the constituents of the honourable member for Adelaide he has been listening to. It would certainly not be his pensioners out in the northern suburbs because they have absolutely nothing to gain and everything to lose by the abolition of the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> One unfortunate thing is that many of the reputable aged lobby groups in Australia at the moment are being tarnished by the same brush as the disreputable ones. We can only hope that members of the public, and aged people in particular, can make the distinction between those two groups. Finally, I would like to commend this Bill to the House in all its respects, particularly in respect to the provisions and the benefits it brings to retired people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been interesting to listen to the debate tonight from both sides of the House. Earlier this evening I had the opportunity to listen to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) in his address to the House, an address in which he spent a great deal of time trying to put some scare tactics into motion by putting words into the Opposition's mouth. This is a tactic which the Government has been engaging in for some years now. It is very concerned as to the way in which the veteran and ex-service community is perceiving this Government's responsibilities in its particular area. It is also concerned as to the way in which the pensioner community in Australia is perceiving the way this Government is handling its affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In both cases they have some justification for concern. But in the process of trying to deflect the attack from the pensioner community and from the veteran and ex-service community it is saying things which are incorrect about the Opposition in the hope that it can whittle away support that the Opposition has been gaining over the last few years as a result of the Federal Government's inability properly to manage the affairs of the ex-service, veteran and pensioner communities. The attacks by the honourable member for Bendigo tonight were typical of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable members on the Government side of the House that they have to do a lot more than the weak attempts they have made through this debate to hurt the Opposition's standing within the ex-service, veteran and pensioner communities. I can assure honourable members, from the correspondence that I have received in my electorate office in Goulburn and by contact with people throughout the community, that the Government has a real problem on its hands. One only has to go back to the meeting that was held in the Sydney Town Hall last year when the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay) was representing the Government at a very large pensioner rally which was addressed not only by himself but also by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). On that occasion the Government received a very clear message. I note that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) is sitting at the table tonight. No doubt he has had plenty of opportunities to consider the views that were expressed by those people at that rally in Sydney last year. They were not cheering the Government; they were booing and hissing the Government. They were cheering and clapping the words of the Leader of the Opposition and our shadow Minister for social security. That rally is typical of the way in which this Government is being received when we discuss matters relating to pensioners and the veteran and ex-service community. </PARA>
<PARA> My comments tonight will stick briefly to the Government's decision to correct the anomaly that it created through the defence force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme and also to bring forward to a more respectable date the date for pension indexations. I know the Whips tonight have asked honourable members on both sides of the House to restrict their speeches to ensure that as many honourable members as possible have a chance to speak on the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill; so I shall make my comments as brief as I can. </PARA>
<PARA> The first part of my address is in relation to the defence force retirement and death benefits scheme. This has been the most visible aspect of the concern and dissatisfaction from the veteran and ex-service community towards the Federal Government. I think there has been a great deal of disenchantment as a result of the Government's decision in 1986 to reduce those benefits that it paid to ex-service member and veterans in our community by 2 per cent. That reduction has been unbelievably badly received throughout the community. When I say unbelievably, I suppose from the Government's point of view it is unbelievable. But the point that it fails to understand is that those people who lost that 2 per cent of their benefits believed that that 2 per cent was theirs by right. It was something they contributed to and worked towards in order to receive for the rest of their lives. They found suddenly that the Government was to remove that benefit and in the process break an act of faith. As a consequence it hurt so many people who have served their nation in either the theatre of war or through being conscripted or volunteer members of our defence forces. As a result of that we have seen the ex-service community face a tremendous reduction in its morale and a tremendous reduction in its respect for the Government and for political parties in general. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter what governments do, if they do bad things it hurts all political organisations because people lose faith not only in governments but in the spoken words and promises of politicians. The Government has indirectly hurt the institution of this Parliament by doing something that has hurt the ex-service community so badly. As a result of that we have seen morale within our present defence forces reduced because it cannot help but affect the way those people think. If people who are currently working in our defence forces expect that when they retire, having given years of service, they will receive a benefit and then find out that in the process of their active work within the Defence Force along the way the Government axes the benefits of those people who have retired before them, then they must seriously doubt the goodwill of the Government when it makes its promises to them throughout their working career. This has affected the morale of our active service personnel. That has been reflected in the record high resignation rates we have seen over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern that has come from the 2 per cent reduction in the DFRDB scheme has added to the weight of disenchantment that members of the ex-service community have had towards this Government. It is not only that which has caused concern; it is the whole way in which the Federal Government has introduced veterans' entitlements benefits in this chamber. I think it was in May 1985 that the Veterans' Entitlements Bill was brought into this House. In the process of its introduction we saw the Federal Government trying to do some shocking things to war widows. We saw the Government slash in half things such as travelling allowances for veterans in the process of receiving medical treatment. We have seen one of the most disgraceful attacks ever on our veterans through that Bill that was pushed through this Parliament back in 1985. Had it not been for the efforts of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) in his campaign to right the wrongs inherent in the Veterans' Entitlements Bill, the veterans in this country would be suffering far worse than they are today. The efforts of the honourable member for Farrer, the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL) and the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association (RDFWA) helped to ensure that some 41 of the 42 amendments that the Opposition put forward were eventually passed through Parliament, despite the best efforts of this Government. As a result of those amendments and the very good work of all of the people that have been mentioned, today veterans throughout Australia enjoy a far better level of service from government. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue has caused a great deal of concern. I have had the opportunity to speak on this matter a number of times in this Parliament. I have spoken on this matter because so much concern has been expressed to me by people throughout my electorate. I have even had cause to read a letter from a constituent from Kangaroo Valley who is a returned Vietnam veteran. He expressed his concern and anguish at the way in which this Government had cheated him through the reduction of that 2 per cent from the DFRDB. So, tonight in the process of debating this matter we must at least express some appreciation that the Government has recognised the mistake that it made several years ago and that it has reinstated that 2 per cent. Of course, in the process, the Government will not backdate that reinstatement and make up for the financial loss that so many people throughout the community have incurred through the Federal Government's mismanagement of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to make some remarks tonight on the Federal Government's decision to bring forward pension indexation dates to correct the wrongs that were created back in 1986. At that time the Government cheated pensioners in the Australian community. It cheated them by pushing back by six weeks the date for the analysis of pension indexation. Many people might say that that is not a lot, that it might not have much effect. But let me point out to the House that many people throughout the community have recognised that it does have an effect, that it has hurt our pensioners-and, of course, that is one of the reasons why so many of them are concerned about the way in which the Government is operating its social security portfolio. It is why so many pensioners turned up at the rally at the Sydney Town Hall last year to boo and to jeer representatives of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision today to bring forward the date, not just to the previous date but to even six weeks earlier, is a welcome one. I am sure many people throughout the electorate will acknowledge the benefits that that will have. However, the Government has a long way to go before it will be able to satisfy the pensioners throughout my electorate. I have been in touch with them and I know that they are concerned that it has taken the Government such a long time to try to live up to its promise of reaching a pension level of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. I know that it will take a long time for pensioners to forgive the Government for removing so many of the prescription or medical items from the free list and for the changes that were made to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I know that it will take a long time for the pensioners in my electorate to forgive the Government for the huge, and growing, waiting lists for public hospitals which so many people need to get into in order to receive proper medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Members on this side of the House understand why the Government is so sensitive in its portrayal of its management of both its Veterans' Affairs portfolio and its Social Security portfolio. We know why people are writing to their local representatives and why they are writing to the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Farrer--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially, I want to comment on the contributions made by my colleagues. In particular, I think the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey), the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) articulated very aptly the Government's concerns in relation to this social security package. I want to address my attention to the virtuoso performance of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) in obfuscating the Opposition's position and misrepresenting the Government's policy initiatives. First, though, I want to put a couple of points on record, because I think they are extremely important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my view, and I think the considered view of many people in the community, that this Government's social justice initiatives-in particular, the reforms announced in the April statement dealing with pensioners and other beneficiaries as well as the incomes of needy families-involve a package which, historically, will be seen as one of great vision. It is a package in which the Minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), can take a great deal of pride. Indeed, it is a package in which the Government can take a great deal of pride. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard this afternoon the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), with his usual obfuscation-which is quite usual for the honourable member and he continually does this-being derisive of this package and program. On the one hand, he supported it and said that he supported the family assistance scheme while, on the other hand, he said that he did not think the Government had been doing enough. The Minister for Social Security has indicated on a number of occasions the abysmal social security and veterans' affairs record of the parties opposite when they were in government. I will take great pleasure in referring to a number of these areas in the course of my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about this historic package, this measure of great foresight and vision which has been introduced by the Minister for Social Security, we have to understand the context in which it was introduced in this House. It was negotiated and introduced with the context of structural adjustment and a wage-tax trade-off, supported by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) through the prices and incomes accord-an historic accord which, like the social justice strategy, is unprecedented in the history of public policy and administration in this country. This approach exemplifies the unquestionable commitment to the welfare and future of Australian families, which has been so clearly articulated by the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which we are now debating. This stands in stark contrast to the record of the Opposition parties when they were in government and the empty rhetoric that masquerades as the Opposition's platform. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer for a moment to the performance of Opposition members when they were in government. First, I refer to the period when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer. He removed the requirement in the Social Security Act that unemployed people should be registered for work. He ran a social security system which required no effective proof of identity. He managed the economy in such a way that the number of beneficiaries increased by 280,000 in the two years from 1981 to 1983. He had a benefits system which meant that it cost an unemployed person with a dependent spouse and a couple of children money to work. The result was an absolute disaster. In 1976 there were 63 beneficiaries for every 100 unemployed people, as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). In 1983, there were 91 beneficiaries for every 100 unemployed people. We have now reduced that figure to 74 beneficiaries for every 100 unemployed people. The Leader of the Opposition's slack administration when he was Treasurer of this country led to every unemployed family being suspected and blamed just because they needed some money to live on. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of this Government stands in stark contrast, and the achievements are legion. The achievements are legion. Let me outline just a few of them. As a result of the initiatives taken by the Minister for Social Security who is at the table, there has been less demand by social security payments on the Budget and on our taxes; there has been a reduction in the proportion of real Budget outlays on social security from 24.1 per cent in 1983-84 to 23 per cent in 1987-88; there has been less demand on the economy, real social security outlays as a percentage of real gross domestic product have declined from 6.9 per cent in 1983-84 to 6.2 per cent in 1987-88. We have reduced dependence on social security. The number of Department of Social Security pensioners and beneficiaries has decreased as a percentage of the population from 19 per cent at June 1983 to 16.9 per cent in June 1988. There has been a smaller burden on workers. The number of DSS pensioners and beneficiaries, as a percentage of the labour force, has similarly declined from 41.9 per cent in June 1983 to 35.2 per cent at June 1988. Significant increases in the rates of payment of pensions, benefits and allowances, and in the free area have been produced by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition derides the initiatives of this Government. The honourable member for Bradfield said today-and I think this is an accurate quote-`Social justice under Labor has failed because Australia is a less fair society than it was in the 1970s'. He also said, `The tragedy of child poverty has become a major issue now'. As the Minister at the table has pointed out on a number of occasions, the reason child poverty has become a major issue now is that this Government, through this Minister at the table, has put it clearly on the agenda. It was hidden by the Opposition. Its record in government is a clear demonstration of its lack of interest in the poverty of Australian families and, in particular, the poverty that confronts many Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA> On an Australian Broadcasting Corporation television program last week, the honourable member for Bradfield debated these matters with the Minister for Social Security. He said quite a number of revealing things during that program, which he reinforced in his speech today. He said that poverty issues were not as great then, when the previous Government was in office, as they are today. As I said, the reason the poverty issue is on the agenda today is that this Government has chosen to recognise the issue of child poverty; it has chosen to recognise and address the concerns of Australian families; it has chosen to recognise the concerns of those people on retirement incomes and to address them, as it has done quite ably and aptly in the April statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield, in the course of the debate with the Minister last week-which every reasonable and unbiased critic would have to say the Minister for Social Security won hands down; clearly, the shadow spokesman is not on top of the subject-referred to Aboriginal children in central Australia. He said, `Go to the central areas of Australia and see how the Aboriginal kids are living out there'. This afternoon in the debate he chose that subject again. I know that the honourable member for Bradfield, when he was shadow spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, made one visit to Papunya, Yuendumu and Kintore. He pointed out in the House today his concern for those people. What the honourable member for Bradfield lacks in understanding he makes up for in audacity. The honourable member should know that the major initiatives that have been taken in the area of child poverty by this Government apply equally to Aboriginal Australians and to non-Aboriginal Australians. The steps taken by this Government in the area of Aboriginal affairs, particularly in the area of poverty of Aboriginal Australians, are unsurpassed in the history of this nation. But the honourable member for Bradfield fails to recognise that fact or accord the Government its due. </PARA>
<PARA> He ought to know that this Government is about change. He would know that change in the area of Aboriginal affairs of this country, to deliver better services to those Aboriginal people he says he is concerned about, has been frustrated time and again by the Opposition. That is the reason that there may be some concern about this Government's delivery of services. We are unable to convince the Opposition, or the conservative parties in this nation, of the need to accord Aboriginal people their due. As I say, the honourable member has the audacity to come in here and pinpoint the concerns of Aboriginal Australians when the position adopted by the Opposition-in this House and elsewhere in Australia-on poverty, including Aboriginal poverty, is unsurpassed. The Opposition shows a lot of gall in the way in which it addresses this issue and in its failure to support Government initiatives in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's approach is illuminating. It has not said one word about what it would do for families. The Opposition spokesman on social security and retirement income today has vilified the Government's approach to poverty and the treatment of families. But what did he offer in terms of constructive comment? What did he offer in terms of a constructive approach to the way in which the Government is handling these issues? He did not offer a constructive approach. But I suppose one cannot blame him for that, in that he is in a sense a pawn of the `furtive delusions' document which was produced by the Opposition in October last year-a matter to which he referred proudly in the course of his address. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has a confused approach to this problem. On the one hand it promises to cut spending; it talks about further fiscal restraint without acknowledging the record of this Government in that area. On the other hand, it promises to expand spending and to introduce new programs. It displays clearly its lack of understanding of the detail of programs. I would like to point out something which the Minister for Social Security referred to during Question Time this afternoon. I am sure that he will not mind if I repeat it. He referred to a statement made by the shadow finance spokesman, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). He is reported to have said in the Advertiser of 22 January:</PARA>
<PARA> I just used to get offended, quite frankly, sitting in the (Fraser) Cabinet room and seeing that, despite all the technical and other analysis that was done and put on the table, quite often a decision was taken on the basis of something a farmer said he had heard in a pub the night before, or that one of his mates had told him. </PARA>
<PARA> It was government by anecdote rather than by analysis. </PARA>
<PARA>The same person made a similar statement in which he demonstrated his lack of understanding about the context in which the Opposition is formulating its policy when he made a statement on the Face to Face program on 12 March 1989. In part he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We'll spell out the cuts-</PARA>
<PARA>he was referring, no doubt, to fiscal restraint and further cuts in government expenditure-</PARA>
<PARA>but just to put it in its correct context . . . we are not so focused on the old idea if you like, the simplistic notion of just cut, cut, cut and basically what I have got in mind is improved financial administration . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same discussion he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can give you some examples. We spend say about $25 or $26 billion on social security and welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Why do we spend that?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there are some disadvantaged and needy people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, how many are there?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied: with 16 million people, is it one million. Now they're getting about $26,000 a head if it is one million. Is it one in eight, I'm sorry, two million out of 16? I mean, they're getting $13,000 a head. My point is, it is not effectively targeted, and that's one issue. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the shadow spokesman on finance telling us that he was concerned about making policy on financial administration during his period with the Fraser Government. No doubt he advised the shadow Minister for social security on the finance of the Department and where it could cut expenditure, not understanding and not knowing the basis on which he would make those decisions. Yet the Opposition is saying that it would further cut government expenditure without acknowledging the steps that have been taken by this Government in terms of fiscal reform in this country and without acknowledging the steps that have been taken by the Minister for Social Security in addressing the needs of child poverty in this country and addressing the needs of families. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Opposition has been absolutely silent in putting forward positive policy initiatives in the area of families. We have not seen what it is supposed to be producing. Opposition members articulate this concern; they try to deride Government decisions; they try to erode public confidence in the decisions which have been made and the commitments that have been made by this Government, in particular by the Minister for Social Security. They try to undermine the support that has been given to the social justice strategy of this Minister and this Government by groups such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the honourable member for Bradfield quoted at some length today from the Australian Institute of Family Studies report Families and the Tax Package, a copy of which I have in front of me. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure I will not bore you with this because it will be tantalising information which I am sure you will take back to your party room. In the concluding remarks it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Overall, the Government's tax package redresses substantially all of the deficiencies in the tax-transfer system affecting families and single individuals, as identified in Families and Tax in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>A bit later on the report refers to the benchmarks and states:</PARA>
<PARA>The benchmarks for assistance to low income families were met, so underpinning the incomes of all families with children. An historic decision was made to index all payments relating to children. </PARA>
<PARA>What does the Opposition think about those initiatives? Does it support them and give them the praise that they deserve? Does it articulate its support publicly out in the electorate? Of course not. Opposition members know that they are principled and historic decisions which they would never have had the guts to make in government. Not only that, they know that if they were in government they would probably rescind them. They would try to rescind them. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this afternoon we heard the honourable member for Bradfield talking about targeting. He was concerned about means testing family allowances. He was concerned about the redistribution of wealth in this country and the concerns of needy families, those in poverty in this country. He does not understand the issue of poverty. He does not understand the issue of social justice. The Australian Labor Party's commitment at the last election was to deliver a guaranteed adequate income for all families with children. Labor has delivered on that commitment. For us the family means jobs, bringing inflation down, housing, bringing down interest rates down, child care, education, and health care that every Australian family can afford. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of this Government is unsurpassed. Primarily, as I have said earlier, the family means jobs. A total of 1.3 million jobs have been created by this Government. In the area of child-care we have increased the number of child-care places by some 300 per cent from 40,000 when we came to office in 1983 to the current record high of 120,000. We expect more. That is the record of a government which is truly committed to social justice. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill should be fully supported by both sides of the House. I urge all honourable members to support the legislation and reject the fatuous amendment which has been put by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to some of the last statements of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) about the Government's record in relation to interest rates. Is he talking about the current level of interest rates, the highest ever, as something to be proud of? I will also have a few words to say about the Government's record with regard to jobs if time permits. Let me begin by saying that this is important, but long overdue, legislation. Government speakers, including the honourable member for the Northern Territory, have been describing the legislation as historic, or words to that effect. This is the seventh year of the Hawke Government. It is not as if the Government has not had time to get on with these changes. Perhaps the changes are historic in the sense that they have been delayed so long. Moreover, their very urgency has been of the Government's own doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The family has not been given the priority under this Government that it should have been. The family is the basic unit of society. As Mrs Thatcher recently put it: it is nursery, school, hospital, leisure centre, place of refuge, place of rest. It encompasses the whole of society. The basic building block of our society has been put under great strain by this Government. I stress the primarily economic factors-the continued significant inflation, the general fall in living standards, and the great escalation particularly in the cost of home ownership. But there has also been a considerable erosion of fundamental family and social values-the blunting of self-reliance, inadequate incentive for hard work and reward for effort, and the easy tolerance of and insufficient real help to counter the 900-odd marriage breakdowns per week. I would make reference to what I would regard as no real crackdown on drugs and to Canberra's role as the porn capital of Australia. We must not kid ourselves that the children and the young, let alone criminal elements, do not get access to all that lousy material. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to stress the general fall in living standards fundamentally associated with the abysmal productivity performance under this Government. It is largely due to the Government's failures in economic policy and increasingly importantly in the micro-economic area. Improvement is fundamental to getting this country back on a sound economic course. That fall in living standards derives particularly from two factors: the general incidence of taxation under this, the highest taxing government in Australia's history; and, secondly, the sustained very high interest rates, with mortgage repayments, on average, up by the order of $40 a week or $2,000 a year as compared with six months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Even within that general context of falling living standards, the impact on families has been differentially severe. In his second reading speech the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) made much of Australia not having a wages system that recognised the cost of children-it never has, I might say-and therefore that this has had to be addressed by the tax and social security system. He avers that not until this `historic' legislation has that happened. It did happen in quite significant degree under previous governments. It ill behoves this Minister and the Hawke Government not to acknowledge that at this time of their general awakening. With the prospect, no doubt, of an early election, they want to get this thing in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to quote from an authoritative study of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, an independent organisation, indeed, funded by this Government. One can take pretty serious notice of its findings. On the key table on page 10 of the report it sets out the changes in real disposable income for individuals and families on average weekly earnings by family type and especially differentiated according to the number of children. All family types gained from 1976-77 to 1984-85, as is clearly set out in this table. But from 1984-85 to 1988-89-and I will leave it to honourable members to guess under whose stewardship that occurred-we have a situation where the standard of living of all family groups fell. In relation to that I quote from page 10:</PARA>
<PARA> Families have done worse than single persons and the extent of their loss rises with the number of their children, this difference between single persons and families relates to the fall in the real value of the family components in the tax system. In 1976-77, a taxpayer on AWE with a spouse and two children was given a 46 per cent reduction in tax compared to a single person-</PARA>
<PARA>That is to say, the family paid roughly half the taxation of the single person. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> By 1988-89, this percentage had dropped to 26 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>So the family was paying about 75 per cent of the single person's tax. At this eleventh hour in terms of the election cycle and the election timetable, we now have a package of measures to rectify this position to some extent and to introduce an increase in and indexation of benefits, family allowance, spouse rebate and sole parent rebate, to give justice to the Minister for Social Security. That is greatly to be welcomed but it should not have been delayed all this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for the Northern Territory claimed that under this Government families have been assisted in other areas. I have already made reference to interest rates and the cost of housing; so I will not labour that point. I cannot imagine what he could claim in that area. I do want to make brief reference to the much vaunted increase in employment since the Hawke Government came to office. There has been an increase of about 1.3 million jobs. We need to see that in perspective. For instance, employment growth in Australia has always been high. It is implied that Australia has done something very significant in this area. Employment growth in Australia has always been much higher than the average for Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Thus, over the 20 years from 1968, employment growth in Australia averaged 2.5 per cent annually, compared with just over one per cent annually for the total OECD. One immediate factor that that correlates with is the more rapid increase in Australia's population. </PARA>
<PARA> I touch on a different point when I say that this strong employment growth has not been confined to the years of Labor's accord, as is often argued. Indeed, Australia has experienced a particularly strong rate of growth over the whole period since World War II. There was, of course, consistent rapid growth in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. But under the much maligned Fraser Government, which the Minister in particular is wont to criticise, employment growth was at first slow as the economy was bent back into shape after the destructive Whitlam years. But from 1979 there was a strong employment growth, with the economy generating some 530,000 jobs over the period of the Fraser Government to the cyclical peak in September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> What needs to be recognised is that, whereas that job growth under the Fraser Government was soundly based on resource development, as its motor force, under the Hawke Government, having benefited early on from the breaking of the drought, the Fraser wages pause and the upswing in the world business cycle, we had thereafter a large measure of growth which can be described as largely growth on tick-a sort of forced feeding of demand via the Budget deficit over most of that period, showing up in the vast balance of payments deficit. As that vast deficit has persisted, there has been an inexorable growth in the overseas debt-from $30 billion in 1983 to $120 billion to date. Honourable members could say that for each of those additional jobs there was a cost of more than $70,000. If one takes the increase, say, from 2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent, one would calculate a figure of about $350,000 a job. I simply draw attention to the impact of that. It gives us an overseas debt of about $30,000 per family of four. The annual interest on that, which has to be found somewhere, is something in excess of $3,000 as an impact on families. This provides the general context for what we are debating tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite that growth in employment we have a rate of unemployment, which is the true measure of an effectively functioning labour market and of an overall economic policy, which has been stuck at around 7 per cent for most of the period. I draw attention to the fact that during the cyclical peak under the Fraser Government the unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent. High unemployment, the massive increase in Australia's overseas debt, an abysmal growth in productivity and lower standards of living for most Australians heavily qualify these claims that we have heard so much from the Government about the employment growth outcome. Because of the arrangement with the Whip, I desist at that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take up a few points made by my friend the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards). I noticed that a lot of his statistics made comparisons with the Fraser Government `at the cyclical peak'. It is interesting that he should choose that particular time to make a comparison because that, of course, was when the Fraser Government started to go bad. That was when Mr Fraser's Government, with the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) as Treasurer, decided to talk up the resources boom and let go of the controls on wages and screwed down the controls on interest rates. What was the result? The result was a massive increase in unemployment and many businesses went to the wall. As a result, Australia was driven into its worst recession since the Great Depression. I was interested to note that my friend the honourable member for Berowra did not make those comparisons over the full life of the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I also pass comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and his passing remark that the Hawke Government's achievement in creating 1.3 million jobs was `not such a real achievement'. This Government can be very proud of the fact that 1.3 million more Australians have jobs today than in 1983. That is more than one million households where there is now an extra wage going into the family, helping to pay for the essential costs of those living in that household. I do not think that the honourable member for Bradfield can dismiss that as `not a real achievement'. It is an achievement of which those of us on this side of the House can be rightfully proud. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield also raised the matter of the level of taxation in Australia. For many years he has argued that we are paying too much in tax. I simply point out to him some statistics drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)-the organisation that prepares an analysis on most of the advanced Western democracies. Australia's total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product is 31.4 per cent. I point out that Australia is the nineteenth lowest on a list of 23 countries in the OECD. So we are certainly nowhere near the top of the list of countries in terms of total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week was the tenth anniversary of the pin-up girl of the Opposition-Maggie Thatcher, the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Since Maggie Thatcher has done such a great job in Great Britain, one would think that Britain would be lower than Australia on this table of total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The bad news for the honourable member for Berowra is that the Government of his pin-up girl receives a total tax revenue of 39 per cent of gross domestic product. Maggie Thatcher has 39 per cent and this Government has 31.4 per cent; yet the Opposition says we have cut taxes further, cut welfare further, cut expenditure on roads, hospitals and all the other essential areas--</PARA>

As a member of the Prime Minister's Task Force on Retirement Incomes, I had the great privilege in December, January and February of this year of attending a large number of meetings around Australia to hear the concerns and worries of a large number of pensioners and retirees. One of the issues that came up at every meeting was the fact that pensioners were upset about the delay between when the inflation figures are announced and when their pensions are increased. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that this has been an issue for pensioners for many years. I am proud that in the April statement the Government announced that the date for indexation will be brought forward not six weeks but 12 weeks so that pensioners can look forward to receiving compensation for the cost of living increases earlier. At this stage I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard three tables which will help me in my contribution tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The first table lists the dates on which the cost of living increases will flow through. Honourable members will note that the increase that was due in mid-December this year will now flow through on 15 November 1989; the increase that was due in mid-June next year will be brought forward two months; and from 20 September next year pensioners will receive their increases 12 weeks earlier. I commend the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) for a decision which certainly meets with the approval of pensioners in my electorate and I am sure throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second table lists the amount of money which pensioners can earn before they will be liable to pay income tax. This is an area which has caused great confusion because, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, a pensioner must calculate the pensioner tax rebate and the amount of pension he will receive throughout the year and take into account CPI increases before he can work out how much he can earn before he must pay income tax. Pensioners almost need a degree in economics to work out how much they can earn before they pay income tax. Last financial year single pensioners could earn only $4 a week before they paid income tax; this year it will be almost $10 a week; from 1 July this year it will be $25 a week; and from 1 July next year it will be $40 a week before they pay income tax. The great breakthrough in this historic Government decision is that it raises the amount that pensioners can earn in the tax free area which has been set for social security. So, from now on the same threshold for social security and income tax will apply to age pensioners. I believe that that will ease a lot of the worry and concern for those pensioners who find it very difficult to understand these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The third table contains an income test ready reckoner which allows people to calculate the pension they will receive at various income levels. For people in organisations such as Grey Power who say that everyone should be able to earn a pension and that at the moment the system works against the battlers, I point out that married pensioners will receive a part age pension up to a combined income level of over $500 a week. I know the vast majority of pensioners in my electorate believe that there should be an incomes test so that those who are better off do not receive the full age pension. I believe that the current incomes test figures are reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened to most of the contribution of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). As he recently visited my electorate, I was very interested to hear what he learnt about retirement, retirement incomes and the elderly in my electorate. He may have spent some time at the Toukley Senior Citizens Centre but he can not have learnt too much because in his entire contribution he did not once refer to any issue affecting age pensioners. In other words, the shadow Minister for social security and retirement income could not think of anything to put before the House today on the issue which is supposed to be in his area of expertise. I hope that in future contributions he can provide us with some fresher ideas as to what he thinks should be done for retired people. </PARA>
<PARA> I take advantage of having the Minister for Social Security at the table to raise with him one issue which has been brought to may attention by a number of age pensioners who served Australia during a time of war but did not serve overseas and therefore do not qualify for a service pension. Some of those people receive a disability pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs due to some injury they may have suffered during their war service in Australia. Whereas the Department of Veterans' Affairs disregards that disability pension for the service pension incomes test, the Department of Social Security deems it as assessable income. That is an anomaly which I hope the Minister will review. I hope that, as the Veterans' Affairs Department disregards disability pensions because they are compensation for an injury, the Department of Social Security will examine this matter as well. </PARA>
<PARA> People in receipt of service pensions and other payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs will benefit from the decision to provide speedier indexation for cost of living increases. They will benefit from the increase in the pensioner tax rebate, something which I know they will welcome. Further, in reply to a question last Thursday I was very pleased to hear the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) advise the House of the success of the campaign by Labor members on this side of the House and the Vietnam Veterans Association, particularly the Central Coast and Hunter Valley sub-branch, to have the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission overturn its terrible decision to impose a contribution fee on veterans seeking legal advice. I truly welcome that decision. It is a pity that the Greiner Government representative on the New South Wales Legal Aid Commission still sought to impose a contribution fee on those veterans and war widows who need legal advice on repatriation matters. I am disappointed that the Liberal and National Party members of this House did not see fit to put a bit more pressure on John Dowd, the New South Wales Attorney-General, to have a combined approach from both sides of politics on this important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am dealing with issues affecting the Department of Veterans' Affairs, I will make one suggestion to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in respect of the widows of service pensioners. Prior to the death of a serviceman, he and his wife receive a service pension from Veterans' Affairs at the married rate. When the serviceman passes away, before the widow can receive the single rate she must transfer over to the Department of Social Security. This creates some difficulties. In a time of stress, a widow is forced to fill out a whole series of new forms in order to receive the widow's or age pension from the Department of Social Security. I believe that it makes a lot of sense to allow the widows of service pensioners to receive the single rate pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This would save forcing these widows to do a lot of paper work at a time of stress. I hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will take that into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I re-affirm my call for the payment of the extreme disability allowance (EDA) to be reviewed. I think that only a very small number of EDA payments are being awarded, certainly in New South Wales, probably because the guide to the disability of a veteran requires him to receive a score of six out of seven. I believe that it is very hard to get a score of six out of seven. Most veterans in my electorate who I believe should qualify for the extreme disability allowance score only four and a half or five out of seven. I believe that this matter needs to be examined so that we can make sure that those who should receive the extreme disability allowance have it awarded to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to touch on is the matter of payments to families, and low income families in particular. Once again, I commend the Minister for Social Security for the historic reforms he has implemented in the time that he has been responsible for that portfolio. Payments by way of family assistance and family allowance for young children are being increased to $33 per week for those who meet the incomes test, and to $43.10 for teenagers. That is certainly a great achievement, given the comparison that those families were receiving only $15.25 a week in 1983 when this Government was elected. Those payments to low income families with children have been pushed way above inflation. That is something which I believe will go a long way towards making sure that those families in need get the money to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield bemoaned the fact that those on high incomes are no longer receiving family allowances. He said that people in well-off families are still up for the same costs in providing for their children. I do not dispute that, but the Opposition always seems to forget that when dollars are provided to high income earners through the welfare system, there are fewer dollars available for those in real need. I find it very hard to argue that people in receipt of more than $50,000 a year really need those family allowance payments when that money can be better directed to those families who are having a real battle in making ends meet. I hope that all honourable members accept the justice of that. The Opposition now accepts the justice of the assets test, although it fought against it in 1984 when it whipped up a scare campaign. The Opposition has now accepted that we were right on the assets test. I just wish that it would extend this common-sense approach to a few more areas in this important area of social security. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take up the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), on his last point on the assets test. If he thinks that all is well with people who have been deprived of income under the assets test, he does not know very much about what has happened to people. I instance the case of a mother of a constituent of mine who owns a property outside the town of Beaudesert. Because of the value of that property, because of increasing land values and because of the formula used, she gets zilch. She is well into her eighties and has an inability to farm. Much of the property is let to agistment. She still does not get enough from that to have a reasonable income. Government members sit there with smug looks on their faces because the Opposition has accepted the assets test. We still maintain-and I think the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) would be aware of some of these cases-that there is injustice as a result of the assets test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have never subscribed to the view that millionaires should receive a pension, but it was rather strange when the figures finally for the income levels or property of people who were subjected to the assets test came out, that only about 12 millionaires lost their pensions. The rest were well below the millionaire class. I see that the Minister has a smile on his face. In those days, he cleverly used those dozen millionaires as political justification for what the Government had done. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, it never ceases to amaze me how Government members stand in this place and lord over us what they are doing for the poor. The realities are that under Labor we have had the creation of great numbers of additional poor. There is no disputing that fact. During the administration of the present Government the number of families that have slipped into the definition of poverty has risen dramatically. </PARA>

Today, 2.6 million households-one in every eight-live in poverty. The Government tries to dismiss cold facts by saying `Rubbish!', but these are the realities. With regard to families, Government members stand here and say what the Government is doing by way of special family allowances, et cetera, but at the same time the Government has been pushing people into higher income tax rate levels. The Government rips it out of one pocket, then makes a Budget speech-we now have two Budget speeches every year-puts it back into the other pocket and says, `Aren't we marvellous?'. Yet the Government wonders why there is so much cynicism in the community towards this place. The people know full well when they have had money ripped out of one pocket and put into the other. Normally, it takes $5 out of one pocket, but puts back only $4 into the other pocket. The other dollar is kept by the Government for some other project it has dreamt up. The Minister should not get too excited. I came in here tonight determined to deliver a fairly passive speech about what the Government had actually done to the poor old pensioner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has been responsible for a portfolio for several years now. I can assure him that the day is dawning on him, too. The Minister is ageing fast, with all the worries of administration he has had to carry. In some ways, I have developed a sneaking regard for him. It is only a sneaking one because I have seen him do a lot of things that I believe have been unworthy, but in other respects I believe that he has brought a kind of zeal and dedication to his job and he is not to be underestimated. The warning to everybody is: do not underestimate Brian Howe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is no. We are on the edge of the 1990s, seven or eight years later, and we have a repackaging of that undertaking. The winds are blowing out there. Government members are getting a bit cold behind the ears. The Government has been told by some of its members, who are shaking with fear in the wintry winds, thinking about what is going to happen to them come the next election, that it had better start looking after the old people. When they go to the rallies they find the old people jeering and sneering at them. It is no longer nice to be a Labor man! They think the Government should do something about it. What does the Government do? It trots it out again and presents it in a new package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What else did it do in 1986? Instead of reducing the adjustment time to one month, it added another couple of months. Instead of waiting one month for their adjustment pensioners were made to wait six months. We saw another sleight of hand the other day. The Australian Statistician, in whom I have some interest, came out with a magic formula to give the country three consumer price index (CPI) figures-one, two and three. He says, `Take your pick'. What does Labor say? It says, `For the good of the nation, we will take the middle one, which is 1.6'. But what does it do for the pensioner-and this will flow through their pension in about the October quarter: it picks the lowest one, which is one per cent. The House tonight is debating legislation announced a couple of weeks ago for the purposes of rectifying all its wrongdoings of the past. Yet, just as people had their coins in their pocket, the Government diminished their CPI adjustment, reefing back a few million dollars in a most sneaky and contemptible way. The Government is into them all the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure, they are necessary because you have been ripping them out of people's pockets. People earning up to about $25,000 a year can qualify for these allowances. Yet the Government has pushed people who, when we were in office in 1983 were earning $14,000 a year, into the higher income tax bracket and they are now earning about $20,000. This is the way the Government goes about it. It tries to create a dependence on government. The Liberal philosophy is to give people back as much as the Government can, to let them manage their own affairs, not to push them into poverty, but to leave them with as much as possible. It does not come running along later and say, `We created poverty for you but now we are going to save you'. The Liberal philosophy is that if the people of the nation have an incentive to care for themselves our nation will be healthier and better off. The very figures of the growth in poverty in this country are an indictment of the Government's administration. I know the Minister is not responsible and that he does not necessarily have the ear of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), as he is there to try to clean up the mess. But I wish he would go into the Cabinet room and say, `Our social security outlays are blowing out and my staff requirements are blowing out because we have to bring in all these bandaid schemes to try to help people whom we have put into poverty in the first place'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude my comments with one final observation: whilst some of what the Government has done in this area is necessary and is indeed commendable in some respects, it cannot dismiss the fact that the number of households living in poverty during its administration has increased dramatically. It cannot dismiss the fact that the taxation levels in this country have been like a corkscrew and the Government has screwed people down so tightly that suddenly they have had to stand up and say, `Please help us'. Who do honourable members think comes along? It is the Minister. He says, `I am your friendly Labor Minister, I am here to help you. We have done this and this and this', and the people by this time have had their incentive destroyed and are so dependent on government that they are probably grateful for what the Government is giving them, but what it is doing in the long term is destroying the will of a nation. That is what the Government has done. It amazes me beyond belief that it managed to win the last election, because the general attitude in Australia is that three or four years of Labor Government is enough just to get the Liberals back on line. Let the Government wait for the next election, because Labor members will be sitting on this side of the chamber. Half of the Minister's friends will not have to worry about preselection in future years because the electorate will look after them come the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly about another Government disaster. The Government's pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) is in tatters. The proposed restructuring of the PBS arising from the April economic statement is symptomatic of the Government's general approach to health care. This appears to be an attempt to force health care professionals to carry the can for all the problems of Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over recent weeks, I and many of my colleagues have been besieged with letters from concerned pharmacists and Australian Medical Association members across the nation. Some of us are involved in coordinating public meetings to air the many grievances contained in letters. There have also been face to face discussions with Pharmacy Guild and Australian Medical Association members. Attitudes are best illustrated by the following extract from the Queensland branch president's circular of 2 May to Pharmacy Guild members. I quote part of that circular:</PARA>
<PARA>Pharmacists have had enough and will no longer put up with the PBS nonsense we have had from the Government over the last two years. Also . . . we will not accept any further cut in our PBS remuneration. Certainly we are not going to absorb-as the Government intends-the proposed $31 million cut in PBS funding in 1989-90 which will be on top of the 14% remuneration cut in real terms over the last 12 months as a result of Government fiddling with the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA> And remember this is just the first instalment. The Government has foreshadowed cuts over the next three years totalling $283 million-or nearly a third of the PBS. On average, Government and patient PBS payments are 36% of pharmacy income. How will your bottom line look after that portion of your income has been slashed arbitrarily by a third? A lot of us won't have a bottom line to look at. We will be out of business, gone, along with our investment, our livelihood, our future, and that of our families and employees-that is, if we don't fight now. </PARA>
<PARA> Except for the $31 million cut in the coming financial year (which the Government has told us is to be effected through reduced pharmacist remuneration), we don't know how the rest of $283 million will be carved off the PBS. This will be done in what the Government calls a `restructure' of the scheme. But we do know that the Government's PBS restructuring over the last two years-wholesale margin reduction, doubled prescription quantities, extended authority system and generic pricing-has been bad news for pharmacy . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government thinks it can wear the loss of pharmacy electoral support. It sees pharmacists as just a few thousand widely scattered votes that don't matter much. We have to show the Government that we can influence a lost of other votes as well . . . We also have to show that we can swing votes in marginal and critical seats that the Government cannot afford to lose in the coming election where we will be mounting a full-blown do-or-die campaign to unseat sitting members unless the Government changes its attitude towards the PBS and community pharmacy. </PARA>
<PARA>High quality health care can only be provided if there is access to the services of the whole health sector. Pharmacists are a critical element of the front line of such a service. As the Guilder said of the PBS:</PARA>
<PARA> The baby may need washing and changing but it is a model child not a monster. With proper care and consultation between those interested in its welfare it can be considerably improved. Together by all means let us throw out the bathwater but not the baby with it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government in general and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) would be well advised not to single out over 5,000 pharmacies across the country for special and, I might add, ill-founded attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Queensland State Parliament on 18 April this year, the National Party member for Burnett, Mr Slack, slurred and demeaned in a most destructive way the officers of the Bundaberg Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). In a speech riddled with errors and misinformation, he condemned the CES office for moving to an office in Woongarra Street. There is no CES office in Woongarra Street, Bundaberg; it is located on the corner of Quay and Barolin streets and has been since 1981. The reason the CES is located in an accessible position is to provide visibility so that the unemployed can have ready access to it. Many unemployed are not closet millionaires like the National Party member for Burnett. They are often times people with little in the way of income and transport. The difference between the CES office and the office of the member for Burnett is visibility. A person really has to go to some trouble to find his office and, judging by his speech in the Queensland Parliament, they would quickly realise they had wasted their time once they got there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The member said that staff go around to the schools and have not talked to children about getting a job. I have checked with CES staff to see whether this is correct. I am advised that CES office staff visit every high school in the Bundaberg District to promote the Youth Access Centre. This work is carried out in cooperation and with the support of school principals and guidance officers. It emphasises careers for youth, training outside of school time and includes employer panels where youth train to improve skills for job interviews. </PARA>
<PARA> The CES staff, as part of the program, bring students into the office to acquaint them fully with the services it provides. It is known in the community, but apparently not to the National Party, that people can register as unemployed at a CES but do not have to apply for unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech, the National Party member said that a store had had difficulty getting staff because of the tax file number. I suppose the National Party response is do away with the tax file number so all the tax rorters can get jobs and put their hands on the money paid in taxes by all honest wage and salary earners paying their fair share. A responsible member of parliament would have contacted the CES office on behalf of the store manager to see whether it had an applicant who wanted to work. There are no records of the National Party member having done so. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Party member pointed to the employment of pickers in the fruit and vegetable industry. He referred to the CES as the Commonwealth Unemployment Service. Last year, when difficulties occurred in the industry, the National Party had no solutions. Indeed, Mr Slack advised people to come and see me. A meeting was called at which CES officers responded magnificently with a series of positive proposals. Now the industry is working with the CES to overcome job shortages by an extensive advertising program into which growers are putting money as support. The National Party member was obviously not aware of this because he did not attend. One would have thought that someone making such a detailed attack on the CES officers would have been familiar with their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the National Party member for Burnett never once visited the CES office. His outrageous attack on the officers was conceived in ignorance, born in ignorance and played out in ignorance. He would have served his community far better by at least visiting the office and seeing how it could help some of his constituents who are in distress. As the local Federal member, I welcome anyone working constructively with the officers to provide a better service for the people we are elected to serve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My speech tonight centres on a youth detention centre which is proposed to be built at Gilles Plains in the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide. I ask: Has the recent ministerial reshuffle of the Bannon Government in an election year taken the Blacks Road detention centre off the Cabinet board or have the concerned residents of north-east Adelaide caused the Government to hear their voice? I would say a lot of each. The residents of Hillcrest and Gilles Plains are right in their rejection of the required location of the proposed maximum youth detention centre. To that end over 3,000 petitions were gathered by the spokesman for that organisation, Mr Terry Fitzgerald, a concerned resident, because this building was to be constructed in Sudholz Road, opposite St Paul's College.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Its name, a maximum detention youth centre, indicates that it is not a recluse for the State's young offenders, is not a haven for graffitists or even skateboard riders, but a place for second time and third time offenders who are guilty of serious and violent crimes. That means robberies with violence, murders, rape and drug addicted related crimes, even among the under-18s. Within the confines of the Yatala prison complex is an area of 80 hectares, or 220 acres, where this 10-acre maximum security detention centre can be incorporated. A report of comments of the previous Minister, Susan Lenehan, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . she was disappointed with the public outcry and once residents had looked at plans they would be `less concerned'. </PARA>
<PARA> `It is marvellous to hear people talk compassionately about street kids'-</PARA>
<PARA>slurring the work done by the Lord Mayor and his `I say no to drugs' appeal-</PARA>
<PARA>`and the need for supported medium-term accommodation, she said. </PARA>
<PARA> She said the Government proposed a centre which would be rehabilitate young offenders, many of whom had been street kids. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of us have probably been street kids in our time but Enfield, which contains over 70 per cent of all of the institutions in South Australia including Yatala labour prison, has become something of a generic code name because once a person lives within the shadows of Yatala one finds that it seems to have a special brand about it. The residents are saying, `Put it at Kalara in Blackwood or put it up at Valley View and there would be a complete outcry', and I can understand that as well. Tough luck if these hardened youthful crims can see and hear either Yatala or the women's prison, and tough luck if the next step is there. Suddenly this social justice program which has been implemented suggests that an $8m maximum security detention centre can be just foisted upon residents who have invested money in real estate and have developed their homes and properties. I refer, too, to the excellent work completed and that being carried out by the principals and students of St Paul's College. </PARA>
<PARA> How dare the wimpish Government, the Department of Community Welfare or any other authorities try to impinge another institution upon the residents, the ratepayers and the decent citizens of Gilles Plains. For 40 years this north-east community has suffered the psychological stigma of living within the shadows of Yatala. The infrastructure is there to support this detention centre not near residents, not near schools and certainly not near Valley View or the Kalara Nursing Home at Blackwood. For too long there has been a soft attitude to criminal offenders and their lenient prison terms. Honest and decent South Australians do not deserve this treatment and will certainly voice their disapproval at this coming Wednesday night's public meeting, which is to be held at St Paul's College at Blacks Road, Gilles Plains. I will be attending it and I certainly urge residents of that north-east area to voice their opinion and concerns once again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Bulletin article of 9 May under the heading `Our date with disaster' the following introduction was written by Ben Sandilands:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The passage of 1989 FC should have taken our minds off such trivial pursuits as politics, pleasures and profits, because it could have sent millions to instant oblivion. But no one realised how close disaster had come until 16 days after the 500-metre-wide rock, doing 15 kms a second, had missed by the cosmically infinitesimal margin of 653,000 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA>The article referred to asteroids and pointed out that there are many large and dark asteroids out there somewhere, that they are travelling at speeds of up to 30 kilometres a second, and that should an asteroid the size of the one mentioned hit the earth there would be massive physical and thermal shock waves produced, high velocity ocean waves perhaps hundreds of metres high and enough debris lofted into the atmosphere to interfere with radiation and weather patterns and, indeed, to make the greenhouse effect an instant reality. So it is very important for us to embrace science and technology. I believe that in many ways within this Parliament this issue does not seem to receive the credibility it should. Collisions between the earth and Apollo asteroids are inevitable. It would seem that it could be a few weeks or even millions of years before a very significant collission occurs. There is the possbility of using technology at the moment which, given sufficient warning time, could change the course of such an asteroid. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this matter only to introduce the topic of science and technology which was the subject of statements today by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I believe that the statements were crucial to Australia. What really annoyed me was the unctuous humbug which followed the statement. I refer in particular to what was said by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) who for many years sat in this place without making reference to this issue. I cannot remember hearing a great number of speeches by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is salutary for us to look back over the time we have been in this place. I looked back at my maiden speech and found reference to retention rates, that at that time in 1983 only 35 per cent of our secondary students were completing secondary school education to year 12. The figure is now nearly 60 per cent. Important mention was made of science and technology. Much has changed since 1983. My first question in the House in March or April 1983 was about acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The then Minister for Health got up and said that we had one case of AIDS in Australia. Now we have some thousands of cases and a massive problem. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at what happens in this place and the sort of debate that goes on in the area of science and technology, it now seems very `Gucci' to talk about the greenhouse effect, pollution, the Antarctic and acid rain. Last week I asked a question of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business about the possible breakthrough in physics of cold fusion. Such a breakthrough would have been potentially of immense consequence. I was annoyed at the way in which the Opposition sat around talking, deliberately ignoring the response of the Minister. Indeed, its attitude to this very important subject was one of indifference. A member of my electorate who was listening on the radio commented on the level of background noise during that very important answer. I had to say to her that it was a reflection of the way in which the Opposition treated this matter. I am concerned that its response to today's very important statement about science and technology was very disappointing. It will only be through a sincere interest in science and technology and scientific development that the Opposition will be able to acquire a policy change and a philosophy which will bring about a real improvement in this area. I hope that we will then be able to believe members of the Opposition when they speak on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA>COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT 1986 DIRECTIONS IN RESPECT OF DISCRETIONARY GRANTS</PARA>
<PARA>I, JOHN NORMAN BUTTON, Minister of State for Industry, Technology and Commerce, pursuant to section 20 of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986, HEREBY DIRECT that, in relation to a project in respect of research and development activities the subject of an application for a discretionary grant under Division I of Part III of the Act, the Industry Research and Development Board shall:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. consider such application only where the Board is satisfied that:</PARA>
<PARA>the applicant company, or the company which controls the applicant company, has and will continue to have for the duration of the project, insufficient taxation liability to enable it to obtain adequate benefit under section 73B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to undertake the project;</PARA>
<PARA>the project is directed to the development of internationally competitive and internationally traded goods, systems or services; and</PARA>
<PARA>the project would not proceed satisfactorily without a discretionary grant;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. in assessing the merits of such project, have regard to the Commonwealth Government's industry development policy objectives, including its specific wish to assist shall start-up companies wanting to enter the international market place and companies involved in industry restructuring, and the following economic, technical and commercial considerations;</PARA>
<PARA> 2.1 Economic considerations:</PARA>
<PARA>the pervasiveness of the technology relevant to the project, including the likely benefits to accrue to other businesses and industries;</PARA>

<PARA>the magnitude of the potential impact of the project and the resultant product, process or system on industry's ability to compete effectively in international markets;</PARA>
<PARA> 2.2 Technical considerations:</PARA>
<PARA>the novelty of the project;</PARA>
<PARA>the level and quality of the research and development of the project; and</PARA>
<PARA>the competence of the research and development team and the extent to which `in house' skills will be augmented by technology transfer and/or the use of expertise obtained under contract in the project;</PARA>
<PARA> 2.3 Commercial consideration:</PARA>
<PARA>the cost of the innovation involved in the project in relation to the size of the prospective commercial return from Australian and overseas markets;</PARA>
<PARA>the extent to which commercial opportunities arising from the project may be circumscribed by restrictive agreements or corporate policy;</PARA>
<PARA>the commercial viability of the project;</PARA>
<PARA>the time frame for commercialisation of the project; and</PARA>
<PARA>the ability of the management team to achieve the full commercial benefits of the results of the project;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. require the applicant to provide a plan which satisfies the Board that the applicant has the potential to carry out the project and see its development through to commercial reality; and</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) A grant of $20,000 was provided to the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations in 1986/87 for a Condom Information Program. AFAO asked State AIDS Councils to review current programs and consider modifications or extensions of material relevant to their local areas. The project was designed to produce widespread and sustained behavioural change to reduce the transmission of AIDS among high risk groups in all states. The brochure referred to was funded by AFAO with $4,900 to the AIDS Council of New South Wales as part of this program. Material of this kind was considered by AIDS Councils education officers to be an effective means of communicating messages to self-identified gay men, particularly those who live in inner city Melbourne and Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian National Council on AIDS and before it the National Advisory Committee on AIDS have consistently recognised the need for explicit educational material specifically targetted to at risk groups showing safer sex practice.</PARA>
<PARA> Community consultation, as part of the AIDS White Paper process, has attracted many submissions from the public and from staff in AIDS agencies, requesting simple, graphic explanations of proper condom use. Instructions currently printed on condom packets and in much educational material have been criticised for being too complex, for requiring too high a level of literacy, and for having unattractive graphics.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the targeting of the pamphlet solely to groups at highest risk of infection, and with distribution confined in accordance with the Chief Censor's determination to self-identified homosexual and bisexual men in venues provided for them, the pamphlet is an example of tightly targetted, effective, explicit educational material of the type being called for by various advisers and commentators.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (c) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> Other less explicit material was also produced as part of AFAO's condom information program, including materials for deaf people, leaflets utilising text and medical drawings, leaflets using text only, and reviews of scientific and medical literature on safer sexual practices.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) This publication was cleared by the Chief Censor and is restricted to homosexual and bisexual men who specifically request the pamphlet.</PARA>
<PARA> I am assured that this requirement has been met in that the pamphlet has been distributed through homosexual bars and venues in Sydney and, to a limited extent, through AIDS Councils in some other States.</PARA>
<PARA> I have not considered any proposal to alter censorship laws in relation to this pamphlet.</PARA>
<PARA> The following recommendation is, however, part of the report of the Discrimination and Other Legal Issues Working Panel in the White Paper process on the issue of censorship: ``That censorship laws and broadcasting standards be reviewed with a view to removing any unreasonable impediments to education and prevention programs, and to ensure the promotion of such programs in a non-discriminatory manner. The publication of safer sex educational material should be exempted from obscenity offences under State, Territory and Commonwealth legislation and broadcasting standards, with specific classification of such material being an appropriate measure''.</PARA>
<PARA> That recommendation is being considered in the context of developing the White Paper on AIDS.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) State and Commonwealth veterinary and medical diagnostic and research laboratories; and various commercial vaccine production and other laboratories. (b) Australian Animal Health Laboratory.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The following list itemises the exotic pathogens held at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and their dates of acquisition by the laboratory:</PARA>
<PARA> May/June 1985-Avian influenza virus, H7N7 Vic 1976, H7N7 Vic 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> Early 1986-Aujeszky's disease virus, Mycoplasma mycoides, Mycoplasma F38 strain, Newcastle disease virus, Albiston-Gorrie, Eaves-Grimes Swine fever virus (3 strains), Rabies virus.</PARA>
<PARA> August 1986-Bluetongue virus (attenuated vaccine strains), Serotypes 1 to 14</PARA>
<PARA> May 1987-Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, Vesicular exanthema of swine and San Miguel sealion viruses, Swine vesicular disease virus</PARA>
<PARA> May 1987-Brucella abortus, Br canis, Br Melitensis, Br suis</PARA>
<PARA> June 1988-Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia of fish virus, Infectious haemopoietic necrosisi virus, Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus</PARA>
<PARA> February 1989-Equine arteritis virus (attenuated strain)</PARA>
<PARA> These exotic pathogens were either transferred to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory from less secure laboratories in Australia with the authorisation of Australian Agricultural Council, or were imported with the Authorisation of the Commonwealth director of Animal and Plant Quarantine after the consultation projects described in (5).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) African horsesickness virus, serotypes 1-9. Bluetongue viruses-27 strains. Cache Valley virus. Epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer virus-4 strains. African swine fever virus (attenuated). Maedi-visna virus-3 strains. Malignant cattarhal fever (African isolates-virulent and attenuated). Rabies related virus-5 strains. Rift Valley fever virus-attenuated strain. Rinderpest virus-attenuated strain. Vesicular stomatitis virus-8 strains.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The safeness of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory to handle the proposed exotic pathogen is first investigated by the independent AAHL Security Assessment Group. Widespread consultations are then held with appropriate livestock industry organisations, the scientific community and other bodies such as the Australian Veterinary Association. Endorsement for the proposed importation is also sought from the Australian Agricultural Council. Based on the results of such consultations, the final decision on importation is made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA> An independent scientific review of AAHL's requirements for exotic pathogens was also undertaken in 1988. This review recommended that the exotic pathogens listed in (4) be imported.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed on 4 November 1988 which created the Canada-Australia Consortium for Ocean Drilling, the Australian membership contribution for the ODP was to be paid ``on or about 1= April 1989''. No documents relating to this payment were lost by my Department. Necessary steps to pay the Australian membership contribution were taken just prior to 1 April and the actual payment of funds overseas has now occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> (3)No. The level of remaining funds available for the ODP secretariat is determined by the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment.

<PARA> (1) The Australian Government arranges periodic federal-State consultations concerning International Labour Organisation Conventions which are considered appropriate for action in part or in whole by the States.

<PARA> (2) Australia is obliged, under the ILO Constitution, to report on both ratified and unratified Conventions. The reporting methods are somewhat different between the two types of Convention.</PARA>
<PARA> As to unratified Conventions, Australia is obliged, under Article 19.7 of the ILO Constitution, to:</PARA>
<PARA>``inform the Director-General of the International Labour Office of the measures taken in accordance with this article to bring such Conventions and Recommendations before the appropriate federal, state, provincial or cantonal authorities with particulars of the authorities regarded as appropriate and of the action taken by them'' [paragraph 19.7 (b) (iii)]</PARA>
<PARA>``in respect of each such Convention which it has not ratified, report to the Director-General of the International Labour Office, at appropriate intervals as requested by the Governing Body, the position of the law and practice of the federation and its constituent states . . . in regard to the Convention showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Convention by legislation, administrative action, collective agreement, or otherwise'' [paragraph 19.7 (b) (iv)]</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been a member of the ILO since 1919 and it would not be practical to provide a complete list of reports submitted to the International Labour Office under Article 19 of the Constitution. However, the Australian Government regularly tables in the Commonwealth Parliament, the texts of new Conventions and Recommendations together with a statement on the extent of compliance. Copies of these statements are forwarded to the International Labour Office. This process is also required by Article 19.7 of the ILO Constitution.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2194" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="RICHMOND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United Trades and Labor Council of South Australia has placed bans as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) on the removal of the Hallet to Peterborough line section</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) on the removal of the Riverton to Spalding line section</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) on the removal of any infrastructure on the Belair to Bridgewater line.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The following stations are affected:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Hallett-Peterborough: Terowie</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Riverton-Spalding: Seven Hills, Watervale, Auburn, Clare, Barinia, Hilltown, Andrews and Spalding</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Bridgewater-Belair: National Park, Long Gully, Upper Sturt, Mt Lofty, Heathfield, Madurta, Aldgate, Jibilla, Carripook and Bridgewater.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Bans have been imposed for the following reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Hallett-Peterborough: Rail Unions assert that this line should be standardised to provide a second standard gauge link between Adelaide and the Sydney-Perth railway line in addition to the route via Crystal Brook.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Riverton-Spalding: The ban was imposed in response to the closure of this section of line which the Union opposed.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Bridgewater-Belair: AN has advised that this ban is part of a dispute between the South Australian State Government, the State Transport Authority and Adelaide Hills residents over cessation of metropolitan passenger services on this line. These services had been provided by the State Transport Authority of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Australian National (AN) is enabled under the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 to operate commercially and independently of ministerial intervention on operational matters. Unions bans are therefore a matter for AN.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) None of the bans on removal of stations have any effect on the management of rail services in South Australia. In the long term on the Bridgewater-Belair line there may be a need to re-align and rationalise tracks and remove some platforms to improve track speeds and reduce maintenance costs. The bans on removal of rails and ballast however, do affect AN as they preclude the utilization of these materials elsewhere on the system.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) At present there are no definitive direct costs arising from the bans on removal of stations.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) See the answer to (c) above.</PARA>
