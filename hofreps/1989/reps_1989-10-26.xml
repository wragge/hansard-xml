<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House, that pharmacists, in Australia, have had their very livelihood placed in jeopardy, by the totally unreasonable decisions, of the so called ``independent'' Pharmaceutical Benefits Tribunal, in drastically reducing the remuneration paid to pharmacists for dispensing of prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these decisions, the essential primary health care functions and services provided (largely free) by pharmacists to the public, have been seriously put at risk.</PARA>
<PARA> The replacement of such services could only be fulfilled by an already overtaxed medical profession and at a financial cost that would be virtually impossible to be funded by the Government or the Community.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to, as a matter of extreme urgency, negotiate with the appointed representatives of Australian pharmacists, to ensure that an equitable financial remuneration is granted to these pharmacists for dispensing prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and so protect the essential services now provided by these pharmacists to the Community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present a summary of the report of the Committee on Drugs, Crime and Society entitled Rethinking Drug Policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In May this year the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority presented to the Parliament a report entitled Drugs, Crime and Society. That report dealt with the trade in illegal drugs in Australia and the strategies used by law enforcement agencies to combat that trade. It outlined the social costs of the present policy of prohibition and examined alternative ways to reduce the harm caused by the abuse of the illegal drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that there was ample evidence that the policy of prohibition was failing to achieve its objective. It was failing to prevent supplies of the illegal drugs from reaching those in Australia who wished to use them. The illegal drugs were available throughout Australia for anyone who wanted them. Prohibition simply made the price of the drugs higher than it would otherwise have been. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that for many years governments had attempted to use the criminal law as a means of reducing supply to the marketplace. The report clearly demonstrated that such an approach had limitations. To the extent that its stated aim was to prevent illicit drugs from reaching the marketplace it had demonstrably failed. The Committee argued that if the present policy was not working, then it was time to give serious consideration to alternative policies, however radical they might seem. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the present policy or prohibition gave the appearance of tough controls on the illegal drugs, in reality there was an absence of government control over the chemistry of the drugs being sold, the outlets where the drugs were sold and the persons to whom the drugs might be sold. This would not have mattered if the policy had been succeeding in its original aim: if, in other words, none of the illegal drugs were being sold or if there were even a realistic possibility of the trade being brought to a halt. This was not the case and the Committee argued that it was time to consider alternatives to the present policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that the Federal and State governments and the community at large should give earnest consideration to the options by which governments might impose more controls on the sale and marketing of the presently illegal drugs. The Committee expressed the hope that its report would be a vehicle for public education. However it recognised that its call for a debate within the community on drug policy would be mere empty rhetoric if it did not take some more steps to facilitate that debate itself. </PARA>
<PARA> To that end it has had prepared this summary of its report under the title Rethinking Drug Policy which I present for the information of honourable members today. Besides presenting it in the Federal Parliament, the Committee intends to send copies of the summary to members of the State and Territory parliaments. It also intends to send a copy to each secondary school in Australia and to persons running relevant courses at tertiary institutions. The summary has been prepared in a format which will enable it to be copied for study purposes and the Committee hopes that this will occur. The Committee also hopes, of course, that by disseminating the summary it will stimulate further interest in its report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognised in its report that before any change was made to the present policy of prohibition there was a need for the Australian community to gain a better understanding of the properties of the prohibited drugs and of the costs imposed by the present policy. Hopefully, the information contained in this summary and in the Committee's report will assist in this process. The summary attempts to set out some of the facts about drug use. It examines the strategies adopted by law enforcement agencies in attacking the illegal drug trade and explains why the Committee believes that those agencies cannot stop the trade. The summary outlines the social costs of the present policy of prohibition including the cost of drug related crime and the threat that the acquired immune deficiency syndrome may spread through the intravenous drug using population. Finally, the summary attempts to provide a concise account of some of the alternatives to the present policy of prohibition. </PARA>
<PARA> Although most countries are signatories to international conventions which require them to prohibit the trade in cannabis, cocaine, heroin and the amphetamines, except for medical or scientific purposes, there are significant variations in their approaches. With accurate information it is therefore possible to make sensible comparisons between different policies based on the experience of those countries which have tried them. Unfortunately such information is not always readily available. The Committee's summary will assist in making some of this information more widely available and its report provides more detail and appropriate references. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, for example, a number of countries impose the death penalty for trafficking offences but it is quite clear that this policy has proved ineffective in stamping out the drug trade in those countries. Thailand is a classic example. There is an enormous increase in drug use in that country, as there is in Malaysia, so it is clearly demonstrable that capital punishment does not relate to any prevention of drug use. The Netherlands permits the sale of limited quantities of cannabis in cafes and youth centres while retaining heavy penalties for trafficking. Cannabis use in that country is low and is diminishing. </PARA>
<PARA> Up until 1968 the United Kingdom allowed doctors to make available heroin and cocaine to addicts on prescription. The system broke down once addicts began to seek drugs for recreational use. Addicts were receiving massive doses for their own use and were reselling part of what they received, thus feeding a growing black market. The British Government therefore acted in 1968 to restrict the power of doctors to prescribe. Rather than providing addicts with maintenance doses of heroin the British clinics now generally only provide methadone, as in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of methadone is seen as one form of treatment to assist addicts to stop using heroin. It is no longer considered possible to undercut the black market for heroin by competitive prescribing. A policy of prohibition has applied to heroin, cocaine and cannabis in Australia since the 1920s. For over forty years it must have seemed that this policy was a resounding success. </PARA>
<PARA> The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, signed in 1961 and ratified by Australia in 1967, was meant to set the seal on this success. Instead, it ushered in an era in which the consumption of the prohibited drugs has increased beyond the most alarmist predictions. The Committee's point is simple. If the policy is so obviously failing, it is time to consider alternatives. There is no easy solution, but the Committee hopes that by bringing down its report and providing this summary it will enable a more informed debate on drug policy to take place in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There are difficulties in the debate. As Chairman of the Committee, I find that when I talk to the media, they want me to say that I support the legalisation of drugs. It is hoped that the media will start to take a more responsible attitude in the debate. One does not need to legalise drugs to find alternative means of tackling the problem. One can look at a variety of approaches, not just a total prohibition pathway. The pathway stretches from legalisation to total prohibition, with all sorts of areas in between. The debate, therefore, needs to be more accurately put by the media. It needs to be put without the use of words such as `instant highs from drug use' which, frankly, encourage young people to use drugs. The community must take a realistic view that it is no use putting people in gaol simply because they use a drug. I am a nicotine addict but I am not sent to gaol. Why then should I be sent to gaol if I were a cocaine addict? Those areas need to be openly addressed and discussed and we need to rethink our approach to the whole rotten trade. Organised crime is the only thing we have gained from the present policy. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian and New Zealand parliamentarians have participated in annual official delegations-exchanges of visits-during the past 10 years, under the so-called Fraser-Tallboys Agreement. The purpose of the delegations was general fact-finding, aimed at increasing the general knowledge of parliamentarians each side of the Tasman about a near neighbour. Last year the then New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr David Lange, held discussions with the Presiding Officers in Australia on the possibility of joint meetings between Australian and New Zealand parliamentary committees. As a result of those discussions it was decided to institute joint meetings in place of the regular exchanges of delegations, for a two-year experimental period. It was also decided that the first meetings under the new system were to be between the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-the Committee that I have the honour of chairing-and its sister committee in New Zealand, the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The visit which is the subject of the report that has just been tabled was to Canberra in August 1989. It was an exchange for one made by members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to New Zealand in April of this year. It thus completed the first round of visits under the two-year experiment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, the central activity under the experimental system was to be joint meetings between parliamentary committees of the New Zealand and Australian parliaments which share similar interests, responsibilities and subject matters. It was fortunate therefore that the first series of visits was between committees which, as the visit itself shows, have so many common preoccupations. We had some very lively discussions with our New Zealand colleagues which ranged across issues which are very relevant to this Parliament, to this Government and to the two committees, and which are very topical. There were issues such as the South Pacific, defence-this has been the subject of much recent discussion between Australia and New Zealand-immigration and the environment. For example, two of the recommendations which are included in the report that has just been tabled address two matters which are very important to those of us who live in this part of the world, namely, the protection of Antarctica. While New Zealand and Australia have slightly different views on the means to attain that protection, our objectives are certainly very much in accord. Another vital question, the protection of the Pacific from the depradation of drift net fishing, was discussed. Again, it is something on which we share very common views. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of our meeting, the two committees involved in the first series of joint meetings agreed that the new system is a great improvement on the exchange of what might be called general delegations. It is possible that the subject matter which concerns the two committees had a great part to play in the success of the two visits. Of course, that will be a feature of future visits, given that they will also be dealing with common subject matters. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that joint meetings with its New Zealand counterpart be held on a regular basis. If this were to happen it would probably need to be in addition to the current two-year experiment of replacing general parliamentary delegations with committee exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go too much into the substance of the issues that we discussed during our meetings because I know that colleagues in this Parliament, including the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) who is to speak next, will address those substantial issues. The discussions were valuable. They helped us see the perspective of our new New Zealand counterparts and they to see ours. In that spirit I commend to the House the report and the idea of joint meetings between Australian and New Zealand parliamentary committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse unreservedly the comments made by the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney) and the stirling leadership he displayed during the recent visit of our parliamentary colleagues from New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand share a very special relationship. The Anzac tradition and heritage, originally forged on the beaches of Gallipoli, has developed and strengthened over many years. It has been reinforced by and through the close historical, cultural, social and economic ties that bind our two nations together. But even things as seemingly immutable as the friendship engendered by the spirit of Anzac can be threatened by changed and changing circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The relationship between Australia and New Zealand has been severely tested on several occasions over the past few years. Paradoxically, in many instances, it is the same issue which once brought us closer together that are now causing problems, dissension and even divisions between us. Over a whole range of significant issues, the policies and attitudes of our governments differ, often quite markedly. Despite the several quite serious setbacks and challenges there is still a desire and determination on and from both sides of the Tasman to maintain and sustain the goodwill and understanding which has been the basis of the unique and harmonious relationship Australians and New Zealanders have always enjoyed. An indication of this determination and desire, and a practical way of developing and reinforcing the special bonds between our two countries, is the current program of meetings and discussions between members of the New Zealand parliamentary Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and our Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The report tabled this morning details the outcome of the latest visit in this new parliamentary committee exchange program. During this visit the opportunity was taken to discuss a range of issues of mutual interest concentrating on matters generally relating to areas of foreign affairs, defence and trade. As is noted in the report, the discussions were frank and forthright. Despite a wide divergence of views, there were always many areas of broad agreement. At the time of this visit the long awaited decision regarding possible participation by New Zealand in the Anzac frigate project was uppermost in the minds of delegates of both countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We now know, of course, the outcome of the deliberations in regard to the frigate project. It is indeed encouraging to note that the New Zealand Government has agreed to purchase two of these vessels on very favourable terms to New Zealand, with an option for two more later. Contrary to the misgivings expressed by some New Zealand members at the August meeting and the previous April meeting, the Anzac frigate project is not something which will benefit only Australia. There are obvious and substantial benefits to be derived by both countries from this joint and very important venture. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the frigate issue is now satisfactorily resolved, the matter of the ANZUS alliance continues to cause me some concern. From Australia's point of view, this alliance with the United States of America is fundamental to our security and defence interests and to those of the Western alliance generally. The decision of the Lange Labour Government in New Zealand to close New Zealand's ports to nuclear capable and nuclear powered United States and allied warships and the consequent suspension of the tripartite operation of the ANZUS alliance has seriously undermined our security interests and diminished regional stability. We must continue to work towards the restoration of New Zealand's full support for and involvement in ANZUS. The same applies to the need for the New Zealand Government to recognise and fulfil its obligations and responsibilities in regard to the overall strategy for the defence of the South Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> Environmental matters were amongst other significant issues canvassed during this visit. Much of the discussion centred on Antarctica and the conservation of marine resources. The report notes that, whilst it was generally agreed that both countries sought a similar future for Antarctica, there was some disagreement regarding how these objectives and outcomes might be achieved. It is obvious that there is still much work to be done in regard to securing the future of this last great wilderness area. Both the Australian and New Zealand governments should continue to work towards implementing appropriate action which would result in the long term protection of the Antarctic continent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who share the increasing concern in regard to the conservation of marine resources will be heartened to read in the report that both committees acknowledged the need for greater cooperation in tackling current problems confronting the fishing industry on which so many countries within the South Pacific region depend. Broad agreement was reached in regard to adopting a joint approach on drift netting-an unacceptable practice which poses enormous threats to very valuable marine resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussion also took place on various issues relating to the provision of overseas aid. Both committees agreed that there needed to be a rationalisation of aid to the South Pacific and acknowledged the necessity for a combined and cooperative approach to this matter. It was also agreed that there should be an increase in consultations and exchange of information between our two countries in regard to aid programs generally, resulting in a more coordinated, efficient and effective overall approach. </PARA>
<PARA> In the conclusion to this report, I would particularly draw attention to the suggestions for improving future visits, especially in regard to the more efficient use of available time. All too often valuable time is wasted on what could be described as pomp and ceremony that is largely unnecessary and unproductive. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding my remarks this morning, I take the opportunity of pointing out that in the introduction to this report two references are made to the current pilots dispute. Unfortunately the dispute is quite inaccurately and incorrectly referred to in the report as a `pilots strike'. As the vast majority of domestic pilots resigned on 24 August 1989-four days before the visit commenced-they could not possibly have been on strike at the time of the visit. Although this may be considered a minor point, I believe it is an important one, and that the inaccuracy should be noted. </PARA>
<PARA> This program of exchange visits has provided an excellent opportunity to strengthen the ties between Australia and New Zealand. Although we already share a very special relationship, we need to keep working at it, otherwise cracks may appear that are difficult to mend. There is no doubt that closer consultations and collaboration between our two countries in addressing problems of mutual interest and concern will be beneficial in both the immediate future and the longer term. I therefore commend to this House the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that this exchange program has proven to be a worthwhile initiative, and should be continued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) on his excellent speech on the report on the visit by the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives. It was a speech which I would commend to those who are interested in the relationship between Australia and New Zealand. Historically, there has been a close relationship between the people of Australia and the people of New Zealand. There has also been a close relationship between the parliaments of Australia and New Zealand, so the presentation of this report by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), provides an occasion on which to make some observations from an Australian perspective on the present relationship between our two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most Australians think of New Zealand in the context of the ANZUS alliance, cricket, rugby union and family connections. They think of a country rich in natural beauty and popular tourist attractions. There are some other things besides that which I am sure that the Chairman of the Joint Committee would have added had he had another chance to speak. New Zealand is also a unique enclave of Anglo-Saxons in the South West Pacific. It is interesting to examine the population mix of New Zealand. Of a total population of nearly 3.4 million the vast majority are of Anglo-Saxon origin. About 300,000 residents of New Zealand were born in the United Kingdom, 62,000 were born in Australia, 22,000 in the Netherlands, 8,500 in the United States of America and 6,000 in Ireland. Few immigrants have come from southern and eastern Europe. Of the population of New Zealand, 12.5 per cent, or 400,000, are Maoris. There are approximately 61,000 people from the Pacific islands. It is a vastly different population mix from that of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealanders have a history of being brave and resourceful people. In World War I, 100,000 New Zealand soldiers served overseas and 16,000 of them lost their lives. In World War II, 57 per cent of men aged between 18 and 45 years served in the defence forces. Of these, 10,000 lost their lives. New Zealand was a defence ally under the ANZUS Treaty. New Zealand is a partner of Australia under the closer economic relations agreement. Under this agreement all trade between the two countries will gradually become free from restrictions. The work done by the previous Government and the current Government has gone a long way to improving trade between our two countries. This has resulted in bilateral trade between Australia and New Zealand increasing from $1.8 billion in 1982-83 to $3.2 billion in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in the area of defence policy that the respective views of our two countries differ sharply. For decades the defence and foreign affairs policy of Australia and New Zealand has been underpinned by the ANZUS alliance. New Zealand is no longer a member of the ANZUS alliance. Australia is now the only country in the Southern Hemisphere which has a defence treaty with the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the United States to formally suspend its military obligations to New Zealand under the ANZUS Treaty was a consequence of the decision by the New Zealand Government to prohibit visits by nuclear ships from the United States. This decision by the New Zealand Government was wrong and, in my view, was a betrayal of New Zealand's responsibilities as a responsible and gallant member of the Western alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a nonsense for New Zealand to claim that it shares with Australia similar strategic concerns. This is not to deny that New Zealand has a legitimate right as an independent sovereign nation to pursue an independent foreign and defence policy. We respect that right but we fundamentally disagree with the New Zealand decision. Indeed, this was spelled out very clearly in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 24 November 1987 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia adheres firmly to our policy on welcoming ship visits by our United States ally. We accept the need for strategic deterrence. Australia will not resile from its firm support for the Western Alliance, with the corollary that the global nuclear balance can be maintained only through a credible United States nuclear deterrent. We believe that, although a nuclear balance of power is not an ideal state of affairs, it does exist and it has maintained world peace. We consider that a realistic policy is to recognise this while, at the same time, encouraging balanced reductions in nuclear forces which maintain the credibility of the deterrent at the lowest possible level. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe too that part of Australia's contribution to the Western Alliance system is to allow access to ports and airfields in Australia by the United States. We continue firmly to believe that such access is essential to the full effectiveness of the ANZUS alliance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not only the reality, as the honourable member for Kingston has just said, but also a fact of life, a fact of foreign policy objectives and appreciation by members of the Western strategic community. In our meetings with representatives of the New Zealand Parliament it was regrettable that they were unwilling to share and accept that statement by the Prime Minister on our responsibilities as a member of the Western strategic community. Whatever other issues may have been discussed between our respective committees-whether it was the environment, trade, culture exchange, migration or the reintroduction of passports and other migration controls between our two countries-no other issue goes as much to the survival of our two nations as a shared defence responsibility. No matter how much we talk about the closer economic relations agreement between our two countries-and we are talking of just over $3 billion-Australia, because of the unilateral decision by New Zealand, is now the only country in the Southern Hemisphere that has a defence treaty with the United States of America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend the New Zealand Government on its wisdom in proceeding with the acquisition of two new Anzac frigates, the surface combatant ships. I hope that New Zealand will quickly restore its position as a responsible member of the Western strategic community. Like people in the United States, we in Australia look forward to New Zealand's return. I hope that as a consequence of this visit there will be a continuing dialogue between members of the respective foreign affairs and defence committees of the parliaments of Australia and New Zealand whereby at long last, after discussion, we share the common objectives of freedom and democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must commence by saying how much I agree with the comments made by the three previous speakers, the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney), the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). I think they have described the situation very well indeed. I would like to also say that I believe that these joint parliamentary meetings between the committees of the two parliaments are extremely useful. I hope that they will continue, because they lead to better understanding, and I hope that they will continue beyond the defence and foreign affairs arena and into the areas of other parliamentary committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I went to New Zealand in April as part of the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade visit and took part in the historic first joint meeting of committees of the two parliaments as well as participating in the most recent visit by the New Zealand House of Representatives Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. There is a perception among some New Zealanders that Australia, in its relations with New Zealand and its attitude to it, is paternalistic and patronising. I know as a fact that some New Zealanders do feel that. I am very sorry about that, because I think it would be wrong if that were the case. I sincerely trust that Australia-as a nation, as a parliament, as individuals-does not go about its relations with New Zealand in that paternalistic or patronising fashion. But if some New Zealanders perceive us as being that way, to a certain extent that makes it fact, makes it reality. Therefore, I think all of us, particularly those of us in this Parliament, have a responsibility to make it quite clear that New Zealand is important to Australia, that in many ways it is our closest neighbour-not just geographically-and that we have many things in common, many things which bind us together. One of the things which does bind us together, and should, is our relationship with the Pacific island states. I believe we have a special responsibility jointly to assist, again not in a paternalistic or patronising fashion but as partners, our friends in the Pacific islands. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand has a different migration situation from that of Australia. For instance, the people of the Cook Islands enjoy joint citizenship with New Zealand and can come and go as they please. Each year New Zealand also takes a quota of immigrants from two countries, one being Western Samoa and the other, perhaps surprisingly, being the Netherlands. Although New Zealand could be seen as being a Polynesian melting pot, it is significant that it does enjoy this particular responsibility and does what it can. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the other speakers, I must make reference to the Anzac frigates. When the Committee visited New Zealand in April I felt there was a complete misunderstanding about the basis for the acquisition of these frigates. People over there kept saying-and I think some of our people have said it too-that New Zealand was not going to buy Anzac frigates from Australia. That was never the case. It was a joint venture, a joint project. In fact, a little over two years ago the New Zealand Government and the Australian Government both signed a memorandum of understanding to develop jointly these particular vessels. New Zealand had an input into their design requirements. I think it has to be made quite clear that it is a joint project. They are the Anzac frigates, not the Australian frigates. Like other speakers, I am very pleased indeed that New Zealand has finally found its way clear to participate, perhaps not as fully as we would have liked, with the initial acquisition-note that I say `acquisition', not `purchase'-of two of the frigates, and hopefully it will take up the option for the other two. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole process will provide a great deal of benefit for New Zealand, not only in its defence capabilities but also in terms of about $NZ1 1/2 billion, I think it was, being spent in New Zealand on the project, which would initiate very useful, very important new high tech developments in New Zealand industry. I have no doubt that, in the long term, New Zealand's economy will benefit greatly because of the injection of new technology because of the Anzac frigates. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, although some New Zealanders felt that we were paternalistic and patronising, some of us-and I must confess that I was one of them-felt that there was a fairly widespread feeling in New Zealand of isolationism. In speaking on the presentation of this report, I think it is only fair and right and proper that I should mention this. I found that many, but not all New Zealanders with whom I spoke-people in the Parliament, in the various government departments and ordinary individuals-gave the impression that there was this feeling of isolationism. Of course, that is to do with their non-nuclear policy and their withdrawal from the ANZUS Treaty. Like other speakers, I hope that in time they will see that there is an alternative and come back fully into the ANZUS alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in the interests of New Zealand and Australia, and indeed the world, for New Zealand to participate fully with Australia and the United States. We have a joint obligation for the defence of the Pacific. Undoubtedly, because of the changed arrangements, we are unable to cooperate fully with New Zealand in defence, although there is an exchange of officers, training and information. However, there is a restriction which inhibits our working together fully. </PARA>
<PARA> An important issue which comes up in the report is that of aid to the Pacific region. I have no doubt that aid needs to be rationalised. Also there needs to be some degree of coordination of aid, not just by Australia and New Zealand. Perhaps the South Pacific Commission could focus on that. All too often the aid provided by other countries turns out to be, in effect, a white elephant. I refer to a cultural centre in Tonga built by the Japanese, which was very kind of them. The Japanese flag flies outside these massive buildings but they are empty because the buildings are totally unrelated to the needs of the people of Tonga. Because the Tongan people did not want to kick a gift horse in the teeth they said, `It is very kind of you to give us these things. Thank you very much'. That was a major aid project. I have been in the buildings. There is a bit of a museum there which is totally unrelated to the needs of that nation. That is why there must be rationalisation. We do not want to waste our aid. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud the fact that New Zealand is working with us towards the protection of Antarctica, even though New Zealand is in favour of signing the present mining protocol. I reject totally the proposition that there be any mining in Antarctica. It is a part of the world which should be preserved. The mere fact that the maximum depth of ice is four kilometres and the average depth of ice is two kilometres, makes the logistics of mining rather difficult anyway. I conclude on a point about Antarctica because it is relevant to Australia and New Zealand. Antarctica is the only continent in the world where there has never been a war. It is the only continent where man has never killed another man. It is the only continent in the world where the wildlife is completely unafraid of human beings, and it is the only continent where there is complete sharing of scientific data and complete assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the exchange of parliamentary committees program should continue. It is to the benefit of Australia and New Zealand. There should be a commitment by this Parliament to continuing the joint meetings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During this 35-minute debate my Party has extolled the virtues of military alliances and belligerence. I strike a discordant note and promote peace and peaceful cooperation. I regret that I have some disagreement with my friend the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) who believes, quite sincerely, that the only way to avoid a nuclear holocaust is by maintaining nuclear deterrents and nuclear balance. However, I believe that the only way to avoid a nuclear war is by total global nuclear disarmament and by outlawing nuclear weapons. That will achieve the result that we both wish but in a different way. It will be achieved through peace and cooperation. I also want to join my colleagues in welcoming the exchange of visits between Australia and New Zealand. We have familiar bonds with our sister nation across the Tasman. Those bonds grew out of the Anzac tradition and have been maintained through peace. Peace, thank God, lasts longer than war. The wartime cooperation throughout history-I was thankful for it in the Second World War-is a short part of our history. It is much more important that we look towards increased trade, cultural exchange and even a possible administrative union with New Zealand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) spoke about the feeling of isolation in New Zealand. I do not have the feeling that New Zealand is isolationist. Of course, New Zealand is taking steps to get out of the nuclear arms race. It sees this as its only chance of survival. I welcome that and so do thousands of Australians. I remember more than six years ago when the then New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Lange, decided to ban the visit of nuclear armed and nuclear powered warships to New Zealand ports. Thousands of people signed petitions. For years I presented petitions signed by Australians welcoming the New Zealand Prime Minister's move to try to break the nuclear cycle. They voiced a note of protest against the path, as they saw it, that the United States of America was taking. </PARA>
<PARA> The action by the New Zealand Government to prohibit access to its ports by United States nuclear ships has brought into focus the ANZUS Treaty. The ANZUS Treaty-and I have carefully read a couple of pages; 11 articles-does not mention any visit by any nuclear warship. It has nothing to do with it. The ANZUS Treaty came into being in 1951. The United States Administration proposed it to appease Australia's fears following the peace treaty with Japan. There are only two articles which can be said to allude to helping each other during some crisis. One is article 3, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not say that America will come to our aid. We should remember history. During the first and second world wars the United States was somewhat tardy in coming to the aid of the rest of the English speaking world when it fought against Kaiser's Germany or Hitler's Germany. The United States took its time in making up its mind. It finally saw that its own interests were threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> In this discussion there has been an emphasis on military matters and military cooperation. This was also the case during the joint meetings with the New Zealanders. Unfortunately, we have mostly been discussing the frigates; and I support the frigates. But we took up too much time discussing military cooperation, the visit of nuclear warships and so on. We ran out of time before being able to touch on trade and peaceful cooperation. This is exactly what has happened in this Parliament this morning. We started off extolling the virtues of war and belligerence and when we heard a voice for peace we had run out of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Copyright Reform Bill 1989. This procedure allows me to introduce a private member's Bill and to make a five-minute statement in support of it. I have just introduced the Copyright Reform Bill 1989. It is described as a reform Bill because it will very substantially reform the copyright law in Australia. The Bill, in effect, will implement the recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee on imported books and other reproduced articles. The problem that this Bill seeks to resolve arises from the fact that over many years, as many honourable members in this House would realise, readers and booksellers have been quite infuriated by one of the undesirable consequences of the copyright law. It is not necessary for me to explain the details of the copyright law on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the results of the copyright law is that books published overseas are very often not available in Australia until months, sometimes years, after their publication. Sometimes they are never available despite the fact that they have been published overseas. Indeed, when books are eventually brought to Australia by overseas publishers for sale here the prices of these books are far in excess of any reasonable price and far in excess of the price at which they sell in the country of publication. There has been a lot of evidence to suggest that the increase in prices may be 10 per cent, 20 per cent or in some cases 30 per cent. This undesirable situation comes about as a result of the provisions of the Copyright Act, which provides that the publisher has copyright in the book and can determine when and where the book is sold. </PARA>
<PARA> The Copyright Law Review Committee has investigated this issue and has proposed a series of reforms to the law, which will be implemented by this Bill. Briefly, these reforms provide that overseas publications will be able to be imported and sold here if either of two circumstances arise. The first is where the books are not available here within a reasonable time from when they are available overseas. That is the first situation-the reasonable time test. The second is a more narrow one. It is where a distributor in Australia, for example, a bookseller, has a specific order for an item that a consumer wishes to import but not re-sell; in other words, wants to keep it to read it. The Copyright Law Review Committee recommended draft legislation to implement these proposals. This Bill will incorporate those changes to the Copyright Act. If the Bill becomes law, members of the Australian community will have better access not only to books but also to records and other reproduced articles published overseas. Not only will they have access to them but also they will be able to buy them at lower prices and with much earlier delivery times than are presently available. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Government will support this Bill. At the same time, I hope that the Government will respond to the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority, which recommended virtually complete deregulation of the industry of the distribution of books and other reproduced articles. The recommendations of the Copyright Law Review Committee are milder than those of the Prices Surveillance Authority. There is now an onus on the Government to show any reason, if there is any, why the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority should not also be implemented. That response-I can understand that the Government may need a few weeks to examine the Bill-should not be allowed to delay the Copyright Law Review Committee proposals, which I now propose in this Bill should be put into law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very healthy example of micro-economic reform. In many areas the Government has been dragging the chain on micro-economic reform, and here is a very good example. The Government should pick up the ball and run with it, accept this Bill, take it over as a government Bill and make sure that it is passed and put into law as soon as possible. Consumers will benefit; purchasers will benefit; industry and commerce and the economy will benefit. Nothing can really be said against this Bill. Therefore, I hope that in the interests of all buyers and readers of books, the Government will support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That, recognising the high level of public concern about foreign investment in Australia, this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) supports Federal Government restrictions on foreign purchases of Australian residential real estate;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) opposes the abolition of the Foreign Investment Review Board; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls on the Government to investigate further initiatives to impose appropriate controls over foreign investment in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>This debate is about the national interest. It is about whether members of the Australian Parliament will listen to the voices of their constituents and respond with appropriate legislative and other controls to protect the national interest. This debate divides the House between those honourable members who believe that the Government has a legitimate role in protecting the national interest and ensuring that foreign investment is targeted to those areas where it truly benefits our country, and those honourable members on the other side of the House-led by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock)-who believe that government has no role in the important matter of protecting the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of the Federal Labor Government's policy on foreign investment is that it is a balanced approach. The present Government is not zealot-like in its approach to this issue. We say that, in many circumstances, foreign investment has a legitimate role to play, both as a driving force for the advancement of the Australian economy and investment in new industry as well as bringing new technology to Australia. We do not have a blinkered view of foreign investment that would seek to make Australia a fortress. However, there ought to be a balance and we ought to recognise that the community has legitimate concerns about foreign investment. That concern is not solely in any one section of the community. Many people right across this country share my concern and the concern of my constituents about excessive levels of foreign investment. Sections of the business community and the trade union movement have expressed that concern. Indeed, the national conference of the Returned Services League of Australia put on public record its concern about foreign investment and called for greater powers to be given to the Foreign Investment Review Board. The Government has acted on some aspects of those concerns. Later I will refer to a piece of legislation that was passed in this House to give effect to concern about excessive foreign investment in Australian residential real estate. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern of the Australian community has not been solely about residential real estate. Concerns have been expressed about excessive foreign investment in primary industry. To his great credit, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, has recognised that concern and he has put on the public record his view that we ought to be monitoring developments in the beef industry, for example, and that we ought to ensure that proposals that are referred to the Foreign Investment Review Board are referred also to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy for an expression of viewpoint that will protect rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Minister Kerin's concerns are, firstly, that, where possible, foreign investors should establish joint venture arrangements with Australian interests; secondly, that there should be provision for adequate capital injection for plant upgrading in abattoirs and meat-processing works; and, thirdly, that such proposals should open up direct lines to overseas distribution and marketing organisations. It seems to be an inherently reasonable proposition that, as a national government, we should ensure that the national interest is protected. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Opposition supports a policy that abdicates the national interest. It is an open slather policy which, on the public record, leads clearly and unequivocally to the abolition of the only effective control on foreign investment in this country-namely, the Foreign Investment Review Board. I intend to speak at some length on that proposal's impact on Australia, because it is completely out of step with public opinion in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not-and I do not believe that any of my colleagues will-be prepared to countenance a debate on foreign investment that is going to be based on race; that is going to try to whip up fears in the Australian community based on the source of investment from any one country. From the Government's point of view, this debate will never be allowed to touch on those issues. This is a debate about the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the Government's initiative in November of last year of introducing into the House of Representatives a law to effectively place controls over foreign investment in Australian residential real estate. That Bill contained the requirement that foreign purchasers of residential real estate were to notify the Treasurer of those proposed transactions. The Treasurer would also be given the power to stop a transaction and prevent the foreign acquisition of Australian residential real estate if it were considered not to be in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, members of this House and the people of Australia: What could be more reasonable? What a heinous and horrendous proposition that the Treasurer of this country, representing the people of Australia, should actually have the power to stop foreign investments that are not in the national interest! That inherently reasonable proposition was bitterly opposed by the Opposition, which voted against it. The Opposition believes that the Treasurer should not have the power and that there should be an open slather, open door policy on foreign investment. I charge the Opposition with being totally out of step with Australian public opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy that the Liberal and National parties have adopted-albeit by a tortuous and divided process-has been to take the view, according to their so-called Economic Action Plan, to abolish controls, except for certain strategic areas-and they only give the example of the media-and with them, the only effective mechanism of control. The Opposition proposes the abolition of the Foreign Investment Review Board because it views it as being out of step with the outward looking, entrepreneurial spirit that it talks about as its so-called rationalisation for its slavish adherence to the false goal of free market forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again the Leader of the Opposition has been on the public record on this issue. Earlier this year, in his capacity as shadow Treasurer, he appeared on the Sunday program and was asked by Mr Laurie Oakes:</PARA>
<PARA> Would a coalition government be more or less regulatory where foreign investment is concerned?</PARA>
<PARA>The then shadow Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA> We would be less regulatory. I have no hesitation in saying that, and you either believe in a more deregulated society in a greater flow of funds around the world or you don't. </PARA>
<PARA>There has to be balance and protection of the national interest. That is why the Government rejects the call for the abolition of the Foreign Investment Review Board, and that is why foreign investment will be an election issue. The Government is glad that it will be. We are glad about that because we think we are in step with public opinion and that the Opposition has abdicated its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are further dimensions to the Opposition policy on foreign investment that ought to be drawn to the House's attention. It has put out a document called Privatisation-The Australian Way. Whatever view one takes on privatisation, frankly I think that a lot of Australians are not going to be happy with proposals to sell the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, Qantas Airways Ltd or, would you believe, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation-something which I would have thought was part and parcel of the history of this great country. It is one thing to take a view in support of selling off these national assets, but it is an entirely different proposition to say, as the Opposition does, that we ought to allow foreign investment in those key sectors of the economy. It may well be that the Opposition would impose some limit on the degree of foreign investment in those key areas in the short term. We have yet to see finally what policy the Opposition will run up to the election with. It has certainly gone on the public record as being prepared to support foreign investment in those areas. I think Australians ought to be aware of that and ought to be aware, when they are casting their votes, of the significance of that policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned in the course of my remarks that there have been bitter divisions in the Opposition on this question, and those tensions and pressures inside the coalition will in my view inevitably burst out before the election. There are principled people in the Opposition such as the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), from South Australia. He is a former Minister of a conservative government who has been prepared to speak out in support of the retention of the Foreign Investment Review Board. He, like me, believes that the Board should have more powers, not less, and it certainly should not be abolished. But people ought to be made aware of what has been placed on the public record in the lead-up to this policy announcement and this free market forces, laissez faire, open slather approach of the Opposition. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald soon after his election as acknowledging the concerns in the community and saying there was a need to fine-tune the Opposition policy, and he has also been quoted extensively as suggesting the Foreign Investment Review Board ought not to be abolished. But the Leader of the National Party was rolled. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been others. Even as recently as 3 July the National Party federal conference-and I want to mention this because people ought to be aware of the betrayal by members of the National Party of their own Party organisation and their own constituency-endorsed a resolution calling on the party at the State and Federal level to show the strongest possible support for the operation of an effective Foreign Investment Review Board. That is the National Party policy, but it is not the policy of National Party members in this chamber. They are out of step. As recently as May this year that well known public figure and Liberal Party President, Mr John Elliott, went on public record as calling for a partial ban on Japanese investment in Australia. We will have no truck with that; we will not countenance racist calls of that nature. But at least Mr Elliott went on to be consistent with our view, in his interview on Channel 10, by saying that the fate of the Foreign Investment Review Board was being reconsidered. He suggested there might be a role for it in keeping out unwanted foreign money. On this occasion Mr Elliott happens to be right, but it is not the policy of his party because his party supports the abolition of the Foreign Investment Review Board. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other principled, concerned people in the Opposition who on this issue at least are speaking with one voice with the Government. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), from Western Australia, has gone on the public record himself as calling for the retention of the Foreign Investment Review Board. He presented a paper to the coalition party room which called for the retention of the Board. He, like the members of the National Party and their Leader, was rolled. We see now a policy which, as I have said, calls for the abolition of the Board. Others have gone on the public record on this issue. Queensland's Senator Sheil has called for limits on foreign investment. Earlier this year the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) raised concerns about beef producers and the Western Australian rock lobster industry. Those industries are concerned about excessive foreign ownership. But he was rolled. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn again, in conclusion, to the honourable member for Sturt. I strongly agree with him. He takes the view that there are concerns about this in the community, that we should be aware of the effect of foreign investment and should ensure that we retain control. He took the view-and I share his view-that we need to retain the Foreign Investment Review Board, make it more effective and respond to those community concerns. This will continue to be an issue as we go to the election, and we on this side of the chamber are proud to stand defending the national interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), has been reading too many newspaper reports about the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and should more properly have addressed himself to what has been said by the coalition leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), in the last couple of weeks. We believe the FIRB has a proper role, and the coalition also accepts the need for controls in foreign investment in certain strategic areas. We believe there is a need for the Federal Treasury to have a proper monitoring role of foreign ownership in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, we do reject the xenophobic attitude some have that espouses a severe wind-down in foreign investment in Australia. We believe that the advantages of foreign investment far outweigh the disadvantages. We have to realise that there are economic costs that go with restricting foreign investment. More than ever there is a need in this country to have an outward-looking entrepreneurial spirit to get us out of the economic mess we are in. It is worth noting in that regard that we need foreign investment more than ever because of the parlous state that this country's economy is in. The low value of the Australian dollar and the high value, relatively, of the yen make it even more attractive for countries such as Japan to invest here. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge freely that there are proper concerns about foreign investment, one of which, of course, is vertical integration such as we are seeing elements of in the beef industry and the tourist industry. In the beef industry, for example, if Japanese investors own the feedlot or the farm, the abattoir, and the marketing facilities, there is concern that access for Australian producers could be restricted. While that may be a concern, there has been as yet no evidence that this has gone anywhere near the extent suggested. Perhaps there is some inkling of it in the tourism industry, whereby if the Japanese buy resorts, own the buses, have the interpreters and run their own tourist shops, Australian people in this area could be locked out. Again I think it is overstated. Nevertheless, it needs watching and we have a Trade Practices Commission in this country which can properly deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern is transfer pricing, where profits can be transferred offshore so that the proper amount of taxes will not be paid in Australia on any profits made. I believe that the Australian Taxation Office is now properly geared up to control this, and it is not creating a problem at all. There are other areas of concern in the Australian community which I think are more irrational. Some people believe that foreigners should own only leasehold land in Australia and not freehold, but if that restriction is imposed it will be less attractive for them to invest here. In any case, frankly, I have never been able to have explained to me what advantage there is in having leasehold land owned by foreigners rather than freehold land. I think it is more in the mind than in the substance. Others say foreigners are coming over here and buying up our heritage, but I have yet to see any proper evidence of this. </PARA>
<PARA> Others say that Japan is winning in Australia the war that it could not win with arms 40 or 50 years ago. I think that is an irrational approach. The success that the Japanese are having in their country today is due to their hard work. The problems that we are running into are due to our incompetence in running the economy and, to some extent, our laziness. The call for Australia for Australians has some danger in it for us. The British arrived here 200 years ago and populated a land that was already owned by Aborigines. They did it successfully because the Aborigines perhaps could have managed the land better, from a technical point of view. If the Japanese can come to Australia, invest and make profits-and do it better than us-it reflects more on us than on them. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at what the Japanese own in Australia, we see that there is very little cause for concern. The ownership of abattoirs has been in the news a lot. The Japanese own or partly own only four out of 39 abattoirs in New South Wales and two out of 39 in Queensland, on the latest figures I have seen. They recently bought an abattoir at Forbes in my electorate in New South Wales. The abattoir had been closed down because we could not run it properly. We could not make profits on it. The Japanese bought the abattoir and opened it up. They have created 200 jobs in Forbes. The abattoir has been of enormous benefit to beef producers in the Forbes district. I can see only advantages from it. If the Japanese had not bought the Forbes abattoir, it would have remained closed. That would have been to the disadvantage of all of us. The Japanese own only 3.5 per cent of the total Australian cattle kill in abattoirs. Another 8.6 per cent is owned partly by Japanese and 3.8 per cent is owned by other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Singapore and West Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> People are getting uptight about the feedlot industry and the fact that the Japanese are creating a few feedlots. However, the Japanese are creating feedlots that did not exist before. By investing money in them, they are guaranteeing a market for Australian beef in Japan. If they did not invest in feedlots in Australia, they would invest in them in Brazil, the United States, or elsewhere. We have to bear that in mind. In Dubbo, in my electorate, the Japanese are talking about spending $20m on a feedlot for 30,000 cattle. That feedlot does not exist now. If we hunt the Japanese from that area and they go to America, we will lose the benefit of selling them 100,000 tonnes of grain each year. Something like $7m of freight will go into that feedlot each year. It would provide $400,000 in veterinary bills each year and it would create 40 to 50 jobs. In addition, the benefits for the beef farmers in the Dubbo district would be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern in the Australian community that profits will be remitted overseas, but we have to remember that our current account deficit-leaving aside productivity increases-can be financed in only two ways: either we borrow more money overseas, the fixed servicing cost for which is now running in excess of $1 billion a month, or we attract investment from overseas. Money is remitted back to those countries which invest only if they make a profit. I would rather have a higher level of foreign investment and a lower level of overseas borrowing. That would be much healthier for Australia than increasing the debt, as we are doing today. We have had waves of foreign investment in the past. People have been concerned about the waves of investment that we have had from Great Britain. We have also had waves of investment from the United States. I can remember the xenophobia that pervaded this country when the Yanks were buying up northern Australia. All they did was develop those properties, employ people here, and create a level of expertise; most of them went broke and went back to America anyway. Thus, it was to our benefit more than to theirs. Today, we have Japanese investment in Australia. The Japanese are investing only 5 per cent of their overseas investment in Australia and New Zealand anyhow. A property of 50,000 acres in my electorate, `Wingadee', was sold recently to the Swire group, an English group, and it hardly made a paragraph in the Land. If the Japanese had bought it we would probably have seen pages written about the Japanese invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the total accumulated foreign investment in Australia, the highest investor is the US with 24 per cent, followed by Britain with 22 per cent. The Japanese have only 13 per cent of the total foreign investment in Australia and others, such as New Zealand, Switzerland, Italy and the like make up the rest. There are enormous advantages in foreign investment. It creates jobs. Seventy per cent of the jobs in the manufacturing industry alone since World War II have been created by foreign investment in Australia. It brings in levels of skills, technology, new ideas, business expertise and the like, which enrich us. Without foreign investment, we would be a backwater. </PARA>
<PARA> If foreign investors make a profit, they pay taxes. They create an infrastructure in this country and develop new resources. They often end up becoming Australian citizens, to our benefit. It gives us a faster growth than we would otherwise have. They cannot take land home with them. If they buy a farm here, they cannot take it back to Japan. It has to stay in Australia; let us not forget that. It releases the capital that we have invested in these areas for investment in areas that we think would be more profitable. Most importantly, it locks us into their consumer markets. The classic case is Japanese beef, on which I have just expounded. It all means a higher standard of living for us in Australia today. At the end of the day, it means better, more friendly relations between nations. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some provisos. Foreign investors must pay the proper level of tax. They must play by our rules in Australia. They must operate here in open competition and they must do it without political favours or subsidies. We should ask for reciprocal opportunities in their countries. Where there have been difficulties in that area, for example, in Japan, I am pleased to see that opportunities are opening up. I see that Denmark, the United States, New Zealand and other countries are investing in Japan. We should too. People ask whether such investment should be made only through joint ventures. That is okay as long as it does not frighten them off and if the Australian capital exists to go into joint ventures with them, but that should not be an absolute condition. We must realise that today Japan is a saving nation and that Australia is a spending nation. We complement each other and we are foolish if we do not get together for our mutual advantage. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables that I have shown to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), which lists the levels of foreign investment in this country over the last decade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. A survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1983-84 showed that only 5.9 per cent of agricultural land was subject to foreign ownership. We had a classic case in my electorate recently with the Auscott cotton project, which was US-owned. It brought to Australia the skills of irrigation engineers, agronomists, farm managers, ginning experts and the like. That project has now been sold to Australian Consolidated Press. There is a case of foreign investment in rural property returning to Australia, so I think it works both ways. Overall while there are concerns-some irrational, some proper-the advantages of foreign investment in Australia far outweigh the disadvantages and we should encourage it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) regarding foreign investment in Australia. I support not only what the honourable member for Hughes said, but also most of what the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) said, which is not often the case. The motion reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, recognising the high level of public concern about foreign investment in Australia, this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) supports Federal Government restrictions on foreign purchases of Australian residential real estate;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) opposes the abolition of the Foreign Investment Review Board; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls on the Government to investigate further initiatives to impose appropriate controls over foreign investment in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>I realise that it is difficult to talk about foreign investment in isolation from balance of payments considerations and the value of the Australian dollar. However, as a non-economist I do not propose to enter the debate by trying to discuss these complex interrelationships. Along with most people in the community, I can relate and react to such things as interest rates, changes in the price of goods and services and whether there is sufficient economic activity within the community to provide sustained employment for all Australians. I digress for a moment to say that whilst most people in the community find these high-level economic debates very confusing, the community nonetheless has become very sophisticated because people appreciate that there are no quick-fix solutions. This is something the Opposition has yet to learn. Its recent attempts to come up with alternative economic policies will not wash with Australian voters. Of course, people do not like high interest rates or wage restraint. However, they certainly have a better understanding than our colleagues opposite of the state of the economy and what needs to be done.</PARA>
<PARA> In order to enjoy sustained economic growth and to participate in the world economy, Australia needs access to foreign investment. This issue is certainly not in dispute. I also believe that foreign investment, both equity and debt, can enhance our productive base and help achieve a level of investment growth beyond that which could be achieved by domestic savings alone. In my own electorate of Hawker, the Mitsubishi motor company of Japan has made a long term productive investment in plant and equipment. This form of investment has added to the productive base. It has also provided jobs for people within my area, and I for one certainly support and encourage this type of productive investment, whether it be in my electorate or in any other part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there can be a down side to what is commonly referred to as the internationalisation of capital. When money is allowed to move freely from one country to another, speculative foreign investment has the potential to be disruptive and to detract from long term productive investment. It is in this regard that I wholeheartedly support the Government's initiative in September 1987 when it abolished the $600,000 cumulative exemption threshold and made it a general requirement that proposals for urban real estate acquisitions be submitted to the Foreign Investment Review Board. Whilst I acknowledge that it is difficult to prove conclusively that foreign investment in real estate contributed significantly to the spiralling house prices in 1986-87, there was a common perception amongst Australians that this was a major contributing factor. As economics is as much about perceptions as about other things, I make no apology for the Government's reimposing tighter restrictions on this aspect of foreign investment. It can be said that Australian investors may have contributed to this price spiral by borrowing from overseas to purchase real estate in Australia. This is another facet of foreign investment that I would like to see subjected to greater scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> I also think the events of last week on Australian stock exchanges, precipitated by the Friday the thirteenth Wall Street shake-out, bring home very clearly the vulnerability of our capital markets to external influences. This, too, is an area where more work needs to be done to see whether it is possible to separate out investment of a purely speculative nature which is unrelated to value-adding production. Whilst I assume that all speculative transactions are subject to the present capital gains tax, I believe further taxation imposts may need to be introduced to discourage the rapid turnover of short term foreign capital moving in and out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government has introduced many initiatives to assist and encourage Australian producers and manufacturers to become more actively involved in the world economy, such as the Button car plan, Austrade, and the exposure of more and more manufacturers to competition by reducing tariffs. I have no hesitation in supporting these initiatives and believe a lot has been achieved over the past 6 1/2 years. However, we have to recognise that Australia is a very small player in the world economy. I think the terminology used is `price taker' rather than `price maker'. That being the case, Australia can be exposed from time to time to quite severe disruptions and dislocations when transnational companies and investors pursuing their own interests can exert undue influence on the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not going to change to any great extent Australia's influence in the world economy, and it would be equally naive to return to the bad old days of trying to operate in a closed economy. The only practical solution, therefore, is to maintain a balanced approach to foreign investment, as my colleague the honourable member for Hughes has pointed out, and allow as much flexibility as possible. However, recognising that we are only a small player in a big game, it is necessary to retain checks and balances so as not to expose the Australian economy to too many sudden and disruptive movements in foreign investment. It is for this reason that I strongly support the retention of the Foreign Investment Review Board because I believe there is a role to be played by an organisation which is given that task. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been in recent years a great deal of concern within the community, as both the honourable member for Hughes and the honourable member for Parkes have pointed out, about foreign investment, particularly foreign acquisition of Australian property. Much of this concern has been based on ignorance, misunderstanding and prejudice. In particular, a great deal of hostility has been demonstrated towards Japanese investment. This hostility is found particularly amongst the older generation, who were involved in or who remember the events of World War II. Unfortunately, much of this feeling has been provoked by extreme Right racist groups with their own warped political motives. I find, however, that when I talk to people in my constituency, particularly about the difference between speculative and productive investment, they begin to take a much more reasonable view on this matter. I have great pleasure in supporting this motion. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House supports policies aimed at creating a fairer Australian society through reduction in the extent of inequities in the distribution of income and wealth by (a) increasing employment and reducing unemployment; (b) improvements in the social security system; (c) strengthening the progressive tax system; and (d) policies aimed at increasing competitiveness and reducing industrial concentration. </PARA>
<PARA>Since this motion was foreshadowed, the Opposition parties have announced an economic package, every aspect of which would make Australia a less fair society. Therefore, in this speech I will concentrate on discussing the Liberal and National parties' policies. Nobody with any compassion can vote for the Opposition parties at the next election. There is an ideological thread running through every aspect of the Liberal-National Party economic package and that is the reduction of the incomes of the vulnerable and the poor. Every part of the package is designed to reduce the security of those who are already most insecure. Every part of the package would reduce the incomes or the services of those who are most vulnerable. Every part of the package is socially divisive, increasing conflict between the haves and the have nots. This package must, therefore, be rejected by every person concerned about fairness, equity and justice in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Peacock package is a shocking reflection on once responsible parties. It vividly demonstrates the extent to which the conservative parties have been captured by New Right Thatcherite ideology. It demonstrates also the appalling ignorance of those responsible for its preparation, for no-one who has met recently retrenched unemployed or the long term unemployed, who has seen a neglected Aboriginal settlement or who has visited an impoverished Third World city could possibly support this package. One astonishing feature of the package is that it does not do anything about Australia's economic problems. Despite analysing some of the serious problems we face, there are no new policies for addressing any of them. The stand on fiscal policy is the same as the Government's. Nothing is said about the exchange rate; comment on industrial relations and wages is limited to repetition of superficial ideological posturing; and comment on monetary policy is inconsistent, unpersuasively linking claims about the aim of reducing interest rates, with no indication about how that could be achieved. This package fails the test of economic responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one goal in the Liberal-National Party package which everyone could welcome and that is the aim of increasing family income. But why limit that goal to only middle and higher income families? Why choose methods that will at best leave incomes of the poorer families unchanged and at worst reduce them even further? Why not choose methods which would increase the incomes of all families when these are readily available? While one of the ends of this package is desirable, all of the means of achieving that end are misjudged, regressive and perverse. Nobody with even a shred of compassion can support the Liberal-National Party economic plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The major feature of this unfair package is the brutality of the attack on the unemployed. If a Liberal-National Party government were elected, everyone who had been unemployed for nine months or more would be prohibited from receiving unemployment benefit. That means that after nine months of looking for work and of being rejected, the unemployed would experience the humiliation and final rejection of being told that the unemployment benefit would no longer be received. As a special concession, and after further humiliating cross-examination, some of them would be given the concession of special benefits. Migrants would also be denied access to income support programs after their arrival. This is like using a chainsaw which has slipped and could cause severe injury. If these policies are introduced, there will be blood everywhere, not only on the victims but also on the hands of those who designed or support this policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are some people who avoid working, but the Government, through the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), has been rigorously assessing and weeding out such people for two years now, and the number of people receiving unemployment benefit has fallen as a result. Unemployment benefit is not payable to people who are not actively looking for work, and that requirement is rigorously enforced. What are those who are denied unemployment benefit or special benefit to do? If they had been able to get work, they would not have been on unemployment benefit. Under the Liberal and National parties' scheme, they will have to sponge or beg or steal. A class of people in Australia would be created for the first time since the Second World War for which the community accepted no responsibility. This would not happen, of course, because non-government organisations-the welfare groups, the churches-would provide voluntary support for such people. But a Liberal-National party government would, for the first time for 50 years, refuse to provide any public income support to a substantial section of the Australian community. It is appalling to know that even a few Australians who claim to be responsible would seriously contemplate such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only would the Liberal-National Party package create an underclass of the absolutely deprived, but also it would abolish most of the programs designed to get the unemployed back into the work force. The package announces that Jobstart, Skillshare and the industry training support scheme would be abolished; so the very schemes which are designed to help the unemployed overcome their problems would be removed. Even the new enterprise incentive scheme, which aims to help the unemployed become self-employed, would be abolished. The plan of the Liberals is to increase incentives for the wealthy but to remove them for the poor. The new enterprise incentive scheme is an imaginative program which helps the unemployed help themselves, but even that skerrick of hope would be abolished. The abolition of these training programs would effectively imprison the unemployed in their inability to obtain work. Even support for the Commonwealth Employment Service, which finds jobs for the unemployed, would be reduced by a quarter. Such proposals are incomprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not even as though the coalition parties believe that their policies will increase employment opportunities. There is not one word in the package about the goal of increasing employment. Amongst the oft repeated economic goals there is not a word about employment, yet in Australia we still have half a million unemployed, which is 6 per cent of the work force. It is certainly true that the Labor Government has succeeded in reducing unemployment from over 10 per cent in 1983 when we won government to about 6 per cent now, but 6 per cent is still shockingly high. That means that half a million people who are actively looking for work cannot find it. The proof of this is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics can identify only 64,000 vacancies while over half a million people are unemployed. At present there are simply not enough jobs for everyone who wants one and is looking for one. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not one word in the policy about unemployment being the major cause of poverty, one of the major causes of family breakdown, and the cause of psychological disintegration, escapism and crime. There is not a word of sympathy or regret for this underclass in Australia. There is not a word about alternative policies for increasing employment or reducing unemployment. The only promises that are made are about reducing income support, reducing training programs, reducing support for self-help, and reducing support for the Commonwealth Employment Service, which finds places for people in new jobs. The introduction of such policies would make Australia a cruel and brutal society. Anyone with any compassion must totally reject the economic plan of the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Other aspects of the Opposition's expenditure proposals also attack the vulnerable. Funding for invalid pensioners would be reduced by $150m a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, kicking the cripples. To have one's illness reviewed in that way is not only inefficient but also humiliating. The Opposition's tertiary fees would make university entrance much more difficult for low and middle income earners. The Aborigines-the most systematically dispossessed section of the Australian community-would have their support reduced by $100m a year. The puzzle about Aboriginal deaths in custody-for which, I regret to say, Australia is known throughout the Western world-would not be resolved for the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody would be wound up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's support for the absolutely impoverished in Third World countries in our region would be even further reduced. Australia is already contributing in overseas development assistance only 0.33 per cent of our national income-a third less than the average of all Western countries, which is 0.5 per cent-yet we live in a region in which millions of people live in absolute poverty. Our shared humanity with these people at least requires that we make a contribution to enabling them to help themselves. Yet this package of the Liberal and National parties cavalierly slashes a further $100m from the aid vote. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would be abolished, removing a check against discrimination against women, migrants, Aborigines and the disabled. Payments to the States would be massively cut, reducing their capacity to maintain adequate health, education and other services-further discriminating against the already impoverished. Anybody with any compassion must completely reject the coalition's economic package. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the taxation measures which these cuts in outlays are designed to support are inequitable. Increasing income support for families is obviously desirable, but it is equally obvious that it should be done in ways which ensure that the benefit goes to the children of low income people as well as to those of middle and high income people. The package chooses to make a tax rebate which will be received only by those whose incomes are high enough to pay tax, so excluding those who do not receive a taxable income. Yet the means for an equitable support for families is readily available through the family allowance scheme, which in fact was introduced by a Liberal government. That means has been rejected in favour of a new scheme which gives the benefit only to middle and higher income people. This is proposed by the same parties which criticised the family allowance scheme for applying to high income families. The hypocrisy would be unbelievable if it were not actually in front of our eyes. Anybody with any compassion must reject that means of providing family support. </PARA>
<PARA> The most regressive measure in an entirely regressive package is the proposal to abolish capital gains tax. Capital gains tax is a necessary part of a fair taxation system because it ensures that income received in the form of capital gains is taxed, as is every other form of income. The benefit of abolition of capital gains tax would be received by those who earn much of their income through capital gains-that is, the wealthy. Abolition of the capital gains tax would simply transfer to the already better off a further $450m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a mystery why the Liberal and National parties have stuck with this part of their frequently changed past policies but have rejected their previous proposals to withdraw or change all sorts of other parts of the tax system. For example, in the middle of the year the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) travelled the country saying that he would increase the tax incentive to save. There is nothing in this package which increases the tax incentive to save. The only impact it will have on saving is to reduce income from the poor, who cannot save, and give it to the wealthy, who can. </PARA>
<PARA> The cartoonist Tandberg made the definitive comment on the package of the Liberal and National parties. He published a cartoon in which he portrays the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as promising that no child will live in poverty while the Leader of Opposition offers the promise that no rich child will live in poverty. That captures the essence of this package. The more compassionate members of the Opposition must be appalled by what their leaders have decided to do. It is quite clear that there was opposition by at least some of the Opposition front bench to at least parts of this package. Many members of the Opposition are humane people, but nobody with real humanity could possibly accept that this package is the way to help middle Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If this package were introduced, Australia would become a divided, unjust society, like Thatcherite Britain. It would amount to a total rejection of any responsibility for mutual support. It would amount to rejection of those parts of our culture which are based on the Christian principle of loving our neighbour. Anybody with any compassion must totally reject the Liberal and National Party economic plan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we believe in compassion. We believe that one of the best ways to be compassionate is to have an economy that works and this economy does not work under the Labor Government. I will come to that subject because the previous address, and no doubt the one to follow, is predicated on the assumption that the Government has got it right. But this Government has got just about every major economic decision wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to outline the recent history of the Government's more enduring achievements. The September current account deficit figure of $1.8 billion is truly appalling. It gives us an annual rate of deficit on the current account, the measure by which we are going broke, of $24 billion a year-about 6 per cent of our gross national product. Incidentally, it is even more than the horrendous figure of $18.5 billion which was forecast in the Budget Papers. So once again it looks as if the Treasurer's figures are wrong. The volume of imports for the September quarter-another achievement of this Government after seven years in power-grew at an annual rate of about 18 per cent. We have all heard the Treasurer speak on the subject of exports. He tells us how well the Government is doing and how it is on track. He tells us how industries are gearing up. But what has happened? The volume of exports is increasing at the rate of 10 per cent. What is the differential? I would think even the Labor Party could work it out. It is 8 per cent. That is what the Labor Government is doing to this country after seven years in power. We are going down the drain at a time when interest rates have reached near unsustainable levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The inflation figure that has just been released is another triumph for this Government. What is the level that inflation is running at? It is 2.3 per cent for the quarter and 8 per cent for the year. That is more than twice the average rate of inflation of our main Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development partners-our main partners in the advanced industrial world. That is another significant achievement of the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the pilots strike. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was going to fix the pilots strike. But remember what he did. Did he say, `Look fellows, this strike could be devastating for this country. Let's all sit down around the table and ask ourselves what is fair for the country, the airlines and the pilots'? Did he do that? Did this industrial peacemaker use the strength and authority of his office to do that and reach a conclusion within a couple of weeks? No, he did not. Instead, he went right over the top because he believed that, at a time when every economic indicator was going against the Government, this issue would provide him with a quick political win and perhaps would give him the window of opportunity to bolt for an early election. He has missed that window of opportunity and he has prolonged the dispute by weeks, possibly by months. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some more enduring achievements of this Government-the long term achievements in which it can take pride. Australia's overseas debt has quadrupled in the time that Labor has been in office. It has increased by more than four times the previous figure. It is now a net figure of $108 billion plus. This is the junking of Australia. Our volume of exports is stagnant and is falling behind those of the rest of the world. Similarly, our quality of life is falling behind that of the rest of the world and our per capital income is sliding. Another great achievement of this Government was alluded to by Professor Helen Hughes, the chairman of the Government's own committee for the review of export market development assistance. Productivity growth has been negligible since 1985, and we know what a unique wages policy this Government has. It is entrenched in this Government's mentality as it looks steadily back towards the nineteenth century. It does not seem to have occurred to any of the geniuses that litter the front bench of the Government that after 80 years it is just possible that it is time to change the wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What does Standard and Poor's say about this? The downgrading of Australia's credit rating by Standard and Poor's, joining the downgrading by Moody's Investors Service, should be added to the recent achievements of this Government. Standard and Poor's had this to say about this Government's industrial wage fixing system:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the centralised award system still contains appreciable rigidities that have restrained productivity improvements. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder that our productivity gains in the last three or four years have been negligible?</PARA>
<PARA> Another enduring achievement of this Government is the level of interest rates. Interest rates for home loans are at 17 per cent and interest rates on ordinary bank loans are at 21.5 to 22.5 per cent. There is no relief in sight. Also, on the most recent figures inflation is stuck at 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes great pride in the policy that it has put out. This policy has been attacked by the Government because it knows that it will be destroyed by that policy. The Government has run out of options and has become a government of quick political fixes. In the case of Kakadu National Park, it stops the prospect of mining there because it wants to buy the green vote. In the case of Eastman-Kodak Pty Ltd, it says, `Let's shovel $50m or $60m in their direction'. On the airline dispute or on any other issue, this Government has a bandaid mentality. It is attacking our policy because it is the right policy for the Australian people, and it has been judged to be the right policy. It is the right policy for families, for children and for all income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> I will finish my remarks by making two points. One concerns the attack made by the Treasurer on Standard and Poor's. We should recall what the Treasurer has been saying. He said, `Don't take any notice of Moody's, wait for Standard and Poor's'. But when Standard and Poor's came out and junked the Government and Australia's credit rating, the Treasurer said, `Well, I suppose they would have to do that to stay in line with Moody's'. The philosophy of the right wing of the Labor Party is, `If you see a head, kick it. If somebody does something, find a reason which shows that action to be dishonourable'. It never says, `We disagree with Standard and Poor's but we accept the integrity of Standard and Poor's'. The Treasurer is saying that `Standard and Poor's lacks professionalism, integrity and honesty and is simply falling in line with Moody's'. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point relates to something that was said by the last speaker, the honourable member for Fraser. He spoke about a cartoon by Tandberg. I recall another cartoon by Tandberg. Somebody is coming in to pay interest rates to a bank. On the desk are his hands, and the bank manager says, `Well, that will do for a start'. That is what this Government has done to this country. It is going out, and it knows it is going out, because the policies of the Liberal and National parties are right for the country, the people, the future and our development as a great country rather than the stagnant society brought about by seven years of misrule by these people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) had been on the front bench, from which he has recently been removed, I think he, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), would have formed the three riders of the apocalypse. This trio has given a mishmash of representation of the Opposition's policies which have been presented by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) over the last week or so. The honourable member for North Sydney gave a definition of `compassion'. If I got down my notes correctly it was to bash the unemployed; to have a policy which will bring about increasing numbers of unemployed. He said that it was compassionate to pull the crutches from underneath the invalid pensioners and that it was right to put another barrier in front of students who wished to enter higher education. He said that it was compassionate to deny access to child-care for the children of pensioner families, low income families and families of the handicapped, and women who opt to stay at home. Then this means contempt for migrants who are setting up a new life in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess that, as a lawyer, he has learnt over time that one does poorly when one has a bad brief. These sentiments are unAustralian. If we asked any average Australian in the community what he wanted out of Australian society-what he wanted the members of the various parliaments in this country to achieve-he would say, `Maintain a fair Australia'. In this country people have come to expect a fair go. Yet all we heard from those opposite was in direct contrast to that. They said that if one is rich one should get richer and if one is doing well one should be better off. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at some of the statistics-some of the facts-about how our society distributes its wealth and its income. Recently I visited a school to debate with an Opposition member of this chamber whom I will not name because he is not present here and I have not warned him. When we were discussing the Opposition's policies he made a peculiar statement that fits very well with what was said by the honourable member for North Sydney-that there was no poverty in this country. `Look around you', he said to the students, `There is no poverty whatsoever'. I said to the students, `Hasn't he heard of the Smith Family, the work of the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the studies of the Australian Institute of Family Studies? Doesn't he know the research and the work done by the Social Welfare Research Centre? Doesn't he talk to people? They will tell you that there is poverty in this country and that the way to roll back that poverty and have a more egalitarian society will be to continue the policies that have been put forward by the Hawke Government and this will take more time'. But, like the honourable member for North Sydney, that Opposition member of parliament said that there is no poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a very unfair distribution of income and wealth in this country. The top one per cent owns 25 per cent of private wealth in this country; the top 10 per cent owns 60 per cent of the private wealth. The remaining 90 per cent has to do with 40 per cent of private wealth. We must maintain a strong public sector with strong government business enterprise. We must put a stop to any thought of privatisation if that 90 per cent is to have any share of the public wealth of this country and not have it distributed in a concentrated way to that top 10 per cent of private wealth owners. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at income distribution 70 per cent is from wages and salaries, 14 per cent from the self-employed and 5 per cent from property, with 11 per cent of our population receiving income from superannuation and pensions. When we work out after tax net family income the top 20 per cent gets 41 per cent of income, the top 40 per cent gets two-thirds of income and the bottom 40 per cent gets a miserly 17 per cent of income. The bottom 20 per cent, the very poor in our society, has to do with 5 1/2 per cent of the income distribution in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a very unequal society. When we look at the changes that have taken place, the money from the so-called squeeze on the low and middle income earners, more income is not going to the poor. The best that this Government has been able to do is maintain the line against deterioration of the situation of the poor in this country. It is very difficult to make advances unless we have a greater acceptance of a more progressive taxation system. But here we have filching of the income, a stealing of the wealth of the middle class to give to the upper class-the upper wealthy people, the richer people. Let us not be wrong about this. Let us be quite clear. The squeezing of income of the middle and low income earners in this country has not gone to the poor, the unemployed, the elderly, the handicapped or the students; it has gone to those who are already in a more powerful position in our society. The Opposition's policy will increase that direction of maldistribution-in other words, make this country even more unequal. The Opposition has attempted to go out and find a scapegoat in society to get its election bribe across to the middle income earners. It has found an emotional scapegoat. In effect, it says, `If you find someone who is down and out, kick him hard'-instead of equitably redistributing income in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Australian Labor Party came to office 2.8 million Australians were living in poverty; unemployment was 10.3 per cent; child-care was not an accepted thing and was extremely hard to get; secondary school students left too early and so were jeopardising their futures as regards getting a good and secure job and a good income. Tax rorts were rife. When people went to a party or social gathering the talk was about how one cheated the Australian Taxation Office-how good one was at ripping off the public sector and making it hard for others, the pay as you earn taxpayers who had to support the whole system. Pensioners found that they faced a declining and less certain future. We were getting two classes of retiree-those on well padded superannuation packages from the private and public sector and those who were meant to make do with the declining real purchasing power of a public pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has put in place its social justice strategy. It is not just a simple one-liner meant to attract votes out in the community or the dangling of a carrot of a few dollars but a solid integrated package overarching all the different programs of Government to bring them together in a cohesive and progressive policy. The Government's social justice policy is about making a fair go for all in redressing inequities in Australian society. The strategy is based on the Government's firm belief-and I think all Australians hold this-that all Australians are entitled to genuine equality of treatment and opportunity in all spheres of community life, including equal access to and an equitable share of the nation's resources. In contrast to the distorted understanding of compassion put by the honourable member for North Sydney, a socially just society to us is one in which the economic resources are distributed fairly, individual rights are protected and enhanced, fair access to essential community services is assured and all have the opportunity to participate in the life of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a series of Budgets we have put together-clearly documented now as a Budget Paper-a program which integrates economic policy with social policy. We have put together progressively a wide range of programs that are making Australia a fairer, more compassionate society that provides better life chances for all Australians. We now see 1 1/2 million more people at work. We see fewer unemployed. We see a fairer society emerging. The choice that is starkly facing us is whether we take the definition of compassion as outlined by the honourable member for North Sydney and turn the clock back or make further progress. I predict that when the people have their chance, they will demonstrate that they want more of this Government and reject the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House queries the benefits of multiculturalism to Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving that motion I want it to be quite clear that `multiculturalism' is one of the debased words of our society, because it has so many definitions. When I say this, I am talking about those aspects of multiculturalism which tend to create division within our society, which tend to cause segregation, apartheid, separation of peoples and even ghettos. This is totally wrong. The practice of multiculturalism in Australia, as set on the new directions by the coalition's policies, will be of great benefit to Australia. This country has already benefited mightily from migration. I do not think anybody in this country can dispute that Australian culture has grown and diversified and been enriched by migration. Australia owes its origins to people who have come from many nations, each making a contribution to the development and fashioning of the Australian identity which marks us out as being different from any other country. Successive waves of immigration have changed the Australian identity over the years. This process will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Terms and concepts such as `multicultural' and `multiculturalism' do provoke a great deal of debate. They mean different things to different people. To many they are words of reassurance, but to others they have, over time, connoted division rather than unity. We really are bound together by common Australian values and traditions to which all have contributed and in which all should feel an equal degree of pride. These values and traditions include a generous acknowledg- ment and understanding of the desire of Australians born overseas to preserve a continuing affinity with and affection for the cultural heritage of their birthplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure I can speak for the whole of the coalition when I say that it is our goal to ensure that all Australians, no matter what their racial or cultural background, can be truly confident that they have an equal and valued role in developing the modern Australian nation. I certainly endorse the objectives of a cohesive society within which people are free to express their own identities. I support equal opportunity for all to participate fully in Australian society and in local and national affairs, as well as the encouragement of a commitment by all to the national well-being. All newcomers want and should have open access to avenues of success and satisfying acceptance in the constantly changing Australian society. Pluralism must not lead to a perpetuation of distinction between new and old, them and us. There must be no first-class and second-class citizens. Equality of opportunity is achieved when people of different backgrounds are able to participate in Australian society on the same basis. We in the coalition believe that our citizens and residents should live in an environment which allows everyone to achieve his own maximum potential. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come to government at the next election, we of course will continue to encourage respect for Australia's cultural diversity, acknowledging that we are a people drawn from many parts of the world. Our pride, a pride which I share, in the history, culture and language of our diverse origins is a legitimate expression of self-esteem. The sharing of our heritages will enrich our nation and strengthen our sense of unity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we should be aware of what the present Labor Government did when it completely reversed what it was doing in terms of multiculturalism, because it is freely acknowledged, apart from those who are fanatical about it, that in recent years the Labor Government had been pushing divisive policies, had been pushing policies of segregation and separate development. But when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) launched the national agenda for a multicultural Australia in July, he adopted a great deal of Liberal-National Party policy. </PARA>

We are pleased that the Government has backed away from the form of multiculturalism which the honourable member has been espousing personally for some time and which is anti-Australian. I agree with the Prime Minister that the three dimensions of Australia's multicultural policy should be cultural identity-the right of all Australians, within carefully defined limits, to express and share their individual cultural heritage, including their language and religion-social justice, being the right of all Australians to equality of treatment and opportunity and the removal of barriers of race, ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender or place of birth; and economic efficiency, involving the need to maintain, develop and utilise effectively the skills and talents of all Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From listening to the speech of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), one would be somewhat surprised to realise what his actual motion was. The motion was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House queries the benefits of multiculturalism to Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA>In his speech, the honourable member appeared to be saying that multiculturalism was all right provided that it was defined in certain ways and that it followed certain principles. Then he tried to tell us that those principles were taken from the Liberal Party's platform. Obviously the honourable member must be a bit confused, because the concept of multiculturalism and the principles to which he referred have been around for about 15 years, ever since they were first propounded by the Whitlam Government, then adopted by the Fraser Government and then adopted by the Hawke Government. In fact, the only time there was any debate on multiculturalism was during the unfortunate period last year when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was Leader of the Opposition and he decided to try to initiate a debate in which he attacked multiculturalism on similar lines to those on which the honourable member for Cowper has attacked it. He tried to attack it on the basis of some ridiculous claim that multiculturalism is divisive in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it quite clear that we welcome the return to a bipartisan approach on multiculturalism since the change in leadership of the Opposition. We welcome especially the position of the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). We want to continue this cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA> Motions such as this one from the honourable member for Cowper do no good at all to the sustenance and support of that bipartisan position. In fact, they give credence to those few elements in Australian society who are opposed to multiculturalism for the wrong reasons and who want to promote a divisive approach. It is not multiculturalism which is divisive in Australia; it is the opponents of multiculturalism who have been using an argument against multiculturalism and trying to divide Australia. There are extremist elements who are obviously blatantly racist in their rejection not merely of certain cultures but of virtually every culture of the world except the very narrowly defined culture which they choose to interpret as Australian. In fact, Australian culture is a much broader and richer concept than any of these individuals can imagine. Many of them live in the past and imagine that Australia is something like it was 70 years ago, when cultural development would have been much narrower than it is now. The fact is that Australia has been enormously enriched by immigration and by the contribution of waves of migration and their cultures. </PARA>
<PARA> Multiculturalism is not divisive; it is a unifying force. It says that every Australian should be able to contribute to the cultural development of Australia through drawing on the cultural heritage from which he or she comes. The cultural heritage might be Anglo-Saxon, it might be European, it might be Asian, it might be Latin American, it might be that of one of the Pacific Ocean countries. All of those cultures have come together in Australia and are contributing to the evolution of the Australian culture of the future. Anyone, unless he walks about with his eyes closed, can see that Australia is much enriched by this development and by the fact that internationally we are recognised for the important contribution which multicultural philosophy has made to social development. When I have been to Europe and the United States of America there has been enormous interest in our multicultural policy, in the way in which we have harmoniously brought together different cultural streams. In contrast to many other countries, we have brought the various cultural streams together in such a way that they have made a positive contribution to the development of our nation. This multicultural philosophy is certainly the philosophy of the future. It is the way in which we will move ahead as a society that gives a fair go to all to participate through their cultural contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the honourable member has to object to in the general philosophy of multiculturalism. He put this motion down saying that he queried the benefits of multiculturalism, but he put down no argument at all. What argument did he present? He presented some vague arguments, similar to those put forward by opponents of multiculturalism such as Professor Blainey, about multiculturalism creating ghettos and separation and all those problems. Anyone who contrasts Australia with any other developed country that has a number of cultures will see that we have the opposite. We do not have ghettos; we have people mixing. Originally, people might come together in one geographical place for their first five or 10 years in Australia, but what do they do after that? They all spread out. Where is the Greek community, the Italian community, the Spanish community, all the different communities? They are everywhere; they are spread around. We do not have ghettos. What are these people talking about? They are simply trying to raise conflicts which do not exist, and we are better off that they do not exist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some in the Western world today who believe that Liberal democracies have been so successful in nurturing freedom and pluralism that there no longer exists a common philosophical foundation or a common morality upon which we can debate social issues or develop law and social policy. It seems to me from my discussions with colleagues on both sides in this place over the last few years that such a pessimistic assessment about our capacity for rational conversation on moral issues is unwarranted. In rising to speak today on the issue of abortion, I intend to put a number of questions to my colleagues and to the Parliament in an endeavour to discover just what principles and values we do share in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many honourable members will have seen comments by a Western Australian academic recently warning his fellow Australians that the growing demand for foetal tissue for cell transplants could see the development of a commercial pregnancy and abortion process whereby poor women are paid to fall pregnant or be artificially inseminated and then have an abortion to make foetal tissue available to doctors. Many honourable members will be aware of debate here and overseas about whether it is time to make use of anencephalic babies by maintaining them on life support systems to provide organ transplants or spare parts for other persons. Many honourable members will recall evidence last year that Australia, as with other civilised countries, is now seeing gender-determined abortions. That is, it is now common for women to abort a baby once the sex of that child has been determined. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask these questions of my colleagues: In a country where we fund and legitimate over 60,000 abortions each year, in a community where the dominant assumption is that it is not immoral or wrong to abort by poisoning and dismemberment, why would it be wrong for a woman to fall pregnant and abort for money? Why would it be wrong to set up anencephalic spare parts units? If there is nothing wrong with abortion, what does it matter that the reason for an abortion is that the woman does not want another girl? Is this Parliament capable of discussing and judging these moral questions?</PARA>
<PARA> I put a more basic matter to my colleagues: Tens of thousand of citizens are insisting that abortion involves the termination of an individual's life, constitutes murder and involves the question of two sets of rights-those of the mother and those of the unborn person. In this place on 17 August I put the view that scientific, philosophical and moral logic support the view that an individual's antenatal and postnatal development constitutes a single process of becoming what she or he already is-an individual person. I referred honourable members to the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation, which found against marker events in the development of an embryo and argued for the status and rights of an embryo. Members of this place, as law-makers, are being asked to form and state their own view on this matter. Do honourable members believe that an embryo or foetus is a human person some of the time or any of the time whilst in the womb? If only some of the time, for the purposes of law-making, what is their suggested marker event and how can it be justified in a non-arbitrary way?</PARA>
<PARA> I now ask a different question. Have those members of parliament who so freely dismiss abortion as a minor procedure ever studied or seen what happens to a foetus when it is destroyed in the abortion process? During the International Year of Peace, in order to provoke debate and consciousness, films and glossy coffee-table books went into graphic detail in describing a nuclear blast. Next week, the library will show three videos on abortion, which are both rational and graphic. How many members of parliament have the courage to inform themselves about what actually happens to a foetus when it is poisoned or cut to pieces in the unnatural and cruel process that is so calmly described in the community as a simple medical procedure? Are members of parliament willing to give abortion the consideration that it is due? Can they resist what I claim are the unavoidable and obligatory moral questions that confront those of us here who are responsible each year for funding tens of thousands of abortions?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the political questions. Regretfully, yesterday, the Government indicated that its schedule is too full to allow a debate and a vote on the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill. The Government's position reflects the contempt with which it treats all those Australians, both pro-abortion and anti-abortion, who believe that the Parliament should make its position clear on this issue. Its position reflects also the contempt with which it treats the Parliament, which, according to it, has no right to determine legislative priority or to amend the schedule of business. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions that I ask my colleagues on both sides of the House are these: Will they continue to accept the way in which Parliament and back bench members of parliament are denied their rights to initiate debate and law? Do they believe that they have the right to keep from their constituents and their voters a clear picture of where they stand on abortion, and abortion funding in particular? Having allocated time on such crucial Bills as the goat fibre levy Bills that were before the House this week, do they accept that the issues of whether one person should be forced to pay for another person's abortion decision and whether abortion and its funding is out of control are not worthy of a position on the legislative schedule of this session of this Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> I ask my parliamentary colleagues to reflect on all of those questions. However, I leave till last what will undoubtedly be the most important question for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Bob Hogg: In staving off debate and a vote on the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1989, will they be happier with a vote on the Bill or a de facto abortion vote on whether to discuss the Bill just before the next election in 1990? I ask all of those members of parliament whose first consideration when dealing with the abortion issue is not the substance of the issue but how they can manage it in their electorates: Will they be happy with the Government if it succeeds in preventing debate on the Bill in 1989 and it becomes a problem on the floor of this House early next year, which will ensure that it becomes an election issue?</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members are failing the community and themselves in their refusal to consider, discuss and vote on the abortion issue and abortion funding. I call on the Parliament to ensure that time is allocated for a proper debate and vote. I leave to the Government the decision whether there will be some kind of vote on the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill this year or in the shadow of the 1990 election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of a number of citizens in Forde and, in particular, on behalf of those residents in the Centenary suburbs whose calls have been totally disregarded in relation to having any control over the area in which they live. We hear much about the Opposition's policy on the environment, but I intend to discuss the implementation of such a policy and the way that it impacts on many people. In Brisbane, Liberal Party policy on the environment is determined by the Brisbane City Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much has been said about the Year of the River. In fact, the Lord Mayor's environmental council has been established to ensure that environmental matters are taken into account. However, no less than five groups within an area of five kilometres who wish to have some say about their own environment and the way in which they choose to live and who wish to create an environment for their children to live in have been denied any input to that famous environmental council or to the Year of the River. Indeed, those people have been treated in a very high-handed way and extremely rudely. </PARA>
<PARA> The first group is the Jindalee Action Group, which is endeavouring to maintain public parks and recreational facilities within its local area. The matter came to a head with the building of a girl guides hut. Well may one say that we certainly support the girl guides, the kind of work that they do in the community and the way in which they develop independence and confidence in many young girls. However, their needs and the necessity for parking and recreational facilities in the area must be balanced. A most extraordinary situation has developed in which one of the local commercial enterprises has taken over the girl guides hut and has promised them the use of a park along the river which is currently owned by the Brisbane City Council. That area of land is not towards one end or the other of that recreational park but is right in the middle, which will deny access to a whole range of people. Over a period the Brisbane City Council has allowed that park to be impinged upon by builders. As a result, the area that was originally set aside for recreational purposes has been reduced by one-third or almost one-half. </PARA>
<PARA> The action group is not asking that the girl guides not be given a home but that they be listened to and that parks, recreational and public facilities within their area be maintained. The group went to a great deal of trouble. It consulted some very educated town planners, architects, engineers and others who suggested a range of suitable alternative sites. One night, in true Queensland style, a special meeting of the City Council was held and approval for the building of the girl guides hut was raced through. Consequently, that hut will stand in the centre of that recreational area despite the fact that probably four or five other areas would be suitable to both the girl guides and the residents. </PARA>
<PARA> That is yet another example of the Opposition's high-handed attitude and its policy on the environment. Anybody who opposed that stance and suggested alternative sites for the girl guides' hut was abused and called a child hater. Over 2,000 people who attended a public meeting were called child haters, which is quite an extraordinary and high-handed statement to make about people who are trying to maintain parks for all children in the area and for all people. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another group of people who live a couple of kilometres from the recreational area and who have also had to deal with the high-handed attitude of the Brisbane City Council and the impact of its environmental policy. The Queensland Cement and Lime Co. Ltd which, as honourable members would know, is not famous for its environmental stance, has sold off its buffer zone land to L. J. Hooker, which is trying to make people believe that it is not going to build light industry there but that it is going to keep the land as a buffer zone. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, to the residents of that area and to those of us in the real world, it is obvious that L. J. Hooker is not in the business of buying land to maintain it for trees, birds and so on. That would be an extraordinary and ludicrous belief. Although the minutes of council meetings reveal that the land has been rezoned for light industrial purposes, we have been told that we have all got it wrong and that the fact it is in black and white in the minutes is simply a little bit of grandstanding by people who happen to oppose the local Liberal Party alderman and that it would be quite extraordinary to believe otherwise. Those 1,000 people are seeking to maintain some control over their lives, over their environment and over the way in which they and their children would like to live. </PARA>
<PARA> When one talks about environmental policy and conservation, one talks not only about the great wonders of the world such as the rainforests, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Kakadu and the wilderness of Tasmania but also about the day-to-day events of all individuals in the community who are trying to determine the kind of environment that they want for themselves, for their backyards, for their recreation and for their children. All of this amazes those people who see land being rezoned at council meetings in the middle of the night, who see extraordinary events happening and who are told that they are child haters and are misguided because they happen to believe what they see printed in city council minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Another kilometre down the road we have a bicentennial project, which was funded by the Australian Bicentennial Authority-the cleaning up of a creek and the establishment of a beautiful barbecue area. As it is at the back of a school many children go there. It is a very pleasant area. We now find that that, too, is to be rezoned for heavy industry, for factories. So, behind a primary school of 400 to 500 students, we are now to have large trucks and heavy industry in an area in which the council last year saw fit to apply to the Federal Government for funding to create a public recreational park. When 400 or 500 people gathered together to ask questions about this matter, no representative of the council turned up. They approached the Lord Mayor's environment council: `Oh,' she said, `We haven't time to discuss any of this'. Indeed, where does one go? It is suggested that people are making it up; that they are grandstanding? But the signs have gone up. Teachers, parents and children at the school are, of course, equally horrified by the fact that a quiet little street and a large park area, which is literally at the back of their school, should be used in such a way. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that members of another group, a boating group, who actually meet on the river, find that their riverbank is to be mined. Their little sailing club where they have met for a very long time is, in fact, quite historic since John Oxley and various other people sailed up that part of the river. They see daily evidence of the riverbanks being eroded, but they, too, can find no voice here. I simply ask that in this, the Year of the River, the environment council and the Opposition's stand on the environment, these people be heard. What is the response to these groups? Can all these people be wrong? Is it wrong for them all to want to maintain the parks next to them and over the road? One of the reasons why many of them bought their houses was so that their children could play in these parks and live in a pleasant environment. Is it wrong for the school community not to want huge trucks and factories behind the school ground? Are they wrong to be worried that their children may well be run over or affected by fumes? Instead of this they expected a nice little nature walk and a barbecue area. Is it wrong for the sailing club people to suggest that the best possible maintenance of the Brisbane River in an environmentally sound way is, in fact, better for everybody in the longer term?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, one has to ask what the Opposition is doing. Why is it treating people in this high-handed manner? These are ordinary citizens who have every right to ask that their views be listened to, that the kind of lifestyle which they want for themselves and their children be taken into account. They should not be treated in this very high-handed and offhand manner. This approach is all too often part of the way in which people are treated by members of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to highlight a couple of rapidly escalating problems confronting Australian wheat growers and, by extension, the nation at large, given the importance of wheat exports in relation to the balancing of the nation's books-or, I should say, attempts to balance the nation's books. These problems are, firstly, the failure of this year's wheat crop across large areas of eastern Australia, and, secondly, the impact of interest rates and the economic environment in which we live on wheat growers and their capacity to keep producing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me begin by making the point that we are in a time of crisis in relation to our foreign debt levels. Australia now has a foreign debt that has increased by more than 500 per cent since this Government came to office. The debt stands at close to $140 billion and has doubled since 1985. The implications for the future of all Australians are both immense and frightening. Already 63c in every export dollar is required to service that debt. In that there is an assumption that we have the commodities to export in the first place and also that they are worth reasonable amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA> A major stumble in either area could well see Australia simply unable to service its debts in the future. That is a frightening prospect and one which we, perhaps rather arrogantly, never thought would happen to us in the lucky country. But it may well happen to us and, of course, yesterday we had the Standard and Poor Corporation reassessing our economic performance because it is plainly concerned that we are getting in too deeply, as well it might be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Last financial year we had our worst ever balance of payments deficit of $17.4 billion. The Budget projection of $18.5 billion for this year is already beginning to look hopelessly optimistic. The $3.88 billion current account position for the first three months of 1988-89 contrasts with a figure of $6.1 billion for the first three months of this year. The implications for a possible massive overrun on the already very high figure of $18.5 billion projected are very worrying indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Some months ago the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made the point to this Government that it was being overly optimistic in its projections for wool exports this year. We know now that he was correct in that forecast. In addition, we have to add to that several worrying developments: the live sheep dispute is one; the pilots dispute is another. What will that add? Perhaps $1 billion or $2 billion-possibly even $3 billion-to our trade deficit for this year. Now we face a further development: this year's wheat crop will be way down on our earlier expectations. That is worrying enough, but I want to suggest that even worse is the prospect that next year's crop will be very low indeed. Many of our wheat growers are so badly knocked around that, given the high interest rates and continually rising input costs faced by the farming sector, they may very well not line up to sow a big crop next year. In other words, it will not be just farmers who will suffer, it will be Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not unusual for farmers to face tough times. Crop failures are not rare; droughts are not rare; and floods are not rare. But certain factors have combined to make the going extraordinarily tough for Australian wheat farmers. For one thing, last year's crop was not particularly good and growers needed this year to boost their position. For another, we have had a series of years of low commodity prices which have weakened the position of the strongest farmers, driven many others into deep debt, and, of course, as we know only too well, driven others off their farms altogether. Given that most farmers are philosophical about seasonal conditions and even commodity prices-they will always talk about next year and the prospects for turning the corner in the next season-worse is the fact that the economic environment in which they have to operate is so unbelievably hostile. To be fair to the Government, as I have said in this place before, it has sought to do what it can in the area of international commodity prices by seeking to reform international trade and it deserves-and has-the gratitude of farmers for its efforts in that department. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us look at the rest of the scene. Our inflation rate has for years been higher than that of our competitors and, as today's figures reveal, they remain so. The cost of farm inputs has continued to soar way and above the inflation rate figures that we see published for the rest of the community. I am reliably informed by one competent farmer in our area, who would have done his mathematics correctly, that his costs have risen by 14 per cent over the last 12 months. That is far worse than the sort of inflationary figures that the rest of the community has had to put up with. We are slugging the most efficient and, coincidentally, the most vulnerable sector of our economy the hardest. That is a great deal less than sensible. </PARA>
<PARA> Reform on the waterfront and in transport lags hopelessly. The efficiencies available for the taking identified by so many different investigations over recent years have simply not eventuated. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has provided some revised figures on farm profitability for the last five years. It indicates that it underestimated by more than $5 billion farm costs in that period. On the other hand, it overestimated farm income by $4 billion in the same period. The overall decline in the terms of trade of Australian farmers in recent years has been sustained and serious. </PARA>
<PARA> To turn again to the plight of farmers, it is true that crop failures do happen. It is also common for a good year to follow a poor one. For example, in 1982 the horrendous drought that had Australia in its grips saw wheat production in New South Wales fall below two million tonnes. But in 1983-84 it shot back to top eight million tonnes; a dramatic improvement in anybody's language. Farmers took advantage of strong country-that is to say, country that was well rested by not having produced much the year before amongst other things-and a good season to plant as much wheat as possible. They reaped the benefits and so did Australia. Now, obviously enough, there is a need for a repetition of that pattern next year in Australia. Farmers will need the cash flow and so will the nation. But in the context of the economic environment in which farmers find themselves, there may well be no repetition of 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> We are continually told in this place that tight monetary policy and attendant massive interest rates are necessary to balance the nation's books. But here is the ultimate irony: the very mechanism used by this Government in its vain attempts to balance the nation's books threatens the capacity of our exporters to produce and export-in other words, to make their contribution to righting our trade imbalance. No better example exists of the counterproductive nature of present interest rate policies than this one. Quite simply, many farmers will not front up next year for carry-on finance; they will not be able to front up for carry-on finance to plant next year's crop. Many will leave the industry. There is precious little prospect of a great surge of export dollars resulting from wheat sowing and stripping next year as there was in 1984 and which did so much to right our economic situation in the early days of this Government. It was indeed a lucky government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if farmers are confronted by interest rates of a mere 17 per cent. No; for the most productive sector of an otherwise often very unproductive society, a very unproductive Australian economy, the rates range from anywhere around 19 per cent right through to a horrifying 27 per cent. That is the highest figure I have yet heard but there are farmers out there struggling with a burden of interest rate levels of 27 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Especially galling to Australia's efficient wheat producers is a justification given by the Government for the handout to Kodak. That justification in large part was that Kodak earns $250m per year in exports for Australia. Many times that figure is available for the taking if Australian farmers are given an environment in which they can expand their production. It is time that we heard the cries of our primary producers. We will continue to ignore them at the cost, not just of social injustice and human suffering on the part of farm owners and their families and the communities that they service and live and operate in, but also of continuing our national slide into international indebtedness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to refer to today is the Northern Territory Government's attitude towards the Opposition's action plan which has been released with such fanfare and has been the cause of such contention and debate within this House. That plan is, of course, as honourable members are well aware, a recipe for economic disruption and social chaos. The plan has as its base the politics of division; the pitting of Australian against Australian. It is a plan that mirrors the number crunching calculations, the pencil and eraser of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and the misplaced public service drop-out who masquerades as the shadow finance spokesman. It has no policy basis. It is not even understood by the Opposition front bench, and we have seen that in the last couple of days in terms of the child-care policy. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has already had to admonish two shadow Ministers for their failure to understand aspects of the policy which affect the areas for which they supposedly will be responsible if there is any change of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this policy were ever implemented it would have a devastating effect on the Northern Territory. It surprised me somewhat when reading the Northern Territory Sunday newspaper, the Sunday Territorian, of 22 October, that the Northern Territory Chief Minister should heap praise upon this document. He said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Support for responsible families and taxpayers is a bottom line of this policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to direct my attention to that statement, that support for responsible families and taxpayers is a bottom line of the policy. That is a cause of some concern because what this policy does is alienate a large section of the Australian population from the benefits of the Australian economy. What it does, quite clearly, is attack those people who are presently on welfare in this country, who may, through no fault of their own, be in positions where they are reliant upon the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the statements by the Northern Territory Chief Minister, supporting the coalition's economic statement, show a complete lack of leadership and support for Territorians. The Chief Minister's uncritical acceptance of the coalition's economic package makes it crystal clear that the Northern Territory Government no longer has the capacity to stand up for its own constituents. The coalition's policy totally ignores the needs of rural and remote Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Labor, programs have been initiated which specifically target the needs of people living in remote areas, to ensure that they have effective and equal access to government services and funding. A large measure of that is a result of the country task force of which the previous chairman was the present Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), who is at the table. The Chief Minister, Mr Perron, in his headlong rush to tie himself to the apron strings of John Elliott and the Leader of the Opposition, has fallen hook, line and sinker for a set of policies which would devastate rural Australia. Gone are the programs set up under Labor, such as the rural education access program and the rural women's access grants scheme, which have been of real benefit to people living in remote areas, not least to those living in the Northern Territory. It is these kinds of services that the Northern Territory Chief Minister is saying he wants to see thrown on the scrap heap. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about Countrylink?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, Country-link as well. Not content with supporting the abolition of programs which have been specifically designed for people in rural and remote areas, the Northern Territory Government has also thrown its support behind cuts of $100m to Aboriginal affairs, which will have an enormous social and economic impact on the Territory. The Chief Minister's public statements have totally ignored the real ramifications of these cuts. Surely, even the Chief Minister can understand that by supporting the coalition's attempt to vandalise some of the most effective and innovative programs which have been designed to provide Aboriginal people with the education and skills necessary to move away from welfare dependency, he is condemning thousands of the Territory's population to abject poverty without the potential means to even lead a life of self-sufficiency. That would be the result if this policy were ever unfortunately implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for Territorians on long term unemployment benefit, the Chief Minister appears to be totally ignorant of the fact that there are some 2,810 people currently registered in the Northern Territory who have been unemployed for longer than 12 months. Under Labor these people have access to specially designed programs to get them back into the work force. Going for the cheap but catchy `dole bludgers' line, the Northern Territory Chief Minister, while pretending to support families, is prepared to throw these Territorians on the scrap heap. When one takes away all the hype about caring for families and punishing bludgers, one finds that the coalition's policy reveals a callous disregard for those in real need and a total contempt for the special needs of remote Australia. In fact, it is an attempt to shore up the bludgers in the community, those people at the top end of the income scale. As I mentioned the other night in this place, the President of the Liberal Party has had his salary package increased by some 81 per cent to over $1.55m. How can that be justified? He is the sort of person who will benefit from the coalition's proposal to remove the capital gains tax. He will accrue direct benefits as a result of that, further to that enormous salary increase. It is no wonder that members of the Opposition are silent when it comes to admonishing the pilots for the outrageous 30 per cent demand which they have made because they are lining their own pockets through their administration. They see that the executives of this country are not prepared to take the sort of medicine that the rest of the Australian community is prepared to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter to which I would particularly like to refer in relation to this policy is the cuts to Aboriginal affairs. I have just left the launch of this Government's Aboriginal affairs policy by the Minister for Education, Employment and Training (Mr Dawkins). He has informed us that during the course of this Labor Government there has been an increase of 28 per cent in the number of Aboriginal people enrolled at school, an increase of 126 per cent in school retention rates for Aboriginal people around Australia and an increase of 205 per cent in tertiary education enrolments. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Opposition propose to do to Aboriginal employment, education and training if it is elected, God forbid, to govern this country? The Opposition proposes to cut Aboriginal employment, education and training funding by $23m. What that will mean, in conjunction with the other cuts it proposes, is that Aboriginal people in my electorate, who are the recipients and the beneficiaries of this expenditure by way of programs targeted to meet their special needs and get them off the welfare train, will be relying on the welfare train for the rest of their lives. That is the net effect of this policy. Its impact upon the Northern Territory community is one that has been totally ignored by the Northern Territory Government. It is so prepared to accept the legitimacy of the arguments being put forward by those opposite, that it could tolerate $100m worth of cuts to Aboriginal affairs expenditure and also similar cuts in the area of employment, education and training, which would have a devastating impact upon its own community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth pointing out that a study this year pointed out that the Aboriginal economy was worth 30 per cent or thereabouts of the total Centralian economy. A large part of that is a result of expenditure made by this Government, either in terms of general grants through the Northern Territory Government or specific program grants by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs or the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In 1988-89 the Northern Territory Government and community benefited by $44m from expenditure by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. What we are seeing is support for a process which would undermine that expenditure, which would undermine the capital improvements which are being made in schools in Aboriginal communities throughout the Northern Territory, one of which was opened this very week by the Northern Territory Minister for Education. That school was the recipient of $1.7m worth of Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the people who want to lead the Australian community. These are the people whom the Northern Territory Chief Minister supports as being the alternative government of this country. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, how anyone with any rational, objective approach to the good of the Australian community, could support the policies which are being advocated by the Opposition, and supported by the Northern Territory Chief Minister and the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak about a national tragedy-that of youth suicide. This issue gains some publicity in April every year when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases its statistics on causes of death. The issue gets two or three articles in the newspapers and then is promptly forgotten for the next 12 months. Yet it is an issue of great importance because suicide is the second largest killer of 15- to 24-year-old men in this country. As such, it is a tragedy for Australia, as well as being a very personal tragedy felt by the families of those children and young people who commit suicide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an important issue because in the past 30 years the number of young people taking their own lives has increased 300 per cent. In the past five years it has increased nearly 40 per cent. What do those figures mean? They mean that this year we can expect about 380 teenagers to kill themselves. That is more than one young Australian every day. That is really just the tip of the iceberg, because for every successful suicide there are at least 100 unsuccessful or parasuicides. That is a conservative estimate. That means that in this country, this year, we can expect 40,000 young people to attempt to take their own life. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it happening? Why is there this enormous increase? Certainly it is a phenomenon that is occurring all around the world, although some people writing about it have suggested that Australia's increase has been more dramatic than that overseas. Many people have ideas about this. A Sydney psychologist, John Howard, has gone on record as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that an increasing number of young people feel so empty and powerless that they are seeking some form of oblivion, escape, tension-release, recognition or validation of their existence through acts which are antisocial, violent or self destructive. </PARA>
<PARA>Richard Eckersley, who works for CSIRO and has written extensively on the predicament of youth in this country, put it this way:</PARA>
<PARA>Accelerating cultural, economic and technological changes have led to more family breakdowns and conflict, poverty, youth homelessness, unemployment and educational pressure. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We have created a level of tension and anxiety and a level of instability that has existed on very few occasions this century. </PARA>
<PARA>That theme is echoed by most people who write on the subject-high unemployment, lack of opportunity, family break-up, uncertainty about the future, drugs, alcohol, alienation from society. </PARA>
<PARA> What can be done? The most important thing in this area is to realise that there is a very important relationship between the people who attempt suicide and the people who are successful. Half of all those people who are actually successful at suicide have attempted it before, and have been documented as doing so. To follow that up, one per cent of people who attempt suicide will subsequently succeed. That is, one per cent of teenagers who have an unsuccessful suicide attempt will succeed in suiciding in the coming 12 months. So what can be done? There are a number of areas where we really could make a significant difference. Youth telephone counselling services are fragmented and not well organised around the country; there is no attempt whatsoever to identify depressive disorders in schoolchildren, and hospital casualty outpatients generally have exceedingly poor counselling and follow up. I worked at one of Melbourne's busiest casualty departments for 12 months. I was admitting officer and in charge of casualty at one stage. I remember the frustration of admitting young people who had attempted to kill themselves. On occasions I had to certify people, as I had no other option to ensure that they would survive the night. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very little understanding of this problem by medical professionals, by paediatricians, psychologists and social workers, and there has been really no attempt to raise the awareness of this issue among the people who actually deal with it. There is the phenomenon of copy-cat suicides. In a school community or a group where one person commits suicide, in the following four to six weeks it is well documented that those other kids in the group are at much greater risk themselves. Yet we have no post-intervention process to prevent that happening. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I concede that this problem is largely one that falls within an area of State responsibility. However, it is of national concern and, as such, it does warrant a national response. We have a totally fragmented, piecemeal approach. The one person in this place whom I believe can hold his head high is my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), who has been pursuing this issue for two years, privately as well as publicly, in an attempt to get something done. He has met with no response whatsoever. On writing to the Minister for Youth Affairs in 1987, who at that stage was the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), there was the promise that something was in the pipeline. He said, `We do not want to give this any publicity'. That was reasonable, but that was two years ago. On attempting to take it up again with the present Minister responsible for this area, the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), he did not even get a response to his letter and that was over a year ago. I have been unable to find any mention of a recognition of the problem by the present Minister. All I found was a statement in December 1988 that the Government was reviewing youth policies and he would have something to say by the end of February-two months later. I can forgive him for the fact that it took eight months to get anything to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> What came out of this year's Budget was totally inadequate. We have a response of $28.7m which, if one takes out existing programs that are already funded, means $27.2m-including a one-off $10m payment for homelessness. In real terms that will decrease by 28 per cent over four years. Let me put that in some sort of context: if we compare that $27m with what one department, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, underspent on its youth programs last year we find that the underspending on youth training and employment was $135m. Yet in an attempt to solve this problem we are giving back a paltry $28m. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that the Government makes much of is the youth homeless allowance. I have seen this at work in my electorate. I have seen how difficult it is to get. I have seen a 16-year-old girl, who was being sexually abused by her father with the willing cooperation of her mother, knocked back for the homeless allowance because her parents would not sign a written statement as to why she could not live at home. That is the sort of ridiculous approach that we have. Other areas of assistance for youth are highlighted in the current year's Budget Paper for youth, sport and recreation, where grants to States, local government, community groups and individuals to improve and build sporting and recreational facilities for young people are projected to fall in real terms by more than 20 per cent in the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole approach is indicative of a system that seems more concerned with putting out glossy brochures, with having lunch with advertising executives or with trying to increase expectations to such a high point that they cannot be met. Raising expectations is so dangerous because when they are not met it just increases the alienation that is felt by young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am really concerned that we have very little understanding of this problem. Not to be alarmed by the increasing suicide rate of young people and not to make it a high priority for action is to ignore one of the biggest problems facing our young people. It is time we put some store into protecting Australia's future by making a genuine attempt to protect Australia's vulnerable children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Queensland State election on 2 December is being billed as the `great three cornered contest' in which each of the political parties in that State claims that it can win government in its own right. Of course, the Australian Labor Party can win government and the National Party obviously also can win government. The Liberal Party of Australia, unfortunately-and I accept that it is unfortunate-is the major victim of the Queensland electoral system and yet it continues to come out with a facade of rhetoric that it is able to win government in its own right. The reality of the situation as it now stands in Queensland is that there can be only one of two results from the election on 2 December-that is, a Labor Party government or a National Party majority conservative government in the State of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is denied by the Liberal Party-indeed, it is denied with great fanfare. The leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Mr Innes, comes out with great statements that the Liberal Party will refuse to serve in a coalition government unless it is the senior partner and that it is going for government in its own right. Unfortunately there is nothing particularly new in these claims because before the 1986 State election the then Liberal Party leader was Sir William Knox and, oddly enough, on 26 October 1986, in the week leading up to the State election, we had Sir William declaring, `I will be the State's next Premier'. That was splashed across the Courier-Mail and he was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a dramatic change over the past couple of days and the situation now is that I will be leading the largest party in the Parliament . . . Former National Party supporters are coming over to the Liberals in droves. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is somewhat similar to the statements made by Terry White when he was the Liberal Party leader in 1983. It was even a little bit familiar when Sir Llew Edwards was the Liberal Party leader in the election prior to that. The fact is that at each State election the Liberal Party makes these outlandish claims that somehow it will magically overcome the gerrymander and become the major conservative political force in the State of Queensland. Any view of the figures over a series of elections shows that through the 1960s and 1970s the Liberal Party consistently outpolled the National Party in Queensland, but it never came any- where near winning more seats than the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The current situation is also clearly demonstrated by every opinion poll researching the political mood in Queensland. The most recent one was the Sunday Mail-Channel 9 poll which was published in the Sunday Mail on 15 October. That poll revealed that State-wide, the Labor Party's support was 50 per cent; the Nationals, 18 per cent; and the Liberals, 26 per cent. Again, even though the Liberal Party is clearly ahead of the National Party in terms of its overall support across the State of Queensland, the reality is that it is impossible for the Liberal Party to win more seats than the National Party. The only remote possibility of that happening is if the Labor Party wins government and wins it so convincingly that it takes a lot of seats off the National Party. In that sort of scenario it is feasible, although unlikely, that the Liberal Party could possibly end up with more seats than the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> That sort of result in the State election is not only referred to in that particular poll; it is also confirmed in the polling of the political parties-by Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd for the Labor Party and by the Kenning Organisation for the Liberal Party. The latter's research document was leaked to the media a few weeks ago. I will not go through that document, except to refer to its conclusion, that the present 52 to 48 two-party preferred split in Labor's favour compares favourably with 42 to 58 at the 1986 election. Labor has a very good chance of winning. That is also confirmed by the Morgan and McNair polls. The position is also neatly summarised by Queensland academics, including Professor Peter Coldrake, of the Queensland University of Technology. Professor Coldrake points out quite correctly that it is almost impossible for the Liberals to win in their own right or to be a senior partner in the coalition. Yet it is strange that at each election the Liberal Party has repeated these claims that it can make it in its own right. The reason it does that is that it suffers in the public's perception when it is understood that the Liberal Party is no real alternative; that the alternative is between a Sparkes-dominated National Party conservative government, propped by the Liberals, or a Laborgovernment. Those are the two alternatives which the people of Queensland have to decide upon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the honourable member for Groom objects to that, but in the final analysis there is not a great deal of difference between the Liberal Party and the National Party in Queensland. In fact, after the drubbing in 1986, the then leader of the Liberal Party said, `The Liberal Party and the National Party should amalgamate'. That was Sir William Knox's answer to the difficulties. He added, `I believe it is a legitimate objective which some time ought to happen'-that is, an amalgamation of the Liberal Party and the National Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course that will not happen. But it does not really need to happen because in Queensland, Liberals and Nationals are like interchangeable players. It is like a team event in which one can be a Liberal one day and a National the next day. Let us just go through some of the candidates who will be contesting the forthcoming State election. No doubt there will be another flurry of nominations as we get nearer the date. But this is the situation as it stands at the moment. Let us start alphabetically. Brian Austin: we all know about Brian Austin and his running mate Don Lane, and what happened in 1983. Both were former Liberal Party Ministers who became National Party Ministers. We have Yvonne Chapman, the National Party Minister who started her career in local government as a Liberal Party councillor. In fact, she was simultaneously a member of the Liberal Party and the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> In the seat of Barambah, which was Joh Bjelke-Petersen's old seat, the endorsed Liberal Party candidate against Trevor Perrett is in fact a former National Party member. In the seat of Ashgrove, Alan Sherlock went through the waiting and guessing game before the last election before finally deciding to plug for the Liberal Party's camp. In the seat of Fairfax, contesting the Federal election against John Stone, will be another former member of the National Party, Alex Somalay. In the seat of Aspley, the National Party's sitting member is Mrs Beryce Nelson. Mrs Nelson was a Liberal Party member who was defeated by the National Party in 1983. She came back and beat the National Party bloke who beat her in the 1986 preselection. In the seat of Cooroora, where the National Party member is retiring, the Liberal Party candidate is a Mr Allen Low, who is the former president of the National Party in the area. In the seat of Maryborough, the sitting member is Mr Gilbert Alison, who was recently promoted to the National Party Ministry. He was formerly a Liberal member. His opponent was his former National Party campaign director who is now standing for the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> In the seat of Warwick, which is held for the National Party by Des Booth, a Mr Peter Beattie is seeking selection for the Liberal Party. This Mr Beattie is not the one who is more well known in Queensland; he used to be the National Party president in that area. In the seat of Albert, the Liberal Party candidate is Kay Elsen. She was the National Party candidate in the seat of Woodridge in the last State election. Standing against Brian Austin in the seat of Nicklin is Councillor Bob King, who is now the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Nicklin. He, of course, was the well-known National Party spokesman in that seat prior to getting preselection for the Liberal Party. Sir William Knox did not need to get amalgamation between the Liberal Party and the National Party. One does not have to get official amalgamation in Queensland; it occurs automatically. Party members just swap. They put their fingers to the wind, decide which way the wind is blowing in Queensland for the conservatives, then they pick their mark. If they think the National Party is doing a bit poorly, then they go over to the Liberal Party. If they think the Liberal Party is going down the drain-as it has in the last two elections-that is no problem, they just swap. They do a Nelson, an Austin, a Lane, an Alison. There is no trouble involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Liberal Party has the gall to say that it is an alternative. It says, `Vote for us, we are different from the National Party'. How different is it, when half its candidates are former Nationals, and half the Nationals are former Liberals? It is a joke. No wonder the people of Queensland will reject this spineless Liberal Party and will come to the conclusion that they either have the National Party again, and all that means, or they have a Labor Party government led by Wayne Goss. Those are the alternatives in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) would like to hear an explanation and a very interesting defence of the subject of changing parties, I suggest he read some of the speeches of a very distinguished former Australian Labor Party (ALP) Minister, Senator Wheeldon, and see what he had to say about changing from the Liberal Party to the Labor Party. This was a subject that was raised on a number of occasions in the Senate and, I dare say, there are others who might have read Senator Wheeldon's speeches and be using them right now. It is really ironic for a Queensland Labor member to talk about realignments when the Queensland public has become dizzy over the past 30 years following the course of the Australian Workers Union (AWU) in and out of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. The fact that it is in at the moment is undoubtedly one of the reasons that the Labor Party's stocks are up a bit. The position is very shaky. The AWU gets in, then it argues with the ALP, which chucks the union out again. The ALP knows that it has no chance of winning an election without the AWU, but if the honourable member really wants to watch musical chairs, he should watch that situation. It has happened so many times that one would go cross-eyed trying to keep up with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party is not going to win the next Queensland election because it is gutless. No matter how good Mr Goss might be looking at the moment-and I certainly have no personal axe to grind with him-I would like to ask him what he is doing about the Labor Party and its effect on Queensland. There has been some publicity in the last few days about the fact that Mr Goss has told the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to stay out of Queensland during the election; he does not want the show pony up there. He can use any justification he likes, but we all know why: the Hawke Government is totally on the nose, particularly in Queensland. It has never been very popular there but the honourable member for Fisher would have to be the first to be shaking in his boots at the thought of what will happen to the Labor Party in the next Federal election. Of course, there are two reasons why the Prime Minister must stay out of Queensland during the State election. One is that his Government is hopeless and the other is the way his Government has treated Queensland, which is one of the subjects that I am going to talk about today. Mr Goss really ought to do something about the Hawke Government. He has been Queensland Labor Leader for a while now; he has told the Prime Minister to stay out of Queensland. He is a few months overdue in telling the Prime Minister to do something about the way the Hawke Government's policies are affecting Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I rise today to speak on just one such topic-this Government's treatment of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education and its funding. The subject of amalgamations of tertiary institutions has been debated here on a number of occasions and it is within that context that I speak today. The Gold Coast College of Advanced Education was one of the last to indicate that it would be entering into an amalgamation arrangement and therefore its funding was not included in a document that was tabled and debated in this House during the last parliamentary session. That document contained supplementary funding decisions on higher education for the 1989-91 triennium. However, by the time the document was debated the decision to amalgamate had actually been taken. I made some comments on that subject in the debate on the document. </PARA>
<PARA> The document tells us about amalgamation and funding decisions and the amalgamation decisions in relation to Queensland are outlined on pages 11 and 12. On pages 31 and 32 the funding decisions that flowed from this are outlined. In that document the tables were given of capital funding over the next triennium for all tertiary institutions. I want to refer quickly to a couple of those and just contrast them with the treatment of the Gold Coast CAE. As I intend to refer in some detail to these tables, which I have shown to the Minister at the table, I seek to have them incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Campuses from the Brisbane College of Advanced Education-three of them, Carseldine, Kedron Park and Kelvin Grove-are to be retained as a separate teaching institution. The funding table will show that Carseldine had funds released for projects in 1990 and Kelvin Grove for projects in 1991. Darling Downs and Capricornia Institutes of Advanced Education are to become university colleges, formally sponsored by the University of Queensland. The document shows that funding for the Capricornia University College of Central Queensland for capital projects starting in 1989 and 1991 has been approved. The Queensland Conservatorium of Music is to become a member of the unified national system by merging with the University of Queensland. The document shows that funding for 1991 and 1992 was therefore approved. Queensland Agricultural College (QAC) will amalgamate with the University of Queensland. The table shows that Queensland Agricultural College therefore had capital funds approved for 1990. The table shows that the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education, which needed funds for 1989 and subsequent years because it was in a phase of growth, having been only recently established, was subject to review. That was because at the time of drawing up the document the amalgamation agreement had not been reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Commonwealth Government funding of nearly $8m for stage two of the Gold Coast CAE capital building program has been frozen since May of this year as a result of the requirement by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that the college amalgamate with another institution of higher education in order to become a member of the unified national system. In July 1989 the college council gave a clear undertaking to Mr Dawkins that it had entered a process of discussions and negotiations whereby it would become an affiliated university college of a major university in Brisbane, similar to the QAC and the other colleges to which I have referred. It also indicated that discussions were taking place with the University of Queensland and Griffith University. </PARA>
<PARA> In August the Gold Coast CAE council resolved that it would enter a phase of detailed and exclusive negotiations with the College of Griffith University and at that time advised the Senate of the University of Queensland that it did not wish to proceed. Since that time detailed discussions with Griffith University have proceeded in a very positive and affirmative manner and both councils are proceeding as quickly as possible to finalise a memorandum of agreement. All of this information was conveyed to the Minister and letters were also sent to him by the Queensland Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, the Chairman of the Gold Coast CAE Council and the Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University, confirming the state of these exclusive negotiations and seeking release of Commonwealth funds to stage 2 of the college's capital building program. Honourable members should remember that I am referring to a building program that is supposed to be under way for next year. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a response dated 23 August 1989 from the Department of Employment, Education and Training stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I am encouraged to learn that the College is engaged in discussions with Brisbane universities and that a firm agreement is not far off. The Department is not, however, in a position to release further funds to the project until arrangements for the College to become part of the unified national system are formalised in Heads of Agreement documentation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Gold Coast College of Advanced Education is the only tertiary institution in Australia that has had that condition put on it. The Minister's action in withholding capital funds, given the clear intentions of both institutions, is unwarranted and punitive and discriminates against the college. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Labor Party wants to win some votes in Queensland in the State election it should do something about that. We are not talking about silvertails, we are talking about the most rapidly growing area of Australia-an area with a population of a quarter of a million, projected to reach half a million by the year 2000 or shortly thereafter. We are not talking about wealthy people, we are talking about people who have been denied tertiary education for years, because they did not have a local institution and could not afford to take themselves off to Brisbane. One of the remarkable aspects of the Gold Coast CAE is the number of part time students, particularly women, who have enrolled in it-students who qualified years ago and were accepted by other tertiary institutions, but who could not afford to attend them. They are now undertaking tertiary education because the facility is there. Those who might have looked to that facility in the future will have that prospect denied by the Minister's action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister talks much in this place about the equity in the Government's programs, but the Minister is treating the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education in a particularly punitive way. In addition this condition has made it very difficult indeed for the college to enter into detailed negotiations with Griffith University. Far from giving a level playing field, it has put the college in a very particular position, quite different from that of any other tertiary institution in Australia, much less the rest of Queensland. I have sought information on this subject from the Minister; I have put questions on notice and I look forward to the reply. I note that my questions have not in any way been acknowledged so far. But the Labor Party will ignore this issue at its peril, because this institution serves not only the Gold Coast, but also areas such as Logan City, Beenleigh-Mr Goss's own electorate-and places in between the Gold Coast and Brisbane. It has introduced courses which are not available from other institutions within quite some distance. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I think that the Government needs to pay urgent attention to this matter. It is now out of the question for the college to embark on its capital program for 1989 and the program for 1990 is now also jeopardised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes I have I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Government and particularly the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) on the second edition of the Age Pension News which is in the process of being posted out to several hundred thousand age and service pensioners in Australia, both full and part pensioners. This is actually the second edition and, as I said, it is going out to all pensioners. It is the first time that age pensioners in Australia have been provided with full, comprehensible and easily read information on their pension rates, their entitlements, fringe benefits, the income test free area, the tax free area and how other income will affect their pensions. It is an excellent publication and for those Opposition members who have not read it, I suggest that they do so because they will probably learn something as well. From what I gather, the knowledge of the age pension system is very much lacking on Opposition benches. This publication includes information on rates; it also includes a lot of information about the measures coming out of the Government's retirement incomes package, some of which were announced in the April statement and some in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had the pleasure of being the only South Australian member of the retirement incomes task force which was set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the end of last year to go around Australia talking to groups of retired people and individuals about the retirement incomes system. One of the things which was made very evident to us, which was raised at every meeting that we went to, was the lack of information; the fact that these people did not have, or could not get without great difficulty, the most basic information about their pensions and entitlements and what would happen to their pensions in the case of other income. It was raised with us consistently that information was something they craved. In my experience in my own electorate, I have found that people want information and, until now, they have not been getting it. Pensioners, in particular, now get accurate and relevant information through the Age Pension News. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has, however, attacked this publication, suggesting that it is an irresponsible use of the taxpayers' money. Opposition members are, in fact, saying that age pensioners and service pensioners should not get any information-this information that they have craved for years and have not been getting. They say that this is an irresponsible use of taxpayers' money. We are providing them with the most basic information about their incomes on which, of course, they depend entirely. Of course, this publication is produced with taxpayers' money but some of these retired people, these pensioners, pay tax and if they do not pay it now they certainly have paid it in past. Why not use some of the tax that they have paid to give back to them information about their incomes. However, I gather that the Opposition prefers to keep them in the dark; it does not want them to know what their entitlements and pension rates are and what is happening in relation to their income. I know that the Opposition members are not in the habit of giving out this kind of information because people who live in neighbouring Liberal electorates ring my office asking for my pensioner information kit; thanking me for some advertisement I have put in the paper involving pension rates; and asking me for information about pensions because they say that I am the only person in the area who provides this. They say, `Mrs Harvey, I am very sorry I do not live in your electorate because nobody else around here is giving out any information at all about age pensions; about this income that we rely on'.</PARA>
<PARA> I would again like to thank the Minister for Social Security on behalf of my constituents and all the age and service pensioners of Australia for this excellent publication which includes not only information about pensions but also useful information for pre-retirees, people in their fifties and early sixties who are coming up to retirement and need to know now, well in advance of their retirement, the Government provisions for superannuation and, particularly, the tax treatment of pensions and superannuation which has been greatly liberalised by this Government. I am looking forward very much to the third edition of the Age Pension News. I am not sure when it will be coming out but I am sure that it will contain--</PARA>

I congratulate Mr Jim Kirk, the Chairman of the Australian Bicentennial Authority, on his acceptance of chairmanship of that company. I draw the attention of the House to supporting comments made at the launch by my colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) in his capacity as shadow Minister for primary industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 and 28 June this year, the second international meeting of representatives from 39 countries and 10 international organisations supporting nuclear weapon-free zones took place in Berlin under the sponsorship of the German Democratic Republic. Today I take the opportunity to congratulate the delegates at the conference on their establishment of the international liaison office for nuclear weapon-free zones. Membership is open to the participants of all countries and regular meetings will be held to exchange views, discuss proposals and note progress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the United Nations representative noted, there have been a number of important treaties prohibiting the deployment of nuclear weapons: notably, in the Antarctic, outer space and on the sea bed, as well as in Latin America with the Treaty of Tlatelolco and in the South Pacific with the Treaty of Rarotonga. The Australian delegate was Mr George Georges, a long time senator of our Parliament, who was representing the Australian Peace Committee. I would like to conclude by quoting from his speech to the conference. Referring to nuclear disarmament, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not sufficient to make significant statements at a high level using diplomatic terms. It is necessary to take your campaign to the understanding of ordinary people, as it is the mass mobilisation of people against the initiatives and programs of major nations which has led to now a disarmament process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly on a subject on which I felt I could no longer remain silent. I was stirred by the very tragic bus crash several days ago in which many people were killed. Unfortunately, major bus crashes are now becoming very much more a feature of our road statistics. I would like to suggest that the time is now overdue to make the fitting of seat belts compulsory in buses and the wearing of them compulsory in those buses which travel extensive distances. I do not, of course, refer to the sort of bus that goes around the town and in which people are permitted to stand up. Obviously, in that case it is not possible, but in those buses that travel longer distances along the highway and at speed, I believe that the fitting and wearing of seat belts should be compulsory. It is possible: there are buses which are available to charter which do provide that service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the great risks in an accident is, of course, of people and objects flying through the air and injuries being caused in that way. Seat belts are compulsory in motor vehicles and aircraft. If they are compulsory in aircraft and, apparently, are thought to serve some sort of purpose in the event of an accident, then they ought to be compulsory in buses. I would like to call on the Federal Government to raise the matter with meetings of appropriate State Ministers. Obviously it is something that State Ministers have to act upon, but it is something on which we need a national approach. I would like our national government to take the lead in this very important area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw the attention of the House to the way in which grave damage can be done to the reputation of respectable citizens living in particular suburbs by thoughtless remarks reported in the media. Recently the Adelaide News carried two reports quoting police officers who described the suburb of Hackham West in my electorate as `the Bronx'. Naturally, the residents of Hackham West, which is a pleasant garden suburb full of people anybody would be proud to have as neighbours, were outraged by this comparison-and rightly so. As I told a meeting of Hackham West residents a couple of weeks ago, I have visited the real South Bronx in New York: a dangerous, treeless, burnt out slum where violent crimes such as armed robberies and widespread drug dealing have driven decent citizens away. I can assure the House that there is simply no resemblance between the Bronx and the well-kept suburb of Hackham West, which is full of respectable citizens who do take a real pride in their area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The police officers quoted in the story enjoy a position of trust in the community and that is well-deserved, but that trust carries with it a heavy responsibility to be careful and accurate with their public statements. The people of Hackham West know that the Bronx label is wrong. So does anybody with any judgment. This is not the first time there have been sensationalist, inaccurate reports in the newspapers about Hackham West, but I certainly hope that it will be the last. The people of Hackham West are sick and tired of being misrepresented as a trouble spot in the social fabric of Adelaide. I want to assist their efforts to clear their good name in any way I can and raising this matter in the Parliament is, I hope, a step in that direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the granting of $130,000 for the construction of a new indoor sports centre at the Tabulam Aboriginal area in northern New South Wales. The centre will be the first of its kind in that region and will include a gymnasium and basketball facility. Undoubtedly it will be a building of great significance to the local area. The corporation concerned had heard of a similar project in another part of Australia and had the wisdom to apply for funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is, however, one serious difficulty. The general community of that area of northern New South Wales has now discovered that the centre will be for the exclusive use of Aboriginal people and it is causing a great deal of concern and dissatisfaction. Similar facilities do not exist for young people living in the near vicinity to undertake sport of the kind that will be possible in this new complex. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to consider the importance of making facilities of this kind available to all Australians. It seems to me very retrograde to have a restriction of this kind. Many of my constituents who seek a review of the Government's decision have approached those who advise the Government on these matters. I would strongly urge that, in the interests of better relations in the various sections of the community, no such restriction be applied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I express great concern over the outrageous refusal of the management of the Roxby Downs project to make public the annual environmental impact report. What is this uranium mining project hiding? While South Australian taxpayers have ploughed a massive $46m into the Roxby Downs project, to date a mere $640,000 has been received in royalties from uranium mined at Roxby, with a further $660,000 received from the copper deposits in the form of royalties. This is a disgraceful rip-off of taxpayers' money for a very dubious and environmentally dangerous mining venture. South Australian taxpayers are paying millions of dollars for the Roxby Downs secrecy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> South Australians were promised thousands of jobs at Roxby Downs, promises that ranged from 200,000 jobs to 30,000 jobs during construction to 15,000 permanent jobs. But in 1989, after many years of operation, there are only 870 jobs covering the project work force, with a further 220 indirect jobs for shopkeepers and so on. The indenture is a farce. If annual environmental impact reports are not released to the taxpaying public the Government must surely question its involvement in this project. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter which is very important to my electorate, and that is the Government's recent decision to allow the importation of frozen Canadian pork. The Canadian industry has certain diseases that do not exist in Australia and one is transmissible gastroenteritis, which could be transmitted to Australia via pig products. Of course, the Government says that although that is a remote possibility, the product would never get to the pigs because in Australia we have laws against the feeding of pig-swill. That would seem a reasonable argument to cut off any opportunity of infected pork getting to a pig.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I draw the Parliament's attention to the fact that on 4 October 1989 a resident of Canberra appeared before the Canberra Magistrates Court for driving offences. He applied for a special licence, having lost his licence, presumably, through drink driving, and claimed that he needed such a licence so he could continue to collect pig-swill from Chinese restaurants in the Australian Capital Territory. As Chinese restaurants probably sell more pork than any other meat, no doubt they would be very attracted to cut-price frozen pork coming from another country. Whilst the Government argues that there is no way that this disease, which would devastate the Australian pig industry, could be transferred from the plate, if you like, to the pigpen, that is not so. </PARA>

It would appear from the answer, and from a High Court ruling, that under some circumstances private law-abiding citizens can be liable for a damages suit against them by a person who, having entered their property, sustains an injury in the course of robbing the property and who commits an assault or other criminal act against the person or persons who own the residence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view, no person who enters premises for an illegal act-whether he is a professional criminal or not-has the right to the protection of the law for the carrying out of his functions. It would seem that under some circumstances the common law and the law of some States of Australia allow a person committing a criminal act to sue for damages an innocent person who is being robbed. I ask that that be re-examined and, if possible, eliminated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen reports of claims by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) and also by its soul mate, the Federal Opposition, that the capacity of the domestic aviation system is running at under 50 per cent. For instance, last weekend the Leader of the National Party of Australia was encouraging pilot propaganda about the number of flights being less than 10 per cent of the normal number, and that half of the passengers were being carried by the Royal Australian Air Force.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those claims are totally wrong. The fact is that capacity is now at over 50 per cent of normal demand and will increase considerably in the near future. Normally there are something like 40,000 seats required each day. At the present time we have available 21,000 seats a day, which is a little over 50 per cent. Of those 21,000 seats, 61 per cent are being provided by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines through their own aircraft and through wet leased aircraft-that is, foreign aircraft and foreign pilots. Fourteen per cent are being provided by Qantas Airways Ltd, 10 per cent by the Royal Australian Air Force, 9 per cent by international carriers, and 5 per cent by commuter airlines flying trunk routes. So clearly, current capacity is meeting more than 50 per cent of normal demand, and that capacity is about to increase dramatically through November. It will increase because of a number of additional wet leased aircraft and also because of the companies getting more of their own aircraft into the air.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment there are seven wet leased aircraft. Ansett has two America West aircraft; Australian has four aircraft and the two airlines share a Royal Brunei aircraft. The Royal Brunei aircraft is going out of action this week but there will be 12 additional wet leased aircraft coming on in the next couple of weeks. There are to be two 757 aircraft from the United Kingdom for Ansett and two additional 737s from America West. Australian will have five 737s, two 757s and one 727, all of which will be available by mid-November. What we will see, therefore, is a very dramatic surge of capacity in the course of the next few weeks, through the introduction of these additional wet leased aircraft and also the capacity of the companies to get more of their own aircraft into the air. That is increasing daily through their recruitment of fully trained foreign pilots, as a result of more pilots being trained here in Australia, and also, importantly, as a result of AFAP pilots increasingly coming back to work.</PARA>
<PARA> The pilots are returning to work despite the fact that there is intensive intimidation of those who do return. That intimidation has taken the form of telephone abuse, some of which I have heard from a tape recording taken from an answering device. It was obscene and extremely aggressive. There has been a lot of abuse of pilots at their homes by persons going to their homes; surveillance of pilots; the sending of wreaths to pilots who go back to work; and intimidation of pilots at the airport when they are about to get onto a plane and be in charge of passengers. Despite all of this, we get the Federation talking about concerns about safety. Not- withstanding all of that intimidation, pilots are increasingly coming back to work and the companies are therefore confident that through November they will move to a capacity of about 80 per cent of normal demand. They will shortly produce schedules for mid-November through the Christmas period and thereafter which will demonstrate that confidence.</PARA>
<PARA> This all has a significant message for those pilots who are still refusing to come back to work. Firstly, they should understand that the system is being restored despite the fact that they remain out. Through November capacity will lift to about 80 per cent of normal demand. The second point they should understand is that the longer they wait to come back, the less chance they have of getting a job. That is because they understand, I hope, that with the increased productivity coming from the new award, or from the new contracts which became the new award, several hundred fewer pilots will be needed by the airlines. New recruits are being employed, and they are taking up the positions. As well, some of their colleagues are coming back. So the longer those who are out stay out, the less chance they have of getting the remaining jobs. The third point that they should understand and understand well is that they should not live in any expectation of a negotiated settlement, despite the propaganda from the AFAP leaders that this is still a possibility. The fact is that there is no possibility of a negotiated settlement. The new award has been established and the Government and the airlines will not deviate from that new award-unlike the Opposition which, despite the fact that it says it would have a wages policy which would reduce inflation, wants to negotiate wage increases outside the wage guidelines. We are not like that. There will be no deviation from the awards. The only way that the pilots can return to work is by deciding individually to do so. The sooner they make that decision individually, the better off they will be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dundas must be getting frustrated. He was at this yesterday. The Opposition's surplus would be $700m less than that of the Government and the Opposition is committed to give away fiscal drag. So it has $5 billion worth of fiscal commitments, but the shadow Treasurer has the temerity to talk about a tighter fiscal policy. The second point the shadow Treasurer made was to change the wage determination process. That means he would move to an enterprise bargaining model. Does anybody believe that in an economy with any growth, particularly such as we have had, the enterprise bargaining model would do anything other than lift wage rates and inflation way beyond the levels at which they are now? But the shadow Treasurer would move quickly on a tighter fiscal policy which, by his own definition, is no tighter, and which is clearly weaker, and to a wage bargaining system. Today the Opposition has apologised for the pilots with their 30 per cent claim. According to the shadow Treasurer, all that will allow the Opposition to take the weight off monetary policy to reduce inflation. That is the essence of the Liberal policy. That is the essence of its policy document. When we comb through the rest, we see that that is it. The Opposition will have a weaker fiscal policy, but wage bargaining at enterprise level.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have been pleased to record on several occasions in the House, one of the proudest achievements of the Government has been the creation of some 1 1/2 million jobs during our period in office. That has meant not only an increase in the number of people in the work force, but also a dramatic reduction in the number of people who are actually registered as unemployed, a reduction from some 700,000 when we came to office to something like 500,000-a very significant drop indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to pursue the honourable member's question, it is worth looking a little at the composition of the unemployed to see where the most important reductions have occurred. We find a most dramatic reduction in the number of longer term unemployed people. It should not be necessary for me to remind the House that it was as a result of the recession induced by our opponents, the Opposition, that there was such a dramatic increase in the number of longer term unemployed people. In 1982 or thereabouts, about 47,000 people were registered as having been out of work for between 12 and 24 months. Within about a year that had more than doubled to between 108,000 and 109,000. Similarly, the same story occurred with those who had been unemployed for more than two years. As a result of the recession the numbers increased from about 44,000 to more than 100,000-more than doubling. That was a clear consequence of the policies which were pursued by our opponents.</PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government, the most dramatic reduction has occurred in the number of those who have been unemployed for between 12 and 24 months, a reduction from 108,000 to 47,000. The fall in those unemployed for more than 24 months has been from 100,000 or more to 67,000. That is, some 90,000 people for whom unemployment and unemployment benefit had become a way of life were rescued from that parlous, dismal and frustrating circumstance. But how did we get there? It was not just as a result of hoping. It was not a result of callously knocking people around by trying to haul them off the dole and then put them onto some other benefit. It was as a result of carefully targeting training programs more recently and, before that, job creation programs.</PARA>
<PARA> We have been particularly successful, through our training programs, in addressing the circumstances of the most needy-that is, those most in need of government assistance. We have helped them and, importantly, their families. These 90,000 people were not just individuals floating around somewhere in the ionosphere; they had been breadwinners, thrown on to the dole scrap heap by our opponents, and we had rescued them and their families with the programs we have pursued. Yet, what does the Opposition now say? It wants to rip $250m out of these very programs which have been so successful in helping these people. This is the most gutless policy that we can imagine any respectable political party ever embracing. The Opposition says it wants to save a few bob, so it picks on those people who are least able to look after themselves, the ones who are least able to complain. It is not only a question of political gutlessness on the Opposition's part, but it is also obviously a social disgrace that these people should be ignored and penalised by the Opposition. But it is even worse than that.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of a very new program that my colleague the Minister for Social Security and I have been putting into effect, that of Newstart, we have helped 20,000 people, specifically in this longer term unemployed category. Our opponents say, `We will keep Newstart, but we will get rid of Jobstart'. Little do they know that one of the most important ways of helping those people is through Jobstart. It wants to keep Newstart, but it wants to rip out of Newstart that part of it which is most effective in helping these long term unemployed. So the 20,000 people who are being encouraged back into the labour market, encouraged back into work, encouraged off the social security system, are the very ones whom the Opposition is intent on abandoning.</PARA>
<PARA> To take up the theme of the most recent answer given by my colleague the Treasurer, what solution does the Opposition offer? Again, we are back to wages policy. Not only will wages policy fix inflation, not only will wages policy fix interest rates, not only will wages policy fix the current account, but also wages policy will fix training! Somehow the Opposition's miraculous wages policy-and in order to believe in its wages policy one would have to believe in fairies-will give effect to these important objectives. Nobody believes that is true. Nobody believes that is possible. What we know now, as we have known in the past, is that the only recourse a Peacock government would have to economic policy is to grind the economy back into a recession, to tip onto the unemployment heap hundreds of thousands more people. As we have observed before, it takes a very special talent to drive this economy into reverse. It is perhaps the only talent that the Liberal and National parties have. Thankfully, it is a talent they will never, ever, be able to exercise again.</PARA>

The fact is that the Opposition has proposed to contract out services to government.

Something like 98 per cent of the construction of government buildings, up to $735m worth of work, is already contracted out. Forty per cent of project design, totalling $40m, is already contracted out. Also, approximately 90 per cent of removals and associated storage, to the extent of about $70m, is already contracted out. All of those areas, plus a number of other areas, are already contracted out.

What it has totally neglected to mention in its costings of this exercise is that the total contracting out of the other services, in addition to those already contracted out which I mentioned at the outset of this reply, would involve the retrenchment of something like 11,500 personnel, particularly in the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA>

That means that there would be a direct addition to Budget outlays of anything up to $600m in each of the first two years. So the Opposition cannot have it both ways. The Opposition either has to fund this massive retrenchment program by further savings or it must reduce the proposed tax rebates by, say, $600m per year in the first two years. So in addition to the $835m hole-that is, the savings shortfall that the Treasurer has already identified in the Opposition's misguided exercise-the Opposition now has to explain, if it wants to go ahead with contracting out, how it is going to find $1.2 billion, that is, $600m over each of the first couple of years, with which to fund its exercise. Otherwise, of course, the Opposition would not be able to proceed with contracting out, because it would lose a lot more money than it would propose to save.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position in regard to interest rates is, like so many things that come out of the Opposition, continually misrepresented. The position which the Treasurer has put, not only yesterday but in recent times, is exactly the same as I have put. It is that the economic condition confronting this country is basically one of too strong a level of demand. In that situation, it is necessary that the instruments of policy be appropriately set to reduce that level of demand. That level of demand has developed during this year at a higher rate than was anticipated by any economist in this country, government or private, going back to the beginning of this year or at the end of the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As distinct from those opposite in their period of government, when they showed a complete inability to conduct macro-economic policy in a way which would sustain a level of activity consistent with employment growth, what this Government has done, as has been said in answer by some of my Ministers previously today, is to have a rate of employment growth which is five times faster than the Opposition was able to generate in its seven years in office and more than twice as fast as that of the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> We are not going to throw away an economic policy which has allowed a massive reduction in unemployment in this country. At the same time, we are not going to allow a level of demand which will continue to impose unsustainable strains upon our external accounts. That is why the Treasurer and I have said in these circumstances that all arms of policy-monetary, wages and fiscal-will be set in a way which retains that proper balance. That has meant that monetary policy will remain tight for as long as is necessary to bring down the level of demand to that equilibrium sort of level which maintains growth; not to a level which is too high on the external account, but to one which is sufficiently high to enable employment to continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA> That means, as we see it, monetary policy staying tight into the future. We have both said, and I repeat, that monetary policy will not be kept tight one day longer than is necessary to achieve those objectives; nor will it be taken off one day earlier. We will do what we have shown ourselves capable of doing in our 6 1/2 years in government, which the Opposition was never able to do, and that is to keep growth going and to sustain employment. The Opposition was never able to do that. The one reason the Opposition was never able to do that, apart from its ideological obsession, was that, in technical terms, the Opposition never had available to it a wages policy. What happened was that when the pressure came on the then Prime Minister and his Treasurer, and those advising him-who have now been elevated to or deposed from, whichever way one wants to look at it, the front bench of the Liberal Party-did not have a wages policy. What happened in the event was that when the pressure came on the Opposition gave away the centralised wage fixing system and the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission said, `Okay, that is the government policy; we will give it away'.</PARA>
<PARA> So we do not have to have a theoretical exercise to examine the inadequacy of the Opposition's policy. We can simply say, `Cast your mind back to 1981; that is when you had exactly the position, the policy, that you are advocating again now'. The Opposition has not got the wit, the wisdom or the guts to learn from its own mistakes. It seeks to inflict upon the Australian people again what it inflicted upon them in 1981. What happened in 1981? Wages exploded by 18 per cent because the Opposition did not have a wage policy. The Opposition inflicted upon the Australian economy the worst recession in 50 years, with simultaneous double digit unemployment and double digit inflation, because it did not have a wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA> One would have thought that people with a modicum of intelligence would have said, `My God, if we did that with the previous policy, perhaps we ought to think of something better and different'. But no, the Opposition sat down in its cocoon for six years trying to think up a policy-we are all waiting for it-but at the end of it, the Opposition came out with exactly the same mishmash as before.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is saying, `We are saying to you, the members of the business community who have had now under the Labor Government a massive lift in the profit share from 11.2 per cent to 16.5 per cent and who, associated with that, have had the highest level of investment since statistics have been recorded, the highest proportion of gross domestic product going to investment ever, that we will take that away from the business community, we will take away the protection of a centralised wage system which has given record employment growth, record investment and record profit share, and expose you to an unregulated, uncontrolled wage bargaining system. We will give you pilots multiplied a thousand times. What we have said to the pilots is, ``You go for your 30 per cent. The Opposition has supported you from day one in that'', and any other group in the community which tries to exercise its industrial muscle would be fully entitled to do it under the Opposition'. Yet the Opposition has the temerity to get up here and talk about interest rates. One knows what would happen in that situation. If the Opposition allowed its unregulated wages policy to apply, the economy would collapse and interest rates would go through the roof.</PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, as we go into the period between now and the election, which we are all looking forward to, we will be able not simply to look at the theoretical inadequacy of the Opposition's policy but also to remind the people in Australia, who have got good memories in this matter, of what the Opposition inflicted upon them before. In its last 12 months in office another quarter of a million Australians were thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap. Who is to blame for that other than the Opposition? The Opposition could not blame anyone else. It could not blame the unions or the Industrial Relations Commission, because they were doing what the Opposition told them to do. The people of Australia will remember that. They will remember the record interest rates, record unemployment and record inflation which the previous Government's policies inflicted upon them and which those opposite inevitably would inflict upon them again if ever they get the opportunity. Fortunately, they will not get it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the House that the capital gains tax has played a major part in restoring fairness to the tax system. The proposition is this: why should somebody who gets his income from buying or selling property or shares pay no tax while millions of ordinary wage and salary earners automatically pay their tax each week? The capital gains area has shifted into the tax system to support productive investment whereas before its presence passive speculative investment was rewarded with capital gains free income. Now that income from capital gains is taxed in the same manner as any other form of income, investment is being channelled into those areas of economy which produce dynamic income-areas which produce employment, growth and activity. It is only through growth and activity that Australia's current account deficit will change. This measure has completely torn away the underpinnings of the tax avoidance industry which tried to turn all forms of income into capital gains type income so as to escape taxation. In other words, the whole tax avoidance industry was about changing the nature of income from income to capital to escape paying tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amount of revenue generated by the tax proves the point. This year $500m will be generated. Through the payment of capital gains tax, $500m will accrue to the Commonwealth. If it were to be abolished, as is proposed by the coalition, property prices would skyrocket, as investors would flood back into the market. In essence, any proposal to abolish the capital gains tax does not provide a plan for increasing investment or national savings. There is an argument, particularly from the coalition, that one should abolish the capital gains tax to increase investment in national savings. The converse would clearly be the case. Less than one per cent of individual taxpayers actually pay capital gains tax. I have had these figures checked. It would penalise the 99 per cent of individual taxpayers not liable to pay capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA> As recent media articles have pointed out, the significance of the proposal put by the coalition is this: the Opposition is making a commitment not only to abolish the Government's capital gains tax but also to backdate the effect of its abolition to 19 September 1985. The words `retrospective legislation' used to apply to a tax penalty applied retrospectively. This is a benefit applied retrospectively. It is reverse retrospectivity. It is a benefit, not a penalty, applied retrospectively. As a result, an enormous dislocation in the property and share markets would ensue as people with accrued capital gains sought to cash in on the windfall gains, gratis of the Leader of the Opposition. The billions of dollars of capital gains liability now sitting in the system unrealised would be realised if all of this property was cashed in on the market.</PARA>
<PARA> Who would be the grandaddy of those who would cash in? Of course, it is that champion of the working class, the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Elliott, the person who says that people receiving the unemployment benefit are bludgers. Next month Mr Elliott will be sitting on over 11 1/2 million bonus shares in Elders-IXL Ltd in respect of 15 1/2 million one cent paid ordinary shares directly held by him in the company, for which he has paid $155,000. What contingent capital gains attach to these bonus shares? What are they worth upon realisation? The answer is that Mr Elliott is sitting on a potential capital gain of about $35m. He has paid $155,000 for the shares and he is sitting on a potential gain of $35m. If a coalition government decided to remove the capital gains tax as from the date of the election, that gain would continue to be taxable, but it would not continue to be taxable if the retrospectivity applied because, as I understand it, these shares were taken out somewhere between June and September 1987. Come September 1992, if they were realised, there would be a contingent tax liability to the Commonwealth of about $17m. So a $17m benefit would accrue in this case to Mr Elliott by virtue of the fact that the measure is retrospective to 1985-not by virtue of the fact that the measure would be cancelled from the date of introduction by a coalition government, but by virtue of its retrospectivity.</PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that the so-called speculative gains tax would be backdated? Is it any wonder that the Opposition proposes a few dollars for families with kids and $17m for the Liberal Party's boss? That is the kind of equity we would see from a coalition government. One per cent of taxpayers are affected by capital gains tax, yet billions of dollars worth of unrealised capital gains liability would be handed back. No country in the world would have witnessed such a trans-fer of wealth because of one shabby decision by those opposite which would confer a retrospective benefit from 1985. The billions of dollars worth of unrealised capital gains contingent liability accruing in the name of the Commonwealth is to be given back, while at the same time the coalition would throw a couple of dollars by way of rebate for families. It would hand $17m to the Liberal Party's President and at the same time take the unemployed, beat them up and send them to Saint Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family and the Salvation Army. It would throw 100,000 people off the unemployment benefit queues.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of morality of those opposite. The Opposition's policy is not only immoral but also, as the Australian Financial Review said yesterday, it has no philosophical basis because it would lopside the tax system. The Opposition, instead of having a tax system which would support dynamic, income producing employing activity, would support capital gains free benefits for passive investments. How does the Opposition think that we can dig our way out of the current account hole that we are in if the nation is investing in blocks of flats and open space property instead of in companies or in any capital formation? The Opposition would not only lopside the tax system but also it wants to give its mates billions of dollars. It wants to give its principal mate, the bloke who runs the Liberal Party, a $17m benefit. Is it any wonder that the Opposition's shabby proposal is backdated to September 1985? Is it any wonder that it is doing what it has usually done-looking after the people who really bludge on Australian society, the people who do not pay their tax?</PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Prime Minister forthwith making a statement outlining the Government's plans to deal with the mounting economic crisis which is a direct result of this Government's economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason the Opposition moves this is quite clear. There is a sham approach to government in this country today. We are seeing a demonstrable failure of leadership by the current incumbent of the prime ministership. It is reflected in the failure of economic management, record taxes, record interest rates, high inflation, abysmal productivity and mounting foreign debt. It is also reflected in broken promises to the Australian people, in cave-ins to special interest groups and pandering to the trade union leadership. In short, a policy-bankrupt government, under this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), has lowered the living standards of most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last two days Australia's credit rating has been downgraded again. We have had yet another disastrous result in the balance of payments and another bad consumer price index number. To sum it up mildly and in brief, the Government's situation is bad and the economy is even worse. All the bravado and all the phoney confidence of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) cannot hide the fact that Australia is stuck in an abysmal malaise under this Labor Government. The Government has, simply put, given up governing. It has left us in Opposition to produce the only alternative for this nation. It can certainly be said that under Hawke and under Keating there is an absence of any plan, any set of policies, to get Australia out of the very mess their policies have produced. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just run through a few of the elements that sum up this Government today. First, it is a government of the big lie. There is a desperate, deliberate effort to hide the real truth from the Australian people. Second, there is an unremitting willingness to sacrifice the good of the country to the narrow partisan interests of the Australian Labor Party and its mates. Third, it is a government of cliques and mates. There is no Labor principle that this Prime Minister will not sacrifice in his desire to placate the rich and the powerful. Any principle that Labor held dear can be put to one side. Fourth, we have seen an unprecedented use of government power for purely partisan purposes. Fifth, we have seen the wholesale abuse of taxpayers' funds to try to advantage Labor's election prospects. Sixth, there has been an absolute failure to take action when it is needed in the national interest because of the fear of an election. All the bravado has led to putting it off and putting it off and putting it off. Seventh, we see both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer hurl what can only be described as vicious abuse at whoever incurs their wrath. Finally, this Prime Minister will find that the tactics of the quick fix, of stitching up the deal of the moment, the backroom operation, just will not wash with this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and again we have come in here and asked for policies. The change in the political landscape over the last couple of weeks has been very interesting. It is the Opposition that proposes; it has the blueprint and the policies. The Government has nothing. Ask this Government what its future policy is in any field of government administration. It does not have one. In not one arena will it be going to the election with a policy for the future. Honourable members actually heard it today out of the mouth of the Prime Minister: in the campaign he will be stressing what transpired in the past. We are looking forward; the Government can look back. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now going to pose a number of questions. We can answer every one but the Government cannot. Where is the Government's policy of tax relief for families? Will the Government commit itself to the discipline of forgoing the proceeds of bracket creep? Does the Government intend to reduce the size of the public sector? Where is the Government's oft talked of program of privatisation? Will the Government adopt our spending cuts? Will the Government liberalise the labour market and achieve long overdue productivity improvements? Where is the Government's policy on injecting foreign competition into coastal shipping? When will we see real action to clean up the waterfront? For example, after what we heard today, the Government should state its policy, not a few examples, on contracting out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot answer those questions other than in the negative. It has no blueprint for this nation, no policy to take it ahead. It is nothing but a fix it and stitch it up deal of the day government. What the Government actually does-bereft of any policy-is the dirtiest, crudest arrangement of the lot. It comes in here with its bombast, claims victory and then leaves the field. I can give a very tragic example of this. No Australian will be unmoved as we replay the words which the Prime Minister used as his centrepiece in the last election. The Government can do many things in this country but when in 1987 the Prime Minister claimed as the centrepiece of the election campaign that `no child will live in poverty in 1990', the day came when he must answer for that. Later in this House he walked away from that and replaced it, skidding over the words and saying, `What I meant was that no child need live in poverty'. The words were: `No child will live in poverty'. </PARA>

On Tuesday of this week the Executive Director of the Victorian Council of Social Service, Robert Hudson, put the truth. He said that approximately 500,000 children were still living in poverty. The Government walks in here, claims victory, walks away and leaves the field. After that disgraceful degree of rhetoric in that campaign, 500,000 people have been ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has the policies. It has the alternative. Instead of non-policies, it has detailed the most comprehensive economic program ever produced by an opposition in this country. We are offering real relief for families with children-the absolutely forgotten people. The Government has been dishing out the money here and there, but it has forgotten the millions and millions of hard-working men and women with kids. It has just overlooked them, other than milking them for more tax. That is why we have included child tax rebates, increased eligibility for the dependent spouse rebate and child-care tax rebates. Eric Risstrom, the Secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, has pointed out that a family on average weekly earnings with three children and a spouse earning $4,000 a year will pay approximately 20 per cent less tax under our policy. In anyone's terms, this is a substantial break for families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has given the historic commitment to return the proceeds of bracket creep. I would just like to pause on that topic. If the Government rejects the undertaking to return the proceeds of bracket creep-as it appears it would-there can be only one conclusion. The bottom line is that if it does not return the proceeds of bracket creep it is in favour of higher taxation. That leads people to say that the Liberal and National parties are the parties of low taxation. In addition, the Treasurer sought to besmirch-forgetting the countless thousands and thousands of small businessmen who will gather so much from us-the Opposition's proposal to abolish Labor's capital gains tax, which will reinvigorate small business and restore the needed incentive to save and invest. </PARA>

Australian business knows that it cannot do business with this Government unless, of course, it happens to be in bed with it and there are lots of examples of that. This Government's Budget strategy is totally blown out of the water. It is hooked on ad hoc decision-making. It has no policies. Its members break promises and they have turned into the greatest lot of political opportunists that have ever been seen. Let us have a look at the Budget strategy and the current account deficit. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) told us that it would be $18.5 billion. It is more likely to be $25 billion. I will bet that I am a bit closer to the real figure than the Treasurer is at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the Prime Minister's pilots dispute, the value of the tourist industry is down $3 billion. He has not revised the deficit figure to accept the fact that the wool clip is down $2 billion. The Wheat Board says that the value of the wheat crop is down $500m. Not one finger has been lifted by this Prime Minister or his Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to do anything about the ongoing live sheep dispute in the Middle East. That is another $200m. Beef exports will be down. The reality is that our exports will be down about $6 billion, and that will make the Treasurer's $18.5 billion estimate look very sick. The Government knows it but will not admit it. It will not admit it because it knows what it means for interest rates. While our exports go down, our interest rates go up, and so does our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at the Treasurer's inflation forecasts. He stood up in here today and took the soft option and stood by his forecast, knowing in his heart that he was a mile out, a country mile away from reality. The Australian people know exactly how far wrong he is. They know it every time they go to the supermarket; they know it every time their household budget gets squeezed because of this Government's policies. Look at the adhockery of it. Look at the way in which the Government made the decision in relation to Coronation Hill. I am told that that decision was 14 to 2 in favour of mining. What happened? The undertakings given to Broken Hill Propriety Co. Ltd and the $12m that it was encouraged to spend on the environmental impact study went out the window. That came hard on the heels of $60m to prop up the Prime Minister's fortunes in his own electorate, the so-called safe seat of Wills. </PARA>

A deal worth $200m was done with the banks to keep home interest rates down. But what about the poor Australians who borrow from building societies? What about them? Does the Government think that they do not vote Labor? That was treated with contempt in the electorate and it will cost the Government votes, not win votes for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then we saw that absolutely disgraceful deal with the airlines. That is the standard of this Government. The list goes on and on. The reality is that it has no economic policies. Government members do not come in here and speak, they do not address the Parliament, because they have nothing to say. They say not a word in defence of the mess that they have made of this country; not an alternative policy prescription. They have nowhere else to go except back to the rhetoric and hope like hell that a big advertising campaign will save their bacon. Nothing will save this Government. It is destined to be tossed out. Whenever it names the day-and it is inevitable-it will be consigned to the political scrap heap. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard the alternative Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of the country. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) have put forward their best effort at a parliamentary debate on the issue of the economy. These are the men who would be king and prince. These are the men who seriously invite you to place your economic future and your social future in their hands. This lacklustre high school debating team, which would make a better fist of it at any high school around this country, comes into this place, stung by the fact that they have been chided in the press and elsewhere for having the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) carry their economic debate in the course of this week, and try to present themselves as serious alternatives for governing this country in its hour of need. A high school debating team led recovery by the Liberal Party and the National Party is what we are being offered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think we have ever heard from a Leader of the Opposition a more pathetic speech on the economy, certainly in my time in this Parliament. This place was dignified by the sorts of contributions that were made by people such as Bill Hayden when he was Leader of the Opposition. It was also dignified by the types of contributions made by the previous Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when he debated economic matters in this place. He portrayed some understanding, and more than a little understanding, of exactly what it was he was dealing with and what he was asking the country to believe. What we got from the Leader of the Opposition was a melange of hyperbole. That is what we got from him-10 minutes of hyperbole on the economy. He says to people, `Trust us. Trust us to deliver on our promises. Trust us to deal with the problem of poverty when we are going to throw everyone who is on unemployment benefits onto the Smith Family. Trust us that we care about families. Trust us that we are the party of low taxation'. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the position when the Government came into office? The top taxation rate was 60c in the dollar. That is an example of the Liberals' low-taxing policy. Our top rate is now 13c under that. That was the Liberal Party's view of its credentials on low taxation. The Liberal Party comes in here and says, `We are the party of the family'. Tell that to the marines or, more particularly, tell that to the people who were thrown onto the dole queues by the Liberals in their last year of office when this country experienced record post-war unemployment. Who did the Liberal Party think they were-Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse? They were ordinary Australian families which were placed on the dole queue. This is the party that has produced a statement on families here and which, when invited to state whether or not it would support indexation of the family allowance benefit, as we have in our Budget, said, `No. we would not'. The Liberals know full well that that family allowance benefit, which goes very substantially not just to children in poverty but to ordinary wage earners, so high is its cut-out point, would be eroded in value by approximately 7 per cent per year unless indexation were to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> This bunch of unbelievably generous people with their unfunded family tax cuts! In the last Budget, this Government's tax cuts to a family of two amounted to some $24.30 per week. What is the Liberal Party offering? That is our last Budget, our policy. What is the Liberal Party offering? It is offering $5.05. Well, bully for it-the great family party that can produce a tax cut which is approximately one-quarter or less than one-quarter of the size of the tax cut which, in this last Budget we brought down, went to families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition asks us, `Where is your policy?' Our policies are in place. The question is, `What is your policy?' That is the only relevant question that needs to be directed to the Opposition in this regard. We have tight fiscal policies. On the one hand, the Opposition says that it wishes to produce a situation in which there is going to be some renewed fiscal discipline. On the other hand, it says, and repeats it in here, that it wants to automatically hand back, unfunded by any cuts in outlays, bracket creep in taxation. This is fiscal discipline that will get us over our problems! It is fiscal discipline that consists of an unfunded hand-back of $2 1/2 billion! We are invited to believe that this is the Opposition that will take fiscal discipline seriously, if and when it gets into office-as if that is its point of discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite then talk about poverty and children in poverty. What is the position of the Leader of the Opposition on the dependants of a person 10 months unemployed because of structural adjustments in a Wollongong steel mill or in one of the mines in central Queensland? What is the policy to support the family of that person if he is unable to get access to a training program and is unable to find employment? The Opposition's policy is to rely on the Smith Family. That is the position just adopted by the Opposition: The Smith Family will take care of them. Those opposite have the hide to come into this place and tell us that we are inadequate in our view on what we need to do to address the problem of children in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter-and the Liberals can run away from it, they can mouth off about it, lie and offer calumny about it as much as they like, but it nevertheless remains the case-is that our policies on family allowance supplement have been analysed by most of the social security organisations, including the Australian Council of Social Service, and including people such as Bishop Hollingworth, who say that these polices have massively increased the benefit for families in poverty and substantially increased the benefit to low and middle income families, who themselves are the beneficiaries of our $24 tax cut, as opposed to the Opposition's $5 tax cut-and that benefit is indexed-and those people have had the honesty to say that in so far as poverty is in itself a factor of income-of course, it is not the only factor but it is the factor that governments can most readily address-then this Government has addressed it. Even though they are lobby organisations wishing to assert that governments should do more, they have had the honesty to come into the public forum and say that the Government, through its family allowance supplement, through its taxation policies which benefit lower income earners, is addressing the area of real need. The Opposition is suggesting that the most unfortunate sections of the community should approach the Smith Family. </PARA>
<PARA> We can trust the Liberals to deliver on one thing in this so-called comprehensive statement, which conceded the commonsense of the Government's fiscal policy and which contained nothing about what the Opposition would do about wages and interest rates. What would this particular party do in this area? It would not continue our proposals on indexation. What could the community really trust it on? No indexation, and one other thing-delivering to its rich mates. The people of Australia can absolutely rely on the Liberals to make the benefit of their promise on the capital gains tax retrospective to 1985. Why? Because the President of the Liberal Party will be a $15m beneficiary of it. People can depend upon it that those people who will be putting money into the Liberal Party's campaign will be insisting and directing that whatever else is done, and nothing-because one cannot trust them-will be done on anything else, but whatever portion of that is implemented, whatever the state of interest rates, the economy or wages policy, it will be absolutely certain that the promise on the capital gains tax will be delivered with a vengeance. The long term future of the Liberal Party with its rich mates will depend upon its credibility in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a disgrace. Given the nature of the President of the Liberal Party, his situation in our society and his influence both in the election of the current Liberal leader and in his direction over current policy, it is a disgrace that such a personal benefit should be incorporated within Liberal Party policy in that retrospective way. Those opposite are a shameless pack of flannellers, and they will not be elected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I was wondering whether I could address a question to you, although I do not expect you to answer it at the moment. Could you examine the question of an alteration to yesterday's Hansard relating to Question Time? You will recall that I asked a question of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) about a former staff member of his and, in particular, his declarations of pecuniary interests. When speaking of his former staff member, the Minister for Administrative Services said in his answer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He did not declare any pecuniary interest of this nature with regard to interests in this consultancy or any other consultancy. Those pecuniary interest forms were regularly updated. A copy of such a form, which was submitted by Mr Ross at a time not long before he resigned late in 1987 from my employment, was located and handed over or drawn to the attention of the Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the expression `was located and handed over or drawn to the attention of the Federal Police'. That is my recollection of what was said, and I notice that those words are reported in the Canberra Times, for instance. However, when one looks at the transcript-the green, as it were-one finds that the words `handed over or' have been struck out and, indeed, the printed version of yesterday's Hansard records-without going over all the words again-that the Minister's proposition is that the return was located and drawn to the attention of the Federal Police. That means that the effect of that answer has been entirely altered. Whereas formerly it was said, amongst other things, that the return had actually been handed over to-namely, given to-the police, that phrase has been removed from the final edition of the Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I would be grateful, therefore, if you would investigate the matter and make some inquiries as to how the Hansard record of what was clearly said came to be altered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, with regard to the matter the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) has raised, I am aware that when I was on my feet yesterday I said that a pecuniary interest declaration had been located and handed over-stop-drawn to the attention of the Federal Police. I did that because I knew that we had drawn their attention to it. As I was thinking while I was speaking, I did not totally recall handing it over to them. I have just been up to my office and questioned my senior staff.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purposes of this Bill are to amend the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 to implement decisions in the recent Budget on Commonwealth programs for schools in 1990 and to supplement for cost increases grants already appropriated for schools programs for 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the Government's rural statement in April 1989, there are also changes to improve the educational access of rural students. This Bill provides for government and non-government organisations operating hostels providing accommodation for rural students to apply for funding under the general element of the capital grants program. It also provides for the establishment of a rural hostels program to provide assistance to such hostels with an initial allocation in 1990 of $1m. Eligibility under the new arrivals element of the English as a second language program is also being broadened. This Bill provides that students enrolling in the first formal year of primary school will be eligible for new arrivals funding where they arrived in Australia up to eighteen months previously. The Bill also amends the definition of full fee paying overseas students so that it applies to primary as well as secondary students. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill appropriates an estimated $2,212m for schools programs in 1990, and provides for additional funds for 1989 programs in line with cost supplementation arrangements to bring total funding for 1989 programs to an estimated $2,055m. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act which provides funding for the 1989-91 triennium. The Bill provides funding for higher education institutions for 1992 amounting to $2,865m in accordance with the rolling triennial funding arrangements. It takes account of the Government decision to provide funding of $34m for an additional 4,000 intakes in 1992 and additional funding for capital projects in 1992 to bring the total annual funding for major works in 1992 to $198m. These measures honour the Government's commitment announced in the White Paper for the continued expansion of higher education to provide for a more highly skilled and educated Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> These funds will allow the Government to make early decisions on new capital projects to commence in 1992 in order to facilitate the proper planning of these developments. Many of these capital projects will take into account mergers which have occurred, or are occurring, in many parts of the country. In relation to one of those mergers, that between the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University, I take the opportunity to announce a major new development which will become possible should the merger be given legislative effect. Agriculture is a vital area of study for Western Australia but the facilities at the Crawley campus have for some time been inadequate. The merger provides the opportunity for agriculture to be relocated to the Murdoch campus which already offers veterinary science as well as having developed a very strong capacity in the physical and biological sciences. This is one of the earliest examples of the advantages which can arise from mergers. To assist with the planning for this development the Government will fund the relocation of agriculture, currently estimated to cost $17m, commencing in 1992, and will also fund other capital projects consistent with the new university's priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased funding is being provided for 1990 and 1991 amounting to some $13m in accordance with the Government's cost supplementation arrangements. The Bill also provides for the incorporation of Australian Research Council programs into the Act in line with the Government's decision to fund these programs on a rolling triennial basis. It includes additional amounts for new research initiatives of $150m over the 1990-92 triennium announced by the Government in its Science and Technology for Australia statement in May 1989. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973, which provides the legislative basis for Austudy and the postgraduate awards scheme, to enhance the debt recovery regime for outstanding student assistance debts. It contains two main measures. First, it will extend the application of existing provisions of the Student Assistance Act relating to the prevention of fraud and the recovery of overpayments; the provisions concern matters such as garnishee action to recover debts incurred under the Act and the penalties for false statements in connection with applications made under the Act. The provisions will be extended to apply to the non-legislated student assistance schemes, namely the assistance for isolated children, Abstudy and Aboriginal overseas study award schemes. To further streamline processing debts under these schemes, action to waive or write off such debts will be taken under the Student Assistance Act, rather than by the exercise of a delegation under the Audit Act as is currently the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill provides that interest is to become payable on outstanding debts, whether incurred under Austudy or postgraduate awards or under one of the non-legislated schemes. Interest will commence three months after a debtor has been advised of the debt. However, provision is made for the Department to approve an interest-free period in cases of financial hardship, particularly where the debtor has come to an arrangement to repay the debt by instalments. The Bill would apply simple interest accruing on a daily basis. The regulations will specify a formula giving a commercially comparable rate of interest. The intention is that the recovery of student assistance debts should proceed in a manner comparable to normal commercial practice. This must include the application of a commercially comparable rate of interest so that debtors do not effectively have an interest-free loan from the public purse. Having said this, I should perhaps add that the introduction of an interest provision will affect only recalcitrant debtors who do not settle their debts or come to some arrangement with the Department within three months of having been advised of the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also enable ministerial guidelines to be set giving guidance in the exercise of various administrative powers under the Student Assistance Act. Action will be taken as soon as possible to set guidelines relating to the waiver, writing off and recovery by instalments of overpayments, and to the approval of interest-free periods. In view of the proposed guidelines, the Bill seeks to extend the range of officers to whom ministerial powers under the Act may be delegated. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant number of amendments have been made to the Student Assistance Act since its enactment over 16 years ago, and the Bill therefore proposes to renumber the Act so that all provisions will now be numbered sequentially. I have referred to the postgraduate awards scheme as coming under the Student Assistance Act. The Government is significantly improving the research component of this scheme by injecting more money and devolving the administration of research awards to individual institutions. As a result of the devolution, postgraduate research awards are ceasing to be administered under the Student Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the financial impact of the proposed measures. It is estimated that the Bill will result in increased debt recovery of approximately $5m over the two years 1990-91 and 1991-92. The effect may then lessen, reflecting the resolution of existing debts and the introduction of more effective fraud control. I would add that the significance of the interest provision is essentially as a deterrent. The actual amount to be collected by way of interest on outstanding debts is estimated to be of the order of $100,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would emphasise that the changes contained in this Bill are an integral part of an overall package of measures addressing the question of student assistance fraud. This package also includes front-end controls and other administrative measures. An important effect of the package will be an increased awareness of the Commonwealth's determination to address the problems of fraud and debt recovery in the area of student assistance. I present the explana-tory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The policy is a long term commitment towards the attainment of equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in access to, participation in and outcome from education. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy is a concerted effort to address the educational needs of Aboriginal people, by cooperatively directing the strategies of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories, non-government education authorities and educational institutions, to achieving, firstly, involvement of Aboriginal people in educational decision-making; secondly, equality of access to educational services; and, thirdly, equitable and appropriate educational outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to enter into bilateral agreements with State and Territory governments, higher education institutions, non-government school systems and other institutions over objectives, strategies, resources and joint monitoring arrangements consistent with the national policy. The Bill will provide a legislative basis for a consolidated program and funding approach that is supplementary to mainstream Commonwealth education funding through an Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has allocated a total of $266m as its commitment to the national policy over the next three years.

<PARA>The purpose of the University of Canberra Bill is to establish a University of Canberra under the sponsorship of Monash University to replace the Canberra College of Advanced Education. Following the release in July 1988 of the White Paper which provided the blue-print for wide-ranging reforms in higher education, a steering committee chaired by the former Chairman of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, Mr Hudson, was established to advise on the amalgamation of the three Canberra higher education institutions. Acting on the recommendations of the steering committee, the Government introduced the Australian National University Bill 1988 into Parliament in November 1988. Subsequently, the Government agreed to a request from the incoming Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government to defer consideration of the Bill to enable the new Assembly to provide advice on the structure of higher education in the Territory. A select committee of the ACT Assembly reported in July 1989 recommending that the amalgamation of the three institutions not proceed at this stage but that a University of Canberra be established to replace the Canberra College of Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA> The University will be established under the sponsorship of Monash University in accordance with an agreement between the two institutions. The report of the Task Force on Amalgamations in Higher Education chaired by the Chairman of the Higher Education Council, Dr Ramsey, released in April 1989, proposed that the sponsorship of former institutions in the advanced education sector by existing universities is an appropriate model for the development of these institutions as full members of the unified national system. Institutions in other States have adopted this model. The Government recognises that there is no single model that is applicable for achieving its objectives of a stronger and more viable higher education system. The establishment of the University of Canberra represents a positive step in the development of higher education in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement provides for the participation of Monash University in a wide range of activities undertaken by the new University. The sponsoring institution will be represented on the council and the academic board as well as on various committees of the University. Development of graduate programs and appointment of professional and equivalent staff will be subject to approval by Monash University during the sponsorship period. The two institutions will promote academic articulation across a range of activities, including student and staff exchanges, integrated professional awards, joint doctoral supervision and joint research projects. particular consideration will be given to the needs of the ACT community. The agreement will operate for an initial period of three years. It is envisaged that the sponsorship arrangements will be subject to external review at the end of this period. The funding for the University of Canberra will be assessed on the same basis as all higher education institutions. The Government will provide funding of $300,000 to Monash University over the next three years to contribute towards the costs incurred in the sponsorship arrangement.

<PARA>The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend various Commonwealth Acts as a consequence of provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989-the Act which amends the Migration Act 1958 which is the principal Act. These consequential amendments are in addition to those matters included in schedule 6 of the Amendment Act. The Bill also makes a number of other minor amendments to the amendment Act. These amendments are made to the amendment Act rather than to the principal Act so as to avoid any difficulty which might otherwise arise with the operation of the renumbering provisions of the amendment Act. The amendments will commence immediately before the commencement of the amendment Act itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the amendments update terminology, make slight changes in wording or correct internal references within the amendment Act. It is inevitable in the case of legislation as complex as the amendment Act that some minor corrections will be necessary. Several amendments merit brief comment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that regulations may be made that will prescribe matters to be considered in the making of decisions concerning discretionary deportation orders, the revocation of those orders and the requirement that an illegal entrant depart Australia. In addition, regulations may be made which specify procedures to be followed in determining the liability of an illegal entrant to mandatory deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> During the passage of the amendment Act concerns were expressed by the Opposition that it was possible under its provisions that a person recognised by Australia as a refugee could unintentionally be expelled by being deported or by being required to depart. I gave assurances that this would not be allowed to occur. To ensure that those legitimate concerns by the Opposition are put to rest and my assurances are kept, a provision is made for the procedures and the criteria for the exercise of the powers of expulsion to be prescribed in the regulations. The regulations will also reaffirm the essential feature of the amendment Act, namely the separation of processes of selection-that is, the grant of visas and entry permits-from the processes of expulsion; that is, the exercise of the powers of deportation and the requirement to depart. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also reinserts provisions allowing for regulations imposing fees for English language tests as previously provided for in the Migration Act. These provisions were previously inadvertently omitted. To further streamline passenger processing at airports, it is necessary to establish a regime whereby visas can be endorsed to recognise a person as being a person who without the endorsement would become an illegal entrant upon entry. Such persons are typically those who have been deported from Australia or another country, who are suffering from a prescribed disease or physical or mental condition, or who have been imprisoned for more than one year as a result of criminal convictions. Without this regime valuable resources are wasted in confirming the endorsement of the overseas post, and in the issuing of a specially endorsed entry permit which merely duplicates the information contained on the visa. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment is necessary as a result of the regulation drafting necessary to complement the amendment Act. To ensure the proper operation of the regulations relating to the points system, it is necessary to ensure the regulation making power is sufficiently broad. An amendment is also necessary to ensure that non-migrant visas can be issued over the counter upon application, and not be delayed by the general requirement to be imposed on pooled applications for migrant entry to notify of any material changes of circumstances since the time of application. Lastly, the Bill establishes that certain proof provisions apply in criminal deportation proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as well as in proceedings in a court or the Immigration Review Tribunal. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is pleased that the amendment we proposed to the Banking Legislation Amendment Bill has been accepted by the Government. We were concerned that the provisions in the Bill which provide the Reserve Bank of Australia with powers of investigation into the books, accounts and transactions of banks, and particularly its proposed ability to obtain information from a bank concerning individual customers where that is required for prudential supervisory purposes, did not safeguard the privacy of that information and the use of that information by Reserve Bank officials and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment that we proposed was in two parts. Firstly, it sought to address those privacy concerns at least to the extent that the Governor of the Reserve Bank will have to satisfy himself that information on an individual bank or an individual client of a bank is essential to the Reserve Bank fulfilling its obligations of prudential supervision. Secondly, we inserted a provision which would direct the Reserve Bank to include in its annual report details of the use of those investigative powers while protecting the identity of those who had been subject to investigation. We are delighted that the Government has decided to accept that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make particular reference to the tragic bus accident which occurred in my electorate last Friday. The whole of Australia has been shocked by this tragedy. Expressions of sympathy to the bereaved and expressions of hope to those who are still recovering from the accident and many other aspects that arise from that accident deserve some mention in this chamber. Tomorrow in Christ Church Cathedral, Grafton, there will be a memorial service to the deceased. That service has been arranged by the Ministers Fraternal representing the churches of the immediate vicinity. It will be a very solemn occasion, reflecting the feelings of the community in that area but, at the same time, will take into account the great concern of the wider community of Australia. I am sure that all members of the House would want to be aware of this service and would want to spare a thought for this rather solemn and sad occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate to refer to this tragedy during the debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill because of the Bill's relationship to two issues that are uppermost in people's minds throughout Australia as a consequence of the worst bus accident yet to occur on Australian roads. I refer, of course, to the issue of road safety and to the issue of funding for the improvement and upgrading of Australia's road system. It is not perhaps the occasion to traverse the details of the reasons for the accident; suffice it to say that speed was involved and perhaps aspects touching very closely upon the issues of road safety. </PARA>
<PARA> I was present at the scene for a good deal of last Friday, and I observed much of the research that was done by a special investigation team from the New South Wales Police Department. I briefly mention the tremendous effort of the police, the State emergency services, the ambulance service, the hospitals, the rescue helicopter crews, the volunteers from many sections of the community and, of course, the concerned citizens who tried to assist at the scene of the horrific accident. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate mention has already been made of road safety, road funding and road standards. The statistics show that the Pacific Highway is, unfortunately, the scene of far too many road accidents. The statistics show a growing incidence of road accidents involving semi-trailers and other heavy vehicles, such as passenger buses, as well as passenger vehicles. The level of road funding, the capacity of the State to contribute to road funding and the level of funding provided by the Federal Government undoubtedly must be of concern. The fall in the amount of funds provided by the Federal Government from fuel tax is a matter of very great concern to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last five years we have seen a fall in real dollar terms in the amount of funds provided by the Federal Government from fuel tax revenue. There has been about a 30 per cent fall. This figure is quite inadequate in view of the increasing usage of roads and the demands that are made upon the road system throughout Australia. I refer in particular to the demands placed on the Pacific Highway, which provides the link between Sydney and Brisbane and which, of course, attracts the heaviest volume of traffic. I appeal today to the Government to review the funds allocated for that specific purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government has taken some initiatives in this area since taking office. It has introduced a special fuel tax and has announced some allocations of funds for the Pacific Highway. But in the last allocation of funds announced by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) only a very small amount in real funds was provided for the upgrading of the Pacific Highway. My colleagues the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) and the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), through whose electorates the highway is located, have expressed concern at every opportunity about the paucity of Federal funding for roads being provided. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon I refer particularly to the section of the highway between Grafton and the Queensland border. The location of last week's road accident was at Cowper, just north of Grafton. In the vicinity of that section of the highway the general alignment of the highway is totally inadequate for the traffic volume. The last allocations of road funding were spread over a period of three years and were spent on major work near the Queensland border-a bypass, a bridge and some realignment. The allocation of a very small sum of money in the vicinity of the location of the recent road accident, north of Swan Creek near Grafton, enables the construction process to go ahead only at snail's pace. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, who was in the chamber earlier, is not here now, because I want to raise an issue to which I hope he will respond at the appropriate time. My question concerns the intention of the Government regarding further allocations of funding for roads in the current financial year for that section of the Pacific Highway. It is well known, and it has been thoroughly established, that there are inadequate passing lanes on the highway and that there is a very unsatisfactory road alignment. The highway is unable to carry safely the present traffic volume, in particular the heavy transports which are using that highway in increasing numbers, and buses which are using the highway in vastly increased numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> A positive plan is required. The Opposition has taken this matter seriously not only in recent weeks. Preceding the recent road accident the shadow Minister for land transport and shipping, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), visited that area and gave what I would regard as appropriate encouragement to the local government authorities, the councils and the State Government in the matter of road funding in the future. However, the present Government in its last Budget allocated an increase in road funding of only $120m over the previous year's figure for the whole of Australia. If one takes into account the prospects of that additional funding being in any way a figure that relates to need, one finds that we in this country are in very unfortunate circumstances in the matter of road funding. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, petrol taxation has increased from 6.155c per litre in 1983 to the astronomical figure of 23.15c. However, the share of that tax which is allocated to road funding has not increased in any commensurate proportion. The Government is taking a huge amount of revenue in the form of fuel tax and it is not returning an adequate amount to the road system. That is a tragedy for industry, for tourism and for the ordinary motorist who wishes to use the roads. It is a tragedy for every family which finds it necessary to use the road system and who venture onto the roads with trepidation, concerned about the risk of accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of my speech I alluded to the issue of road safety. It was at the advocacy of this Government that an increase in the speed limit for heavy vehicles from 90 to 100 kilometres an hour was introduced. I believe that that was a retrograde step. There was no identification of the roads upon which it was considered safe to travel at that speed. It is certainly not a safe speed at which to travel on the Pacific Highway. It is not a safe speed at which to travel on many of the arterial roads on which that speed is now permitted. I urge that there be a follow-up to the Minister's announcement of yesterday or earlier today that further consideration is being given by the Federal Government to the issue of speed limits, the introduction of the use of appropriate equipment, such as tachographs and speed control mechanisms on heavy vehicles, in order to try to minimise the carnage on our roads. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that this issue is of major concern to most Australians today. It is time that this Government reviewed the situation with appropriate concern. There is no doubt that the problem can be solved over time with an effective program of road upgrading and an effective approach to the needs of major roads such as the Pacific Highway. I urge that, under this particular provision of funding, account be taken of the limitations on the New South Wales State Government in attending to the very important issue to which I have referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 is to create a national system of control over the manufacture, evaluation and marketing of therapeutic goods and devices for both export and domestic consumption. The accompanying piece of legislation, the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill 1989, relates to the application of a range of fees and charges for the registration and evaluation of therapeutic goods and devices, and for the licensing of manufacturers and inspections under codes of good manufacturing practice. For the purposes of this package of legislation, the definition of `therapeutic goods' is a very wide one and includes prescription and non-prescription medications, vitamin, mineral and dietary supplements, herbal and homoeopathic preparations, as well as medical devices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major parts of the Therapeutic Goods Bill relate to the determination of standards for therapeutic goods, the establishment of an Australian register of therapeutic goods approved for import, export or supply, and the licensing of Australian manufacturers of therapeutic goods. The proposed date of commencement of the legislation is 1 March 1990 with fees and charges to be collected from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In principle, both the Opposition and the therapeutic goods industry support the broad objectives of the Therapeutic Goods Bill. There are a number of obvious advantages to the community and the therapeutic goods industry in having a unified system of controls over therapeutic products and their advertising. There is no argument about the value of ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods and the need to protect the public interest in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us in this House, even the youngest of us, are old enough to know about the havoc wrought by thalidomide, for example. On the other hand, the Opposition shares a range of concerns expressed by the industry in relation to the Bills and the regulations which will underpin them. These matters include: doubts as to whether a national system of controls is achievable in this way; whether the Government's proposals contain adequate checks, balances and avenues of appeal; whether the codes of good manufacturing practice are excessive and unreasonable on a benefit to risk basis; the damage which may be done to the manufacturing and export industry by the proposed fees and charges; and finally the fact that the whole structure is to be underpinned by regulations which have not yet been finalised let alone made available to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for reasons such as these that the Opposition has resolved that it will oppose the legislation despite the fact that the Bills themselves are fairly innocuous. The Therapeutic Goods Bill amounts to a motherhood statement. The accompanying regulations, which have not been made available to the Parliament, will be the vehicle for carrying the real thrust of the Government's intent. From our point of view the Government has got things around the wrong way. Normally regulations are attendant upon legislation and serve to tidy up administrative loose ends and plug the odd gap here or there. In this case, however, the legislation is being used as little more than an enabling tool which paves the way for the Government to bring in the big guns by way of regulation. We simply cannot be expected to accept bland enabling legislation, thereby signing what amounts effectively to a blank cheque. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the Government, at least in the health area, has learnt nothing from its experience with the vocational register for general practitioners which the Parliament refused to accept without first having an opportunity to consider the relevant regulations. The same situation exists here, which is why we intend to move in the Senate for the legislation and regulations to be referred at the same time to the legislative and general purpose Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. In the event that this move is unsuccessful we will look to amendments and to the possible disallowance of the regulations if we find them unsatisfactory when finally we get them. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of the Government's proposals on the future of the therapeutic goods industry is something which must not be underestimated or ignored. This industry is an increasingly important part of Australia's overall manufacturing and export effort. The significance of just one part of it is underscored in comments by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in a foreword to the 1988 Austrade document on the Australian scientific and medical device industry. Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA>As an industry sector you typify the new direction manufacturing must take, in that you are technology and skill based; there is a high level of investment in research and development; you exhibit a real entrepreneurial flair; exports represent a high proportion of output. In addition, you are establishing for Australia a particularly high reputation for quality and reliability for these technically sophisticated products. This is at a time when it is essential that the country lifts its whole image abroad if we are to make real headway in achieving a quantum leap in exports of high value added manufactures and related services. </PARA>
<PARA>That is how Senator Button sees the industry. The danger is, however, that these proposals, presented to the House by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) could serve to undermine the very achievements so warmly applauded by Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the first broad area of concern-whether a national system of registration and control is attainable in the way the Government now proposes. The Government intends to draw upon broad heads of power under the Constitution, including the corporations power, to create a national system. Clearly, unless all the States and Territories cooperate, the proposed system for the national registration of therapeutic goods will be unworkable. The Victorian Government has apparently indicated that it is willing to look at repealing its own system of registration but will not do so until the spring 1990 parliamentary session. This means that if the national system embodied in this legislation comes into effect in March 1990, as the Commonwealth intends, there will be dual registration in Victoria for quite some time. This has grave consequences for the industry, which wants a guarantee that the system will be implemented on a truly national basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Housing and Aged Care, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is expected that the States and Territories will implement complementary legislation  . . . Model legislation will be presented to the States and Territories which would effect this. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that at the conclusion of this debate the Minister will be able to inform the House what progress is being made with regard to complementary State legislation. This is important as there are good grounds for arguing that Victoria should repeal its legislation and all States and Territories should have complementary legislation in place when this Bill comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the subject of whether or not the legislation contains adequate checks, balances and avenues of appeal. As I have said, the legislation provides for the application of corporations powers by the Commonwealth to replace existing State and Territory jurisdictions, and in principle neither the Opposition nor the industry objects to this. </PARA>
<PARA> There are concerns, though, that the Commonwealth powers are so far-reaching that without suitable controls and public accountability the industry may be left with virtually no say in the running of its own businesses. For example, it is the Commonwealth's intention that the recommendations of the Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) should be adopted as the poisons standard. In effect, this will give the NHMRC recommendations the force of law. </PARA>
<PARA> While the NHMRC is an extremely important body carrying out an extensive range of highly respected activities, it must be recognised that it exists pursuant to an Order in Council. In this context, the industry has expressed serious concerns about its lack of public accountability. In addition, the industry does not consider the NHMRC to be representative of its particular interests, industry itself having no representative on that body. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time, industry has input into and representation on State poisons advisory committees, but bodies such as this will be disbanded with the implementation of the proposed national therapeutic goods system. There are, therefore, good grounds for concern that the adoption of the NHMRC recommendations will deny the industry formal representation on poisons scheduling decisions and deprive it of any effective avenue of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> Also on the subject of appeals, clause 60 of the Therapeutic Goods Bill provides for decisions made under the Bill to be reviewed by the Minister and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There are two things to say about this. First, clause 60, subsection 5 requires the Minister to give applicants written notice of the outcome of his reconsideration of a decision, but does not require him to provide a statement of reasons for that decision unless requested to do so by the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> This hardly seems fair or reasonable. One would think that it would be sound commonsense and administratively more efficient to provide the reasons for the decision along with that decision rather than simply advise people that they should make a further application if they want to find out why their first one was unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> But leaving that aside, the second appeals issue relates to the role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The industry believes that, in view of the technical nature of matters arising from a request for a review of a decision on a product, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is an inappropriate body to hear such appeals. An appeals body which includes industry representatives is the industry's preferred alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the matter of regulation and control. What is at issue here is whether the existing control mechanisms are efficient and whether their proposed intensification is warranted. This matter was addressed by the Business Regulation Review Unit (BRRU) in its Information Paper No. 13 of March 1989 entitled Therapeutic Goods Regulation. On page iii of this document the BRRU said:</PARA>
<PARA>Efficiency requires a balancing of risks of harm from a treatment against other risks resulting from delays or denials of access to more effective treatment and factoring in regulatory costs involved. Any controls exercised by the authorities must be capable of achieving the objective sought. It is observed that a number of long standing difficulties in the management of the therapeutic goods program remain. The increased regulation proposed, particularly surveillance of a wider range of goods, may exacerbate rather than resolve these problems by reversing recent moves towards more risk related approaches. </PARA>
<PARA>These views expressed by the BRRU are mirrored in the numerous submissions that I have received as the shadow Minister for health from individual companies and groups around the country within the therapeutic goods industry. Based on the current and past performance of the therapeutic goods program of the Department of Community Services and Health there are clear grounds for questioning the Department's ability to deliver the promised improvements in the evaluation and regulatory process. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact the BRRU concluded that the intensification of controls proposed by the Government are not, in the main, warranted and that its charging proposals are excessive, particularly with regard to products having well known features and risks. In fact, the excessive nature of the Government's proposed controls is amply demonstrated in relation to the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The Minister for Housing and Aged Care, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides a standard of regulation that is recognised internationally as being necessary to control therapeutic goods and which will bring Australia into line with levels of product assurances exercised and required by its major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA>The point which is relevant here is that while the industry and Opposition support the principle of high manufacturing standards, the Government's proposed revision of the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice is not merely, as the Minister would have it, `in line with that of our major trading partners'. The industry says that it is, in fact, in excess of the GMP specified in the United Kingdom and the European Economic Community (EEC) and represents excessive, unreasonable and unattainable criteria for manufacturing practice which cannot be justified on a benefit to risk basis. If the Government is committed to bringing manufacturing practices in this country into line with international standards, why does it not adopt the EEC code?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally now, and perhaps most importantly, I turn to the issue of the proposed fees and charges for registration, listing, evaluation, licensing and inspection. The Government has scaled down its intention to squeeze the industry for the full cost of the therapeutic goods program. Initially, at least, it will be endeavouring to recover just half that sum, which at present amounts to some $15m per annum. Of course, there are no guarantees-none that I have heard of-that it will not hike this figure up at the first available opportunity. But even at the 50 per cent recovery level these fees and charges have the capacity to devastate an industry which the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology acknowledges as being essential to Australia's efforts to `make real headway in achieving a quantum leap in exports of high value added manufactures'. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition do not have the detail of the charges which, like so much else of this proposal, remains unresolved, but we do know that on 10 October last Senate Estimates Committee F was given an indicative range of charges. These included: $50 a year for listing a product on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods; annual registration fees of about $350 for a prescription drug and $150 for an over-the-counter medication; evaluation charges of between $700 and $52,500; manufacturing licences costing between $800 and $8,300; and inspection fees ranging from $600 to $4,000. </PARA>
<PARA> What is clear from all of this is that the fees will have a marked impact on the industry with costs inevitably flowing on to consumers. As my colleague Senator Peter Baume so aptly put it in the Senate, `it ends up as a tax on the users of therapeutic goods'. Not only will there be an impact on consumers, but also it is important to understand, especially in the light of Senator Button's very considered comments and appreciation of the importance of this industry, that the industry's international competitiveness will be under attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me use the example of just one part of the industry, that sector involved in manufacturing medical devices. At this stage it is only a fledgling industry in this country consisting of about 600 firms, most of them relatively small-extremely small, one might say-with an annual turnover of less than $3 billion. But, despite its lack of size, this industry and the companies within it collectively have an annual turnover of $3m. Their local production exceeds $1 billion, and their exports are valued at over $300m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an industry which is strongly export oriented and already a success on the world scene. About one-third of its local production is exported, compared with 15 per cent for manufacturing industry as a whole, and there are some of these companies exporting more than 90 per cent of their production. I visited a number of them. In fact, medical devices currently represent more than 5 per cent of Australia's total manufacturing exports. </PARA>
<PARA> In just five years from 1981-82 to 1986-87 exports from this burgeoning industry grew from $170m to $317m. It is a success story that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, certainly understands, as does the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. These achievements, plus the potential for future development, are in jeopardy because of the Government's moves to impose charges on the industry to fund the operation of one part of the Department of Community Services and Health. This industry is looking at being severely, if not irreparably, damaged and having its international competitiveness destroyed. When I visited one factory recently, the principals clearly stated that it would now be cheaper for them to go offshore and manufacture in Malaysia, for example, but they and their employees preferred living in Australia, with all of its attendant benefits. With the imposition of a range of charges, the likes of which we have heard in the Senate Estimates Committee, the competitive position of companies in the medical devices industry will be severely affected. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the Government's therapeutic goods fees and charges run completely counter to other initiatives it has taken through Austrade and the National Industry Extension Service, for example, to encourage innovation, research and development and export enhancement. All of this investment of taxpayers' funds could be wiped out by the imposition of fees and charges, which have the capacity to restrict research and development; cripple a growing export earning industry; inhibit the establishment of new companies; deny the community the benefits of new, innovative products; and, importantly, destroy potential job creation. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, we do not come into this debate without any international experience. All of these dangers have been recognised by the United States Government, which from time to time has flirted with the idea of imposing charges on the therapeutic goods industry through its Food and Drug Administration. Arguments which have been accepted by the United States administration include the following: that product evaluation is for public benefit, not for the private benefit of the manufacturing company, and should therefore be financed from general taxation revenue, not through specific fees and charges levied on industry; that a user fee on a regulated industry is in effect a tax on research and development since it is the cost of bringing a new product into the marketplace; and, finally, that user fees would be particularly burdensome to small high technology firms, many of which do not earn sufficient revenues to support such impending costs. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these arguments are equally valid in the Australian context. If they are ignored, then, as I have already said, much of the work which various arms of government have undertaken to try to boost research and development, to foster new and innovative industries and to develop export markets will, in the final analysis, amount to a completely wasted effort. I give just one small example, a small company in my home State of Western Australia, Go Medical Industries, named aptly because of the innovative spirit of its founders and the people who work within it. It has been in operation since 1982 and employs a staff of 10, developing innovative products that have found a place on the world market. More than 90 per cent of its output, 90 per cent of all it produces, is exported to the United States of America, New Zealand, Italy, Canada, Singapore and other scattered countries. It is the sort of success story that Australia desperately needs when we consider the monthly balance of payments current account figures and the month by month growing international debt. This is one of the hundreds of small Australian companies which could be driven to the wall by these therapeutic goods proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Opposition is not prepared to stand idly by and see the therapeutic goods industry destroyed by an ill considered Government proposal. We want the whole package-I repeat, the whole package, not less than half of the package, because we are dealing with pretty innocuous legislation this afternoon-thoroughly examined. The real thrust is contained in the regulations, which we have not yet seen and I understand perhaps are not even finalised in the drafting. We want the whole package-the legislation and the regulations-thoroughly examined so that due regard can be paid to the concerns which I have raised here and the numerous other ones brought forward by all sectors of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope all members of the Government, not just the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, will recognise the significance of the therapeutic goods industry. We hope that all members of the Government will appreciate the tremendous contribution this industry is making to the national economy and the Australian community. More importantly for our country's future, we hope that they appreciate the enormous contributions it can go on to double, treble and quadruple, if properly supported and properly fostered in the way that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce recognises is absolutely crucial. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that successive Government speakers-and there are several, to be followed intermittently by Opposition speakers-will appreciate that we come to this debate devoid of what we continually experience in this chamber: party politics. We have raised a number of serious concerns, all of which are amply evidenced and given voice to by the industry. We could have moved an in principle amendment in this chamber, but we did not. We could have moved an amendment that the Government withdraw the Bill and itself refer it to the appropriate Senate Committee that I mentioned in my remarks; but we did not. I recognise that at such short notice the Government is unlikely to agree with our position. So we will not be moving any amendments to this legislation this afternoon. Despite the opposition that I have expressed, neither will we be dividing on this legislation. The cruel reality, as we all understand, is that every time we put up a proposition that the Government does not support we lose. I do not even want to take that course on a pro forma basis because I underscore the bona fides with which we come into this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I clearly foreshadow that in the Senate we will refer this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. We believe it is the most appropriate committee to examine these proposals from an industry point of view. We do not believe that sufficient consultation has taken place with industry, let alone the States. By referring it to the Senate Committee we will be providing that opportunity. It does not disturb the Government's timetable because the Bill will not come into effect, even if passed, until March 1990. The charges will not come into effect, even if the Bill is passed, until July 1990. If we are successful in referring the legislation to the Committee-that, of course, depends on the support or otherwise of the Australian Democrats-we will be demanding, and that is not too strong a word, the tabling of the regulations. It is unreasonable to expect the Opposition, indeed any opposition, to pass legislation of this kind without the all important regulations. As I close my contribution, I hope the Government will support the referral of this proposal to the Senate Committee on Industry, Science and Technology so that all relevant matters I have raised this afternoon and others that can be put by industry can be fully considered and adequately addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to initiate my remarks on this very important legislation by drawing the attention of the Opposition to one very simple fact-namely, that two prominent members of its front bench are on the public record as being flatly and diametrically opposed to the views that have just been expressed by the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). In common with me, those two members, namely Senator Bishop and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), were members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into therapeutic goods, which amassed six volumes of evidence and which formed a damning indictment on the control by successive Australian governments of the introduction of new drugs and medical devices to the Australian market. It is clear that the shadow Minister for health has not read one bit of that evidence, let alone the unanimous recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which called for national legislation as a matter of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not as if national legislation on the subject of drugs and medical devices is such an earth-shattering proposition. Every comparable civilised democracy already has that form of legislation. Australia is so far behind the times that, rather than-as the shadow Minister suggested-this legislation being a risk to exports, the brutal reality is that our international reputation is tarnished for every minute that this legislation fails to be passed in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into therapeutic goods was conducted in an honourable manner with the bipartisan support of all members of the Committee, to whom I pay tribute for their work. Let me relate some of the findings of the Committee. First, because there was an absence of national legislation, there was an inability to ensure an enforceable national standard of good manufacturing practice, the overriding purpose of which is quality control. I say to the people of Australia: what the shadow Minister for health has done by speaking in this chamber today is to say that he does not agree with Senator Bishop; he does not agree with the honourable member for Dundas; he does not agree with the Public Accounts Committee; he does not agree with what the industry said over about a year of public hearings; and he does not agree with what the consumers' representatives say. The shadow Minister for health says that there is no need for national legislation in the form in which it is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee found that the licensing of manufacturers, which is currently a state responsibility, with varying standards, in some cases precluded the power to close down substandard and unsafe premises. Let me tell honourable members what happened during the course of evidence before the Committee. A representative of a South Australian department appeared before the Committee and was asked what would happen if an attempt was made to close down manufacturers. It was found, in effect, that once a manufacturer in South Australia obtains a licence, he holds that licence for life and it literally cannot be revoked. Believe it or not, that meant that the Government of South Australia had no power to close down premises where unsafe practices were operating. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is just scandalous. Thirdly, the Committee found, unanimously-and it included two front bench members of the Opposition-that no requirement existed to evaluate any Australian made medical device prior to sale and use in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Committee found that no control existed over the importation into Australia of the vast majority of medical devices, with the result that some devices that are banned overseas can be imported legally into Australia without any inquiry. I repeat that: under the current law, it is legally possible to import into Australia medical devices that have been banned overseas. That is intolerable. It is totally unacceptable that consumers in this country are placed at risk by the utterances in this House today of the shadow Minister for health. People forget the campaign against and the misery and the injuries that were caused to people in this country by the Dalkon shield. People forget the campaign that had to be waged to get government action on that device. People forget so easily what happened in the case of the thalidomide tragedy. This national legislation is all about making sure that those tragedies never recur. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, the Committee found further that there was no evaluation of the majority of diagnostic products. The Committee was concerned to hear in evidence that one-third of the manufacturers of therapeutic goods in Australia had not complied with the International Code of Good Manufacturing Practice and that a significant number of deficiencies of a major or critical nature had been identified over a number of years. I should explain in more detail just what that means. I repeat that one-third of the manufacturers of therapeutic goods in Australia did not comply with the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice. That information was provided in evidence on oath by Commonwealth officials. In evidence, officials of the Department of Community Services and Health defined an unacceptable standard of manufacture as:</PARA>
<PARA>a grossly deficient standard of general compliance which includes a large number of minor and major deficiencies, and possibly some critical deficiencies, observed to persist over successive  . . . inspections . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is a repeated practice that involves serious matters. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>the critical deficiency would be one that would or could cause harm to patients and a major deficiency would be one with the potential to cause harm indirectly to patients. </PARA>
<PARA>For the benefit of those people who are interested to learn what sorts of things we are talking about when we talk about breaches of the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice. I point out that in evidence before the Committee, Commonwealth officials provided the Committee with a dossier of the breaches of the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> This debate is about whether or not the shadow Minister for health is going to come into the chamber and protect public health, and whether or not the Opposition is going to undermine the attempts of this Government to support the unanimous recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee and the call by consumers and the industry in this country to have national legislation. We have heard from the shadow Minister in the course of this debate, with respect, a pathetic effort to defend the Opposition's position. I have made the point in the course of my contribution that there is an internationally accepted Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for drugs and medical devices. That code involves vital issues of public health, and before the Opposition called the quorum in order to deprive me of speaking time I was going to highlight to the House just what breaches of that code have been revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I do that, I repeat that one-third of the manufacturers of therapeutic goods in this country have been found not to comply with the international code. Let me take a couple of examples. In sworn evidence given to the Public Accounts Committee, and accepted by the two Opposition front bench members on the Committee, we heard of three cases of breaches involving companies in South Australia. The first was a manufacturer of tablets, capsules, liquids and creams which had demonstrated poor compliance with the international code and persistent deficiencies-including, I might add, critical deficiencies-since 1981. So for seven years it had breached the code but under the law of South Australia the premises could not be closed down. We heard the example of a manufacturer of tablets, capsules, liquids and creams which had been involved in persistent deficiencies, including several critical deficiencies, since at least 1980. So for eight years it had failed to comply with the code, the public had been put at risk, and under the State law the premises could not be closed down. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an attack by me on the industry; it is a defence by me of reputable manufacturers. It is an attack on the minority of manufacturers, though a significant number, who breach the code, who put the public at risk and who, if this Government has its way, will be put out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the other example, involving a manufacturer in Western Australia, where the shadow Minister comes from. We heard his example of what is happened in Western Australia, but let me tell him of sworn evidence of the Department of Community Services and Health before the Public Accounts Committee. The evidence was not rebutted by the State Government. We heard of a manufacturer of liquid creams which had shown very poor compliance with the code and persistent and major critical deficiencies since 1980. So for eight years no effective action had been taken. Then we heard about a company described as company 40, which was described as having a total absence of compliance with the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice, with many major and critical deficiencies. Remember that major and critical deficiencies are the grave ones involving issues of public health. This is a case in the State of the shadow Minister for health, who would purport to be protecting one day the public of Australia. In the course of our Public Accounts Committee inquiry we tried to find out more about this company that was in such violation of the standards that the community should expect ought to be followed. I asked a witness before the Committee whether in fact it was a sole person operating and running his own business, and the witness said that that was correct. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>In suburban Perth?</PARA>
<PARA>The witness answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>In a backyard?</PARA>
<PARA>The witness answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>So we had a company totally failing to comply with the internationally accepted code, placing the public at risk and operating out of a suburban backyard. That is the situation that the shadow Minister for health came into this chamber today to defend. If honourable members believe that there is something innovative about national legislation, let me tell them that it was first thought of and first proposed during the time of the Menzies Government, right back in the mid-1960s-and still we do not have national legislation. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) is to be commended for bringing this legislation before the House promptly, in accordance with the unanimous views of the Public Accounts Committee, including the views of Senator Bishop and the honourable member for Dundas. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other matters that are unlikely to be touched on in detail in the course of this debate, but honourable members might like to hear from me-I happen to have read the six volumes of evidence and happen to know what he is talking about, unlike the shadow Minister-what the practice has been in a number of State governments. Under the international code for the issue of certificates, only the national government has the authority to issue certificates. The certificates have come into existence so they can be used as documents of credibility on the international marketplace, so that reputable Australian manufacturers can take their certificates into the international marketplace and be recognised, sell their goods, assist people in overseas countries and make a dollar for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the House what the Public Accounts Committee uncovered in the course of its investigations. We found that a number of State governments-including both Government and Opposition controlled State governments-were issuing bodgie, shonky certificates which gave every appearance of certifying that companies were complying with the internationally accepted code. We heard evidence from people on oath that made it very clear that those certificates, issued by State governments, had been issued to companies in total violation of that internationally accepted code. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not come into this chamber to play party politics. Until I spoke to the shadow Minister I believed that the Opposition was supporting the legislation. I find it inconceivable that any Opposition spokesman, particularly in such a crucial area as health, could possibly fail to support the bipartisan report of the Public Accounts Committee especially when two of his shadow Ministers voted, as part of a unanimous decision, to support that document. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Opposition ought to rethink its position because by taking the stand that it is taking in relation to the current legislation, which the shadow Minister in his own words described as unobjectionable, it is placing the people of Australia at risk because of that minority of shonky manufacturers. The Opposition's stand is not in the interests of consumers, it is not in the interests of the industry and it is one, with respect, that will bring great discredit and embarrassment to the Opposition. If the legislation is unobjectionable, as the shadow Minister said, it ought not to be referred to any committee of the Senate. It ought to be passed. If there is some problem with respect to fees-I believe that there is none, and I assume the shadow Minister will deal with that-let us deal with that and the question of regulations when they have to be implemented. Let us not try to stop social progress; let us not fly in the face of the unanimous recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with great pride that I commend the legislation to the House. I commend the Minister because he has acted on those unanimous recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee and he is doing his best to protect the people of Australia from those backyard operators that operate out of the shadow Minister's own state. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can only guess that the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) either misheard or misunderstood the words of my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). I am loath to come to the conclusion that he misrepresented the honourable member for Tangney in his reaction because, having known him for some time, I know that he certainly does not have a history which would lead me to want to come to that conclusion. The honourable member for Tangney has said that he would like-and we so propose-the therapeutic goods legislation to be referred to a Senate committee; that is not opposing the legislation. The honourable member for Tangney gave the Opposition's reasons for this. Whilst it might be open to honourable members opposite to contest those remarks, that was not a course that the honourable member for Hughes chose to pursue. It seems to me-I say this with all the respect that I can-that much of what the honourable member for Hughes had to say concerned the findings in an earlier report of a very formidable committee of this Parliament, one which the honourable member chairs. He then took it one step further and interpreted as a personal slight on him the fact that somehow the Opposition might want to do something different or to be a little more cautious in its approach to this legislation than is the honourable member for Hughes and his Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not that this Bill is so urgent in the sense that its provisions are not intended to apply until March 1990. There is not great panic. When the honourable member for Hughes resorted to arguing the urgency of the measure, he obviously was not aware of that fact or he chose to ignore it. It seems that as this Government gets older and more tired, its new, perhaps enthusiastic, members of the Ministry, dream up harebrained schemes without the prudence and restraint which more experienced Ministers in the Government once provided. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, along with the Privacy Amendment Bill which is before the Senate, is typical of that failing. It is yet another example of the Government and its approach to regulations gone mad. The desire of the Federal Labor Government to regulate or control industry whenever the opportunity presents itself continues unabated. However, it is not the overall scheme of national regulation which has led to the grave concerns of businesses in the therapeutic goods industries, but a system of charges to fund the new legislation which appears to be both inequitable and irrational. </PARA>
<PARA> In establishing the national system of regulation, the Bills go too far in imposing new burdens on businesses which are, in some respects, more onerous than the regulatory burdens faced by their competitors for overseas markets. Such difficulties as the broad definition of therapeutic goods which will require licensing do not appear to have been adequately addressed by the Government in developing the legislation. The regulatory burden which the legislation will facilitate is not wholly apparent from the legislation. We are to be presented with a whole host of regulations after the legislation has been passed by the Parliament; that is, whilst a procedure, a method, a device which is being employed increasingly by this Government is arguably unwise. </PARA>
<PARA> A greater part of the burden will be imposed by the regulatory powers conferred on the agencies of the Department of Community Services and Health and the standards which they choose to establish. The nature of the regulatory regime, which will be faced by the industry if the Bill passes through the Parliament, is further confused by the inability of the Federal Government to properly establish agreement with the the States about the operation of the legislation and the timing of its introduction. The Victorian Government has already made it clear that it will continue to administer State legislation in this area until well into the time when the Federal legislation is scheduled to have effect. The uncertainty that ensues represents an intolerable burden on those manufacturers and importers who will have no idea what regulations and standards might apply to their products, and how long those standards will apply. It will lead to delays in the introduction of new products and even the improvement of older products which might be well established in the marketplace. In the end, it is the consumers seeking some form of therapy or treatment who will suffer from the uncertainty which these Bills will create when enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> The system of regulation to be introduced is, perhaps, as comprehensive as for any other industry. In that respect, the legislation is an unusual application of the Federal corporations power which backs up its provisions. The detailed operation of most industries is regulated at the State Government level. These Bills propose the licensing of manufacturers, the regulation or listing of their products and inspection of premises to ensure conformity to Federal regulations. Licences can be granted on a conditional basis and can be revoked or suspended on a number of different grounds. None of these powers is usually exercised by the Federal Government. To that extent, this legislation is a significant indicator of the direction which the Labor Government is taking with the regulation of Australian businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government seeks to establish the power to regulate the minute details of the production of the enormous range of products to be defined as therapeutic goods. Surely this must be considered an ominous prospect by those in business who will soon have to cope with the introduction of the Commonwealth package of companies legislation. That legislation is currently being challenged in the High Court. However, it also has the potential to alter significantly the nature of the regulation of business in this country and the role of the States in the Commonwealth. Not only would the States be removed from another area which in the past had been their responsibility, but also the area of licensing, which traditionally and constitutionally has been a major source of income to the States, will have been gradually impinged upon by the Labor Government. While I do not believe that regulation by the States is necessarily a good thing-indeed, the States are responsible for part of the massive Government burden on business-the imposition of further regulation and expense by the Commonwealth threatens a new and less responsive power to which companies must be accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence to suggest that Commonwealth legislation will be less onerous than that of the States. In time, it is likely to be more so if recent experience under this Government is any criterion. Uniformity-the most common justification for Federal regulation and the reasons which appeal to most Australian businesses-must be discounted as a value when it is remembered that the checks on the growth of that regulation are much less and the potential for avoiding over-regulation is much less than under an effective Federal system. There is some indication that this legislation owes more to an exercise in empire building by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and his Department than a genuine desire to improve the regulatory environment of the therapeutic goods industry. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more significant criticisms of this legislation by industry is that products which have been extensively investigated by well-resourced and thorough agencies in other countries, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration, must go through the same procedures again in Australia. This is despite the fact that the details of the earlier investigations by other agencies are readily available and open to independent validation by Australian authorities, but in a procedure which might be significantly shorter than the full investigation from scratch. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian regulatory procedures are renowned for their slow approval of new drugs and other medical products. The problems which this presents for medical practitioners trying to treat patients with the most modern means available are obvious. It is essential that these existing regulatory delays are alleviated. However, this legislation imposes new regulations, new procedures, new charges and an increased burden. This burden will hold back both the development of the Australian therapeutic goods industry and the supply of the most recent forms of medication and treatment to Australians. These regulatory effects will be compounded by the system of fees which will be imposed under the new Commonwealth regulatory scheme. The Government claims that the fees imposed in this package of legislation will only recover half of the costs of the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In a strange twist of logic, this Government has repeatedly imposed what it characterises as a user pays system of payments for government imposed regulations. That is how powerful and regulatory governments go about creating their own markets. By what means the Government could construe the regulated industry as the user of regulation, I do not know. Regulation is more often imposed on a reluctant industry and reluctant consumers to promote the interests of the regulators. This seems to be the case here-at least to some extent-given the information, or lack of it, from the Minister and his Government. Those arguments aside, the way in which the fees are structured by this legislation shows a lack of understanding of the industry which the Government is seeking to regulate. Fees will apply across the board with little flexibility to allow for the variety and different levels of production and the often very limited markets for therapeutic goods. The level of these charges bears little resemblance to the likely costs to the Department in administering the various so-called services on which the fees will be levied.</PARA>
<PARA> The licensing fees will be imposed on an annual basis, despite the fact that the cost to the Department of monitoring a licence might well be negligible. In those cases, it will be more than `user pays' or some form of rational contribution. The rationale for a significant annual charge on the licensing or listing of goods is not as clear as the similar charge for the licensing of the manufacturers themselves. The exact level of the charges to be imposed remains a matter for regulation under the legislation. This is another point that we object to and one which should be considered by the Senate committee to which we hope to have these Bills referred. The Government has made it clear that these charges are to be seen as a source of revenue which will be passed on to customers by the producers of therapeutic goods. So the consumer will pay once again. These increased cost burdens on the consumer are just one more kick in the teeth to those who are already struggling under the Government's Medicare mess. </PARA>
<PARA> As Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are becoming an increasing financial drain on the Government, the Minister for Community Services and Health and his colleagues have sought to reduce that drain by imposing on individual consumers and the providers of medical services these additional costs-unforeseen costs as far as the consumers are concerned. The costs of medical assistance which cannot be legally covered by insurance have increased rapidly in recent years. Even so, the cost of private insurance has escalated enormously because of the effects of Medicare on the insurance market. The poor level of service provided under the Medicare system has been well documented with long waiting lists for surgery, shortages of hospital beds, declining morale amongst medical staff, poor delivery to country areas, and an enormous drain on the taxpayer. This legislation is in the same tradition, establishing a new unified national system of regulation, with a series of charges which could prove far more onerous than the Minister suggested in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> In drawing to a conclusion, I would like to make a few points about regulation in general. In spite of the very best motives of many regulators and the governments which introduce regulatory laws, their noble ideals are often not fulfilled. The Minister in his second reading speech referred to the thalidomide tragedy and suggested that this Bill would reduce the chances of similar mistakes occurring in the future. However, the thalidomide failure was not one of regulation or lack of it but was a failure due to a lack of knowledge. The Government cannot regulate against ignorance. The Government should provide effective remedies for such failures through the legal system. It should provide incentives to companies to conduct the most rigorous research and testing of new products before they come on to the market, otherwise the regulatory process becomes not a protection for consumers but a protector of companies which have met the requirements of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> A firm which has gone through extensive procedures for regulatory approval has no incentive to engage in further research, or to follow up new information which emerges after the product is registered, licensed or approved for sale to the public. Regulatory minimum standards have a tendency to emerge as maximum standards with no benefit to any company which seeks to improve on those minimums. Regulation which is too extensive, constrains improvements in efficiency, quality and standards by forcing producers to conform to one standard laid down by the regulatory agency, which is not always at the forefront of research and knowledge. Regulation is always in conflict with innovation and advance. </PARA>
<PARA> When human lives are at stake, caution is an essential requirement for anyone building a service, such as therapeutic goods for the public. However, regulation runs the risk of causing stagnation and vastly higher costs to the consumer with little real benefit in terms of quality or safety. There is a tendency amongst honourable members on the other side of the chamber to blame chemical companies and the search for a profit for every form of medicine which does not work or, more unfortunately, which causes deleterious and unexpected side effects. Yet they neglect to inform people that most of those products have received regulatory approval before being released on the market. They neglect to mention that the vast majority of great advances in medicines and therapeutic treatment were developed by the same companies which they so readily condemn. No such advances in knowledge have emerged elsewhere from expensive regulatory agencies which more often than not slow the release of helpful products to those who need them. I support the stand taken by the honourable member for Tangney, the shadow Minister for Health. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In following the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) I find myself in a dilemma. His contributions are always well thought out. They often have some substance but, unfortunately, not today. The honourable member for Curtin spoke about the overburden of regulation. There is going to be no burden on the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) when he replies to this debate in analysing the contribution of the honourable member for Curtin and the points that need to be answered. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Curtin has failed to recognise that the Therapeutic Goods Bill and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Bill were developed from the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in which members of the party of the honourable member for Curtin participated and they agreed with the recommendations. The industry was consulted and it also agrees with the recommendations that form the basis of this legislation. So away we go again with what I describe as opposition for the sake of opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, I do not think that members of the Opposition make much of a contribution to the process when they engage in opposition simply for the sake of it. I reiterate two or three points made in the Minister's second reading speech. Recognising the magnitude of the problem faced here in having legislation, in some way, to provide these guarantees, it is an immense task to put over 14,000 medicinal drug products and over 25,000 therapeutic devices into the marketplace and expect people to both understand them and ensure that those products are safe in the marketplace. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, there are still great areas where there is a lack of knowledge. There is a requirement for immensely complex checks and balances to ensure that risks to humans who take these substances or use these devices are minimised. We have to find parameters which define the acceptability of anything which is to appear in the marketplace for prescription to or consumption by the public. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, we have to tackle the question of quality. We have to ensure via national legislative standards that quality is guaranteed. We have to ensure that safety is guaranteed. The honourable member for Curtin, in his contribution, made a comment about thalidomide and said that the problem of thalidomide arose because at the time there was a lack of knowledge. I put it to him that that was not the case. The problem arose because at the time there was undue haste in introducing the drug to the marketplace. It had not been sufficiently tested and the side effects when they were apparent in the early stage were not properly recognised, and were in fact ignored for what might be put as commercial reasons. It is not true to say that there was a lack of knowledge in that instance. When we are dealing with safety, particularly the safety of drugs and medicines, we have to ensure that there are satisfactory national standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin makes the point that any attempt to legislate puts in place a lowest common denominator of standards. That may well be the case, but it is not sufficient to say that there should not be legislation because the best that can be achieved at the moment is the results of the intensive investigation by the Public Accounts Committee, chaired by the honourable member for Hughes, (Mr Tickner) and the recommendations from the industry that this is the way to go and which take account of the role and interest of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect we have to take account of is that, having satisfied ourselves that the model will account for quality and safety standards, we have to be assured of the efficacy or the effectiveness of the product. The world have been through the development of the snake oil medicines, as they are called. Of course, there have been many wonder prescriptions of one kind or another and many millions of dollars spent by people in the chase for a product that in the end proved to be nothing more than a sugar pill. So the extent to which we give an imprimatur to effectiveness is important and is embraced in this legislation. Again, that is consistent with the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will now require three major elements to be satisfied before the product appears in the marketplace. We have adopted the three major elements recommended by the World Health Organisation as being necessary for effective regulation. First, there must be a pre-market assessment of the product for human use. I assume that that is self-evident to every member in this place and does not need further elaboration. Second, we require through the legislation that good manufacturing practices are followed in the manufacture of therapeutic products for human use-in other words, standards of quality in the process that guarantee all the things that we require of a product that is going to be consumed by the public. Third, we have to ensure that a set of standards is developed for human and veterinary use of drugs and that there is compliance with that set of standards. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to take into account that at the moment there is a potpourri of State, Territory and Commonwealth legislation in this field which has evolved over many years. This legislation is an attempt to draw all that together and give industry, consumers and governments of all levels that are involved a common base with which to work. In an economy which is trying to rationalise in a whole lot of areas and with many of the inconsistencies that have developed with our Federal-State system in so many fields, this is the logical way for this nation to go, and this legislation ought to be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> A logical extension of this legislation is that, having put this legislation in place and guaranteed the quality, safety and standards of the goods that actually appear on the shelves, it behoves us as a parliament to turn our minds also to the question of prescription and supply or consumption of the various drugs and devices that are available to people. Recently in this Parliament my colleague, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), in his capacity as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, handed down a report called Drugs and Crime in Society, and in my opinion there is a startling finding in that report. It set out to deal with the question of illegal drugs, illicit drugs, and the Committee found that there was a factor of 9:1 of toxic poisoning cases to overdoses in our hospitals and doctors' clinics. The major drug problem in this country relates to legally available drugs and compounds. They do not have the criminal elements associated with them which lead to all the other problems of illicit drugs. But in terms of people stuffing things down their throats, doing immense damage to their systems and placing great demands on the national health system, the major problem in this country is the legally available drugs and compounds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has asked the Standing Committee on Community Affairs to conduct an inquiry into the prescription, supply and consumption of drugs. The Committee will look at the whole question of community attitudes. Why is it that we say, `Something is wrong, we must have something, let's get our hands on it quickly'? Why are we such prolific consumers of these drugs? Why is it that so many people overdose and show signs of toxic poisoning? Is it because of television advertisements such as the one that advises women that they are not good mothers unless they rub Vicks Vaporub onto their children's chests when they start to cough? Is it because we have been conditioned to traipse to the doctor and say, `I must have something'? Is it because we pay our doctors and chemists by volume? Under the prescription system, the more patients one sees and the more turnover one has, the more one earns. Is that a smart way for a nation to go about these matters?</PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line is that, having introduced this legislation, which at least provides a base and guarantees that what is available on the shelves will meet certain standards, even though we may end up catering for the lowest common denominator, as the honourable member for Curtin said, we must now turn our attention to trying to wind back community dependence on drugs, particularly those that are dangerous if taken excessively. As Chairman of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I point out to the House that we in the Parliament have a responsibility to follow up that matter, now that this legislation has been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I take a very broad view. I think that a much broader role can be played by our pharmacists, for instance, in advising people. I think it is absolute lunacy that, in order to obtain a drug under the prescription system, we must consult one professional, for which visit the Government pays, and we then traipse down the road into a shop and see another professional. We then pay another fee for the prescribed item, whatever it may be. Surely, there must be scope for much more harmony, coordination and efficiency not only in financial terms, but in health terms. The views of community centres, alternative medicine advocates and consumer associations need to be heard as we look at the next stage, having put in place a base by way of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think I have wandered too far from the ambit of the Bill. This legislation represents very much an action in good faith by the Minister. It shows once again-and I have made this point on many occasions-that the Hawke Labor Government is not a government which pigeon holes reports. We all know what happened to parliamentary committee reports over many years. I know that every report with which I have been associated during my time in this place has been taken very seriously and has been responded to by the Government, certainly to my satisfaction. The Public Accounts Committee, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Hughes, has done a very deep and thorough analysis of the issue. It has presented a report of substance which has been picked up and accepted by the Government and industry. This legislation puts it into action. The Hawke Labor Government's record-whether it is in the area of meeting the pledge to remove children from poverty, getting people back to work, fixing up the Budget, or even taking note of reports of parliamentary committees-is one of action. I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all recognise the difficulty that honourable members have from time to time. I am not reflecting on the honourable member's motives. I hope that he reads the Hansard record of my speech. This matter is a difficult one because the Bill that is before the House has been a long time in its gestation. The report of the Public Accounts Committee has been referred to by Government members as a report which should be seen as approving of this legislation in its present form, leading to its passage. That is a gross distortion of the report, and the arguments put forward by Committee members. It ignores the damning views of the Committee concerning the way in which the Government responded in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to refer honourable members to the discussion which appears in the report on the question of legislation. When the Public Accounts Committee undertook its inquiry and reviewed the therapeutic goods evaluation and testing program, it was aware that there had been an absence of uniform national legislation in the therapeutic goods area. The Committee stated that the need for such legislation was recognised as far back as 1966 when Commonwealth and State Ministers formed a working party to examine the proposal. Page 13 of the Committee's report details the way in which Commonwealth powers were restricted and the legislation under which the Commonwealth presently operates. The Committee dealt with State legislation. It recorded the nature of the evidence given by witnesses to the Committee and spoke about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme review, which strongly supported the proposal for uniform national legislation, and its recommendations. The report quotes favourably some evidence that I received as a member of that Committee in relation to the way in which the States, as well as the Commonwealth, were dealing with this matter. I refer in particular to paragraph 2.42 of the Committee's report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, however, was disturbed to hear evidence from the States, industry groups and consumer groups that consultation has not been as extensive as the Department had indicated in its submission and evidence. Most groups were aware of the proposal in principle, but had had no detailed discussions or consultation with the Department. In particular, industry and consumer groups were aware of proposals but were concerned at the lengthening timetable for further consultation and eventual introduction into the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Thereafter some quotes are included in the Committee's discussion. As I said, I was involved in that matter. In paragraph 2.46 of the report the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The ever lengthening timetable for introduction of the legislation is of great concern to the Committee. As stated in Chapter 1 the lack of appropriate legislation was of concern to the Committee . . . However, this concern should in no way impede proper consultation with interested parties. The Committee believes that the draft Bill should be made public as soon as possible and should be made available to those parties for comment. Adequate time should be allowed for proper debate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee indicated in its report that it had been advised that the Department might prepare this legislation for presentation in the 1989 Budget sittings. After all of those comments about the need for consultation, after the Committee had offered some views, particularly in relation to substantial issues, including cost recovery aspects, in which the Committee universally endorsed the need for cost recovery, I am surprised that the specific suggestions of the Committee were not taken up by the Government. This has been a matter of concern to industry and is a matter of concern to me. Honourable members who are not members of the Committee come in and laud the Government for introducing legislation at this time. They suggest that one ought to be pleased that the Committee's report has been responded to, yet there are significant variations between the Government's Bill and the proposals that were submitted and supported by the Committee. They were supported across the board politically-by me as a member of the Committee and by my colleagues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister was certainly across these matters because I have spoken at length with him. I have supported strongly the view that the Opposition has come to-that the legislation ought to be rejected at this time-because of the extent to which these sensible views put by the Public Accounts Committee have been ignored by the Government and its advisers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to emphasise the time that has been taken in this matter. I would have thought that, with all the comments that have been offered in relation to consultation and the need for consultation, we would not have arrived at a situation where we have proposals that are so abhorrent to the industries concerned. I have had some discussions with industry representatives and I have not found them at all unreasonable. Over a long period speaking with pharmaceutical manufacturers in my electorate I have become aware of concerns that many of them have had for national legislation, particularly national legislation that would put in place a framework of law which would enable a good manufacturing practice in particular to be administered uniformly throughout Australia. There is a concern that if a high standard of good manufacturing practice is enforced in New South Wales, for instance, as has been the case over time, but a lesser standard is adopted in other States, industry could be forced to move from one State to another simply to have products manufactured at a lower standard. I do not believe that that is what the Australian public would want. I think Australians would want a proper and appropriate standard, reasonably arrived at, enforced uniformly throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When I seek advice from industry I am told-as the Opposition has put in its own comments-that in principle this package of legislation has been supported by the relevant industry groups, which see some advantages to the general public and manufacturing industry in relation to uniformity of scheduling and regulatory controls of manufacturing. But, unless there has been cooperation and proper consultation and discussions between all the States and Territories and the Commonwealth, national registration arrangements will be unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage we have no clear indication that any State or Territory of Australia has drawn up complementary legislation. At this stage the Victorian Government has indicated that it is willing to look at repealing its own system of registration but will not be doing so until the spring session in 1990. This means that, even with the program that the Government has set down at this time, it will not be competent to deal with these important questions. It will not have legislation in place because the way in which the Victorians are addressing this question means that the Government will be forced to delay the introduction of the registration arrangements if it is going to avoid the situation of having two systems in place. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that this proposal gives the Government time to arrange for these outstanding matters, of which the Government is aware and to which industry is drawing attention. They involve substantial questions of disagreement with the Public Accounts Committee and its stated view on the report. I do not know whether the Public Accounts Committee has changed its view since then. If it did, it did so when I was no longer a member. At the time when I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee we looked at the question of fees. A whole chapter, paragraphs 7.14 through to 7.30, dealt with the basis upon which we thought a fair system of fees should be introduced. We made a number of very simple points. I think the emphasis ought to be understood clearly by all honourable members. We were not in favour of cross-subsidisation or of fees that were designed to raise revenue for government; we were in favour of fees that were designed to be a proper cost recovery mechanism for services actually rendered to industry by government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a Bill which does not seek to do that. We have the imposition of annual fees, regardless of whether or not they represent a payment for service, and the imposition of a secondary and indirect form of taxation-that is, revenue being gained by Government-through this exercise. As a result of what the Government is proposing we have a situation whereby exporters might well be penalised in cost terms as against other countries producing the same goods who would not be similarly charged. We have the situation in which there might well be cross-subsidisation, and that is a matter which the Committee was unwilling to embrace. In paragraph 7.22 the Committee had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>However, in framing such a fee structure the Committee stresses-</PARA>
<PARA>I mention again that word `stresses'-</PARA>
<PARA>that, for evaluation or other costs, there should under no circumstances be cross-subsidisation by one category of goods in respect of any other. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Goods already on the market that only require registration should not be re-evaluated. Fees for inclusion on the Register should not be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>These matters are of very considerable concern to industry. The Government seems to be moving to try to impose unreasonable charges, a form of indirect taxation which is quite unjust and quite improper. We have come to the view that this matter ought to be looked at again. The Government could have referred the matter to the Public Accounts Committee for further report and report to the Parliament if that was its desire. No doubt when this matter is before the Senate the Opposition's view that there should be a further examination of these questions will be pressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think there is a need for arrangements-as industry believes-whereby for the general public and manufacturing industry there is a uniformity of arrangement throughout Australia. I think it can be achieved by proper consultation, but proper consultation did not take place before, when the Committee undertook its report and I doubt, from what I have been told, that we have seen proper consultation take place since the Public Accounts Committee undertook its review. </PARA>
<PARA> I can believe that officials may very well have been embarrassed at the nature of the criticism that they were subjected to by the Public Accounts Committee and I can believe that they would want to try to meet the timetable that was set. But the Committee emphasised the need for consultation. Since the Public Accounts Committee deliberations, there has been further examination of some of these questions by the Government's Business Regulation Review Unit. Some of that material was brought to my attention after our Committee reported. I thought it was of interest that that review commented on the need for the approach to be taken in this area not to be unduly bureaucratic. The government's own advisory unit said:</PARA>
<PARA> The paper considers that there are many areas where regulation generates unnecessarily high costs. It also considers that the intensifications of controls proposed by DCSH are not, in the main, warranted and that the charging proposals both for these intensifications and for the ongoing program are excessive. These conclusions apply with particular force with regard to products having well known features and risks. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make one other point in relation to the comments made by the Government's Business Regulation Review Unit and by the Public Accounts Committee. We were not of the view that this Government, through its legislation or through the Department of Community Services and Health, ought to be reinventing the wheel. There is a wealth of information about the evaluation of products and drugs throughout the world. That information ought to be taken into account in an examination of these questions. Where inquiries have been undertaken by competent overseas authorities, there is a need for their judgment to be accepted at face value by Australia. I do not know that we are so much at the forefront of knowledge within government here in Australia that, when it comes to the European Community or the United States of America, we can say our view on evaluations, because we are not at the forefront of actually inventing these drugs, ought to be accepted, and we ought to be able to make and undertake all of these examinations to the exclusion of views reached by regulatory authorities abroad. I just do not think that is the case. The Government's Business Regulation Review Unit came to the same view: assessments undertaken by competent overseas authorities ought to be accepted; it would achieve substantial savings and would reduce delays in bringing products onto the market here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee spent a good deal of time looking at these questions. We offered these views. I would have hoped that, in developing the report, the Government, knowing of the amount of time spent, would have taken the views of the Public Accounts Committee into account and produced a Bill that would have been satisfactory to industry and one which the Opposition would have been able to enthusiastically support instead of having to ask for further inquiry, instead of having to delay implementation of legislation or its rejection if the matter cannot be resolved by a further inquiry and report. </PARA>

<PARA> We are talking about therapeutic goods and the whole industry which revolves around the use of devices and substances for therapy in this country. I would have thought that it is clear that the principle that there should be national legislation is something that all of us on both sides of the House support. It is clear that the Public Accounts Committee, in its report, made considerable recommendations. But in the end, the Government has to decide on the form and nature of that legislation, and there will invariably be areas in which concern is shown by industry and by the Opposition. I accept that in this place. But to come in here and suggest that we in the Government oppose this, and to be negative and carping and saying that it is all bad, is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take up some of the points that the honourable member for Dundas raised. He said that he supports proper cost recovery of those evaluations that take place, but he does not support-and it is terribly difficult for any manufacturer to sustain-a $50-a-year fee for annual membership or listing. That is absurd. He said that a $50-a-year listing fee will put people out of business. I do not believe it. Then, if a manufacturer wants to have his drug on the list, it costs him between $150 and $350 a year. I am sorry, but that will not put any reputable manufacturer out of business. It is not an unreasonable thing. It could easily be considered to be within cost recovery. To suggest that it is unreasonable is nonsense. The honourable member knows that as well as I do. To suggest that the Government is reinventing the wheel in all of this legislation is nonsense. The suggestion within the legislation that the Government will use the British Pharmacopoeia is clearly an indication that it will take on board all of that body of evidence that exists in that listing of pharmaceuticals which has been built over a long period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that the honourable member comes in here and is negative just for the sake of being negative. When that happens, it is unfortunate that a bipartisan discussion does not take place in here. When good manufacturing practices are spoken of and we are told how reasonable it is that good manufacturing processes should be part of the criteria for manufacturing devices, pharmaceuticals and whatever else it is that makes up therapeutic goods in this country, that is a reasonable thing. But when it is found out that in some places the evidence received by the Public Accounts Committee was that a third of the manufacturers were not fulfilling those principles-that code of manufacturing practice-then there should be concern. We should be rushing in here to do something about it, and there should be legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dundas mentioned, very correctly, that it is 1966 since this matter was first considered. Indeed, that is a long time ago. In 1986 the Cabinet decision was made to revise the Therapeutic Goods Act of 1966. Following that we had the Public Accounts Committee report. Now we get to this place. There has been considerable consultation. Every time I come in here to speak on a Bill-and there is all sorts of legislation that comes before the House-we have the problem that there has not been consultation. Really, there has been an enormous amount of consultation with the industry. I have no doubt that there are areas of industry in which there would still be concerns. When the regulations have to be tabled in this place, no doubt we can hear from the honourable member then. But to suggest that the Government delays, destroys, gets in the way and stops the principle from going ahead is wrong. That is where I have difficulty. What we are talking about is ensuring that the quality, the safety and the efficacy of therapeutic goods are substantial. That is in the public good for all of us in this House, and we all understand that. It is necessary that all of those devices, all of those treatments and all of those substances are sound and that people can expect that they are sound and understand that there is some sort of uniformity in the way in which they are assessed. At the moment we have a patchwork quilt. </PARA>
<PARA> Last time I came to Canberra, I came on the train. It was a frightening experience, because the train was derailed, things broke down and went wrong. But I can just imagine what it must have been like before the standard gauge railway was introduced. There was a patchwork of different States doing different things and it could not be all tied together. The same thing applies in this area. In the last century we had that sort of mentality-that we all do it a different way. I accept what the Opposition is saying. The Victorian Government may, for some time, have a piece of legislation overlapping with what we introduce. That may also happen in other States. But the problem now is not that there is an overlapping; the problem is that there are huge gaps. One could drive a truck through the gaps. One can bring into this country all sort of therapeutic devices that are not allowed overseas. People ring me asking why they cannot bring into Australia the latest new drug that will cure their cancer. One feels very disappointed and very sorry for a person in that circumstance. Unfortunately, there are all sorts of people who will prey on the circumstances that people find themselves in by selling them snake oil, selling them substances that really do not work. In popular mythology, crushed almond kernels used to be a treatment for cancer, but it does not work; it just costs money. We need some sort of rational, sensible mechanism that brings about control and regulation of this whole area of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Five criticisms were brought up by the Opposition spokesman. The first was that we will have this overlap; therefore it is not achievable; therefore we should not do it. It is not logical to say that, because we have had huge gaps and an inefficient system for 88 years, we should not do anything about it because it will not work. If we are about anything in this place, we are about developing sensible ways of solving Australia's problems. From time to time there are bitter arguments and disputes in here, but we really need to think about sensible ways of solving some of our problems. We have here a united way of tying up this area of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The second criticism we heard was that there has not been enough consultation, and that industry does not want this and does not agree with it. I have not had large numbers of people rushing to my door telling me that. The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee has not found that to be so; the Minister has not found that to be so. So where are all these people going? Obviously they are going to honourable members on the other side of the House or they do not exist. We heard that in some way the appeal process would be unfair because when the decision on the appeal was given, no reasons would be provided for the appellant. It was said that in some way industry was not getting a fair go in the appeal process. But that practice is standard for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If one wants the reasons the Tribunal will provide them, but the reasons are not provided unless they are asked for. There is no difference in this legislation from what currently exists and what is the standard practice of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The third concern was that it would be necessary for Australian businesses to comply with manufacturing practices which were excessive and unreasonable. On that I simply say this: if one-third of them are not complying with a code which says that these are good manufacturing principles, then there is need for some change. I was horrified to hear the concern raised by Opposition members that if the businesses are made to comply with good manufacturing principles and good manufacturing practice, in fact they would be uncompetitive. We have had this mentality for too long in this country. We need to understand that if we are going to export, if we are going to produce good products, then the standard and the quality have to be first class. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that being asked to comply with good manufacturing principles is excessive is nonsense. Who will buy these goods overseas? How will we establish ourselves as having a good reputation in this area? It is an export oriented industry. How are we to establish ourselves unless we ask for quality products within Australia and outside Australia? If we import and export good quality products, then it will be a viable industry and it will provide for Australians a sustainable export industry and an assurance that the quality of therapeutic goods is outstanding, as it should be. The suggestion that being asked to comply with good manufacturing practices is excessive is a nonsense. Indeed, the Opposition should think again about whether it wants to use that argument in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We then got onto fees and charges. Indeed, the shadow Minister spoke at some length about it. He said that the charges that were going to be levied were excessive. The honourable member for Dundas said that this cross-subsidisation that would occur-we have not seen a final list of charges; an indicative list of charges has been circulated with industry and there has been an amount of discussion about it but there has not been a final list of charges-would in some way cause the breakdown of manufacturing in areas of therapeutic goods. Again, the Opposition is asking for cost recovery. This legislation recovers half of the cost of setting up this regulating mechanism. The cost is $15m; we will recover $7.5m. One could hardly suggest that was cross-subsidisation. One could say that it is reasonable fee setting to recover some of the costs that ensure the quality of products in this country. But the shadow Minister suggested that there should be no fees, no charges. He is suggesting that the taxpayers should pay for this. If it is not the consumers who pay, it is the taxpayers. So the user pays principle that is used from time to time on the other side goes out the window. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the principle the Opposition wants to enshrine, if that is the principle it wants to follow, that is okay. Every time there comes into this place some sort of Bill which relates to regulation and charges, which relates to levies on industries, which relates to any area like that, let us have consistency. The taxpayer should take all of those charges. If that is what the Opposition thinks, there should be no levies on industry, there should be no regulation. All of those things should be paid for by the public purse and the user should not pay. If that is the principle the Opposition is espousing, perhaps we could accept it. But there is inconsistency. It is clear that the fees that are indicatively charged and are proposed to be charged are reasonable. It is not excessive to pay $50 for annual listing. If a company is going to manufacture thousands of widgets and sell them all over the place, $50 a year will not break it. The suggestion that it might is nonsense. The suggestion that we will re-evaluate all those things that we have been evaluating is again just being negative; it is just spoiling. That is not what is proposed in this legislation, and the suggestion that that is what it is about is crazy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am looking for a rational reason for the Opposition opposing it but I cannot find one. It may be that there are areas of the regulations that the Opposition would agree with; the regulations are not finalised. The draft of the regulations has been developed with the industry. There has been a lot of consultation. People know about the regulations. There has been a great deal of discussion. We are concerned about the thrust, the principle behind the philosophical approach to this legislation. The philosophical approach is that for too long in this country each State has done its own thing in a disjointed way. Sometimes there is overlap; sometimes there are huge gaps. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we assess these goods sometimes at the point of supply, sometimes at the point of import. There is no control over the standard to which we produce products, which we may then export. That affects our reputation as an exporter of quality goods. That structure, which is piecemeal and has been built up over decades, requires change. If one is going to change the structure one needs to start with a principal. This legislation enshrines the principle that the Government will adopt a national approach. It will set up a mechanism that will allow present knowledge and experience to be used. It will allow that expertise and knowledge that exists overseas to be used, but it will fill in the gaps so that the whole painting is clear and there are no holes here and there and pieces where paint has not been laid onto the canvas. If you like the analogy, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be able to stand back, look at the picture and know that it is complete. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that by setting up this legislation the Government in some way is anti-export is a nonsense. The suggestion that by setting up this legislation the Government in some way will cripple industry and manufacturers is a nonsense. The Government is trying to tie them together. Some members of the Opposition understand this issue very well; others are perhaps a bit dim in their knowledge of this legislation-and I do not include the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) in that. However, I find it amazing that they oppose the legislation. The Opposition has implied that, with the assistance of the Democrats, it will block this legislation in the Senate. I hope that before it reaches that stage the Opposition will allow the legislation to be passed. It is only for the public good. Between now and when the legislation goes to the Senate, I hope the Opposition will give consideration to allowing the legislation to pass. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am amazed that a person with the professional skills of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), should talk about Australians drinking snake oil in this day and age. I wonder how many times he has prescribed that particular product for his patients. This debate needs to be lifted from the emotional level of the previous speaker's contribution to some factual information that will relate the debate to a modern pharmaceutical and device industry which is growing and developing and which needs careful attention by legislators. I refer the House to the body that was established by the Government to review business regulations and to ensure that the assessed impact of regulations was reviewed. The Government established that body also to ensure that all new regulations were efficient, cost effective and likely to achieve their desired objectives and that there was proper liaison with State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's own committee, which was established specifically for the purpose of looking at those factors, has bucketed the Government's approach in this instance. It is all right for Government members who have some penchant for regulation to come into this Parliament and say, `We are going to cram regulation after regulation down the throats of the Australian people and Australian manufacturers'. One has only to consider the situation in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the dispensing of prescriptions and the delivery of pharmaceuticals by Australia's chemists, to see that the Government is absolutely opposed to the proper delivery of services to clients. The Government has forgotten what the people of Australia really need. It is really enthralled with the bureaucratic process. If something is big, beautiful, difficult to manage, cumbersome, bureaucratic and costly, the Government seems to go for it. In this instance, it is making a grave mistake.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Opposition acknowledges the need for a national approach to therapeutic goods-that means goods of a pharmaceutical nature or device-and whilst there is a need for a national program and common practices to be adopted amongst the States, there is no need to adopt this mumbo-jumbo obstructive approach that the Government's own committee has so strongly criticised. A committee of the Government was set up within the bureaucracy to check whether or not Government proposals were efficient and workable. In March of this year, according to its report, that committee decided that the Government's approach was not appropriate for Australia's modern industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee cited a number of grounds on which it was critical of the intentions of the proposals of the Government and the Department. Firstly, it cited the refusal to recognise that any country but Australia has an absolute capacity to test any of those devices or pharmaceuticals. It appears that we have to reinvent the wheel and do everything here in Australia from scratch, which would be costly and stupid. Why can we not accept the standards of comparable countries, which often have gone through the process of research and development alongside those organisations that are seeking to break through into new and more advantageous products? It seems that the Australian bureaucracy and the responsible Minister are saying, `If it is not examined fully and in detail here in Australia, we do not trust anybody else'. </PARA>
<PARA> A consideration of the record of the current system reveals that it is very difficult to point to any damage that has been caused to any one Australian-certainly no deaths-through a failure of the system. We are moving to a new system. I believe that the Public Accounts Committee found an instance of one death that was caused by infected bandages that were imported into Australia. What is wrong with our import provisions when we are going to stamp on Australian manufacturers but we are not going to check imports to the same degree. That is crazy stuff. That five deaths occurred in a hospital because somebody used the wrong strength product is hardly a reason for changing the whole system. Hospitals should possess the technical competence to avoid mistakes like that. This will be a brand new system. Much of the intention is good but much of the delivery is bad. I do not intend to go into detail at this point; I will leave that until after dinner. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee established by the Government was given the following tasks: to assess the impact of the regulations; to screen the regulations and ascertain whether they were effective and efficient; to achieve the desired objectives of the Government; to liaise with State governments; and to ascertain whether or not the current measures meet those criteria. In so many areas they certainly do not meet those criteria, and the committee was correct in saying so. The economies of accepting overseas competence are obvious. The acceptance of existing drugs without further testing, regulation and registration is also apparent. Readily available drugs will all go through this process. Even though people can now buy those drugs off shelves in supermarkets, those products will have to be reassessed because we need a pristine system. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee commented on the outstanding results and performance of the pharmaceutical goods manufacturing industry of Australia, which hardly justifies the comment that some 35 per cent of Australian manufacturing facilities operate at unacceptable levels of quality control. That control has existed for a long time and I am sure that if that is the case-and I doubt that it is because the end product does not seem to indicate that-it has taken a long time for Commonwealth authorities to get round to commenting or encouraging State authorities to do anything about it. I doubt the veracity of that 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian pharmaceutical and therapeutic industries have a remarkable safety performance. We are talking about loading unnecessary costs on Australian industry. Those costs will not be applied to imports to the same degree and will seriously damage Australia's future manufacturing, both in the supply of import replacements and to take advantage of export potential. I am most critical of this because it matches government regulation in so many spheres. This week the Government was unwilling to deregulate a failed aviation industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At a time when inflation is annualised at an amazing level of 9.2 per cent, with an annual rate of 8 per cent; when the balance of payments is a massive $1.8 billion and that is considered a good figure for the month; when the pharmacists are reeling under the attacks of a Federal Government that seems to want to deny services to the community and proper remuneration to skilled and highly qualified people; when the airlines are in a mess, when one has to wonder whether John Elliott is running Ansett Airlines of Australia rather than Sir Peter Abeles and whether we could have had a different result from the airlines dispute at a time like this with all those public tragedies around the nation, we have the Government in this House day after day, time and again, quietly regulating more and more, controlling the activities of Australian business and the lives of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight we are debating regulations and legislation on an important issue, the supply of therapeutic products to the Australian community. If that is the case, the Government has got its priorities wrong. We have a framework for legislation; there are no regulations to spell out the detail on the Bill which is before the House tonight. This Bill, like so many others that have come to this House, is just a framework which is going to impose more and more costs on the Australian people. This proposal will raise about $30m from the therapeutic manufacturing industries-a $30m bill that will be eventually met by the consumers of Australia-and yet we do not know in detail how the Government is going to apply it. Those people who are responsible for supplying these products do not know how the regulations are going to apply to them; or they know nothing about the bureaucracy, the form filling and all the rest of the paraphernalia that will be imposed upon them. We have only a framework. </PARA>
<PARA> What a priority this Government has. It is wrecking the economy, it is wrecking the opportunity for people to move around the nation and at the same time it is quietly, day after day, imposing more and more costs on the Australian people. It is taxing this industry, and eventually the consumers, simply to placate a feeling that seems to exist in this Government that there are problems in the pharmaceuticals industry. There are no problems; the record demonstrates that there have not been any problems. There have been no deaths because things have not been properly inspected or attended to. The Opposition says there should be a national approach to this issue, but we are so concerned about what the Government is doing that we are proposing that this legislation should go to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for proper consideration, firstly, so that regulations can be assessed by the Senate and, secondly, so that those who are interested in the industry, including the consumers, can make representations to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to put this to a Senate committee, and two important factors make this critical. The Government set up its own Business Regulation Review Unit to evaluate the cost of regulation. That review unit has said that the Government is way off track. Its report is a condemnation of what the Government is doing. The Therapeutic Goods Bill is flawed. All of the proposals in the Bill are outlined in the Government unit's own report. On top of that, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of this Parliament has studied this matter and there have been serious reservations expressed by this bipartisan Committee. We have a parliamentary committee and a specialised unit looking at regulations, and both of those groups have said there are problems with what the Government is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposal under the Therapeutic Goods Bill will raise another $30m. That $30m will be raised by fees and levies and all sorts of things that do not exist at the moment. One notable feature is that the Government is to apply $13.2m to laboratory testing instead of $1.5m. It is going to increase that expenditure six-fold, for the protection of the Australian people. What it really means is that we are going to have a unit, paid for by the Government, which will be run by bureaucrats who are going to test products on a selective basis. This sort of testing can be done by ethical, well practised, commercial units that can be told with absolute certainty what the Government's requirements are. But no, we are going to expand the testing process so that there will be routine testing of new products after they have gained entry to the market, regular testing of prescription drugs and regular testing of certain devices such as hip replacement devices, dialysis machines and all other sorts of devices that are manufactured within Australia. There are quality alert provisions, according to the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and inspection and testing after consumer complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a unit that goes into this field and goes into a whole range of new testing. It is completely unnecessary to expand in this way. Testing is necessary but the expansion is the thing that horrifies me. The codes of GMP for therapeutic goods and for therapeutic devices are the key elements of this legislation. All it is about is controlling, from Canberra, one more industry. The Australian people have not suffered the difficulties of the Third World in the hands of unscrupulous suppliers or manufacturers. The record of this nation, with its modern education and well run institutions, can hold its own with that of any other nation in the world. The Public Accounts Committee went so far as to say that goods already on the market that only require regulation should not be re-evaluated, but the intention is to re-evaluate products that Australians have been buying for years. There is no point to that except to build an ivory tower. There is no public demand for this. The only thing that the public needs is an assurance that the quality of the products that have been on the market for years will be maintained. But there is going to be a re-evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament stated that under no circumstances should there be cross-subsidisation, but the purpose of the legislation is to raise funds, through fees, and then plough them back into other fields designated by the Government under this legislation. Some of those fields include education against drug abuse and all sorts of interesting things, but the Government's taxing policy is probably the critical factor. The Government has seen an opportunity to get more out of an industry-a total of $30m from goods, devices, and pharmaceutical and other therapeutic goods-and redirect those funds into legal systems, education outlets, adverse reactions monitoring and a whole range of things that are being proposed. We do not need this. </PARA>
<PARA> Let the Senate Committee have a good look at it and come forward with a sensible compromise between the positions of the Opposition and the Government. That can easily be done. The Opposition is not opposed to much of what is contained here, but we point to the stupidity of going to the extent that the Government is going to on the advice of its servants, flying in the face of its own unit set up to review business regulation and flying in the face of the Public Accounts Committee just to claim that Australia is going to have something special and different from the rest of the world. But becoming something special and different in this instance will mean the cost to manufacturers will be so great that many of them will be forced to stop manufacturing particular products in Australia and there will be more importation. </PARA>
<PARA> That is exactly the wrong strategy for Australia in the current economic circumstances. The additional costs proposed in the legislation will prevent those who are manufacturing in Australia from exporting into the world market-all in the name of something special and unique that is not mirrored in any other country in the world. We are not even prepared to accept the standards of and the examinations made in the United States, Great Britain, Europe, or anywhere else. We have to do it all ourselves. That is also one of the complaints of the Business Regulation Review Unit and the PAC. We will not accept the high standards imposed by the United States or by Great Britain; we have to run tests from day one as if the product is original and had never before been on the market. Even those mild pharmaceutical products which have been on the Australian market for years are retested. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the Government knows what it has got itself into. A few enthusiasts in the Government have been carried away with all this stuff. It is wrong; it is heading in the wrong direction for Australian industry and the well-being of the Australian consumer. They have had to suffer enough because of the Government. In this minor area, any additional cost will filter through the system to all pharmaceutical products. What will the Government do when the pharmacists tell it that because it has imposed these requirements on the manufacturing industry and additional costs have been imposed on pharmacists, it will have to increase pharmaceutical benefits? Of course, the Government will say to the pharmacists that they should dig it out of their own pockets because that is its classic approach to problems such as this: regulate, then make those affected by the regulations pay for the regulations that nobody in Australia wants. It is deplorable. It is typical of the Government that day after day in the House buries this type of legislation, while not being able to deal with the big issues. The Government is going in the wrong direction and it must change its attitude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank goodness for the clock! Thank goodness the 20 minutes on the clock was reduced to zero minutes! The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) made remarks about an industry that bears no resemblance to the industry we are talking about. Can honourable members imagine more regulation in an area as important as therapeutic goods? The honourable member, in his wide ranging debate, complained that inflation was at 8 per cent; the Opposition could never get it below 10 or 11 per cent. We know that a significant component of that--(Quorum formed) I thank my colleague for supporting me during my contribution on the Therapeutic Goods Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mitchell talked about regulation and went on to say at length that regulation was a particularly bad thing. I would have thought that in this particular industry, as distinct from those other areas of manufacturing endeavour, regulation was a good thing. I would have thought that regulation in the industry to make sure that proper standards were maintained was a good thing. The honourable member spoke of a number of things-the current account deficit, the chemists' remuneration and the airlines-in a very wide ranging debate before he got onto any point of substance at all. I took notes of anything the honourable member said that was even remotely related to the Bill. One thing that he did say was that he believed that it should go to a Senate committee for examination, as though that would solve the problem. We have heard of government by committee but this is really Opposition by committee. Can honourable members imagine the Senate setting up a committee to examine this when it has been through the Public Accounts Committee, when the Ministers-Federal and State-responsible for the carriage of this Bill have talked about this over a number of years? The Opposition still wants to send it to a Senate committee for examination. The mind boggles!</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mitchell talked about the increased cost of testing. Once again, I would have thought that was a good thing-$13.2m to make sure that those drugs were properly evaluated-to the extent that they are not tested at the present time. If funding increases from about $2m to $13m, so long as the testing is stricter and the consumers can be sure that the standard of those drugs is as good as that in the rest of the world, then it is money well spent. It seems to me that when we talk about the costs on local manufacturing and the costs which seems to be the focus of the honourable member for Mitchell's contribution, we should also look at the costs of not doing it. One of the reasons the legislation is brought forward is that Australia is finding it increasingly difficult to participate in international agreements for regulatory collaboration on therapeutic goods because of our lack of a national system, not only in terms of recording and testing these drugs, but also to make sure that in the international area the drugs can be seen by people in other countries to have been tested to a level that does meet the strict standards that are required. I would have thought that manufacturers, at least, would have seen that as a positive; that is, that if they desire to export the drugs-that is, get into the international market-they would make sure that those drugs were tested to a degree that the international market would find acceptable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague on the other side of the House is shaking his head like a golliwog. I am better briefed than he is and I am a lot better briefed than the honourable member for Mitchell. One other thing that the honourable member for Mitchell mentioned was one more industry being controlled from Canberra. I do not know where that is evident in the Bill. I do not know where that is evident in anything we are talking about here. I would have thought that the Bill we setting up here in the Federal Parliament recognises that the hotchpotch arrangements between the States and the Federal Government that have existed until now need examination and overhaul in a comprehensive way. One of the things that has bedevilled this country is the amount of duplication by the different parliaments which have responsibilities in the same areas. The Federal Government, by taking the lead in something as important as this with the cooperation of the States, means that we will have a much more comprehensive system which will ensure that the therapeutic goods sold in Australia meet the standards that consumers should expect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mitchell also made the point that there was no public demand. He said that the public was not demanding that we have this legislation. I suppose that if that were the criteria by which we enacted legislation there would not be much legislation enacted at all. I do not think that in the early days there was a great rush from Australia about thalidomide. I do not think there was a great rush to have the parliaments of Australia put in place comprehensive testing arrangements when thalidomide came onto the market. But one would have to agree that the scope and intent of this Bill are to protect against episodes such as that. So the argument the honourable member uses that there is no public demand does not hold water at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mitchell went on to say that there have been no deaths in Australia and he asked, `So why change?'. Again, I find that an extraordinary argument. The therapeutics industry is a very dynamic one. New products come on to the market all the time. It seems to me that with such a dynamic industry we have to move with it. The fact that there may not have been any deaths in Australia is no reason not to advance the control and testing of therapeutic goods. Let us look at why the legislation is required at all. As I have said, the legislation will create one national system to replace the current patchwork of controls. We found that there were great holes in the existing system through which some therapeutic goods could get on to the market without being properly tested, a process Australian consumers should expect. The present situation is inequitable to industry and unsatisfactory to consumers in that varying levels of scrutiny are applied to locally produced and imported goods. Some goods can enter the marketplace without any prior assessment or approval. For that reason alone the legislation before the Parliament today is not only warranted but also necessary. It is about time that this was done. We can always look back and ask, `Why was it not done before?' but it is certainly better late than never.</PARA>
<PARA> About 25 per cent of Australian manufacturers of therapeutic goods for human use are not manufacturing to internationally regarded standards of good manufacturing practice. That being the case, I am sure that the legislation before us will ensure that we lift the standards of those goods that are sold in Australia. That is a good thing. It might cost a little bit more-it really is a little bit more when we look at the total cost involved in this legislation-but I think the Australian consumer is well served by it. Australia is finding it increasingly difficult to participate in international agreements for regulatory collaboration on therapeutic goods because of our lack of a national system. With six States and two Territories, plus the Federal Government, all having a discrete area of control, it is very hard for manufacturers to ensure that when they put their goods up for international scrutiny they are accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has given strong encouragement for the new legislation. Overall, the scope of existing controls will not be markedly increased, rather the legislation will provide a uniform, national system. Yet to hear the honourable member for Mitchell talk we would think that this legislation will replace the whole scheme and that there will be massive changes in the industry. In fact, it brings the industry up to date and ensures that the hotch potch of existing controls work in a much more effective and efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the issue of fees. One might ask why the fees are being introduced. In line with the Government's policy on cost recovery, it has decided that the program will recover 50 per cent of its cost from the therapeutic goods industry. That is a good investment by the industry to ensure that its products are up to international standards. Certainly the Government will put in the other 50 per cent on behalf of the consumers. Therefore, the cost recovery from the industry will reflect the benefit it gets from the legislation. The most substantial fees and charges will be for product evaluation for registration, and the inspection and licensing of manufacturers. This is necessary if we are to ensure that the therapeutic goods for sale in Australia and for sale overseas reach the standards required so that people here and overseas can be sure that the product they buy has been tested and carries an approval with which they can feel confident. It should be pointed out that many other countries charge fees for the same services. So I do not think that we are the only country to do so. We do not do anything different from many other countries. Many other countries, like us, have seen the wisdom of having the industry contribute to the standards that we expect the industry to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the attitudes of the States and Territories. They have received drafts of the Therapeutic Goods Bill. All State and Territory health departments have supported the introduction of the national scheme. I know I do not have to point out to the House that all health Ministers are not Labor Party Ministers. There are health Ministers of other political persuasions. The point made by the honourable member for Mitchell is shot down by that one fact alone. It is not just this Government that supports it; it is supported by health Ministers around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The States and Territories are cooperating in the planning of the new legislation. New South Wales, the only State with a comprehensive licensing system for manufacturers of therapeutic goods, is investigating transitional arrangements for the transfer of licences to the national system. Again, we have cooperation from New South Wales and from all of the other States. Victoria, the only State that conducts premarket assessments of some therapeutic goods, has agreed that its regulatory machinery, the Proprietary Medicines Advisory Committee, can become part of the national system. Again we are drawing on the experience of the States to ensure that the national system incorporates all of the good things we have in the system at present and at the same time making sure that it is a much more comprehensive system so that consumers can feel confident that therapeutic goods, those made here and those imported, have gone through that testing process. </PARA>
<PARA> Model complementary legislation is being prepared by the Commonwealth which, if enacted by the States and Territories, will feed manufacturers and products which lie outside the scope of the Commonwealth legislation into the national system. Once again we have cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth to ensure that the industry benefits. There has been close consultation with industry associations, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) agreed to the release of the current draft Therapeutic Goods Bill to the associations and consumer groups for their input. Once again the Government has consulted with not only the State governments and Ministers for health but also the industry. In general terms, the industry supports the rationalisation of the legislation and the major elements of it. It beats me why, after all this process of consultation not only with State governments but also with the industry itself, we would want to send the legislation to a Senate committee. The mind boggles. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very few issues that may still be contentious. These include controls over exported drugs, some aspects of controls over advertising, release of information by the Department of Community Services and Health, and the final fee structure, which will not be decided until after a joint industry-Government committee meets later in the year. Although there are areas that the Government and the Opposition do not always see eye to eye on, I am sure that, with the consultation process that has been set up by the Government and followed through, we can be confident that by the time the legislation becomes operative those processes will have been gone through and consensus will reign. </PARA>
<PARA> But it really does beat me why the Opposition takes the stance that it does. It seems to me that the Opposition opposes everything for the sake of opposing it. To send the matter off to a Senate select committee is counterproductive. We have seen these stalling tactics over and over again. How many times have we referred matters like this to a Senate committee only to have the committee come back and endorse what the Government was doing in the first place?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Therapeutic Goods Bill raises many diverse issues. I am sure that there is a recognition by most honourable members that the concept of licensing, registration, listing of products, application of codes, good manufacturing practice and so on is a progressive step. My concern-and I am even more alarmed since listening to the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear)-is that a bureaucracy will be established in this country with enormous power, which will exercise control and charge the manufacturers extraordinary amounts which, in turn, will be passed on to the consumers. A figure of $30m is mentioned. Of course, under the current arrangements, the cost is about $2m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I look at the explanatory notes. Perhaps someone who can speak with greater knowledge and skill than I, and trained in the medical world, can throw some light on one matter in the explanatory notes. Part 2 of the explanatory notes, under `Clause 10-Determination of standards', states:</PARA>
<PARA> Subclause 10 (1) allows the Minister to declare, by Gazettal of an order, a standard for therapeutic goods or a class of therapeutic goods. Any such standard (commonly known as a Therapeutic Goods Order) takes precedence over a monograph in the British Pharmacopoeia or the British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary). </PARA>
<PARA>I would be very interested to hear some explanation of that. Does it mean that we will have an authority that regards itself as having greater technical and scientific know-how and that this authority will become a means of dictating the operation of all aspects of this field? Therapeutic goods have existed really for many generations. Most of us can recall our family homes and seeing the things that our forebears had on their shelves. A lot of the remedies were not to be scoffed at. They did not have to have all the nonsense of this Bill to determine whether items were something people might find useful, but with the proper warnings. I believe that in those days people were very well sustained health-wise, particularly in the far flung parts of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that modern technology, research and medicine have produced many life-saving drugs. Let us think of the difficulty confronting the pharmacy industry today because of the enormous hike in the cost of pharmaceuticals. That is what the Government is making such a fuss about at the present time. Is it the intention now to push the usage of therapeutic goods by the community into a similar category so that the costs become so high that people are forced to either pay up or go without? That is really what it will come down to. Let us have some standards, a listing and so on. This is obviously going to take it far beyond that. It is going to make determinations, and those determinations will be very expensive indeed. Many of the old-fashioned usages will either fall by the wayside or be replaced by something else that will, obviously be very expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> I am intrigued that the honourable member for Canning had so much to say in his speech. I recall only in the last year or so the honourable member for Canning ridiculing the medical profession, making public utterances unfairly and without substantiation attacking the medical world of this country. I wonder whether his lending of his total support to this legislation in the way that he has is yet again evidence of some collusion that, if we knew the real facts, would suggest that part and parcel of a big brother approach is that we should tell people what is good for them regardless of whether there is a scientific reason to support that advice. </PARA>
<PARA> In one approach, so much is embodied in this legislation that it is all-encompassing. It is typical of this Government and what it has done in respect of the health services of this country since it took office to create a bureaucratic monster wherever it can, and, as a consequence, establish an enormously high cost factor, and then expect the public to pay for it. Is that the way to help those families who really have a dependence on many of the things that would come under the heading of therapeutic goods?</PARA>
<PARA> We see these days in health food stores and similar outlets shelves stacked full with all sorts of things that will come under the jurisdiction of this legislation. There is much concern by individuals and families for the environment and for those things they believe are related to nature and what nature has endowed. Will this create a situation where many of these things will begin to get a little beyond their reach? I believe it will. I would have to see a lot of evidence to convince me otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia today is experiencing an enormous wave of enthusiasm for nature, the environment and related things. What is being put to this House tonight seems to me to contradict that course very substantially. It is not appropriate to begin to talk about various specific matters, but I can think of a number of examples in rural areas-in electorates such as my own. Many things are produced-and have been for many years-that come under the heading of therapeutic commodity. Nothing untoward has occurred. There has been recognition of the products and an export trade has been established. One example of such a product is tea-tree oil. There are divergent views as to its value and usefulness, but I find that it has a wide range of applications. Many people have benefited from the use of it. It is now growing into a very substantial industry, one in which a big expansion in export trade is envisaged. In fact, the expansion has begun to occur. Will the Government's net be thrown over it in such a way that it will be impeded? Will its cost factors be jeopardised because of the need for compliance with whatever regulations are to be established under this legislation? The explanatory notes tell us, as I said a moment ago, that the determinations can take precedence over recognised standards that are usually applied to goods of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is sound reason why this legislation should be looked at again. Evidence should be collected from authorities that have the means to advise the Parliament in an effective and practical manner, particularly on the establishment of standards, the way in which those standards should be determined and the subsequent administration of those standards. It is all very well to say that perhaps some risks have been taken but nothing has been put to this House that gives any evidence of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In any country a commodity will be produced that comes very close to what I referred to under the heading of the kinds of things that would be covered here-in other words, a subterfuge. Will there be a law to say that that cannot happen? I doubt it. What if somebody comes up with a particular fetish such as we have seen over the years? People have attempted to market-and in fact have marketed-cures for cancer and things of that kind. There have been enormous hoaxes imposed on the community. I would rather see some legislation introduced that provided a means for assessment of things of that sort so that there was a reduction in the element of risk for well meaning people who read in an advertisement or publication a claim that something could be achieved by the use of whatever product it might happen to be. The substance to which I referred a moment ago was manufactured by boiling lantana branches. This was claimed to provide a remedial cure for cancer. Many people paid enormous sums of money a few years ago for the product in the hope that there was some substance to the claims. </PARA>

We do not need to create a bureaucracy merely to impose a cost, to create a division between recognition of what are already well established provisions for checking and on assertion of whether a commodity has a basis of recognition. To establish some new standard without a means of determining what that standard will be, merely on the whim of a section of a department, without any recourse to some higher authority, is the real danger in this legislation. It is for that reason that I believe further scrutiny is necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was with some surprise and, indeed, a great deal of sadness that I listened earlier to the speech by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner). He has a reputation for being a caring member of this House. He is Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and runs that Committee remarkably well. Today, he either misunderstood the position, particularly of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), or he misrepresented it. The problem that we on this side of the House have is not with the principles of the legislation, nor, indeed, with the need for the legislation; our problem is with the details of the legislation and, in particular, with the absence of any detailed regulations. The Government is yet again asking us to buy a pig in a poke. The industry and the Opposition both support the need for appropriate principles to be established and enforced. But this legislation is not appropriate; it is grossly flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I heard the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) say some remarkable things. He said, `Regulations are good for you'. It sounds like a new recipe. He also claimed quite incorrectly that this legislation had been examined by the Public Accounts Committee. That is completely false. The principles and the area have certainly been examined by the Public Accounts Committee but this legislation has not been examined by it. He also said, `The increased cost of testing is a good thing'. It does not matter about the increased costs for small businesses; it does not matter about the increased costs for consumers-in this case, of course, the sick in our society; it does not matter about increased bankruptcies or increased exports. He said that increased costs are a good thing. I point out to him that the alternative to not doing it is not to do it at all, but to do it efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> He also made some rather strange remarks in a roundabout sort of way about the fact that there was no central control in Canberra, and then went on to support centralisation of the bureaucracy in Canberra. He also missed the whole point of the matter, which is that the intent of the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 is fine. We are very happy with the intent of the Bill; it is the details of the legislation and regulations with which we have major problems. That is why we wish to refer it to a Senate select committee. I point out in passing that our opposition to this Bill will not necessarily hold up the Bill. It is not scheduled to come into effect until between March and July 1990. There is plenty of time for a Senate select committee to examine the Bill and report back. The Government might be beginning to realise the flaws in this legislation and the fact that the committee is very likely to reject the legislation outright. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather sad to see this sort of legislation. It is the end-of-the-Roman-empire type legislation. It represents the last days of a falling government. I do not know whether the responsibility for this terrible, appalling legislation lies with the public servants, the lawyers or, as in the end where the buck must stop, with the Government. But the Bill is so grossly flawed that it is amazing to see it come before this House. We are being asked, as I say, to buy, sight unseen, a whole host of regulations. In some cases with legislation that does not matter, but this legislation basically comprises regulations with a Bill to support them, not a Bill containing a few regulations to fill in the gaps; the regulations comprise the heart of this Bill. Basically, we do not have them available to us to examine and debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We agree with many of the aims of the legislation. We completely support the aim of improving the standards, of the industry and the level of protection to the Consumer. We agree that licences in some form are worth while, that fair controls are appropriate and that uniform regulations and legislation across the States would be beneficial. But there are major problems. On that uniformity question, for example, there are difficulties with advertising. Currently, manufacturers in this area must comply with the Media Council of Australia code. Those who wish to sell their items in New South Wales have to comply with the New South Wales therapeutic goods and cosmetics Acts. Now we have these new regulations, all of which are significantly different. What is the poor manufacturer supposed to do? There are clearly financial impositions, in terms of time and red tape, upon small businesses. The Government keeps on telling us that small businesses may well be the lifeblood of this country's future economy. If that is the case, it is going to be a very anaemic looking economy-even more so, if possible, than it looks at present. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K4">Dr WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland. Let us look at the operation of the Bill. I understand that, basically to appease the Victorian Government, the Proprietary Medicines Advisory Committee from Victoria is likely to have a major input into, if not to be the overseeing body for, this Bill. There are major problems with this Committee. In particular, it is vastly inferior to the equivalent New South Wales committee. The industry is very concerned, as is the Opposition, that there is no industry input into this Committee and that the amount of expertise in the Committee is very limited. If the Government is really looking for a committee which is worth while and which works, why not use the New South Wales committee, which is open to representation from industry and has expert advice on it? Clearly Victoria is being bought off politically. Unfortunately, this is at the expense of quality. Clearly in the end there must be only one body in Australia. It is inappropriate to expect the various manufacturers to conform with half a dozen different pieces of legislation. It is bad enough having to try to face up to this option before us now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the Code of Good Manufacturing Practice just briefly. This will be the basis of the licence to manufacture the goods. We support the high standards that this requires, but effectively this is just more red tape and is considered by ourselves and by virtually the whole of the industry involved to be excessive. It will be an extra stratum on top of the United Kingdom (UK) European Community and the United States of America requirements as well as the World Health Organisation requirements. Surely it must be possible to integrate the two, three or four, or however many countries we are looking at exporting to, to make sure that the imposition upon manufacturers, importers and exporters is not as great as at present. Surely it should not be beyond the legislators to organise that appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major problem areas that we have concerns the question of fees. The Government has stated, I believe, that 50 per cent of the costs will be recoverable. These amount to some $15m in costs imposed on what is really still-although it is rapidly expanding-a small industry. If we compare these fees, for example, with the UK costs, the latter are #1,000 in the first place and then #500 per annum, whereby in Australia for a full licence the equivalent cost will be $13,000 every single year. Not much will happen in every single year. In every single year after the first year somebody will press a little button on a computer and say `Yes, it is the same as last year-$13,000. Thank you very much'. It is all in keeping with the imposition of taxes and extra financial burdens on industry and individuals that always comes from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this will be an extra cost upon, in the first place, the companies involved and, in the second place, upon the consumers. The Government has made it very clear-and the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), I believe, has stated-that it expects that the extra costs will be passed on to the consumer. First of all, we will have decreased international competitiveness. As the honourable member for Tangney pointed out, this is one of our boom industries in terms of exports. The cost to the Government is often just a question of pushing a computer button. The value to the industry is almost zilch in most cases. Very little service will be offered by the Government for these exorbitant fees and there will be no relationship between the fees charged and the service offered. This relationship was one of the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, which the Government is so keen on citing. We should bear in mind, of course, that the industry already pays corporate taxes. The fees will result in an increased number of bankruptcies in an industry area that we need to encourage, not discourage. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a terrible piece of legislation. If these fees are essential why not, for example, have exemptions as appropriate or give a greater differential of fees with some relationship to the type of service offered, again as recommended by the Public Accounts Committee? For example, why are products which have been on the market for years, and which are absolutely safe and have never had any problems at all, to be re-evaluated at enormous cost to manufacturers, importers and exporters when clearly it will be no advantage to the manufacturer, exporter or consumer. The only advantage is to the Government in the money it will rake in. Clearly these extra fee impositions are revenue raisers-from the highest taxing Australian Government known to mankind. The fees include such nonsense as an evaluation fee for the exemption; an application fee for registration; an evaluation fee for the registration; and an inspection fee for the registration. There is an application fee for the licence and an inspection fee for the licence. This is in spite of the fact that the Public Accounts Committee said that all such registration fees should be minimal. These are not once off; they are annual fees-year in, year out. They represent more taxes upon, in the end, the consumer and upon the industry involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Supposedly the Government, as I said earlier, is recouping only 50 year cent of cost. That may be acceptable if it were 50 per cent of the costs that were appropriate and necessary. These sorts of fees are inappropriate and unnecessary and are an imposition. The Government should not be proud of recovering only 50 per cent of them when those fees are, on the whole, unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> We have very little confidence in the ability of the Department involved to actually do the testing properly. I have in front of me countless examples of inefficiencies from the Department. One springs to mind as a good example-or a bad example, whichever way one looks at it-of the incompetence of the Department under the Minister's control. It relates to a device called a Medis infuser pump. There are mark 1 and mark 2 versions which are very similar. They are imported by a small company called Medical Specialities Australia. I know the director of this company. She has worked very hard to get a small company off the ground and now, after years of work, is just beginning to see the company expanding its activities to the benefit of not only herself but also Australia. This pump basically allows ambulant patients to remain ambulant-and therefore again save the Government money, because the patients do not have to be hospitalised-while they receive drugs of various types rather than being tied to a bed by an intravenous drip. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that there were limitations in the design of the pump-this is the mark 1 version-but that since it was inexpensive the Department had decided to pass it. This was in writing from the Minister. It seems to me to be crazy. Either the thing is good or it is bad. The fact that it does not cost a great deal surely should not influence the decision as to whether it is safe to be allowed to be used on the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly this device is absolutely safe. It is widely used overseas for literally thousands of patients. It has been tested in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. It has been tested and proven by the stringent criteria available in those countries and has been tested in Australian public hospitals. In this situation, why can we not accept the stringent criteria of the United States and the European Community? One leading hospital biophysician in this area, having tested the pump and having said that he thought it was an excellent device and completely safe, was told by the medical devices and dental products evaluator not to put his approval of the product in writing because of the politics of the evaluation. That is the trouble. This is a very good pump which is very worth while. There has been an extreme amount of evaluation going on-completely beyond what was necessary. The pump has been proven overseas and an almost identical pump has been proven in Australia. Yet we are going through the red tape, the bureaucracy and the expense to the company and, in the end, the consumer of the unnecessary evaluation of this very worthwhile device. There are too many politics in this area. There is too much money grabbing, too much regulation and too much central control. As I said, we support reasonable controls, but these controls are interfering and unreasonable. We do not want red tape or this gross interference and we do not want the money grabbing. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area causes me some concern. In my profession prior to entering Parliament I had quite a lot to do, both directly and indirectly, with the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). Because of that, I have enormous respect for that organisation. I understand from the explanatory memorandum that this organisation will be responsible for the drugs and poisons part of this legislation. The problem is that, for all its wonderful reputation, the NHMRC is not known for its understanding of industrial problems or for its sympathy towards industry. It is entirely inappropriate that the drugs and poisons part of this legislation should be governed by a body such as the NHMRC, which is not representative, which has no industry input, and which on the whole is not accountable, when there are virtually no good appeal mechanisms against its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also mention in passing that this Bill gives formal recognition to the NHMRC in a somewhat backdoor sort of way. If the Government wants to recognise it, that is fine; we can discuss that separately. But if that is to done in a formal way, why not introduce the legislation separately rather than by this back handed sort of way?</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the NHMRC committee, it would be much more appropriate, surely, to have a separate committee and to have the NHMRC as part of that committee, to have industry representatives on that committee and to have an adequate appeals mechanism. The current appeals mechanism is to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. August body though it may be, it has no expertise in these particular areas and it seems entirely inappropriate to me that, in an area which needs great expertise, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be the sole arbiter. Surely there should be a separate appeals mechanism set up which will allow for experts in the area to adjudicate upon points of difference, as there almost certainly will be with the NHMRC's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are all sorts of problems with this Bill which I have covered before. One of the problems is that it has not been thought through carefully enough. I have to say, of course, that this is typical of this Ministry, the Ministry which is known for half-truths, which bases, for example, the pharmacy problems upon very flawed data and propaganda and which resorts to insulting the members of that valuable profession. Will it resort now to insulting another group, the hospital and other manufacturers of therapeutic goods in this country, who will not toe the left wing socialist line? The things that are flawed at the moment are all related to this Minister's management. This particular Bill clearly will not improve the standards of the industry. It will increase the costs to both patients and taxpayers. It will not increase the protection of the consumer. It will send many of our small businesses bankrupt. It will decrease our overseas competitiveness. It will clearly reduce our exports. This flawed Bill should be withdrawn. </PARA>

The Department is developing bilateral and multilateral agreements, especially in the exchange of product evaluation and good manufacturing practice inspection reports. That is a very important process, as people would recognise in an international environment, not only for ease of improving the processing of products through the system but also to ensure that we have an international system that we can work on in a trade environment as well. This is an administrative matter and not something that is dealt with in the legislation. Thirdly, the products already legally on the market will not be automatically re-evaluated. However, the legislation does allow review if current evidence indicates that there is a problem and it is necessary. It was also claimed that the codes of good manufacturing practice are imposed without consultation. That is simply not so. The codes are developed jointly with industry in the process which is occurring now with the revision of those codes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comment quoted from the Public Accounts Committee report was a reference to preliminary development of the proposals in 1986, not to the development of the current Bill. In fact, a detailed proposal on the legislation was released publicly back in October 1988, which is a good 12 months ago now. In May this year a later update was issued, a draft of the Bill was released to industry, consumer groups and the States and the instructions for the regulations were also released for comment. Wide consultations were held. I believe that the Bill reflects those discussions. I think it is interesting that some members have commented about the industry's lack of consultation. I think it is fair to say that if it is all summed up, not too many pieces of legislation in relation to governing an industry have gone through such a rigorous but nonetheless very positive process as this Bill has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not aware of any requests to the Department, where a consultation has been turned down, whether it was for a personal meeting, telephone discussion or participation in seminars. If honourable members opposite really had a wide understanding of the industry and a wide contact with the industry, as the Department certainly has, I think they would find that this Bill has received a very high degree of acceptance. It is noteworthy that, although the Opposition claimed that it has concerns about lack of consultation, it did not actually take up the opportunity to get a briefing on this Bill from the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to the issue of cooperation with the States and the Territories, because this is something that has been talked about in terms of overlap, duplication and such things. The real fact of the matter is that under legislation such as this, which involves all the States, over the life of the Federation of this country, although overlaps and duplications have occurred, there has also been a hideous number of gaps, and it is through those gaps that many problems have occurred. If there is a slight degree of overlap and duplication, particularly in the case of the Victorian legislation, that is nothing compared with the multiplicity of duplication and overlap that has occurred in the past. But within a short time even that will have been removed and we will have a national system of assessment of therapeutic goods regulations, not an additional system. In fact, it is for that reason that the Commonwealth has at all stages provided detailed information to State and Territory governments. I am very pleased to confirm that all States and Territories have indicated that they will participate in this national scheme. The States and Territories recommended that the Commonwealth draft complementary legislation. Such a draft has been prepared and, in the near future, it is expected to be referred to the parliamentary counsel committee. </PARA>

<PARA> The much cited Business Regulation Review Unit report must be fundamentally questioned. When we are talking about such things as therapeutic goods and devices, we are talking about medicines that people take and devices and appliances that people have to use on a day to day basis in dealing with their lives, health and safety, and such a report must be fundamentally questioned when it starts from the premise that a problem is substantiated only if identifiable deaths occur. My goodness, do we have to get to that stage before some action is taken? That would be grossly irresponsible. We have seen enough problems in the past in this area. It is bad enough that from time to time some things can slip through. Certainly, there needs to be as much effort as possible to reduce the damage to an individual's health. Any risk of death must be clearly identified and action taken to overcome that. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to the excellent, very articulate and very well educated points made by my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) and the detailed investigations of the Public Accounts Committee, which he chaired. There is no doubt that the Public Accounts Committee was of the view that there are serious problems in the industry which must be addressed. I praise all members of that Committee from both sides of this House for the work they put into the report. I am very pleased to be in a position to have so much of the report incorporated in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as regulations are concerned, I think the industry overall-there may be many small examples of it-is very pleased with this legislation and recognises its value to Australia in developing an internationally competitive environment and an internationally respected environment for therapeutic goods and devices. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as fees and charges are concerned, it is extremely disappointing that the whole thrust of the Opposition's comments is to place costs on industry before any consideration of public health. That is a shame. It is in conflict with what the public would believe, and they are the people being served by the manufacturers, by the Government and by this legislation. It is those people whose health is to be protected. The Cabinet's decision on fees and charges is extremely fair. Fifty per cent of the costs, rather than 100 per cent, are to be recovered from the industry. It is worthwhile noting-it has certainly been noted by industry-that setting up a government-industry consultative committee to advise the Minister on the scale of fees and their utilisation within the therapeutic goods program is a very positive step in terms of the relationship between industry, the Department of Community Services and Health and government. That will be a very valuable addition to the area of therapeutic goods and their regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank all honourable members who participated in the debate. I congratulate and thank the Public Accounts Committee of this Parliament on the work it put into this matter over a period. People who are on those committees do a lot of work. They go all around the place and spend long hours working to get consensus and agreement on the reports. Much of that has been reflected in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout debate on the Therapeutic Goods Bill 1989 and amendments moved by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), the Opposition has played a very constructive role. It has sought to accommodate the Minister, although we have our points of difference. However, we very much regret that the same sort of constructive role has not been played by the Minister in the pharmacy dispute, which he has deliberately inflamed by painting pharmacists throughout this country as greedy, self-serving monetarists. For that reason, whilst the Opposition cooperates in this matter, we ask that the Minister take a far more fair-minded approach to what is becoming a very bitter, divisive dispute within our community. It is affecting pharmacists, their families and their clientele. It is outrageous that this Minister is treating the pharmacists in this fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief in this committee stage. I have laboured under the practical human difficulties, since making my speech in the second reading debate, of not being able to be in two places at one time. Hence, I have not been here for the comments of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples). Simply put, the amendments have been moved by the Government and we will not oppose them. We will not be dividing or voting on them. That is consistent with what I said during the second reading debate. I imagine that the Minister was labouring under the same problems because he was not here to hear my remarks. If he was not able to hear them on the blower, I hope that he and the Government will consider them carefully because we did enter into this debate with very good bona fides and have clearly stated-if not exhaustively, certainly extensively-the problems we have with this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have given the Government plenty of notice about our intended plan of action in the Senate-that is, to oppose the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Bill at this time and to seek its referral to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I say to the Minister that, as with the vocational register and its handling by a Senate select committee on that occasion, if the Committee is given reporting dates, it is quite likely that we could still see the Committee report back to the Senate in plenty of time for the Government, if it is still the government at that stage, to be able to meet the starting date of this legislation, which is March 1990. I hope that the Government will take a very constructive attitude to the way in which this Bill is handled in the Senate. I hope also that, on this occasion and on all future occasions, so far as the health portfolio and so far as my working relationship with the Government are concerned, the Government will learn that the Opposition will not support legislation that is very much dependent upon regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my contribution earlier today, there has been an about-face in the health portfolio in recent times. Normally legislation has attendant upon it some regulations that provide some administrative arrangements or perhaps plug a few gaps here and there. However, in at least two major pieces of legislation relating to the health portfolio the reverse has been the case. The Parliament has been presented with enabling legislation which is pretty innocuous, but the real guts of the Bill-if I can use that vernacular phrase-is to be found in the regulations. It is quite unreasonable for the Government to expect us to pass legislation on a wing and a prayer, as it were, without being able to see the regulations. I simply make that point and hope that a constructive debate will take place in the Senate where the numbers are a little more finely balanced. I hope also that we will be successful in referring the legislation to a responsible Senate committee which, at the end of the day, carries a Government majority but, importantly, provides for consultation and communication with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I came back into the chamber I managed to catch the tail end of the remarks of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care when he was speaking about the extensive consultation with industry. I do not doubt that the Minister has received extensive submissions from industry and that he, his Department and his ministerial office have sought advice from industry. However, I wish to make two points about consultation. Firstly, even in the dying months of this Government's administration it must make an effort to reach out into the wider areas of industry groups and not simply content itself with dealing with matters that it might feel comfortable with. In other circles these are known as the peak groups or peak forums. If the Minister's attention is drawn to my speech during the second reading debate he will learn that hundreds of very small firms in this country which, with the right encouragement and environment, may grow to be big firms. Those small firms are largely unrepresented. They do not belong to organisations such as Australian Medical Devices and Diagnostics Association Inc. or similar organisations. The Government should make an effort to ascertain the effect of its intended legislation on the grass roots version of industry. Secondly, I make a very fundamental point that consultation does not occur when, following the receipt of advice, that advice is refused. Consultation is genuine only if there is a bit of give and take and a bit of understanding shown. </PARA>
<PARA> I reaffirm that the principle of the legislation is first class and is not contested by the Opposition. As part of the maturation of this country we will move towards a more uniform and more national code of practice in this whole area. I believe that that will be achieved only by the Government playing a more cooperative role with the States. I spelt all of that out during my speech in the second reading debate. I do not believe that the Government is going about this in the most appropriate way to achieve the success that it is looking for. Hopefully the Opposition can assist the Government by moving in the way that it will be moving in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the House are two anti-dumping Bills which were introduced on 5 October. They are the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989 and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1989. They are companion Bills which seek to make amendments and effect a restructuring of the Government's anti-dumping legislation which is contained in three Acts, namely, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act of 1975, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act of 1988 and the Customs Act of 1901.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anti-dumping measures in Australia were originally incorporated in the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906. Later, anti-dumping measures were included in the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act 1921, the Customs Tariff (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1961 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975. No doubt the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who takes an intense and keen interest in legislation surrounding the issue of dumping because of his desire to protect the interests of his constituents, particularly those involved in the citrus juice industry, will be somewhat familiar-although I suspect not intimately familiar-with all of the provisions of the preceding Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills seek firstly to remove any difficulties that might arise as a result of the High Court's deliberations during the Air Caledonie case. This is done by transferring sections of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to the Customs Act of 1901 by repealing them under the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989 and effecting the transfer through the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill. I suspect that radios throughout Australia are being turned off at this stage. However, I do make the point that the listing of the legislation and a detailing of the mechanics surrounding the changes to the principal heads of legislation is very important. I feel very sorry for those listeners to the parliamentary broadcast who do not have as detailed or as intimate a knowledge of or interest in this complex legislation as do members such as the honourable member for Farrer. </PARA>
<PARA> The High Court decision in the Air Caledonie International v. The Commonwealth case, which arose when the Government sought to impose a `fee for immigration clearance' in respect of international airline passengers entering Australia, dealt at length with section 55 of the Constitution. Section 55 provides that laws imposing taxation deal only with the imposition of taxation. It was considered in the past that the prohibition on mixing taxing and non-taxing Acts was not infringed when an Act dealing only with the imposition of customs duties amended a principal Act which contained provisions concerning non-customs duty matters. The High Court, as a result of the decision in this 1988 case, now construes section 55 as extending to laws in the form in which they stand from time to time, after amendment, with the requirement that such laws deal only with the imposition of taxation or duties of customs. </PARA>
<PARA> As it was considered by the Government that some problems could arise due to this decision, the restructuring of this legislation is being proposed to ensure that laws imposing duties of customs are in separate Acts from laws dealing with non-duty matters. Consequently we have the first Bill, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1989 which repeals a plethora of current sections. The second of the Bills before the house this evening is the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill 1989. This Bill is the vehicle used for transferring to the Customs Act 1901 the sections repealed from the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1989. I very much fear that at this very point we lose the few remaining listeners we have to this parliamentary broadcast. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also proposes to make a substantive legislative change. The Government is seeking through this legislation to allow a profit margin to be included in the matters considered when a normal value is being construed. I do make the point, though, that this will not apply where sales in the country of export have been at a loss for an extended period. This is a very important matter to members of the National Party of Australia and to our coalition Liberal Party members representing rural areas, because dumping is a fundamental concern to a whole range of agricultural industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Farrer says, on this occasion only. Dumping occurs when the export price is less than the normal value of goods in the domestic market of the country of export-a definition you yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know only too well. Sometimes, because the goods are not sold on the domestic market of the exporting country or because of a centrally planned economy, the normal value on the home market is not available and therefore a normal value has to be constructed. Normal values are constructed under section 5 (2) (c) or 5 (4) of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. According to the second reading speech of the Minister-a best seller at the time-it was the Government's intention last year in amending three provisions of the current section 5 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 that a profit could be included in circumstances specified in regulations to the Act. I should note that this was part of the same legislative package which last year created the Anti-Dumping Authority. After that Authority was established in September, the Government referred to it the matter of the regulations which were to prescribe the circumstances where a profit component should be included, must be included, in the normal value constructions or, in the words of the Minister, in his letter to the Anti-Dumping Authority dated 24 November 1988:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the recent changes to Australia's anti-dumping legislation were made, Section 5 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 was amended so as to provide that when constructing a normal value a profit component is to be included only in circumstances identified by Regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now necessary to establish those circumstances . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This action was also taken against a background of the Gruen review of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 and preceded the amending legislation passed in the Parliament last year. The Government decided to reject Professor Gruen's recommendation that section 5 (9) of the Act be repealed. This legislation is a result of the findings of the Authority in regard to this and other matters. The Authority noted in its deliberations on the issue of including a profit margin:</PARA>
<PARA>The Authority is convinced that it was never the Government's intention that a profit not be included when constructing a normal value in non-section 5 (9) cases. It believes that it has the general support of all areas of the business community for the inclusion of a profit in such cases. . . </PARA>
<PARA>This quote from the Authority's report No. 4 brings me to mention the section 5 (9) exception which, against the Gruen recommendation, the Government decided to retain in totality but in a tightened form. Section 5 (9) deems the occasion when sales are not in the ordinary course of trade. A similar provision is also used in the United States, Canada and the European Economic Community, and is in accord with article 6 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and article 2 (4) of the GATT anti-dumping code. The Authority looked at the construction of a normal value in the cases where section 5 (9) has been invoked. In examining the extent to which normal values were constructed, Professor Gruen found that of the various ways in which a normal value could be determined, only 15 out of a total of 176 instances, being 8.5 per cent, resulted from section 5 (9) being invoked. According to the Authority, the Australian Customs Service has advised that this ratio has changed little. The Authority stated on page 29 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . There is a strong argument for never including a profit when section 5 (9) has been invoked and a normal value is being constructed under section 5 (2) (c). </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the criteria under section 5 (9) is that the goods must have been sold at a price below the cost to make and sell them. If the goods were sold at a price exactly equal to the cost to make and sell them-(i.e. at a profit level of zero)-then section 5 (9) could not be invoked. Providing the other requirements of section 5 (1) were met, the selling price would be recognised as the normal value for the purpose of a dumping inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Authority concluded that after conducting a number of dumping inquiries it might be possible to identify some circumstances in which a profit margin could be included in section 5 (9) cases, but recommended that at this stage a profit margin should not be included. </PARA>
<PARA> It also raised matters concerning effecting the transfer of a number of minor amendments, concerning the following matters: the publication of details relating to undertakings; the ability to partially revoke notices and partially release a person from an undertaking; to allow for securities for a breech of an undertaking; and to make clear the power of the Comptroller-General of customs to reject applications under section 269tc. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is accepting the recommendation of the Authority and this legislation along the same lines as the Authority made its recommendation in regard to section 5 (9)-that is, at this stage. We accept the recommendation of the Authority at this stage. Before very long the coalition parties will return to government and we will then review the existing dumping arrangements. We will also review the effectiveness of the Anti-Dumping Authority, we will simplify the legislative provisions, and we will ensure adequate resources are available to Customs to enable speedy resolution of dumping complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms are absolutely necessary and long overdue and they stand as testimony to this Government's failure to implement reform in a micro-economic sense; that is, this Government will not tackle reform of industry on a specific basis. Instead, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) employs one arm and one arm only of government economic policy, being, of course, monetary policy. The Treasurer fails to address either fiscal policy or wages policy in a way that will bring about productivity and efficiency in this period of Australia's economic stagnation. Moreover, Government members run as fast as their cowardly little legs will take them from micro-economic reform whether on the waterfront, with coastal shipping, or the issues surrounding privatisation. The Government will not face its responsibilities. How then can industry-let alone primary industry-maintain a competitive edge on corrupted world markets when its own competitive edge at home is either hindered or in no way assisted by government?</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House is of tremendous importance in bringing about micro-economic reform. Sadly, it is a little too late. Moreover, it is just too little. The fact is that unless the Government has the courage, the determination and the vision to bring about extensive micro-economic reform, this country will continue, sadly, to have record balance of payments figures, galloping inflation, increasing unemployment and record interest rates. We can consider the legislation tonight in the midst of a falling economic policy which does not merely threaten to crush the Government, but is actually crushing the Government with its weight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in support of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill. I guess there is no greater concern for primary industries today than the fear that they will be ruined by a flood of cheap imported products. This fear is born of a genuine concern that in Australia we are breaking down protectionist trade barriers. At the same time, our farmers know of and see only too well a wall of protectionism in the European Community, the United Kingdom and some of our Asian trading partners. Their argument goes: why should we break down our defences when other countries are not doing so? We are leaving ourselves open to ruin from the dumping of surplus subsidised products. Their other concern is the time lag between reporting a case of dumping and the time taken to see whether dumping is occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the second reading speech, the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) says that the second substantive proposal in the Bill is aimed at implementing the Government's recent decision announced on 10 September on the inclusion of a profit margin when the normal value of goods is being constructed. As we know, dumping occurs when the price at which goods are exported to Australia is less than normal value of the goods in the country of export. This normal value is usually just the price of the goods in the domestic market of the country. However, a problem arises in some instances when goods are produced only for export. The normal value must then be obtained in some other way. These Bills set out to address that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate the fear of dumping has not been restricted to primary producers. Some genuine concerns were raised two years ago about the possible dumping of cement. The industry and the Government worked through that problem. I now appeal to the Government to continue to be vigilant in the pursuit of dumping when it comes to primary production. It was this fear that the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology during its inquiry into the sugar industry found was uppermost in the minds of sugar growers. The Senate inquiry was told that there is a delay of up to 12 weeks before information can be provided in respect of imports. The Committee's reports states:</PARA>
<PARA> This delay limits severely the ability of refiners to monitor trends and provide relevant up-to-date information to Customs Authorities in support of a dumping complaint. By comparison, in New Zealand, statistics are available from the Customs Department on a weekly basis 10-12 days after the end of the week to which the statistics relate. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that very few companies are likely to be major importers. Because such industries are large and well-known, potential importers of dumped sugar are unlikely to get away with doing so without strong protest from those likely to be affected adversely. An aspect of the inquiry report concerns me and I ask the Minister to take note of it. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the Australian Customs Service told the Committee that there may well be difficulties in establishing a dumping case in respect of the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA>This appears to contradict the earlier assurances, but the Committee nevertheless recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> If deficiencies are alleged the Government should investigate them, and if necessary, amend the anti-dumping legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I press the point that advice given by the Australian Customs Service to the Committee is answered in these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other concerns at the moment with respect to dumping. I refer to the pineapple industry, where there are reports of cheap imported pineapples flooding the markets and destroying the viability of farmers. In my electorate I have received no personal representations, but the association concerned is making a very public campaign, supported by the National Party of Australia. Both Senator Ron Boswell and the National Party State Primary Industries Minister, Mark Stoneman, have shown an ignorance of bilateral and multilateral trade. They have continually demanded that a high protective barrier be put up to stop the import of pineapples and at the same time said that Australia needs access to more world markets. It is important to recognise that if we take that track and put up protective barriers we undo the very gains that we are making and the very proposition that the Nationals are putting up would be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Minister to monitor the situation continually to ensure that our producers are not the victims of a flooding of dumped products because I have always believed that on a fair playing field we can not only match, but also beat the world and we are achieving that. We are achieving it in a meaningful way this year with a win at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. All the reports I have seen so far, though, lead me to believe that the greatest howls of protect in regard to pineapples are coming from the Golden Circle cannery. In 1981, Golden Circle rejected a request by G. J. Coles to package pineapple under Coles' Farmland label and insisted that it would market products only under its own brand label. </PARA>
<PARA> Coles and other supermarket chains subsequently placed orders with overseas suppliers who were prepared to meet its requirements. Canned pineapple imports are not significant in the total domestic market and in 1987-88 represented approximately 13 per cent of the total canned pineapple market. In spite of the imports, Golden Circle, the sole Australian producer, processed a record tonnage of pineapples in the cannery year ending 30 November 1988. Australian consumption of canned pineapples has been rising steadily in recent years and Golden Circle has maintained its market share against import penetration. The decision of Golden Circle not to participate in sales with supermarket chains may have been a major factor in the import of canned pineapples. I would appreciate it, though, if the Minister would undertake a continuing scrutiny of the situation, as I am sure he will, to ensure that our pineapple producers are not the unwilling victims of both dumping and the paranoia of the Queensland National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention also the need for continual monitoring of the situation with Canadian pork meat. Producers are concerned about two aspects: the fear of subsidised imported product and fear of the disease, transmissible gastroenteritis. Of these, the former is within the ambit of the Bill. The industry fears that the pig meat industry will be badly damaged by subsidised Canadian competition. As I understand it, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) had modelled possible outcomes and has concluded that imports from Canada will probably not exceed 17,000 tonnes per annum and may average 12,000 tonnes per annum. This also depends upon the exchange rates and in some years there may be no importation whatsoever. This compares with the domestic production of roughly 300,000 tonnes. Of course, the quantity varies, as I said, with the exchange rate. I ask the Minister to assess whether the ABARE model is holding up over time. </PARA>
<PARA> Most producers are confident that they are efficient enough to beat fair competition. I support that proposition totally. They also understand that if we win at the GATT talks, as we did with US sugar quotas and with the Korean beef deal, we have to have free markets. Our producers gain by free trade. As the overwhelming percentage of Australian farm product is exported, Australian farmers have more to lose from high tariff protection than any other nation. That is why I fail to understand the attitude of some of my opponents in Queensland who have a different story for every audience. At the end of the day they have to represent the whole agricultural industry. We cannot quarantine one industry and put at risk the total Australian agricultural production. We have proved continually, with GATT this year and with the breakthroughs we are making in the United States-and those breakthroughs will impact on the EEC-that we are going to win. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect in regard to the pig industry is that until now growers have looked only to the Australian market. I put this proposition to the House: because, until now, Australian growers have supplied only the Australian market, there has never been a requirement-financial or otherwise-to look to exports. Now that we are importing Canadian pig meat, producers are saying that there may be an export market there. Certainly we will have a look for it. It is said that necessity is the mother of invention. This may well prove to be the case in this industry. A small industry that is producing 300,000 tonnes of meat may well be able to double production and gain access to the Asian markets. As we know, in Asia pig meat is very popular. All primary industries need to assess export opportunities. Exports improve our economy and the viability of farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> The great powers of the world have the economic and military muscle, yet they lack the intestinal fortitude that goes with free trade. As we all know, Australians have been laid to rest all over the free world where we fought for freedom and I believe that if we have to raise continually the fact that we can stand on our own feet in free trade and embarrass the EEC and Japan we should continue to do just that. They pride themselves on being tough, yet when it comes to agriculture they are trade cowards. We should continually raise that point. In my view they are not just in the short term looking after their own political interests, they are downgrading their own agricultural industries. By protection, by covering them up, they are creating inefficiencies, just as a child who is locked up in a house and is not allowed to get out into the real environment becomes socially deficient. </PARA>
<PARA> By our free trade, by the initiatives of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table, and by the initiatives of the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), we have created the toughest, the most effective and the most commercial agricultural base this country has ever seen. I compliment the Minister once again for the wise and tough decisions he has made to oppose dumping. Logically and rationally we must work through the problems other countries impose on us by dumping their goods onto our markets without putting at risk the free trade position we must maintain if we are to continually have not only a viable but also an expanding agricultural industry. I think that that is the most positive argument we have to offer. we not only wish to maintain our present agricultural base but also, as we have so much to gain, we must gain access to more world markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with much of the argument advanced by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and with all of his sentiments. Unfortunately, for reasons I will try to make clear, he has arrived at a wrong conclusion in his support for the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill and the Customs Legislation (Anti-Dumping) Bill. This legislation proposes amendments to legislation which was enacted by the Parliament only last year. The principal Act established the Anti-Dumping Authority to coordinate the Government approach to dumping complaints. Some of the amendments in this legislation incorporate provisions which might be construed as taxation measures more relevant to the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act rather than to the anti-dumping legislation, presumably to avoid possible legal challenge under section 55 of the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These changes are largely procedural, and are not a matter of controversy, although they do add to a growing list of government legislation which has been the subject of very poor drafting. Such drafting problems are then the subject of ad hoc amendments in the Parliament which are often retrospective in their effects and fail to address the fundamental errors in the construction of the legislation in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that if the Commonwealth was not stretching the limits of its constitutional powers, many of these examples of contorted drafting and hurried error would not be made. However, there is no question about the powers of the Commonwealth over industry protection and dumping. Objections to the Government's approach in these areas are largely economic. The dumping issue and the issue of protectionism are intimately and irrevocably linked. </PARA>
<PARA> Anti-dumping legislation is a form of protection of local industry. The only debate is over whether this protection is justified. I will argue that anti-dumping legislation is neither a sensible nor a justified form of protection. It follows that the second element of this legislation, which in part extends the protective effects of the calculation of the `normal price' for dumped goods, is not justified. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of this Labor Government to anti-dumping has been confused and contradictory. On the one hand it commissioned Professor Gruen to review the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975. He opposed the use of anti-dumping legislation as a measure of industry assistance, and recommended that the scope of such legislation should be restricted. In rhetoric used in the Parliament and to those who are usually opposed to protection, the Government has insisted that its approach to anti-dumping was to avoid its use as a form of protection, restricting the scope of legislation to unfair trading practices, to use its words. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we find that the Government has allowed industry leaders to think that tough anti-dumping legislation can be a trade-off for reductions in the levels of industry protection. It is not surprising that the highest numbers of dumping complaints over the years have been made by the most heavily protected industries in Australia. Some companies see dumping duties as just another tool to defeat international competition. Such duties loom as a desirable form of protection for companies because they are decided by administrative means in particular cases and do not impose across-the-board tariffs which, when applied to components or other imports, might add to a company's cost structure. However, the costs to consumers and quite often the taxpayer are possibly greater for anti-dumping measures than for any other form of protection. Not only is the price of the goods concerned effectively increased to much higher levels, but also the Government loses revenue as foreign companies increase prices to the Australian consumer to avoid the penalties arising from a successful dumping complaint. The procedure adds uncertainty to both people seeking to trade with Australia and Australian firms who are supplied by overseas companies. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) introduced last year the legislation establishing an anti-dumping authority, he seemed to acknowledge in his second reading speech the risk that dumping complaints could be misused. He then issued a press release inviting industry, unions and farmers to use the `tough' new laws which would effectively ensure `fair competition'. The Government wants it both ways. Given the divergence in what the Government says on this issue, we should judge it by what it does. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that the number of dumping complaints has declined from 100 in 1982-83 to 28 in 1987-88. The number of times that duties have been imposed from these complaints has declined from 42 in 1982-83 to 16 in 1987-88. Reviews of existing dumping duties have increasingly revoked those duties. These are all good signs. However, the number of dumping duties which are longstanding is still a matter of concern, and the length of application of these duties indicates the myths that surround commercial practices that are often branded as dumping. The Industries Assistance Commission, which has seen its scrutiny of anti-dumping measures reduced by the Labor Government, was moved to observe in its last annual report:</PARA>
<PARA> There is potential, however, for on-going conflict between an anti-dumping system directed against `unfair' trading practices, and government initiatives to reduce protection. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely my point. This legislation is the first change to the Government's new anti-dumping regime. Ominously, it will increase the level of effective protection to industry and represents a cave-in to pressure from industry over quite a long period. The particular change we are considering will in effect increase the normal value that is calculated for imported goods about which a dumping complaint has been made by more frequently incorporating a profit level in a notional price. Goods which are sold in Australia below the normal value at which the same goods are sold in the country of origin are considered to have been dumped. In most cases the normal value is deemed to be the market price at which the goods are sold. However, the Australian Customs Service uses a formula to estimate such a price when the country of origin has a non-market economy, when the goods are not sold in their country of origin and when the goods are sold at a loss in their home country. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Gruen argued that the use of a constructed value for goods in dumping complaints presented a range of problems and potential for abuse. To reduce these problems, he argued that an artificial level of profit should generally not be included when constructing a normal value. These proposed changes reject Professor Gruen's arguments in favour of a review done by the Anti-dumping Authority itself. In general, a profit will be included in the normal value if it is constructed, but at a level which is left to the discretion of the Authority. It is an open-ended change which will increase uncertainty and will often appear arbitrary. It is cloaked in largely tattered garments of moderation and plots a middle course between favouring free trade through an arbitrary ruling against the inclusion of profit and protection through use of the anti-dumping procedure. Whilst it is true that the review by the Anti-dumping Authority rejected some protectionist arguments, the effects of the change will, nonetheless, tend to increase the number of successful dumping complaints and, therefore, the overall level of protection provided by anti-dumping law. </PARA>
<PARA> International precedents make this change even more ominous. It is certainly true that this change will bring Australian law into line with other countries such as the United States. That is not necessarily a good thing. The use of contrived levels of presumed profit in the calculation of the normal value of supposedly dumped goods has been the foundation of much of the new protectionism which American anti-dumping legislation and practice represents. This new protectionism effectively puts a floor on the price of competition in national markets and insists on foreign companies increasing their revenue and profit margins at the expense of reducing the overall volume of imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the talk of fair trade, the most unfair trading practice in the contemporary international trading environment is the imposition of non-tariff trade barriers. The assumption that a certain level of profit should be included in the artificial calculation of price which determines whether unfair trading has occurred has no justification in normal commercial practice. If the same standards were applied to the trade practices of domestic commercial firms, then most retail sales after periods of high demand, such as Christmas, would be outlawed. </PARA>
<PARA> Anti-dumping legislation represents one of the few forms of protection which is allowable under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules. For this reason, there is a tendency to use it extensively and more often. The argument that other countries do it, therefore we should follow, is a well-worn defence of all forms of protection. It is wrong. It is in the interests of Australian consumers to purchase goods for the cheapest price at which they are available. The gains to the economy from the more efficient use of resources which these price decisions represent outweigh any potential loss to a particular business or industry. Retaliatory protection has never reduced trade barriers. Instead, it has acted to ratchet up the general level of protection and undermine the flow of trade. The current boom in non-tariff protection, such as anti-dumping legislation, reflects international competition between governments to outdo each other in looking after local industry at the expense of local consumers and, in the long run, to the cost of local industry. </PARA>
<PARA> To put this discussion in context, I want to look briefly at what dumping and unfair trade are-or, more precisely, at what the Minister tells us they are. The Minister in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> Dumping occurs when the price at which goods are exported to Australia . . . is less than the normal value of the goods in the country of export. </PARA>
<PARA>One might ask: What is wrong with that? Surely, if Australians can get goods at cheaper prices than someone else, then we should take advantage of our good fortune; but not according to the proponents of anti-dumping regulation. To these people, cheap goods are not what they seem. They are part of a movement which will drive many Australian manufacturers to the wall. Cheap goods more often than not are dumped on Australian markets to get rid of them, possibly with some commercial advantage in terms of market share. It is suggested that once an Australian industry is ruined the companies exporting to Australia can then take advantage of their position by charging inflated prices. </PARA>
<PARA> This predatory pricing, as it is known, is penalised by anti-dumping law in Australia if prices charged in Australia can be shown to be less than in the country of origin of the goods and if material injury can be demonstrated by the complainant. The implicit assumption of fair trade laws such as those against dumping in Australia is that if any foreign company successfully competes and takes business away from an Australian firm, then it is guilty of causing damage to local business. In fact, in tight market conditions where damage can be proved, the advantages from cheap imports are likely to be at their highest for Australian importers. This is the silly foundation of anti-dumping law. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other problems with the Minister's definition. The greatest of these is defining the so-called normal value of goods. It is not just a problem of determining that value. It also ignores such common commercial practices as differential pricing. It ignores the different market conditions which might apply to Australian demand for those goods. Fundamentally, it misunderstands the nature of the price mechanism in a market economy. Anti-dumping legislation distorts the price signals on the local market, thus inhibiting the ability of local firms to respond to demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Predatory pricing designed to drive competitors out of business, which was a feature of arguments about monopoly legislation in the United States, is not a common practice, largely because in a relatively open market it cannot work. As long as Australia is open to imports from a range of sources, monetary loss faces any company which sells goods to Australia at beneath the actual cost of producing them. We should allow Australian consumers to take advantage of such folly. Much so-called dumping is little more than the clearing of a glut in the supply of a product on international markets, little different from a retailer's sale of surplus stock at a discounted price. This process is in the long term interests of Australian manufacturers, who compete on international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> However, most of the dumping complaints do not arise from competitive industries. They arise when a locally based firm has lost a contract and seeks some way of gaining a slightly lower price than its competition without reducing its price and therefore its profit margins, or the conditions of its employees. Most of the initiators of dumping complaints have been from the chemical and petroleum products industry, the base metals industry, and machinery and equipment manufacturing interests. In the past, textiles and food and beverages industries also made a contribution to such complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are these industries already relatively heavily protected, but the reasons for inefficiency and uncompetitiveness can not be blamed on international competition. One recent complaint involved the importation of coloured pencils, at supposedly dumped prices, from three other countries. I doubt that any honourable member opposite could seriously argue that a foreign firm is using its market power to develop a coloured pencil monopoly, or that the Australian coloured pencil industry is so important that it must be protected from competition, despite the much higher charges to those parents of children who are the consumers and who will pay for that protection. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many distortions of international trade, and governments produce many of those distortions through subsidy and centralised marketing arrangements which lead to distortion of prices. However, it has not been demonstrated that Australians should not take advantage of the cheaper goods which this can provide, whilst the Government uses international forums to advance its version of free trade. The extension of those distortions through non-tariff barriers, is unworthy of this Government and its fine words on free trade, but it is typical of the double standards which we have come to expect from the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will, if only to a small degree, slow up both the process of industrial reform in Australia and the reductions of taxpayer funded protection. It will give a further out to companies, and particularly trade unions, afraid of competition from their fellow workers, both in Australia and overseas. The economic arguments against the extensive use of anti-dumping legislation are overwhelming. The Opposition did not support the establishment of the Anti-Dumping Authority, and the first piece of legislation arising from its work-the piece that is before us-firmly suggests that this was the correct decision to take. The assertion that `fair trade' must be seen as an alternative to `free trade' is nonsense. The only fair trade involves true competition for price and quality as assessed by consumers. Dumping duties do not allow or encourage such competition. As Professor Gruen said in the Australian Financial Review of 4 May 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>Anti-dumping policies are used predominantly by certain rich, unadaptable economies... which find it politically easier to use anti-dumping techniques for protecting their industries than to allow their industries to compete freely. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty good description of our economy under the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>

Do we wait for predatory companies from overseas to come in and effectively destroy large sections of our industrial and manufacturing base beyond the point of repair and beyond the point where it can be restored? We would then be subject to enormous market power on the part of those same overseas producers against which we have no effective competitive defences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. Having made those few observations on the extraordinary contribution by the previous speaker, I will now talk more generally about this legislation. It needs to be seen in the context of a significant revision of anti-dumping legislation in recent times. Part of the legislation deals with a fairly technical matter-the need to avoid some unconstitutionality. That has required a degree of restructuring of the legislation to avoid any potential problem with section 55 of the Constitution. I will not comment further on that matter because I do not think there is any great controversy about that. It does not really go to the major substantial elements in the legislation that is before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main matter before us is the question of normal value and the circumstances in which a profit component can be included in the construction of a normal value. This was one of a number of matters that have been of concern to Australian industry, both on the employer and the trade union side, in recent times. There are a number of other matters, including the question of the definition of `material injury'. These several matters have been considered by the Anti-Dumping Authority and it has recently placed before the Minister a report with a set of recommendations dealing with a number of matters of general principle as distinct from specific inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the way the Anti-Dumping Authority has conducted these inquiries, the attempts at consultation with industry have been admirable and, hopefully, that will set some sort of pattern for future developments in the way these sorts of inquiries are conducted. Anti-dumping legislation is, of course, a politically sensitive matter. In recent times we have seen demonstrations by people involved in the cement and tyre industries and some sectors of that sort. There has been concern. It has become a live political issue in some electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> As chair of the Caucus industry committee I would have to say that the issue has attracted great interest from other members of Caucus who are not necessarily members of the committee as a result of the fact that there is an obvious degree of electoral sensitivity if there are industries where people in specific electorates are quite directly and specifically affected. Of course, the local members start to feel the heat from that. It is undoubtedly a politically controversial issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also intrinsically very important economically. For an industry like the chemicals industry, for example, which might be contemplating a major investment decision and adding to its capacity in a pretty significant way, it is one thing to have a carefully structured reduction in the protection regime which is predictable and capable of being taken into account by a firm which is considering an investment; what is considerably more difficult to take into consideration is the prospect of several shiploads of dumped product suddenly turning up in an Australian port and wiping out the market in an industry very quickly and for a considerable period. That element of risk associated with that sort of development really is one of the major disincentives and one of the major factors holding back investment in additional capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Having talked to quite a few people in industry who have the responsibility for making these sorts of decisions, I can state that there is no question but that the concern and uncertainty relating to the possibility of the sudden arrival of a large quantity of dumped product is very significant. Arguably more significant than the actual level of formal protection itself is concern about the risk of suddenly being confronted with dumping. The previous speaker talked about uncertainty and the need to eliminate it. If he is talking about some sort of orderly development of key sectors of Australian industry, the elimination of the form of uncertainty that arises from dumping is terribly important. He seemed quite oblivious to that consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> As to anti-dumping legislation, there has been a lot of talk about a need for a level playing field. That is the current buzz phrase. People say that we need to free things up, remove artificial distortions and have a situation where Australian industry is able to complete on an equal footing with the industries of other countries. I have always had a degree of scepticism about some of that rhetoric. The previous speaker spoke about non-tariff barriers. Some countries have been able to develop their industry successfully in the post-War period, but the idea that removing all protection from the domestic market and throwing the whole thing open to the free play of market forces represents a route towards a viable industry development model is belied by the actual experience of countries like Japan and South Korea, of Western Europe and so forth. But, even if one accepts that a level playing field is desirable and accepts the basic propositions which underlie that type of rhetoric, I think it is reasonable that is should be a genuine level playing field. In the field of anti-dumping legislation there has been some concern from industry as to whether that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> To refer to the present legislation and the method of construction of a normal value, this issue of whether one includes a profit component concerns industry quite a bit. The industry quite reasonably argues that no business operates on the presumption that it will earn a zero profit; that it will have a zero rate of return on its shareholders' funds. In the real world that is quite unrealistic. I point to a case in the United States of America, where a fixed profit margin of, I think, 8 per cent is included. They say, `If that is the sort of situation that prevails with our major trading partners, why should we not have similar provisions in our legislation?' In other words, industry representatives are saying , `Okay, let us have a level playing field but our protection against predatory practices and unfair trading practices, against dumping and so forth, should be no less strong than that available to our major trading partners'. That is the argument the industry puts forward and it is why this question of inclusion of a non-zero profit component in a constructed normal value has come to the fore. That, together with other issues such as the definition of material injury, are terribly important in determining how effective in practice anti-dumping legislation will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The material injury question is not really the subject of the current legislation, but it was one of several issues that were considered by the Caucus industry committee. As a result of quite a discussion that took place at the Caucus industry committee, a number of references were made to the Anti-Dumping Authority. Part of the Anti-Dumping Authority's response to those references is the subject of the legislation before us today. There was a sentiment among Caucus members concerned with industry policy that, while acknowledging that we are subject to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and that we cannot simply flout the provisions of that, it is reasonable that we try to utilise to the fullest extent available the provisions of the GATT anti-dumping code so that we have protection against dumping which is consistent with but not significantly weaker than what the GATT code envisages and provides for. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, on that matter of material injury, which is not the subject before us today, there was a concern that we were adopting an overly restrictive definition of material injury and that there would have to be a substantial drop in profitability and/or market share. But the GATT anti-dumping code envisages a whole range of possible measures or indicators of material injury so it was felt that we ought to broaden that out. Again, that is not the subject of today's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the inclusion of a non-zero profit component seems to me difficult to argue with. The Opposition claims to have a number of people who represent, come from or are knowledgeable about the operations of the business sector. It would be interesting if its members could point to some of their colleagues in the business world who would consider that having a zero profit margin and zero rate of return on shareholders' funds was somehow a viable way to conduct a business. It would be pretty extraordinary if they did. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation envisages the possibility of a non-zero profit margin. It prescribes a non-zero profit margin in one particular case. Subsection 5 (9) of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 says that, if there is a case where it is necessary to construct a normal value because of the fact that a product is being sold in the country of export at a loss over an extended period, it can be argued by the Minister or the Anti-Dumping Authority that it would be inappropriate to include a non-zero profit margin in that case. But in general the idea of including a profit margin-which may be zero, depending on the circumstances but that could be a matter of decision on a case to case basis-seems to me self-evident. For the Opposition to be attacking this legislation and the Government's approach to it in the way it has is absolutely extraordinary. How can anybody argue that Australia should not have any effective anti-dumping measures? That was the essence of what the previous speaker argued. It shows in the clearest and starkest terms the nature of the Opposition's commitment to the development of Australian industry. In other words, the Opposition is saying, `Okay, we will open up our industries to the most predatory practices, with no protection whatsoever. We will supposedly be committed to a level playing field but we will have considerably weaker or in fact non-existent. . .'--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent times some important changes have occurred in economic activity in this country. For the first time we have a strongly growing economy but an Opposition that is willing to bring on a recession. That should be made very clear. The Liberal Party's action plan really is all about bringing on a recession. I should like to explain what that means. When I first became a member of this House it was very noticeable that the Labor Party was clearing up the mess of mass unemployment that has occurred throughout the Australian community. It had to repair the damage that had been caused by the Liberal Party. It has been a long haul, but the Labor Party has got on top of the problem essentially because it has policies about retraining and housing and an industrial relations system that works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one considers the recently released economic policy of the Liberal Party, one discovers two or three issues. Firstly, the Liberal Party would relinquish control over interest rates through the Reserve Bank. The Liberal Party would return the proceeds of fiscal drag and bracket creep back to the consumers, which would lead to a very demand-led economy. In those circumstances the only way to reduce that demand would be by promoting mass unemployment. That point should be pressed home. The other night the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) spoke about taxation policy and capital gains tax. The Liberal Party wants to remove retraining, particularly that of Aborigines, and to remove the Jobstart program. When we put all those things together, it is clear-it is on the record-when we couple it with the fact that the Liberal Party is promoting a recession--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Liberal Party is in fact talking about increasing the level of unemployment. Many people in my electorate say to me, `It is not the fact that I am unemployed but, when I do become unemployed, as happens in a dynamic economy, I am going to get no support or help if the Liberal Party is in government'. That is the substantial position. That is the big worry, and the point must be emphasised. We cannot afford to return to the level of social division and social concern that existed when the Labor Party came to government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the past 10 or 12 days, from talking to many people in the community, I have learned that they recognise that, as do many people in the business community which is the other interesting aspect. They are not prepared to tolerate a Russian roulette industrial relations policy-not knowing when they are going to be knocked over by the system of contracting out which the Liberal Party is going to bring in in industrial relations. People will make an assessment when they consider the pattern of unemployment creation, the proposed taxation changes and also the industrial relations system. I heard what the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said before. However, what I am saying is the case, because those are the circumstances that exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) pointed out today, the capital gains tax is a very central issue. It is about giving back a very large windfall gain to those who do not need it. The Opposition talks about business; but in its period in office it did nothing about the double taxation of dividends. The Labor Party introduced dividend imputation. The Opposition did nothing about reducing the top marginal rate. The Labor Party had to do that. One must consider the structural questions and the Opposition's record. It is clear that the Opposition's policy would create division and a lack of social cohesion. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of training and taxation policy, the Government is prepared to restore equity and fairness to the system. The people in the community who have jobs and houses understand that. The Government is very clear on that. That has always been its position. However, the Opposition is not happy with that because it is the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more optimistic note, I am pleased to advise that the Government Whip, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham,) is 50 years of age today. I am sure that he would appreciate having the company of members of this House for a refreshment following the adjournment of this House. Because he has been a member of this House for a long time, I know that he has the respect of many. </PARA>
