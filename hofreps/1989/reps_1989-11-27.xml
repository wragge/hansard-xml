<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the obvious point at the beginning of my answer to the question-it was made by way of interjection from the Government benches-that I have publicly acknowledged a message from the South Australian election, and I acknowledge it here, and that is interest rates are hurting and people do not like them. Obviously to some extent an outstanding Premier, Mr Bannon-I remind honourable members that he is still the Premier of South Australia-has paid some penalty for the hurt that is being felt. I have public knowledge of that message. I have not noticed any acknowledgment by the Leader of the Opposition of an equally resounding message which has been given to the Liberals, and that is, the people of Australia will not buy them at any price. They have a great record for coming second.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I continue to be amazed, as we on this side of the House are, by the Opposition Leader's absolutely breathtaking hypocrisy on the question of interest rates. He does not acknowledge the fact that under the previous Government interest rates were higher than they are under this Government. He might have a bit more credibility if he faced up to and answered questions about the interest rate implications of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. As I have said before in this place, and as I repeat in the context of the Leader of the Opposition's question, the Opposition needs to face up to what the interest rate implications are of the alternative to the Government's policy. I have stated quite clearly why interest rates are where they are. They are there for very sound reasons which I have explained. It is about time that the Leader of the Opposition faced up to the fact that under the Opposition's so-called Economic Action Plan interest rates would be higher.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us make it quite clear that the Opposition has acknowledged that there will be no tightening of fiscal policy under its Economic Action Plan. Indeed, its fiscal position would be significantly looser because of the enormous hole in the revenue side which would flow from its abolition of the capital gains tax. If we look at the wages arm of policy, every commentator acknowledges that there would be a massive blow-out in wages under the so-called Economic Action Plan. If we have a looser fiscal policy and wages policy, as the Opposition would have, the absolute alternative, the inescapable conclusion, is that interest rates would be higher. That is a fact which is acknowledged by all commentators who have analysed the Opposition's economic policy.</PARA>
<PARA> It is simply about time that the Leader of the Opposition came clean on the hidden agenda of the Opposition in this. The hidden agenda is as it was in 1981-82-massive unemployment. We cannot have any other outcome if we have looser fiscal policy and a situation then of a wages blow-out. The inevitable policy is tighter interest rates and massive unemployment. One does not have to be theoretical about it. This was precisely the prescription the Opposition had in 1981-82, and it will not come clean on it. What the Opposition is trying to do this week, in going to interest rates, is do the dirty work for its Queensland colleagues. It will not divert the attention of the Queensland electorate from the single issue of the Queensland election, and that is the massive corruption which has pervaded the State of Queensland under coalition Liberal and National governments for the last 30 years and the Nationals in the last period. That is the issue, and the Opposition will not divert attention from it.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that if he believes that our analysis of his Economic Action Plan is incorrect, if we are wrong in saying that necessarily the Opposition would have higher interest rates and massive unemployment, why does he not present himself to a press conference so that he can explain, in answer to questions from the press, where our analysis of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan is wrong? The fact is that the Opposition has got the Leader of the Opposition totally on a leash and is terrified to let him off the leash to be exposed to questioning by the press.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In general, what I found in those countries is that they are strengthening their capital gains tax regimes, and there is no debate about capital gains taxation. The only country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that I am aware of that has a public debate about capital gains is Australia-and it is only a public issue because of the squalid policies of the Opposition. I am aware that in his address to the annual general meeting of Elders-IXL Ltd in Adelaide on 15 November Mr John Elliott, the Chairman, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's punitive capital gains tax runs counter to tax policies around the world.</PARA>
<PARA>This was said on the same day that the shadow Treasurer released his discredited 29-page defence of the Opposition proposal-which, I might add, has since disappeared without trace. It was part of an orchestrated Liberal Party strategy to undermine the overwhelming public support for the capital gains tax. But of course, like everything else the Liberals are saying about capital gains, Mr Elliott's claims should be seen for what they are: a bit of self-serving rubbish.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with some of these other countries and just demonstrate how the proposal by the Liberal Party and its Chairman is nothing more than an attempt to find an economic rationale for ripping the guts out of a decent tax. The United Kingdom strengthened its capital gains tax in the 1988 budget. It now taxes real capital gains in excess of a small personal threshold which was reduced in that budget and it taxes them at full marginal rates of tax. In Japan, nominal capital gains have been taxable since 1946, but there have recently been changes to Japan's capital gains tax which have toughened its impact, particularly in relation to securities. In the United States, capital gains have been taxable since 1913, but under the Tax Reform Act 1986, which took effect from 1987, the distinction between short and long term capital gains was removed and full nominal gains are now taxed at full marginal rates. They are not taxed at concessional rates as they used to be--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are now taxed at full marginal rates. There is a proposal presently before the United States Senate to lower the tax rates on capital gains for a short period in an attempt to bring forward revenue to combat the large US budget deficit, by encouraging taxpayers to sell assets. But the proposal is that the tax rates should then return to full marginal rates and that only the real capital gains be taxed. In other words, they would return to a situation exactly the same as occurs in Australia-that is, a tax at the full marginal rate on the real gain. In Canada capital gains have been taxable since 1972 but, as in other countries, the provisions have recently been strengthened. Until 1987 one-half of nominal capital gains were taxed at full marginal rates. This proportion is being increased to 75 per cent of nominal capital gains by 1990. I am unaware of any OECD country which has a capital gains tax as ineffectual as what is being proposed by the Opposition in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other countries capital gains taxation is, as I said at the beginning of my answer, simply not an issue. It was not an issue until it was raised by the Liberal Party of Australia in the current debate. The Opposition proposal has nothing whatsoever to do with what is happening in other countries, contrary to Mr Elliott's claim. It is simply a self-serving intervention by Mr Elliott to defend the indefensible with a capital gains tax change which would do nothing other than line the pockets of wealthy people like himself and look after the one per cent of taxpayers who currently pay capital gains tax.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in the House before, the proposal by the Opposition would amount to the largest transfer of wealth in the history of the nation to one per cent of the taxpaying population in what would be an inequitable and, worse than that, economically destructive policy change which would make the tax system lopsided and favour investment in speculative capital activity. As one writer said recently, the great problem with the Liberal Party is that it does not know how to run a market system. It thinks that to run a market system one has to glad-hand business and throw money at it rather than running an efficient system, an efficient economy, where resources are allocated properly and where income is taxed regardless of its variety, which is what the capital gains tax is all about. I conclude by making the point that Mr Elliott's statement is nothing but self-serving rubbish which has been echoed by his parliamentary yes men in this chamber.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Rankin for his question. I would have expected that, by now, with the Opposition beating up the question of quarantine, it might have asked a question about it in this House. The thing that has occasioned most of the recent display of histrionics by the Opposition is the lifting of the ban on the import of Canadian pig meat. I would rather address the more basic quarantine principle. In 1987 I established the Lindsay Quarantine Review Committee to undertake a review of quarantine policies to ensure that we have the best possible methods of assessing quarantine risk and using our resources most effectively in countering those risks. The Lindsay Committee advised-and I entirely agree with it-that we cannot have a no-risk or nil-risk quarantine policy. There is no such thing as no risk. More importantly, to try to have a no-risk policy would place an intolerable burden on our economy. We would have to ban people, postal articles, aircraft, ships and all forms of seed and genetic material from coming into Australia. The policy we have adopted involves a formal, transparent decision-making process based on assessed risks with significant input from industry in the making of decisions on the allocation of resources. In other words, it is exactly the same policy framework that we have had in place for 10 years but, post-Lindsay, we have actually tightened the policy. Through a series of steps, we now take into account the pest or disease threat, where it comes from, how it spreads and its biological consequences. We also take into account the strategies for exclusion and the risks of entry under those strategies. We take into account, too, the costs and benefits of continued exclusion. In this way we can build up profiles of pests and diseases we want to keep out of the country. For example, the profile of foot and mouth shows that it must be kept out of the country. At the other end of the spectrum, there are lesser diseases and pests that do not justify the measures foot and mouth justifies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a matter of fact, one of our biggest problems is smuggling. Recently we had the nashi budwood incident. We have had a series of chicken diseases and we have also had the illegal importation of grapevines. Smuggling is probably the biggest problem we have in quarantine. The Government's approach post-Lindsay, the tightening up, does not mean the abandonment of a strong quarantine policy. We are not opening the floodgates to disease, as maintained by the Opposition; on the contrary, we are shutting them firmly. We know that there will always be an element of risk: we are acknowledging that risk and we are quantifying it. We are using it to make decisions rather than pretending it is not there. If continued prohibition of a product cannot be justified on quarantine grounds, we will not use quarantine as a non-tariff barrier.</PARA>
<PARA> Logic does not seem to worry the Opposition, which is running around scaring people and implying that it is possible to run a no-risk quarantine policy. The Opposition's hypocrisy on this issue is exposed in its so-called economic policy, which promises a $14m or 23 per cent cut to the budget of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had many pathetic questions from the Leader of the National Party in this place but that would rank as amongst the most pathetic. I have said nothing at all which would indicate any apprehension on the part of the Government of interest rates going higher. I have said that we have them higher than we would like. We certainly do have them higher than we would like. But, as distinct from this Opposition, we have indicated that we are prepared to make the hard decisions in the area of macro-economic policy. We have taken those, and we have spelt out what the implications are-as distinct from what those on the other side of the House are doing. They will not spell out that the necessary implication of their Economic Action Plan is even higher interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If those opposite think that the analysis that I and the Treasurer have made of the necessary economic implications of their plan is not accurate, and if they think that their Leader has the capacity to explain that to the press, they should let him off that leash that they have put around his neck. It is an absolutely common piece of ground in the politics of this House that they will not let their Leader of the Opposition be exposed to the press so that the press can ask him the question: Is it the fact that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have an incorrect analysis of the Economic Action Plan? If we are wrong, and if the Leader of the Opposition can explain during the questioning of the press that we have it wrong, why does he not do it? The reason why those opposite will not expose the Leader of the Opposition to scrutiny by the press, including the financial press, is that they know that what Keating and Hawke are saying is right.</PARA>

If the honourable member for Bennelong was still the Leader, I do not believe he would tolerate a leash around his neck. He would face up to the press and explain what he thought. But this Leader does not do that because, first, he does not really understand the implications of his policy and, secondly, he knows that if he were released to be examined by the press and subjected to questioning, he would be destroyed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Is the Minister aware of the paper by the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) entitled Measuring Poverty? What are the implications of the report for social and economic policy development into the 1990s?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2913" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Streeton for his question. The Government welcomes the EPAC report, which points out that over the past 20 years the problem of poverty in Australia has increasingly been associated with homelessness, long-term unemployment, youth unemployment, marriage breakdown and hardship amongst immigrants and refugees. It points out also that, as a result of the Government's reforms, such as the family allowance supplement, rent assistance and pension indexation, poverty is now less a problem of inadequate income but a problem of more complex issues relating to alienation and exclusion from full participation in society. The report concludes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Income support measures alone are not sufficient to deal with the broader aspects of poverty that exist in the Australian community. A broader range of other social policies will also be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper points out the need for a much broader approach to research into poverty-an approach that analyses the nature of deprivation and exclusion experienced by different groups. The House will recall that on 6 March this year I referred to the importance of social wage measures such as Medicare, superannuation, Austudy and family payments and of programs like Newstart and JET-jobs, education and training-which provide assistance for the excluded and disadvantaged. As the Prime Minister stated in his address to the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) congress in September:</PARA>
<PARA> It is possible to describe poverty in terms of dollars and cents or the lack of them. It is possible to attack it in terms of financial benchmarks, as we have done. But the causes and the symptoms of poverty are far wider than pure economics. Perhaps we need a broader assault-ACOSS can help-along with State and local governments who have major interests in many aspects of this problem.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party will continue in its social policy development to address the problems raised by EPAC. If it is clear that we have developed policies that have attacked the root of income insecurity and poverty and that we are prepared to build on those policies of the previous Government which excluded hundreds of thousands of people from the labour market, it is also clear that coalition policies stand in very stark contrast to the Government's commitment to overcome poverty and disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition would deny access to the universal program of health care. As I understand it, it would freeze the number of child-care places. It would certainly prevent any further growth in higher education. It would abolish programs that help families living in the bush-programs like Countrylink, the rural education access program, and the rural women's access grants program. It would slash the mechanisms to support families in times of crisis. Programs such as Skillshare, Jobstart, Newstart and JET, under a coalition policy, would effectively be abolished. So, in contrast to the Government's efforts in line with EPAC's recommendation to broaden the analysis of poverty to include broader social conditions, the Government's acceptance of the thrust of that approach, the very strong social programs that have been developed, and our improvements in terms of income support, the Opposition would tear into those programs. It would lock people into disadvantage and leave them excluded rather than help to build social policies that in the long run remove the cancer of poverty from the Australian community.</PARA>

It would be quite pointless therefore to respond to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the issue of micro-economic reform generally, including waterfront reform, I repeat what we have had cause to say on a number of occasions. If the Opposition talks about the condition of the Australian micro-economy and the condition with which we had to deal when we came to office, it will not be able to avoid one point: we have had to deal with a situation which was established by 30 years of Liberal-National Party governance out of the previous 34 years. I again put to the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition that challenge that they have now had time to accept and about which they have had plenty of time to think: let them just tell us and the Australian community any period at all during those 30 years when they came within a bull's roar of a program of micro-economic reform to compare with what the Government has done generally in the area of micro-economic reform and in regard to the waterfront in particular.</PARA>
<PARA> When in government the Opposition parties did nothing but exacerbate the situation with respect to the waterfront. Under the program of micro-economic reform that we have brought through, there will be reform on the waterfront. There is a distinction between the way in which the Opposition would approach that reform and the way in which the Government would approach it. The Opposition can either give effect to its rhetoric and say that it will bring in draconian legislation that will punish employers and the trade unions if they do not do something, it can talk about it and produce chaos, or it can engage in the process of constructive consultation with the employers and the trade unions which will produce reform. Those are the alternatives. The Opposition did nothing. There is no reason to assume that in government it would have the courage to take on the issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has had the opportunity over the last few months in one area of micro-economic reform, that is, the aviation industry. What was it prepared to do there? What was its answer? It was to cave in to the pilots. When the pilots said they wanted a 30 per cent wage increase, the Opposition was prepared to say, `Yes, of course, have your 30 per cent wage increase'. It would have destroyed the Australian economy. That is what the Opposition's reform would have been. As a result of what is happening here, the pilots' component of the airline industry will have a 50 per cent productivity increase over what there was before. The Opposition had that chance and all it did was to say, `Give in'. That would have destroyed not only the aviation industry but also the Australian economy. As I have said before, the Opposition did not have the guts to begin to face up to the pilots; how would it get on with the wharfies?</PARA></TALK.START>

What progress has been made in implementing this decision?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2915" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the questioner indicates, in the Budget the Government said it would amalgamate a number of organisations that have compatible roles in furthering the process of structural reform. In particular, the Government is convinced of the need to join the Inter-State Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission because transport issues are such an integral aspect of business activity and are best considered in a broad economic context. I am aware of media commentary, though, claiming there is a constitutional impediment to what the Government is proposing. However, the Government's legal advice is that it is up to the Parliament to determine whether or not the Inter-State Commission comes into existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just give some of the history. What the Government is now proposing is consistent with the history of the ISC provision in the Constitution. Since 1901 the ISC has been active only from 1913 to 1920 and from 1984 to now. The ISC Act was repealed in 1950. A new Act was not passed by Parliament until 1973 and this was not proclaimed until 1983. The bottom line is that, under our proposals, the role of the Inter-State Commission will be enhanced, not diminished, by being incorporated in a larger body with greater economic expertise under a dynamic new chairman, Mr Tony Cole. The Government regards it as vital to the process of accelerating micro-economic reform that the Industry Commission Bill be passed by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I add that, once again, the Opposition is standing in the way of the sort of micro-economic reform that it is saying that it supports. The Opposition has decided to oppose this Bill. As reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday, the National Party-the old Country Party-has rolled the shadow Treasurer, and, consequently, the Opposition has decided to oppose this vital Bill. So the Opposition has decided to oppose the Bill that will reform the inquiry and recommendation process on economy-wide industry reform. The Opposition talks about micro reform but, as usual, when it comes down to it, it is the old National Party tail wagging the coalition dog.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of an instance of the shadow Treasurer relying on his experience as an adviser in the days of the former coalition Government in a quote in the Australian Financial Review on 6 July 1987. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It was very frustrating. Howard would get rolled. Cabinet Ministers would sway the debate on the basis of an anecdote in the non-members' bar the night before, even if we had four feet of paper on the table . . . The farmers could produce anecdotes out of the air. I used to wonder a lot how much many of them understood.</PARA>
<PARA>For decades, members of the Country Party were responsible for corrupting markets in this country as successive Liberal Treasurers failed to stand up to them. The shadow Treasurer showed last week that it is par for the course for the Liberal Party. He is following in the footsteps of his former employer, the honourable member for Bennelong, who was famous for his weakness inside coalition Cabinets in not being able to get his way in the face of the Country Party. What we find in the Sydney Morning Herald is this:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the push to dump the legislation came from the National Party transport spokesman, John Sharp, who had convinced his leader, Charles Blunt, to take on the Opposition spokesman on the Treasury, John Hewson. Hewson got done, despite support from the Opposition spokesman on finance, John Stone.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, with him on one's side, no wonder! The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> However, as the meeting progressed, it became clear he had used all his political capital getting his preferred position on the new rules for company tax . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the House that they were more lenient arrangements, so he used up his capital agreeing to more lenient arrangements. The quotation concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . with Sharp adamant, he was forced to capitulate.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the great lion who is going to change the face of the Australian economy. This is the person who is going to reform the wharves and ports-make all the micro changes. He is afraid to ask me the questions about the subject because he never likes the answers. The Leader of the Opposition will not put a question to me because, when he was shadow Treasurer, he used to die when he got the answers. As shadow Treasurer he used to have to ask a question once a month to at least let his crowd know that he still had some gumption, but now he will not ask at all. Here is the shadow Treasurer, who has been rolled by whom?-John Sharp from the National Party. He has convinced the Leader of the National Party-that great intellectual guru-that they should roll a Bill which establishes the Industry Commission with the Inter-State Commission as the major inquiry and recommending body in micro reform.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister said, whenever the tests have come to the Opposition, whether it be micro reform with pilots and the airline industry, pharmaceuticals, or micro reform in the tax system, the Opposition has always opposed the lot. The Opposition left us with the port and wharf structure they referred to earlier-as the Prime Minister said-for 30 to 40 years of craven weakness in the face of the stevedoring companies and unions. This Government has produced a 40 per cent lift in wharf productivity and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development crew-manning levels on coastal shipping, and the Opposition is still carping at it.</PARA>
<PARA> I will make the point clear: This notion that we can shift the public savings balance by 8 percentage points of gross domestic product and that we can shift macro-economic policy by 8 percentage points of GDP in the face of an underlying current account weakness of 6 per cent and that does not matter, but further reform of ports and wharves will make all the difference-that is just bunkum. That is small beer. That is what I pointed to. It is relatively small beer compared with macro policy. Even small as it is, the Opposition could not fix it up. Now the vehicle that the Government is employing to inquire into and make recommendations the Opposition does not even have the wit or the courage to carry though its own shadow Cabinet and party room.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Isaacs for his question. The Government shares-and I am sure the Opposition does-the hopes and aspirations of the Czechoslovak people and of the Czechoslovakian community here in Australia which have been engendered by the quite remarkable events of the past few days in Prague, Bratislava and other centres. The extinguishing of the Czech Spring, the Prague Spring in particular, by the Soviet-led invasion in August 1968 led, as we know, to 21 years of national anguish, frustration and stagnation. During that awful period of 21 years, decent Czechoslovaks, such as the great athlete Emil Zatopek, were subjected to harassment and humiliation. Their choice was simply either to suffer in silence or, as many of the country's outstanding talents did in that period, like the great film director Milos Forman, to seek freedom abroad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously we have a sense of exhilaration, which I am sure is shared throughout the House, at the spirit that is sweeping the Czechoslovak nation. The distinguished playwright Vaclar Haval, for so many years the victim of repression in his own country, is exercising an important influence on national affairs. It is particularly moving for all of us to see Alexander Dubcek, whose brutal overthrow in 1968-69 was followed by 20 years in isolation and humiliation, once again playing an important national role in his own country. On behalf of the Government I have sent Mr Dubcek a message expressing our admiration for his courage and constancy of purpose and welcoming his re-emergence on Czechoslovakia's national stage.</PARA>
<PARA> The corollary of these developments is the overthrow of the quislings, the opportunists and the conformists who have prospered since 1968. In this place last Tuesday I said that their days were numbered. Milos Jakes, the hard line party leader who presided over the major purge after 1969, has fallen, along with other leading Brezhnevite figures. Clearly, a major shake-out is in progress and, equally clearly, that shake-out is not yet complete. On behalf of the Government I express the hope that representative institutions and personalities, consonant with the strong national tradition of democracy in Czechoslovakia, will emerge and that they will be able to tackle the major tasks of reform which have accumulated over the decades. This development will serve to reinforce the currently strongly positive trend in East-West relations and also facilitate closer bilateral relations between Australia and Czechoslovakia.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, hopes to call into Prague during his proposed visit to eastern Europe next month, and I hope that he will have contact there with this new, emerging, exciting political leadership.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that the Leader of the Opposition should look very closely at the decision that was handed down at the end of last week by the judge of the Supreme Court. I will come to the specifics of the question in a moment. There is only one part of the decision by the judge of the Supreme Court which I presume the Leader of the Opposition will not question in its analysis. There is only one matter out of which the Government basically draws any pleasure or comfort and it is this: the judge of the Supreme Court had the responsibility, in that atmosphere as distinct from this, of analysing, in a detached and judicial way, the allegations made in this place, which were also made outside this place by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. The Leader of the Opposition has been at one with them in making allegations, in regard to the history of this issue, that there has been a conspiracy between the Government and the airlines of this country to bring about this confrontation. Day after day in this place he has given support to that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As distinct from the Opposition's allegations being thrown around in this place, in the calm and detached atmosphere of the Supreme Court the judge had the responsibility of analysing the allegations which were made before him by the Federation, the same allegations which the Opposition has been throwing around day after day. The judge's finding in regard to this matter was clear. He repudiated unequivocally those allegations. He said that there was no evidence to sustain the proposition and he rejected the argument that there had been any conspiracy between the Government and the airlines to bring about a confrontation. Specifically, he found that it was the AFAP which, to use his words, had been spoiling for a fight.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to understand the implications of the judgment for the Opposition, because in one statement the judge of the Supreme Court has totally destroyed the position which the Opposition has adopted in this place. It is further evidence of the remarkable hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition and the total Opposition in this place that now there has been an untrammelled opportunity to test the allegations which the Opposition has thrown around so recklessly and without any basis, the judge of the Supreme Court has found its allegations and those of its colleagues, the AFAP, to be entirely without foundation. I come from that basic point to the deep regret that we on this side of the House have that it was necessary for this to happen, because from day one we pleaded with the AFAP to operate within the processes of the Industrial Relations Commission. We pleaded with it to stay within that system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had pleaded with the AFAP, as had the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), to stay within the system which has provided for, is abided by and is used by the whole of the trade union movement in this country-that is, if it had claims for increases it should go to the Industrial Relations Commission and argue them. It was pointed out to the AFAP by the Government and the ACTU that if it did not follow those processes but said: `No, we don't want to use that area where there is the protection for those who take industrial action and who process their claim. We want to take ourselves outside that system, with all the protection that it provides'-no-one forced it to do so-it must understand and expect that it would be subjected to civil processes which could be extremely damaging for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We did not want that to happen. We pleaded that the airline pilots should stay within the system and not expose themselves to that risk. Time after time we said, `Stay within the system'. We said, `If as a result of your decision to go outside the system the airlines decide that it is necessary, in the context of your creation, to take action they will have our support'. That action having been taken, I repeat what I have said. We take no joy or comfort from it. We did not want it to happen. We pleaded with it that it should not happen. That having happened, the Opposition has to live with the fact that a judge of the Supreme Court has dealt with the allegations that the Opposition had made. Day after day in this place and outside it the Opposition has joined with the Federation of Air Pilots in condemning this Government and the airlines, saying that we are in cahoots and that we are in conspiracy. What the Opposition has to live with is the fact that a judge of the Supreme Court has repudiated that, found it to be without substance and that in fact it is the Federation which has been spoiling for a fight.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by repeating what I have said before: the Industrial Relations Commission has said that there is a way for the Federation of Air Pilots to become involved in the reconstruction of the airline industry. The Supreme Court judge has spoken in regard to these allegations, and he has dismissed them, as they should have been. The Industrial Relations Commission, in an atmosphere distinct from that of this place, is saying what can happen, what is the way for the Federation of Air Pilots to be involved in the reconstruction of the airline industry. It made it quite clear, and let me take this opportunity of indicating what that process is. The Industrial Relations Commission has said that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots should accept three conditions. They are not conditions that are imposed specifically upon the Australian Federation of Air Pilots; they apply to all unions. The first is that the Federation should lift the embargo upon its members seeking employment; secondly, that it should accept the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission; and, thirdly, that it should be bound by the national wage case principles.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission has said that if the Federation accepts those three conditions, which apply to everyone else, it can apply to be bound by the award which is now based upon the contract. Further, following those points, if the Federation then seeks to be so bound and says, as it does, that it does not like the conditions of the contract, in those circumstances it is open for it to argue before the Commission for a variation of the conditions of that award. In other words, the Industrial Relations Commission has set down the path quite clearly as to how the Australian Federation of Air Pilots can be involved in the reconstruction of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> It is both my hope and the Government's hope that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots will accept that path which has been so clearly outlined by the Commission. That is the one and only way in which the Australian Federation of Air Pilots can now, in this situation in which the airline industry is being rebuilt, have a part in it. If the Australian Federation of Air Pilots makes that decision to follow the path laid down by the Industrial Relations Commission and seeks to be bound by the award, this Government will not be heard to oppose it.</PARA>

<PARA> That this House censures the Prime Minister for his arrogant disregard for the impact of his Government's mismanagement of Australian families and businesses struggling under record high interest rates and struggling to cope with the continuing fall-out from the pilots' dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>We move this motion of censure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with very good cause, and it follows the censure of him by so many people in South Australia last Saturday. There may once have been a time when this Prime Minister was governing, albeit that that is debatable. What is not debatable, but is an irrefutable fact, is that this Prime Minister-one only had to hear him at Question Time to confirm this bluntly and to the point-is a spent force whose time is up and who is a positive impediment to effective and compassionate government. This is a government without direction. It has lost its way. It gives no relief, makes no progress, has no credibility. It is a policy-bankrupt government. </PARA>
<PARA> I want briefly to remind the House what I said last week of the five steps of the paralysis of policy of this Government. Those five steps were that, instead of policies, we have the politics of the big lie, the politics of the quick fix, the politics of personal abuse, the politics of hypocrisy and the politics of confusion. The politics of the big lie are substantiated by reminding people of the statements the Prime Minister has made. Interestingly, I forgot one last week. The first was that no child will live in poverty by 1990. The second was that interest rates will fall. The third was that the pilots dispute is over. The one I forgot last week was that their will be no capital gains tax. That is the politics of the big lie. It is followed, as I have said, by the politics of the quick fix. We have Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, Coronation Hill and the bank interest subsidy. There is the politics of personal abuse-Elliott, Parbo, the pilots federation and the pensioners. What about pensioner Bell? As we have said, any man who calls an age pensioner a silly old bugger does not deserve to be Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the politics of hypocrisy. There are the rorts of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the travel allowance. I forgot the matter of Keating's rorts last week. There was the travel allowance, the tax return and the travel documents. I forgot the travel documents. I assume the Treasurer got to Tokyo this time with a visa. They would have given him a visitor's visa pretty rapidly because they would not have wanted him to establish a case for permanent residence. There was then the exclusion of the trade unions from capital gains tax, and the elaboration of the policy of confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to this policy-bankrupt Government, the Opposition has given the nation the Economic Action Plan-substantiated throughout, a document which is the most detailed and comprehensive tax and expenditure program ever presented by an Opposition party. It is an action plan for a more productive and fairer Australia. By the end of our first term in government the tax rates will be cut, interest rates will be lower, government will be smaller, inflation will be reduced, productivity and real wages will be higher and the growth in foreign debt will be brought under control. </PARA>
<PARA> At Question Time I heard either the Prime Minister or the Treasurer talking about the inadequacy of the proposals we have, for example, on fiscal policy. Let me remind the House that our fiscal policy will reduce outlays by $2.7 billion to 22.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), the lowest since 1964-65. We will reduce the tax revenue as a proportion of GDP to 24.3 per cent, the lowest level in six years. We will direct $1.6 billion from the first year of the privatisation program towards reducing public debt, and we will increase the Budget surplus, including asset sales, by $1.7 billion to $10.8 billion-which, at 3 per cent of GDP, is the largest increase since comparable figures have been kept. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and again we have asked for the Government's policies. It does not matter in what field of government administration we raise the point about the Government policies for the future, the Government cannot tell us what it will do. It has not produced a blueprint or a schedule. More than 30 policy documents have been produced by the Opposition; not one has been produced by the Government. No wonder the National Farmers Federation berated the Prime Minister last week and said that the only policy discussion around today concerns Opposition policy. The Government has no policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The test is simple. We can go around to Government Ministers and ask, `Can we have a copy of your policy for the future?'. They say, `We don't have one'. We can pose various questions. Time and again we have posed them. Where is the Prime Minister's policy for relief for families? He does not have one. Will he commit himself to the discipline of forgoing the proceeds of bracket creep? No. Does he intend to reduce the size of the public sector? No. Where is his program for privatisation-the small beer of micro-economic reform? None exists. Will he adopt our spending cuts? No way. Will he liberalise the labour market? He cannot even work out which way to go about it. Hawke and Keating have different approaches. Where is the Prime Minister's policy on injecting foreign competition into coastal shipping? He has no idea. He simply dumps on previous governments. We might as well go back to Federation. The fact is that he does not have any policies for the future. He has a very simple tactic of just stating the problem, either dismissing it or claiming victory, and then leaving the field. So nothing at all is done. When we are elected, as we will be at the next election, once again the Australian people will have a government that has a passion for results rather than a government that has a passion simply for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The substance of this censure motion relates to both interests rates and of course the pilots dispute. They sum things up about this Government. Let us go over a little bit a minor part of the Government's history on interest rates. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech during the last election, pledged that he would get interest rates down. He said this as late as this year simply because he was campaigning in the Western Australian elections; not because he knew anything would happen. He said, `Interest rates will fall by the end of the year'. After months and months of buffeting, because people are hurting so much, he said over the weekend, `I could just say, ``All right, down come interest rates'' '. There is then the more revealing statement for this Government which allegedly relies on a quasi-independent Reserve Bank of Australia. The most ludicrous, damning and most pointed statement of all was, `I could just ring up and say, ``Ease the screws: rates down'' '. </PARA>

<PARA> What about the pilots? This really is lovely stuff. Everyone is suffering; everyone is inconvenienced. The effect on the trade balance is well known. But this man, who is in another world, has his head in the sky-but the planes are not there with him, only the interest rates. He has no idea of how to fix the problem, yet he stood up here today and said, `I pleaded with them'. Government members know what he said and the Australian people know what he said: he declared war on the pilots. He could have these planes back in the sky tomorrow. He, with his Government, is the owner of Australian Airlines Ltd. He could test the pilots. Instead of testing them with his phoney language, he could take them to the court and direct Australian Airlines-it is his airline-to sit down and negotiate with the pilots. If he were to test them out he would have them back in the air straight away. He should stop the compensation, test the pilots out and negotiate with them. But oh no. Honourable members know what is going on. They know who gets on the phone and says, `I want the compensation'. So the compensation is paid-taxpayers' money; money paid by everyone here-just to keep this dispute going because the Prime Minister declared war. The Prime Minister was the one who said, on 20 August, that the common law proceedings brought by the airlines had `the full support of my Government'. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who has any doubts about the ineffectiveness of this Government and the havoc it is wreaking on the Australian people should just remember the other sorts of phrases that have been used to justify the inept behaviour of this Prime Minister. He said, `The pilots dispute is over'. But the best of all-and the real test of this man-is that he said that if he could not protect Australia against the pilots, `I would not deserve to be Prime Minister'. More than 100 days have gone by and he has not protected Australia-and he does not deserve to be Prime Minister. The people of South Australia showed him that. They showed him what they thought. </PARA>
<PARA> The only comparable occasion in recent history was the narrow return of the Dunstan Government in 1975 when, like Mr Bannon, Mr Dunstan pleaded with the South Australian people to disregard Federal issues. He said, `Please get them out of the way. Don't take any notice of what the Whitlam Government is doing; judge me'. Dunstan squeaked back. Do honourable members known when Dunstan squeaked back? It was only weeks before the greatest devastation wreaked on the Australian Labor Party in the history of this nation. That was in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The only justifiable reason for this Prime Minister's not anticipating what happened in South Australia was the fact that he was hardly there. Anyone who blinked would have missed him because Mr Bannon did not want him there. Mr Bannon would not have a bar of the Prime Minister's participating in that election campaign. If Premier Bannon were here today he would probably have seconded this motion. No wonder the Prime Minister does not know the consequences of the South Australian election results, because Mr Bannon and his Party would not let him visit the State. The Prime Minister went there to handle the submarine project, which was understandable, because it was appropriate that he should stand on the conning tower during the election campaign. It was also appropriate for Mr Bannon. If one looks at the history of the Bannon Government, one will discover that it has torpedoed just about every other major development in the State. The majority of South Australians were aware of the situation, but the Prime Minister was not, because the Bannon Government would not let him go there. The Prime Minister is a liability to the Labor Party but, tragically, he is an even greater liability to this nation. The sooner he ceases the rhetoric of saying, `I can fix this and I can fix that', squirming his way through Question Time and deceiving-and that is what he is doing today-his own Party--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what the Prime Minister was saying. Some people can forgive mistakes of judgment, but they cannot forgive the deliberate and calculated deception practised by this Prime Minister. He is the leader of a party in government. We and the Australian people expect some guidance from him but, more particularly, we expect some leadership. Over the past 12 months this Parliament and nation have witnessed his continued and unashamed attempts to mislead the Australian people. How can the Prime Minister say the sorts of things he does and then, two months later, seek to wriggle out of them? Does the Prime Minister make up the statements as he goes? He certainly has no central purpose to his Government. If he did have some central purpose, he would not continue with these economic policies which are retarding the development of the nation-even worse, they are retarding the lives of so many people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the pilots dispute, the Prime Minister just does not care. The Prime Minister is content to just wriggle through any matter. The pity of it is that the pain being inflicted on Australians is simply not necessary. If he undertook the micro-economic reform that he knows is required, our trading position would improve and interest rates would decrease. However, he has put micro-economic reform into the too hard basket. The harsh reality is that this Government is absolutely paralysed in terms of policy. All it does is set up studies and, when it runs out of agencies to research the problems, it simply sets up more government bodies to undertake more studies. We have seen this pattern in the establishment of the Industry Commission. Did honourable members hear the remarks made by the Treasurer this afternoon when he referred to `this significant micro-economic reform' that he has introduced? I refer to the amalgamation of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and the Inter-State Commission. This Government, after the previous election, said that the hallmark and the pinnacle of this third term of the Hawke Government was to be micro-economic reform. The one thing that it did in this Budget was to amalgamate the IAC and the Inter-State Commission. They will all do the same thing: they are included in the one Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are opposing it, you fool, because under the Constitution the Inter-State Commission has an ongoing provision. However, the Government is seeking to amend it in a non-constitutional way. It seems to me that the Government's legal advice is about as good as the medical advice it propagates around here, for which it churns out fees on the old Medicare! In short, the problem for the Australian people today is that the Prime Minister and his Government are paralysed. The Government is stagnating. It has no ideas and no direction. I concede that two weeks ago the single, most important initiative was taken by the Government: the Prime Minister wrote to his Ministers asking for some ideas. I hope that Opposition members keep those cards and letters coming in because nothing is coming from the Government side. It was the most important initiative taken to date, yet we have seen nothing and we will not see anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only alternative lies with the coalition. The Government cannot produce the detailed reforms so carefully worked through and fully costed as appears in our Economic Action Plan. As I said at the outset, I could go to every Minister's office in the building and ask for the policies for the future, but I would not get any because those policies simply have not been determined. The Government is running down the nation without any charter whatsoever for the future. The Government knows that a single reliance on high interest rates is not the only way to go. The Government cannot bring itself to spell out, as we have in our document, a coordinated economic program on fiscal, wages and monetary policy, the structural reforms, the micro-economic reforms, the privatisation program and the tax changes. Our plan offers the future for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy processes in the Hawke Government, however, have become nothing but a farce-Ministers publicly campaign against Ministers; major public policy statements are made without consultation, whether the Treasurer on the run in Tokyo on enterprise unions or the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) on family policy; and key policy areas are given over to special interest lobbies. Last week, the Government said that we cannot have its tax policy until Bill Kelty comes back from his Christmas holidays; it has been deferred till next year. Last week, the Prime Minister sought to deny that the extreme environmentalists were being given veto powers over mining projects, which they are. Honourable members will remember that the penultimate point the Prime Minister made in his speech then was to say that it was outrageous that I had made an allegation that the Government had sold out to environmentalists. </PARA>
<PARA> If we test what is happening in the area of value-added industries and see the requests and needs for development in this country, we will see them retarded if the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) can get to the door first. Honourable members do not have to take my word for it. They can take that of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) because he pointed out that the Government has no policy for sustained development; in the pursuit of votes it has sold out to the green movement; it has no sensible, sensitive, balanced environmental policy, as we do. The reality is that the Government has a desperate need to give a lead, to give relief; it just cannot do it. As a consequence, I am not surprised that headlines such as `Hawke is a liability say MPs' appear in papers. The problem is that the Prime Minister is a liability not just to the Australian Labor Party; tragically, he is now a liability also to the Australian nation. </PARA>

I trust that members opposite will not question the source to which I go, because it is Access Economics. I think that the Opposition will accept Access Economics checking us, because it is the organisation to which it resorted and which was responsible for checking the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said that in this country we have no policies which enable sustainable development. Let us have Access Economics check us. In its publication, which came out on 6 October 1989, just two or three weeks ago, under `Investment Monitor', it says that it has provided this unique listing, sector by sector, of some 500 investment projects, worth over $5m each, under construction, committed or under consideration, in mining, manufacturing, tourism and public sector investment related to foreign exchange earnings. It continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Projects listed have a total value of over $90 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> As a proportion of total investment tourism represents 34 per cent, manufacturing 30.5 per cent, the public sector 21 per cent and mining 14.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of total investment 54 per cent is under construction or committed and 46 per cent is under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>Access Economics goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the list is not padded out with a large number of projects which are unlikely to proceed on commercial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> We have included projects in mining, manufacturing and tourism as major sectors with the potential to earn foreign exchange. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Projects are spread across a much wider range of industries than was the case with the resources boom. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the report on this Government by Access Economics. It is remarkable, in the light of the statement by the Leader of the Opposition that this Government has no policies for the future for sustainable development. What are the projected foreign income earnings of these projects listed by Access Economics? Of those which are already under construction and committed, the estimate is of some $5 billion per annum of foreign exchange earnings and, of the total $90 billion, an estimate of some $10 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard all this noise. Today we have witnessed the remarkable spectacle of the recycled leader with his recycled speech, but in this recycled speech of the recycled leader, we have it failing on every point, as I will show. At the last point of this recycled speech of the recycled leader he said that the Government has no policies for sustain- able development. A report on the Government by his own examiners, Access Economics, destroys the Opposition's own proposition: $90 billion worth of sustainable investment development. The Leader of the Opposition has been destroyed out of the mouth of his own mob. That is how much notice we can take of him. </PARA>
<PARA> I now go to the most remarkable comment I think we have heard in this Parliament from the recycled leader. Quite remarkably, he made the observation that he was concerned with the return of an effective and compassionate government. I do not want to engage in a whole lot of rhetoric. I will sustain my proposition that that is the most cynical piece of hypocrisy that I have heard in this Parliament by just testing the Opposition's record against that of the Government. That can be done by looking at some very significant groups; that will test the compassion of the Liberals and the Nationals against that of the Government. Let us look at what has happened. Do not let us talk about compassion in this rhetorical sense, let us do a simple test. What happened to groups of people who needed the compassion of government under the Liberals and Nationals when they were in government and what has happened to those same groups who needed compassion under this Government? I take these examples. I take the case of a sole parent with two children. I guess people would say that that group in our society-sole parents with the responsibility of looking after two children-is a pretty classic test by which to judge the compassion of alternative governments. What happened to that group in the period 1975 to 1983? What happened to their real disposable income in the seven years under this crowd opposite? The real disposable income of a sole parent with two children went down by 4 per cent. In seven years, the compassion that those sole parents experienced was a reduction in their real disposable income. What has happened under this Government between 1983 and 1989?</PARA>

I do not say he is a fool; I simply say he cannot understand the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at another group in respect of whom one might make the judgment about compassion. Let us look at the position of a married pensioner couple with two children. Would one think that a married pensioner couple with two children belong to the sort of group by which one might test the compassion of government? What happened in the seven-year period in government of that mob-these people who now propose compassion? The real disposable income of a married pensioner couple with two children was slashed by 2 per cent in their period of government, whilst under us it has increased by 14 per cent. There is the test of compassion. The Opposition can have all its rhetoric about Australian families and compassion; it slashed the real disposable income of that group as well and we have massively increased it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the case of the long-term unemployed single adult, and let us take two categories-one who is not renting privately and the other who is renting privately. What did the Opposition do for the long-term adult unemployed? It slashed the real disposable income of that person by 19 per cent. This is a person who, through no fault of his own, was unemployed for a long period and the Opposition in government-and the Leader of the Opposition has the hypocrisy to get up in this place and talk about compassion-slashed the real disposable income of that person by 19 per cent. Under this Government, if he or she is not renting privately there has been a 23 per cent increase in real disposable income, or if he or she is renting privately, 32 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We can have all the rhetoric in the world about compassion, but these people, who are now proposing the same economic policies that they had before and who now talk about compassion, can be tested in each one of the categories of our society who look properly to government for compassion. The Opposition when in government slashed their income in real terms. Through carefully targeted and responsible government, this Government has significantly increased the real disposable income of those groups who must and can look only to government for compassion. The rhetoric about compassion must be tested against the record. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that factual situation, we now have to judge what it is that these people would offer against what this Government has done. I have disposed of the absolute untruths of the Leader of the Opposition in his statement about no sustainable development. I have disposed of that by reference to his own Access Economics. I have disposed of his hypocrisy about compassion, but let me go to that part of the Leader of the Opposition's speech about the grand plan the Opposition has for the future-the Economic Action Plan. The other day I had cause to refer briefly to an analysis by Mr Gittins, just to get some idea of how much substance can be given to this so-called Economic Action Plan. Everyone heard what it was going to do: zero inflation, minimum interest rates, rising employment, everything one could dream of. Let us share just a few thoughts with Mr Gittins about how much significance can be attached to this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I've just got hold of my copy-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the Economic Action Plan that has been advanced in this censure motion as the answer. This is what they did before-smashed the economy and brought the worst recession in 50 years, and at the same time there was double-digit unemployment and double-digit inflation. That is what they did, but now they have the new Economic Action Plan, which will do it differently. Gittins goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This was where Dr Hewson revealed his great insight, the revelation that will make him the world's greatest Treasurer. This discovery, termed the `integrated economic strategy'-</PARA>
<PARA>which the Leader of the Opposition has been talking about-</PARA>
<PARA>will, he says, constitute a `different world' to the one we have known. Clearly, it will confound the conventional wisdom as to how economies are managed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hewson breakthrough is simply stated. His strategy will have as its central objective the control of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Leader of the Opposition said. Gittins continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Inflation and wage growth will be down to the level of our trading partners by the end of the first term. But this will be achieved with less, rather than greater, reliance on monetary policy and won't involve a rise in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>What did Gittins say about this strategy? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>See what I mean? It's path-breaking stuff; Nobel Prize material. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me make my shamefaced confession upfront. I'm having difficulty following the logic of the different world. </PARA>
<PARA>Boy oh boy! Not only is Mr Gittins having difficulty following the logic of this nonsense; so is every commentator who has looked at it. </PARA>

Because, like Mr Gittins, he knows that it is a load of hogwash. Mr Gittins, having given it the consolidated raspberry, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If you get down to it, what's the core of this pathbreaking stuff, this Nobel Prize winning new economic theory? The core of it is wages policy. It is clear to me that wages policy lies at the heart of the breakthrough to a different world. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me conclude by examining, in terms of what the Leader of the Opposition has said, how much credence can be given to the central core of this new world wages policy. I will do it by relating it to the airline pilots dispute. When the Opposition was tested, when it came down to finding out, not in its textbooks, back rooms or committee rooms, but in the hard world of Australian industrial relations, the Opposition's industrial relations policy and wages policy were found wanting. </PARA>
<PARA> It demonstrated in 1989 that it was the same as it was in 1981-82: when the pressure is on it gives in. What happened when it gave in in 1981-82? We had the most massive wages breakout and every first year economics student knew the inevitable result. It was what happened when the Opposition said, `No, we will take away the apparatus of the regulated centralised wage system and let it be free reined'. That is what the Opposition is saying now and what happened then? We had the worst recession in 50 years because the whole economy collapsed and that is what the Opposition would have done today. It would have given 30 per cent to the pilots and would have ended up in 1989 with what it inflicted on the country in 1981-82. It fails on the test of compassion on the statistics; it fails on the allegation of no sustainable development by its own tester and examiner, that is, Access Economics, and it fails on the crucially central question of an Economic Action Plan wages policy. It ruined the country once and it would do it again but, thank God, it will not be given the chance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House has just had to endure 20 minutes of unbounded claptrap. To indicate how out of touch the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is, I point out that he spends all of his time going backwards. He went backwards in the South Australian election last week and he went backwards right throughout his speech today. He spent his entire time going backwards and referring to the past. A large part of the motion deals with interest rates. The Prime Minister hardly mentioned interest rates. He hardly addressed the plight of the average Australian.

The people of South Australia, while they are struggling under high interest rates, have not had it as bad as people in other parts of Australia. Everyone in this place knows that a 5 per cent swing in South Australia is about a 10 per cent swing federally. Even on 5 per cent we would be swept to government with a landslide of 30 seats.

While the Prime Minister might ignore all the official warnings and even the comments of his pollster, Rod Cameron, or Simon Crean, he will ignore the warnings of the South Australian people at his peril. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) knows that. He has been out door-knocking in his electorate; he is that concerned about it. Look at the faces around there. Everyone knows how bad the current circumstances are. Average Australians are struggling under-indeed, many are being killed by-the Hawke-Keating Government's high interest rates. Home loan interest rates are 17 to 18 per cent and business borrowing costs are 21 to 25 per cent. Yet the Prime Minister, when addressing a matter of great substance-that is, this motion-hardly mentioned interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the average home buyer the facts are very simple. Today it takes an income of $64,100 to buy a median priced house in Sydney. The average male income is about $27,000 or $28,000 and the female income about $17,000. With a joint average income of between $45,000 and $46,000, a couple is looking at $64,100 which is required to buy a house. This Government's high interest rate policy has put the average home beyond the reach of the average Australian. There is an enormous amount of pressure on average Australian families and family structures. Members of families are being forced to take on extra jobs. They are being forced to take on second jobs. They are being forced to take on second mortgages instead of having children. The real losers are the children who are spending much more time on their own. Parents getting home after doing one or two jobs each find it impossible to spend time with their kids. The Government is destroying the lives of a whole generation of Australians as a result of its high interest rate policies. It is destroying family life in this country as a result of its high interest rate policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has argued in this House that high interest rates do not matter because only about 25 per cent of people have to pay increased interest rates under their current mortgage arrangements. That number has increased dramatically as many Australian families have been forced to move off regulated interest rates and take out second mortgages. As was revealed in the lead story in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, there are many people who for the first time are facing the reality of falling house prices. Instead of there being just a few people, as the Treasurer would like us to believe, who are influenced by this high interest rate policy, three million to four million Australian families buying their home at present are suffering under high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The new home buyer has seen the average house move elusively away from him, as his income has been restrained and as house prices and interest rates have skyrocketed in what was a speculative boom created by the Government's economic mismanagement. Following the introduction of the capital gains tax the only place in which many families could put their money was their home. We have seen record increases in house prices and interest rates in recent times. More recently, as interest rates have started to bite in the housing sector-that is the only area where we see any evidence of them biting-house prices have started to fall. Looking at the simple equation of the average two- income family earning around $45,000 to $46,000 and needing $64,100 to buy a home, one sees that there are only two ways in which such people will be able to get there-that is, a substantial boost in their income or a substantial fall in house prices to make that equation add up. That is why Max Walsh, on the front page of this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, devoted so much time and space on this under the heading `Falling home prices spell the end for Hawke'. Falling home prices, as a direct consequence of this Government's economic mismanagement and its high interest rates, will spell the end for Hawke. The swing in prospect at the Federal level as a result of the Government's persistence with a misguided policy of sole reliance on high interest rates will be roughly double the substantial swing in South Australia last weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> When we consider how much the median house price has already fallen in Sydney, we must remember that typically in the past house prices did not fall very much. They tended to stop rising for a time, flattening out a bit, but they did not fall very much. Honourable members have seen the advertisements in real estate offices where a little old man with a walking stick is described as the person who waited for house prices to fall. House prices never tended to fall very much off the rate of inflation, but in this period of flattening economic activity, we have already seen a substantial fall in house prices in Sydney. The median house price in Sydney has come down over $40,000 since the peak in around March this year. Many average Australians, even those who own their own home, are now experiencing the impact of those falling house prices on their wealth. Just as this guy, the Treasurer, gets the economy slowing down ultimately by high interest rates, he will get a double whammy wealth effect coming from the housing sector as people cut back their consumption expenditure, driving the economy through the floor. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the risk the Government is playing with. Billy Bunter-the Leader of the House-can sit there making jokes and making light of it. Another place where house prices have started to fall is Perth. In the last quarter they have also fallen in Canberra. House prices are starting to fall significantly for the first time in our history. That is hitting not just those who have recently got into a home but also those who own a home and who in many cases have borrowed recently against the equity in that home to purchase other assets, to educate their children, or whatever. The Government is risking the greatest financial shake-out this country has seen by its ill-informed persistence with high interest rates under present circumstances. The Government should consider the consequences if house prices continue to fall-$40,000 already on the median house price in Sydney. How far will the Government let house prices continue to fall? How many families will it annihilate? How many people who own their own home will it put at risk as a result of this policy?</PARA>
<PARA> The other part of our motion relates to the pilots dispute. We have seen a conscious attempt on the part of the Government to downplay the significance of the pilots dispute. It has ranged from the Treasurer saying that when he was in a leading Sydney hotel it still had a high occupancy rate right through to the Prime Minister denying that the dispute continues to exist. The people of Australia know that the dispute exists. They know the damage that it is doing to the tourist industry and to a large part of the small business industry in this country and they have one simple question: Why has the Government not solved it?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is in a unique position in this dispute. It is an employer in this dispute. Effectively, it owns Australian Airlines and it could instruct the management of Australian Airlines to start negotiating immediately. The Government could end this dispute in a few days by providing the right sort of lead, by recognising that it is an employer in this dispute. I believe that the Government could get a commitment from the pilots to return to work in return for those negotiations being initiated. I believe that it could get those negotiations based on productivity and that it could, as a result, significantly start to change the face of industrial relations in this country. In recent days the Treasurer has become very attracted to our idea of enterprise bargaining. There is probably an opportunity in settling this dispute even for him to initiate the process of enterprise bargaining. Maybe we could have an Australian Airlines enterprise union negotiating this dispute. There are endless possibilities. The point is that this dispute can be settled in a matter of a few days. That settlement procedure can start the process of tying wages directly with productivity, which is precisely what this country needs, and that negotiating process can see the pilots return to work in return for those negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more than that, the Government can actually take the economic agenda one step further forward in solving this dispute by going into the area of competition. In an interview in the Australian this morning the Treasurer started to burn up his history of inactivity in micro-reform. We are told that micro-reform is no longer important, that macro-policy is king, always was king and always will be king. He is getting out of the micro-reform area. Yet in the settlement of this pilots dispute the Government could actually make a substantial change to the nature of competition in the airline industry and those negotiations that I have been talking about could take place in the context of a genuinely more deregulated and competitive airline market. Right now, foreign airlines are flying on domestic routes all over this country. Why does the Government not keep some of them there as a form of immediate competition in the nature of the settlement of this dispute and see those negotiations take place in a much more competitive market environment?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's concept of airline deregulation and competition in the airline industry ought to be drawn out for the average Australian. At the end of next year we are hardly going to see anything out of this dispute-mickey mouse deregulation at best; no genuine new competition; no effective competition coming in; and probably one dominant Australian airline left, Ansett Airlines of Australia, the other one being sent to the wall by this debilitating dispute that is probably consciously part of the procedure that is going on in the back rooms of the Government at the present time. This is a ridiculous situation for the country to be left in. </PARA>
<PARA> My point is that the dispute settlement can actually make substantial progress in two ways. First, it can initiate the sorts of changes in the industrial relations area that this country dramatically needs-wage increases genuinely based on productivity. What this country needs is a genuine productivity break-out. Second, the Government can get genuine competition into the airline industry, one of the most important sectors of our transportation industry at the present time. Now is a golden opportunity to advance both labour market reform and competition policy or micro-economic reform in the settlement of this dispute. What do we get as a response from this Government? What is the answer that the Prime Minister has given to the people of Australia? He started out by declaring war and he backed out when it got a bit tough. He tried a whole lot of other devious devices in order to distract attention from the fact that the dispute has got out of hand, that he inflamed it at the beginning and that now, of course, the bottom line cost, as is so often the case, is going to be a substantial segment of the small business community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of South Australia last weekend showed that they are aware of the damage the Government has done to home owners and home buyers. They are aware of the damage that the Government's policies have done to the small business community. They voted decisively against the Australian Labor Party. If the Government wants to test us in the national forum on the same sort of issues, we will fight the national election on interest rates, the Government's interest rate policy, and on solutions to the pilots dispute, because the Australian Labor Party and the Government stand totally condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just be quiet for a moment. Just shut up for a second. The Leader of the Opposition spoke to issues such as Britain's membership of the European monetary system, monetary union, the impact of the monetary union on Europe, federalism and the rest, and the response from the Prime Minister was around the same subjects; but in both cases there was structure to their thinking. Later on when I met the Leader of the Opposition it became obvious to me that the speech he made was but the tip of a very large iceberg in terms of his own knowledge and thoughts about the structure of policy for Britain and Britain's place in Europe. I came back to this shabby little debate here led by this frustrated actor, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), performing like a Victorian vaudeville hall performer-with all the antics and thespian character he could bring to the thing but without any ideas, without any idea that the requirement of an opposition is to be the alternative government, without any semblance of a policy structure. He referred to this Economic Action Plan. What was it? To take $2.5 billion off outlays and pay them as tax expenditures. That is it, as if to take $2.5 billion off outlays and spend it on tax expenditures would change the character of Australia, but while doing so suggesting that the Opposition would have the tightest fiscal surplus since 1964, when it has opposed just about every measure the Government has taken in seven long years of getting rid of the Opposition's fiscal legacy. The sheer indecency of it all!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To what point does the Opposition's change go? The Opposition is admitting that it would not change fiscal policy and, as the Department of Finance made clear, it would diminish the surplus by $800m. Therefore, with an $800m smaller surplus than the Government's, on what basis could the Opposition reduce interest rates? It has given up the option of doing anything about interest rates. The Opposition had its chance and decided to try to buy votes with the money instead of buying lower interest rates. The Opposition had the option of going through its fiscal policy and devoting cuts in outlays to a bigger surplus, but it did not do it. Instead, it decided to spend it; in the classic Liberal tradition, the Opposition took the sleazy way out to try to buy its way back to office. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the shadow Treasurer, is saying that we have no answer on interest rates and that interest rates are a record under us. He is wrong; they were a record under him and Treasurer Howard. Cash rates were 22 per cent compared to 18 per cent today. That is the result. </PARA>
<PARA> The most indecent thing is this talk from the Leader of the Opposition about the micro-economy. I swear blind that two years ago the Leader of the Opposition would not have known what the term meant. He would not have known what the term `micro-reform' implied. Yet the Government in 2 1/2 years has presided over a bigger micro-reform restructuring of the economy than at any time in the post war years. Let me record the progress in the micro-agenda in these last 2 1/2 years. There has been a cut in the company tax rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent-the largest micro-change of all. There has been a massive cut of 33 per cent in industrial protection-the second only cut since the war, and both times by a Labor government. There has been reform to the textile, clothing and footwear industries and to agricultural markets. There has been total reform of superannuation savings and a total remaking of the savings picture, with an extension of the imputation system to superannuation funds. There has been total deregulation of the airlines system, including air freight. There have been reforms to government business enterprises. There has been a 40 per cent lift in waterfront productivity. Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development crew manning levels for Australian shipping have been introduced. There has been reform of grain handling. Finally, but importantly, there has been award restructuring, the first attempt ever by a government to change the nature of the Australian award structure. That is in 2 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition had 30 years and did nothing. Now we have got somebody who could barely spell `micro' telling us how we should be progressing the micro-agenda. Then the honourable member for Wentworth, the shadow Treasurer, tries to upbraid me because I say that macro-policy is king. Of course it is king. Does the Opposition think we could deal with a 6 per cent current account imbalance if we still had a public sector borrowing requirement of 7 per cent? If we did not have an 8 percentage point shift in the savings balance, does the Opposition think that any micro-change would matter in terms of the economy? They both have to go together, hand in hand. Which Government has put that into place? A Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition thinks that it would all fall to him in office and that in some way he could preside over all of this change when he finally became Prime Minister. He does not understand that it is a hard world out there. Australia has difficulties. A mountain of debt was left from a structural weakness following 20 years of non-investment in the economy under the Liberal Party of Australia. Twenty years of failure to invest led to a current account weakness, with a figure of 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980, nine years ago. That is what we were left to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has hardly ever held a major domestic portfolio. When he had one, he spat the dummy and resigned on Prime Minister Fraser. He always held the foreign affairs portfolio and went swanning around the world, never taking the responsibility for major policy. As I have said in the House before, he was always happy to come second, always pleased to be in the reckoning but not quite make it. One telltale time, when he was defeated by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) for the Opposition leadership, he was asked the question `You always wanted to be Prime Minister, didn't you, Mr Peacock?'. The answer was, `Did I?'. He had that terribly shocking revealing look on his face that is the honest blush of a person without the guts to do the big job. He still does not have the guts to do the big job. He thinks that if he just rolls into office it will be okay. It will not be okay. The moment he starts to weaken and the empty-heads in the National Party of Australia roll him on policy-as happened to the shadow Treasurer this week-the markets in Tokyo, London and New York will kick the coalition to death. We turn over $40 billion in Australian dollars every day. These huge informed markets will beat the coalition to a pulp. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition do not understand. They think the born to rule squad is back. They think that they are finally back here and are trying to traffic their way into office on the basis that the Labor Government has had some high interest rates. But we will be inheriting the crown. This country has a long way to go to get out of debt problems given to us by the coalition when it was in government. If members of the coalition think that they should inherit our work, when they gave us the problem in the first place, and then sit there with someone who has more resemblance to a B-grade movie actor than to a thoughtful political personality, they can think again. I am afraid that wanting to come second and then finding one has come first will cause a very big personality change for Andrew Sharp Peacock. Were there to be a coalition government, it might fall to sterner people to work out the policy. But it would not come from the honourable member for Wentworth, who has always believed in giving Australia a recession. He helped Treasurer Howard give Australia a recession in 1982-83. In the end, his policy is a weak fiscal policy with high interest rates and a recession to cut import growth, inflation and wages. That is the only policy he has. The rest of the world would regard that as a non-policy. The moment any demand is made on the Australian economy out pops inflation, imports and structural weakness. However, this time it will pop out with $130 billion of gross debt. </PARA>

<PARA> We have been in office for seven years. The Opposition has put together no structure whatsoever. What does it finally come up with? It will take $2 1/2 billion off the Aborigines and unemployed and throw it away on tax expenditure- and they suggest that that is a policy change. But members of the Opposition have the crass indecency to talk about how economic policy is not working. Access Economics Pty Ltd has a list of $90 billion worth of projects. In this month's October balance of payments we see a 39 per cent increase over the same period last year in exports of machinery, transport equipment and manufactures. Manufacturing exports are growing by about 50 per cent a year now on average. When the coalition was in government the whole industry was dying. We are rebuilding our industrial base from the ground up, from the smouldering wreck the coalition left us with in 1982-83 when the factory doors were shutting across the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear talk about compassion for the families which are thrown on the unemployment scrapheap and their children but the worst thing is that members of the coalition would do it all again because in their hearts they believe that the only way to control wages is with high unemployment. Then another Labor government will have to come in and clean it up again. How many times have we cleaned up after other governments? During the war we had to pick up the pieces when Menzies, following his craven cowardice towards the appeasers in Europe, had to be thrown out of office. We had to bail Australia out of the Pacific war. Then we had to set up the game for the coalition government in the 1940s. Then in 1980s we had to do it again. Yet the Opposition thinks it will come back. </PARA>
<PARA> The most amusing part of the debate was when the shadow Treasurer quoted Max Walsh this morning. He was telling us how terrible it is that house prices in Sydney have risen and how the Labor Government will be defeated for it. Then he told us that we will be defeated because house prices are going down. He is having his argument both ways. He does not believe that the operation of the monetary policy is reasonable. He believes that he can just traffic his way into office on a recital of half-truths and prejudices. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has the tightest fiscal policy in the country's history. It has a workable wages policy delivering realistic and competitive wage outcomes and a monetary policy set firmly to play its proper role in moderating demand to lift product growth. We have the most comprehensive economic reform program in Australia's history. There has been structural reform of the variety I have just mentioned, tax reform, financial deregulation, airline deregulation, oil industry deregulation, ports and shipping restructuring, productivity-based wage rises, award restructuring, cuts to import tariffs and a better skilled work force. We have the highest investment share in our history, coming from corporate tax rates and imputation, and domestic savings are encouraged not only by a massive shift in the public savings balance by 8 per cent of GDP but also by a total change of occupational superannuation which, along with the Budget surplus, is totally changing the face of the Australian savings picture. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the work of a serious government. Only a serious government can change Australia and keep it changing and protect all Australians from being beaten to a pulp by the world markets. Imagine if the Leader of the Opposition were standing against the rest of the world trying to protect Australia from the ravages of the marketplace in the face of Liberal and National Party weakness. We would be ripped to pieces. The antics in the House of Representatives and the thespian tricks and all the rest would then count for nothing. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``this House expresses its concern at the total failure of the Opposition to produce a credible alternative economic strategy, as evidenced by the so-called Economic Action Plan, which would result in a relaxation of fiscal policy, a less effective wages policy, a tighter monetary policy, and no effective mechanism to advance microeconomic reforms, all of which would contribute to a rise in the level of interest rates, massively increase the level of unemployment and smash the economic fabric and structure of this country.''. </PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer came in here today like some sort of Tokyo Rose and used his usual techniques. There was a whole heap of personal abuse and vilification; a lecture about 1983, which was largely irrelevant; and then a pathetic attempt to pretend that everything is all right. The reality is that not everything is all right. Every economic indicator that measures this economy says that this man, who is now scurrying out of this chamber to rewrite his curriculum vitae, has failed. While most people think that he was over there talking to the Japanese press and not to the Australian media, he was really applying for jobs in Tokyo, London or anywhere else. The Paris option is well and truly back on the agenda. If Government backbenchers were smart they too would be reading the positions vacant columns. The Treasurer is; he has read the writing on the wall; he knows that he has failed. This is the man that took responsibility for their destiny. He took control of the political and economic strategy of this Government. He said, `I'll get interest rates down. Trust me. Just wait for the Budget strategy. We'll be right'. The political strategy, the economic strategy, just walked out the door, and if Government members were smart they would be doing the same because they have no hope whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government went into its third term very bravely indeed. I can hear the brave words now: the hallmark of the third term is going to be micro-economic reform. Where was the speech-Ballarat or Bendigo? The local member will remember it well because he too will be judged by it. What was the Government going to do? It was going to restructure this economy. It was going to make major changes to transport, shipping, the waterfront, labour reform-no-one asked Mr Crean or Mr Kelty-and of course telecommunications. In the only areas in which the Government has made changes it has fallen flat on its face. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this Government's media policy and see what that has given us. It was a question of taking the big cigars from its mates, doing what it was told, doing the bidding of the big end of town, and falling flat on its face. In recent days it has seen what that means. There were no cigars being handed out; there were just a few harsh words from the unions, and nothing was done. The Treasurer's strategy to get this Government re-elected and himself elected as Prime Minister has come unravelled. He has failed totally and absolutely. One only has to look at the latest Budget and the current account deficit: the forecast record of $18.5 billion will be closer to $25 billion. Any of those opposite who are halfway economically literate would know that they have no hope of getting a reduction in interest rates before they call an election, unless the Government takes the coward's option of having a half-Senate election and spending $40m or $50m to save the political skin of those miserable types over there. </PARA>
<PARA> Even on Saturday, when the Bannon Government was nearly kicked out, the Prime Minister talked about higher interest rates. He said they have to be a bit higher to squeeze down the activity in the economy. The man has no hope. According to the Prime Minister, high debt has suddenly become a virtue. He says that we need this high debt to restructure our economy. It is a question of how much we need. Given that the Business Council of Australia will have a summit on debt, the first thing we will have in the new year is the Prime Minister running the world's greatest debt statement. We can see it now. He will gather around him some bankers and he will make a statement on debt. It is probably being drafted in his office now. That is the approach this Government has to political issues. It has no substance, no policies; just rhetoric, public relations and presentation. No wonder the backbenchers are petrified. </PARA>

There is no problem about that. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, with your local knowledge will know that you will not survive either. I am sorry for you both, but it happens to be a fact of political life. This will happen because of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. They are both incompetent. To see the Treasurer come in here today and pretend that everything is right in the rose garden must make you, Mr Deputy Speaker, absolutely sick. You, like all the other backbenchers, know that not everything is absolutely right; you know that the ship of state is heading towards the rapids and there is no-one at the helm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government members believe that the Treasurer is out there writing his curriculum vitae because he will not hang around in opposition. Only a small group of those opposite will survive. The Treasurer will not be with them, neither will the Prime Minister, and the Minister for Defence probably will not either-the doorknocking will not save him. That is the reality. No matter what they do, because of the economic mismanagement of this man who spoke here last they are gone; they are finished. They cannot run this economy. They do not know how to do it, they do not know what to do next, and they have no answers to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> All we get from the Prime Minister is a lot of claptrap, 1970s rhetoric, and not one policy. Where is the policy response? Not so long ago we spent every day in an entire week in this Parliament inviting the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Government in general to lay down their economic policy and give us a policy response. What did we get? We got the Government gagging the debate. Not once did we get a response. Not once did a Government member put a piece of paper on the table. Not once did we get a sensible word from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or the Leader of the House. All we got was the ruthless use of its numbers to prevent a debate which the Australian people wanted to take place. The reason we did not get a response is that those opposite have nothing to say. They have nothing to say because they are paralysed: They are preoccupied with their re-election. That is why the Prime Minister writes to the Ministers and says, `Please tell me what you would like me to do. Send me a few ideas. Write to me. Tell me what I can promise at the next election that the people might believe. By the way, don't tell me to promise that no child will live in poverty by 1990. We tried that last time and it didn't work. Don't tell me to promise low interest rates because I've tried that. The Treasurer can't give me lower interest rates and no-one believes me. And of course, don't ask me to promise that I really care about Australian families because they know that isn't true'. But a believable promise-and the Government is going down this track-would be buying favours, buying support. If it is a question of making expedient promises that it thinks will get electoral support, then this Government will do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer came in here today and lectured us about his commitment, his guts, his preparedness to restructure this economy, and then he scurried out. Where was he when the Government had to take some really hard decisions? When it comes to the hard decisions, the Treasurer cannot cop it. We had an example with Coronation Hill-a well known gold mine with platinum and palladium. But what did the Treasurer say? Where was he? Was he in there fighting toe to toe, shoulder to shoulder with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy? No way. The Treasurer sold out, just like the Minister for Defence sold out, just like all of those opposite sold out, on the sort of decision that is necessary in the national interest. The man who came in here and lectured us, who pointed over here and said, `Why aren't you tough and hairy-chested just like me; why can't you take hard decisions', would not know a hard decision if it hit him in the head. When he had his chance he caved in to the Prime Minister. The craven pursuit of votes was more important to the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, the entire front bench and the entire back bench than a decision in the nation's interests. That is the standard of government we have right now-a government that has no answers because its absolute priority is expediency to try to get it off the political hook that it impaled itself on because of its own ineptitude. Those opposite would not know what to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Treasurer is now back in the country with no hope of delivering on micro-economic reform because it is too hard, he tries to repaint the political debate. All of a sudden micro-economic reform is small beer-about a seven, if one measures it against the Treasurer's performance. And he probably could not even handle that. He says that macro-economic policy is king. I say this to him: he will not succeed in this country unless he can deliver on micro-economic reform. The key to us being competitive and successful is a genuinely restructured economy beginning with the labour market. What is the Government's industrial relations policy post-Thursday? What is its attitude to damages against unions as a result of their strikes? What is its industrial relations policy on that? Or has Mr Kelty not told them? Have we not had the meeting with the Australian Council of Trade Unions yet to have the policy parameters laid down for the Government? He has probably taken an early holiday. Simon Crean has left the country, so the Government does not have any briefing notes and does not know where to go or what to do. The Government really does have a problem because there is only so much money that it can throw around buying support. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen nothing short of a basket- load of expedient decisions ranging from those involving Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd through to the airlines. Was that not a proud decision? It was a case of the Prime Minister again looking after the big end of town. Never mind the tourist industry. Support the airlines. The loss in foreign exchange earnings as a result of the downturn in the tourist industry is likely to be between $2 billion and $3 billion. While the Government is looking after Ansett's bottom line and ensuring that its profit and loss account is all right, while it is ensuring that the Australian Airlines accounts look all right and that East-West Airlines receives a subsidy, what is it doing about the tourist industry? What about the Queensland tourist industry and its bottom line? What are we going to do about future bankruptcies? What will we do about the children who will have their standard of living reduced? What will we do about the people who have invested their life savings? That is why this Government is on the nose in the electorate. While it is looking after the big blokes-the people who puff cigars with the Prime Minister, who come and stay with him, take him fishing and look after him-it is not looking after the little people of Australia, the people who vote. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one in this Government knows what the real priority should be. This Government has been reduced to the politics of `feel good', the phone call from the chief executive who says, `Prime Minister, what a great decision that was. We will support you, Prime Minister'. What about the workers? This is supposed to be a Labor Administration. What about the workers and their wives and their children?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I meant the Prime Minister. We know what the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) thinks of the Prime Minister in relation to Kodak in particular and we know what the Treasurer thinks of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe). It is no wonder that they know there is no hope: there is insufficient unity in this Government to decide even on a Lotto ticket. It is no wonder that the Treasurer is out there rewriting his curriculum vitae: the only option he has for the future is to get out fast and get another job.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have learned at least one useful thing from the speech by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt), who has just spoken. He has at last worked out that there is gold at Coronation Hill. In his previous speech on a censure motion in this place, after talking at vast length about his detailed study of the environmental report, which he alleged no one on this side of the House had read, he managed to make the earth-shattering revelation to the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) that there was no gold at Coronation Hill and suggested that the honourable member was a fool not to know that. I am pleased that he has at least used this opportunity in the debate to correct his absurd error. I could not believe that the leader of a major party in this country, who is persistently raising that as an issue in this place, would stand in that sort of ignorance. However, it is illustrative of the problems this Opposition has. When it gets down to detailed hard work on any policy matter, it knows nothing at all, and that fact is well understood by the electorate. The Opposition should not worry about that. The electorate knows exactly what the Opposition stands for and what its views are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members should take no comfort from the results of the South Australian election. I recollect the surge to us which occurred in 1983 when the Australian Labor Party was elected. At that time Liberal State governments were going down like ninepins, not on the basis of Grey Power, Democrats or any other preferences but, rather, on the basis of people moving from the Liberal column into the Labor column. Liberal governments lost office in Victoria, Western Australia and federally. The current situation is that those Labor governments are being re-elected and joined by others, including the Labor Party in Tasmania. The Labor Government has survived in South Australia for the third time in succession and, following the election in Queensland on Saturday, we will see a Labor government there also. This is the great run-on, the great surge of support for the Liberal Party!</PARA>
<PARA> We do not obscure the fact that certain features of the policies we are obliged to pursue do concern people, and we thoroughly acknowledge that point. Tough decisions must be made in government and they have to be explained to people if the government wishes to be re-elected. It is easy for the Opposition to criticise this Government and to state an effective position which can secure this Government's political defeat. Why is it that the Opposition wins every public opinion poll and every by-election, but when people are asked whether or not they wish to appoint the Opposition as a government-in other words, to stand aside from the politics of protest and actually enter the lists to vote for a government-they will not support the Opposition? Even if they intend to support the Opposition parties when a government is at stake voters prefer to go through two or three different routes before listing them. That occurs because the Opposition stands for nothing; it has no policy which people believe will remove the dilemma in which they find themselves. The voters will adopt that position when they go to the polls. </PARA>
<PARA> The election will be well into next year. The fact is that the Opposition has had a run as a result of a couple of insubstantial points included in its Economic Action Plan. However, I suggest that honourable members opposite begin to read the press commentary on that plan, because members of the press are beginning to ask questions. They ask us the question about interest rates and say, `What is your position on interest rates?'. We say, `Interest rates are at this level. We know that it is a difficult level to live with, but they will not go higher because we are in a situation where we are keeping fiscal policy tight and we are pursuing a wages policy that keeps interest rates at least at a level where they do not blow out to blazes'. This is not a stand pat position; rather, this position is a product of disciplined Budget policy over a number of years that has turned the Opposition's record deficit into a record surplus. As a result, this Government can at least have some handle, in a deregulated environment, on a blow-out in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the press understand and will ensure that the public also understands that, if the Government does not produce further real reductions in wages and does not cut fiscal policies much further, it can pursue only one policy on interest rates and that is massive increases in interest to flatten the economy as it did on a previous occasion. It is not as though there is no evidence of the Opposition's practices on that in the past; they are well known. That strategy was pursued by the Liberal Party in the past and it will be pursued again. It is Banquo's ghost at the feast of the economic action plan; it sits there subliminally between the lines, haunting the people who put it forward, haunting them so severely that they do not dare confront the press at any press conference. They do not dare confront anyone who will subject them to systematic questioning. It is all right to have a public meeting in which they march in, make the speech and march out again. Adolf Hitler knew all about that practice at Nuremberg. He knew that at a public meeting one should not subject oneself to a question unless it is an arranged question. The policy is to march in, big chant and march out. That is the way in which the Liberal Party conducts its public meetings and the way in which it puts itself forward for a public test. Honourable members opposite know that if they presented for questioning they could not stand up. </PARA>
<PARA> They also know that if their Leader were presented for questioning, devastation would result. He cannot obfuscate. The honourable member for Wentworth knows enough in the area of economic policy to obfuscate somewhat by getting off the subject when he is subject to a hard question. The Leader of the Opposition has no chance at all. What comfort would any person have in the alternative government when he looks at the debate which has taken place today? The Leader of the Opposition made a speech that he has made on two previous occasions, last week and earlier than that. Not a word was different. He even had the decency to acknowledge that, as on two or three separate occasions during his speech he said, `As I said last time'. I suppose next time he will say, `As I said last time, the time before that, and the time before that'. He will say that he has run out of the capacity to use 20 minutes in any other way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition is in that situation because he does not understand what he is handling. What comfort does it give people about to cast a vote to know that if they voted for the Opposition they would put into power a Prime Minister who does not understand what his subordinates are doing and who would preside over a policy which can work only if housing interest rates go well into the low 20s and if rates on business go about four or five percentage points higher than that? The policy of the Opposition cannot work without that happening. As a result, the economy will be flattened. Where will the compassion of the Opposition be then? What will it do as it sees the people go from their houses on to the streets; as it sees people join the dole queues, as they did once before; as it sees the kids deprived of life chances, as they were by that extended period of youth unemployment that the Liberal and National parties invoked when they came into office? What will the Opposition do for them? What will it say to them?</PARA>
<PARA> We have some idea of where the Opposition stands on compassion from some of the policies that are outlined in the Economic Action Plan. It says: `Yaboo sux! The people don't really like the unemployed, so we will take from the unemployed and give to John Elliott and the rest of his mates in the Fosters Liberal Party a massive capital gains benefit'. That is what we understand now by Liberal Party compassion. The Liberal Party will take from the unemployed to give to John Elliott; that is its compassion. That is what it invites us to applaud in this place; it invites the galleries and the public to applaud it. The evidence of its compassion is to ladle money into John Elliott's trough and into the troughs of those of his ilk, ripping it from the poor while it does so. That is an indication of how members of the Opposition would deal with the situation when they confront the problems which will occur as a result of their pursuing massive interest rate policies. </PARA>
<PARA> There are months to go before the next election. Members opposite should not think for one minute that they will get away with meandering into the polls, having said nothing about where they intend to take interest rates. They should not think for one minute that they will get away with that. These days campaigns are different. They are not pursued in the way they were in the past. We keep winning elections because we address people where they are. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) has been amused by the fact that I doorknock my constituency. As I cheerfully own up to that, I inform him that I have doorknocked my constituency in every campaign for every election that I have won. I inform the honourable member for Tangney-textbook Tangney as he was described recently because he takes his policy from a textbook; if he took it from any decent textbook he would know this-that doorknocking is the sort of thing a member of parliament does. A member of parliament confronts his constituents on the doorstep, he explains the policy of his party and points to the policy of other parties; he is prepared to put himself at risk in relation to the policies. I have doorknocked my constituency before every election and I will continue to do so. I also doorknock between elections. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in my electorate tell me that they find interest rates hard to bear. Many of them tell me that they have found circumstances difficult to handle. However, they also say that the Opposition is led by a will-o'-the-wisp and that they cannot support it. They say that there is nothing that can be done about an Opposition that will not tell people what it will do, that has no plan for the future except persiflage in this place and further obfuscation out on the hustings. The Opposition has a total unwillingness to present itself to a decent test. In marginal seats, the electors know that their votes will make a substantial difference. Every time that is the case, the wing collapses, as it did in South Australia. We lost a couple of good members in South Australia at the recent State election and the swings against them were 2 or 3 per cent. If the Liberal Party gains a couple of per cent from us in our Federal marginal seats, it will not be elected. It may win a few seats, but it will not become the government. The reason for that is that the electors make a serious study of what the parties offer. I will tell the House one other thing they say to me. They have a few views about the honourable member for Tangney. They feel that he has a bit of growing up to do. Ironically, they also had a few views about the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). They thought he was a decent man; they were probably right in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only way people will ever get to talk to the honourable member for Tangney is if they ring him up because they will not see him on their doorsteps. They will not see the honourable member for Tangney at any public meeting in his constituency. If they are lucky, they might get through to him on the telephone. What Gough Whitlam once said about Billy McMahon also applies to the honourable member for Tangney. He described him as Tiberius on a telephone. In this case, the honourable member for Tangney is the poor man's Tiberius on the telephone and he illustrates what is wrong with the Liberal Party-yuppie insensitivity to what is happening to the ordinary people in this country. The Opposition cannot conceal it by the sorts of policies it produces here. It will not be able to conceal it, given the fact that its leader is completely incapable of explaining economic policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion is contemptible. Members opposite have dragged into the motion on a general debate on the economy a view they have on the subject of the recent airline dispute. I again remind the House what is at stake in that dispute. Had the Government not stood firm, had the airlines not stood firm, there would have been the potential for a blow-out in wages similar to that which occurred when the Liberal Party was in office in 1981-82. That is what was at stake. The Government did not decide that it would be a nice thing if members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots stopped flying aircraft; it did not think that it would be a good idea. That has never been the Government's position. The Government decided that the issue had to be taken on because the consequences of failing to do so would include major economic damage, if not ruin, to this nation. We took it on for no other reason. No serious economic commentator disagreed with us in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition urges us to talk to the pilots when we are so far down the road and something like 40 per cent of the required work force has already been recruited. On what basis? The basis for negotiation put forward to us is: `We will hold off until after Christmas and then go back to things as normal. Next time-because nobody will believe you again when you say that you will deal decently with them in the airlines-we will win and we will beat you.' The Liberal Party has no understanding of the minutiae of these activities. That is why it has no idea about how to implement policy. It is not sufficient to have a piece of paper which says, `We will reform the waterfront'. It needs to know how to do it and it should say how it will do it in its policy statements. If it will not, it simply cannot be trusted because it was in a position to deliver before and it did not deliver. Members opposite are contemptible. They have displayed themselves as contemptible and ignorant in this debate. The debate has gone far enough. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the debate the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) suggested, in a flourish of thespian splendour, that there was some impropriety about the way in which I provided medical advice to people within this place and indeed suggested that there was something improper about the fact that some should offer to pay for the service. I point out these things: to practise full time in the Australian Capital Territory, one needs to have registration and one needs medical practice insurance, the cost of which is almost $1,000. I provide a service in this place, as do other members who are practitioners. I provide a service to the public. Honourable members may have noticed that, during Question Time today, we were called to assist someone in the gallery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I provide a service to the staff in this place and I provide a service to members from both sides of the House and their staff. Indeed, I twist nobody's arm and it is often at some inconvenience that one provides this service. The point should be made very clearly that those who are bulk billed by me are bulk billed because they offer to pay for the service. No member of the staff or the public has ever had to pay for the service and only those who offer are bulk billed because, as taxpayers, they have an entitlement to that, and I have an entitlement to charge them because of my registration. The net effect for providing this service is a loss and I would be happy to provide copies of my tax returns to honourable members opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the twenty-first and twenty-second reports of the Committee for 1989, relating to, respectively, housing development for the Defence Housing Authority at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills, Sydney and the development of Commonwealth Government Centre, stage 2, Townsville.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Defence Housing Authority proposal involves housing developments at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills, Sydney, at an estimated cost of $131.84m at July 1989 prices. At present a need exists to acquire suitable housing for defence personnel in the Sydney metropolitan area. Over the next three to five years it is proposed to develop sites at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills for integrated defence-civilian housing. It is proposed to build approximately 100 medium density townhouses at Randwick. At Holsworthy 1,500 residential allotments will provide a mix of conventional, cottage and medium density housing, while the East Hills site will consist of 400 residential allotments providing a mix of housing. The developments will be undertaken through a joint venture arrangement between one or more developers and the Defence Housing Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The East Hills site includes an area of freshwater wetlands-believed to be the best surviving example in the Sydney area. The Defence Housing Authority has acknowledged the environmental significance of these wetlands and has assured the Committee that there is no intention to seek rezoning of this area for residential purposes. The Committee agreed with the Defence Housing Authority and various environmental groups at East Hills that development should be excluded from the forested slopes down to the Georges River and that a corridor linking the environmentally sensitive vegetation areas should be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The report relating to the stage 2 development of the Commonwealth Government Centre, Townsville, is for the construction and fitout of a 12-storey office building of 12,600 square metres on Commonwealth- owned land adjacent to the existing Commonwealth Centre. The building will be specifically designed to meet the Australian Taxation Office's accommodation requirements to service the northern Queensland region, particularly as a result of its computer redevelopment and re-equipment program. The Department of Administrative Services informed the Committee that the existing scattered mix of owned and leased accommodation occupied by the Australian Taxation Office in Townsville is not conducive to administrative efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that the consolidation of the Australian Taxation Office in one building will improve administrative efficiency and security of operations, allow for the rationalisation of other Commonwealth tenancies and effect significant reductions in the rent bill by relinquishment of approximately 6,500 square metres of leased accommodation in Townsville. The Committee accepted the advice of the Department of Administrative Services that the construction of a Commonwealth-owned building is the most cost effective method of satisfying the office accommodation requirements of the Commonwealth in Townsville. The Committee was informed that savings to the Commonwealth for equivalent leased space over a 15-year period is estimated at $21.2m at current prices. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to comment briefly on the report of the Public Works Committee on housing developments by the Defence Housing Authority at Randwick, Holsworthy and East Hills, Sydney. I begin by commending the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) for presenting a prompt report on matters of such important interest. As the Federal member for the electorate which includes the Holsworthy site, I turn my attention first to this site. This area of land has remained shamefully undeveloped for a very long period, and I am delighted that the Government has seen fit to take the initiative and do something about the development of this site and, in particular, to ensure that there is a mix of both private and public sector housing. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the convener of the Government members defence force action committee one of my priorities has been to push for a massive expenditure of Commonwealth moneys to improve the housing of Defence Force personnel, and this Holsworthy project is pre-eminent among the initiatives that the Government has taken in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was privileged to be at Holsworthy on Friday with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) when the agreement was signed with the private corporation, Delfin Property Group Ltd, to initiate this Holsworthy development. In part, it involved an area of land which was the subject of a proposed development during the time of the Whitlam Government. Unfortunately, that development did not proceed, and I am delighted that, as a result of considerable pressure from myself as the local member, the Government has responded and taken the initiative to develop that site. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to East Hills, I make a number of brief points. The first point to highlight is that that area at the moment provides, I think, a very poor example of development. Servicemen are located in what is the former East Hills migrant hostel and adjacent to that is the naval estate at East Hills or, as it is now called, Voyager Point. But the problem is that, because of the small and remote nature of those two communities, adequate shopping and community support facilities do not exist. It is for that reason that for some considerable period of time I have been pushing for the release of Commonwealth land to ensure that a viable residential community was established in the East Hills-Voyager Point area. I believe that, as a result of that pressure and the initiatives of the Government, there has been a very substantial release of Commonwealth land and, once again, I am extremely pleased that the Defence Housing Authority has been a catalyst for the proposals that have been put forward for that site. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter that I touch on concerns the environmental protection of the Georges River at Voyager Point. Tragically, I believe that the Georges River is one of the untapped physical resources of western Sydney. The river has not had the recreational and public use that it is potentially able to receive; nor have past governments, at local, State or Federal level, been as responsive as they ought to have been to ensure the environmental protection of the Georges River. I am very pleased to note that the Public Works Committee has focused on that question of environmental protection. Whilst not yet able to endorse in detail the Committee's report, I hope and trust that the Chairman and members of the Committee have responded to resident and environmental pressure, which I strongly support, to ensure adequate protection for the environment of that very important waterway of western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> With those words, I endorse the Chairman's report. I thank him for his personal on-site inspection of those proposed developments, and I extend to the Defence Housing Authority my very best wishes in its ongoing task of improving the lot of Defence personnel and their families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the Committee's report, entitled Rail: Five systems-one solution, on the efficiency of Australian National's east-west oper- ations, together with the minutes of pro- ceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2J4">Mr SAUNDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure deals primarily with ways of improving the efficiency of the east-west freight and passenger operations of the Australian National Railways Commission. Our terms of reference also charged the Committee with considering two other major issues: the transfer of terminal facilities from Broken Hill to Parkes, and greater integration of intersystem operations. In the course of the inquiry a number of other issues arose which demanded our attention. These included: proposals for a national freight consortium; road-rail cost recovery; the subsidy paid to the transport industry; and ways to reduce the amount of freight being carried on the national road system. We gave a great deal of attention to these issues because of their close relationship with the inquiry's terms of reference and because of their importance to the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the context of improving the east-west efficiency of Australian National (AN), our terms of reference made particular mention of the transfer of terminal facilities from Broken Hill to Parkes. It is important that this matter be fully explained. There is no AN terminal at Broken Hill which could be moved to Parkes, or anywhere else. AN has no staff or facilities of its own there. AN pays the State Rail Authority of New South Wales for any services carried out by SRA at Broken Hill. As the result of the Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. review of the operations of SRA, significant reductions are being made to staff numbers at Broken Hill and other places on the main east-west rail corridor. AN has proposed a number of ways its efficiency in this corridor could be improved and up to 50 positions at Broken Hill have been identified as affected by these changes. These operational and other changes are dealt with in chapter 3 of our report. Discussions between AN and SRA are proceeding to identify any savings which can be achieved, and the benefits will be shared between the systems, according to their agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted, both in the submissions from and in the evidence taken at Broken Hill on 7 June 1989, the attitudes of that city. The Mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the Barrier Industrial Council and private citizens all expressed concerns about the impact of cuts to employment in that city. The New South Wales Government and the SRA have given guarantees about retraining and relocation of staff. We can only hope that these guarantees are honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusions and recommendations in this report deal, firstly, with the various operational problems which exist in the main east-west corridor. In particular, we believe that the proposals AN has made to improve efficiency at and east of Broken Hill should proceed and that New South Wales should receive assistance from diesel fuel excise payments to fund the necessary work in its territory. Studies on the feasibility of standardising the Melbourne-Adelaide route should continue because of the national benefits that this would confer and there should be studies of the feasibility of bypasses of the main line at both Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important conclusions and recommendations relate to inter-system freight and passenger operations, the subsidy paid to road transport and funding for upgrading railway infrastructure. It is a matter of concern to the Committee that enormous sums have been spent on the national road system at a time when so few excise payments have been returned to rail systems to improve and upgrade the necessary infrastructure. I believe that some of my colleagues will deal with these issues in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> It is customary to thank those who have been involved in the preparation of a report. I would like to acknowledge the work done for members and staff by the Transport Office of the House of Representatives. The printing staff gave a great deal of help, pleasantly and willingly, at various stages. At different stages Valma Buck, Tracy Cumberland, Laura Gillies, Marlene Lyons and Natalie Raine performed nobly on the keyboard, with Di Morrison of Joint House, who did a wonderful job transforming the draft for printing. Our special gratitude is due to our adviser, David Baussmann, and to the staff of the secretariat, June Murphy and Patrick Regan. They did all the planning for our trips, researched, drafted and typed the report and were pleasant and helpful companions to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been an interesting and revealing inquiry. We all hope that this report will make a worthwhile contribution to an important national issue, the future of rail in Australia. Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues on the Committee, particularly the members of the subcommittee, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil). They cooperated fully, both at hearings and in the preparation of the report, and assisted me greatly in the finalisation of the report. I believe we arrived at a report which is worth commending not only to the House but to the Government for adoption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I commence my remarks by saying `well done' to the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for the report Rail: Five systems-one solution that was tabled a few moments ago in the House. I congratulate the honourable member for Aston (Mr Saunderson), the Chairman of that Committee. I know some members of the Committee have taken a long, enduring and genuine interest in the future of railway in this country. Whilst I have just mentioned the honourable member for Aston, I look across the chamber and see the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), who has a great deal of the operations of Australian National (AN) in his own electorate and who has taken a deep interest in those operations since coming to this place-and, indeed, before that time. On this side of the House, of course, as the honourable member for Aston mentioned, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) has had a lifelong interest in railway and has been keenly involved in this inquiry. There are also other people on this side of the House who are very much interested in railway, such as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who has had quite a number of discussions with me about this type of report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The future of railway has, I believe, been grossly underrated in Australia for many years. I have a personal belief that railway in this country has tremendous potential which can be achieved if both State and Federal governments are prepared to face up to reality and make the hard, necessary decisions to implement the types of changes and reforms that are needed. At present the railway systems throughout Australia are in general subsidised. I doubt whether one could honestly say that any railway system in Australian is not being subsidised in one form or another. As the Industries Assistance Commission pointed out in its annual report tabled only a couple of weeks ago, if we can reform some of the areas of our transport infrastructure-areas such as railway, waterfront, coastal shipping and so forth-and look at other factors within out transport infrastructure, we can give a $9 billion a year boost to the gross domestic product of Australia each and every year. The types of changes being spoken of in this report lead to those sorts of potential gains down the track if we can get governments to take up the opportunities that are present today. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the world there is a recognition of the importance of railway. As airways become more congested and airports become more congested and difficult to build, in places such as Europe people are starting to look to the potential of railway. Indeed, that potential is now being realised and railways are finding a new life. People are finding that railways can operate profitably and that private enterprise can be allowed to operate within existing railway services. Those private railways can operate profitably and provide a very good service. This is not just being done in Europe, in countries such as France, with its TGV system. There is also the very fast train in Japan. There is even talk of our own very fast train, running initially between Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> So the future of railway is being recognised as a future with great potential. That is what this report is about. It has a number of features which I am very pleased to see. Of course, I am disappointed not to see some features written into the report. I want briefly to touch on the features I am very pleased to see. One is the fact that the report believes that Australian National, the Commonwealth's railway operation, has a very important role in the future. Australian National, as the report suggests, needs to have a central controlling role in interstate passenger and freight services in the future. If it can be given that role, I believe Australian National will perform the task more than admirably because Australian National is now regarded as being probably the most efficient railway operation in Australia. I was also pleased to see talk of the amalgamation of depots at Kalgoorlie, the transfer of terminal facilities to Parkes and the works that have been recommended to take place from Broken Hill eastwards. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some disappointments in the report. I am particularly disappointed that there is no discussion of the possible role of private enterprise in Australia's railway future, particularly within the operations of Australian National. As I mentioned a few months ago, the experiences of Europe indicate that there is a very genuine, real role for private enterprise in our rail system. If we include private enterprise in our rail system it will help us pay for the necessary improvements that are needed to our rail systems and help us to become more competitive and more efficient in our railway operations. It will also help our railway operations to become more reliable. I believe it is terribly important that we bring private enterprise into the operation of railway services throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little disappointed that some anti-road freight sentiment seems to be expressed in the report. I note on page 27 of the report what could perhaps be described more kindly by saying that a very enthusiastic pro-railway sentiment was put by the writers of the report. Of course, from the other side of the counter one could say that somewhat of an anti-road freight sentiment was being expressed. I think that what is being argued in the report is that we need to take some of the money that is contributed towards roads and spend those moneys that should be going towards roads on upgrading our rail system in Australia. I propose another argument-that is, that we ought to be giving greater priority to the transport infrastructure of Australia. We should not be arguing that we should be shuffling existing funds from road construction to railway improvements; we should take another argument altogether and say that we need to give greater national priority to improving the transport infrastructure of Australia, part of which includes improving our railway and part of which includes improving our road services. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that if we take this line we will achieve more results, because many people today would say that road freight people contribute a tremendous amount towards the cost of provision and upgrading of road services in Australia and that railway is a very grossly oversubsidised operation. Either way, let us argue for more priority for national transport infrastructure rather than shuffling the cards between ourselves to try to take money from roads and give it to rail. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also some other very interesting elements that I would like to see brought into the debate about railway, and that is the use of B-doubles. Of course, B-doubles, which provide a 20 per cent increase in efficiency, can supplement railway operations in Australia. I see that there has been some discussion about the Melbourne to Adelaide standard gauge rail track. I believe that that was part of the Australian Labor Party's commitment when it first went into government in 1983-a commitment yet to be fulfilled, as is a commitment to a rail service between Alice Springs and Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA> Either way, the coalition is pleased to see this type of discussion come into this Parliament. It is pleased to see that these types of recommendations are being made. The best thing we can say is that we are pleased with certain elements of the report. The basis of the report is good, but it falls short in a number of areas which we believe are important. We give the commitment to member of the Committee and members of the Parliament that the coalition will pursue this line of work when we get into government. We will take up the hard issues and we will put into action some of the thoughts and expressions made by members of this Committee. We believe that by so doing we will help to transform and reform Australia's transport infrastructure to make us more efficient as a nation producing products to sell overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to say `well done' to the staff of the Committee. The report is well put together, well written, well researched and, from all reports, has been put together by a very cooperative and very professional group of people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I rise to support the report Rail: Five systems-one Solution in the belief that it is progressive and will make a very worthwhile contribution to the debate about the future of rail in this country. Although it is primarily about the Australian National Railways Commission and ways of improving the efficiency of its east-west operations, we have also dealt with some other significant issues and made some important recommendations in these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of this Committee travelled by rail as much as practicable during this inquiry. In June, six members plus secretariat staff, Hansard reporters and an official travelled from Adelaide to Broken Hill on the Indian Pacific and then on to Parkes. In July, with two of my colleagues, I travelled on the Indian Pacific from Perth to Adelaide. In Adelaide, Broken Hill, Parkes, Perth and Kalgoorlie we inspected the facilities of Australian National, the State Rail Authority (SRA) and Westrail. These trips, together with the submissions received and the evidence taken, have enabled honourable members to see something of the operations of AN as well as two of the systems with which it interacts all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> In evidence to the Committee, one of AN's executives outlined what could be taken as the Commission's general approach, which is to get something effective operating and then progressively upgrade it over the years. This, it seems to me, is what AN has done, and done very successfully since 1978. As detailed in chapter 3 of the report, AN wants to spend $18m, principally at Broken Hill, Parkes and between these two centres. AN has calculated that completing this work could reduce the transit times for longer freight trains from Parkes to Perth by as much as four hours. It is already doing other things in its own territory west of Broken Hill, such as laying concrete sleepers and installing a communications system for its trains across the Nullarbor Plain using fibre optic cable. Members of the Committee took evidence at Broken Hill in June and our attention was drawn to the problems which will be caused there by job losses. As a result of changes that AN and the State Rail Authority of new South Wales are making, jobs will undoubtedly be lost in that city and in other places in the east-west corridor. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Federal member for other railway centres, job losses such as this give me great concern. I accept that in the quest for increased efficiency in railway systems, there must be changes to work practices and some consequential loss of jobs. Employment practices in the railways have not always kept pace with technology. To survive railways simply must become more efficient. It is my earnest hope that the undertakings about retraining and relocation, which have been given by the New South Wales Government and the SRA, will be fully honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> Some evidence was given to us about a couple of matters which I would like to touch on: bypasses from the main line at Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, and standard- isation of the Melbourne-Adelaide route. While there may well be considerable benefits to the local communities if freight trains in particular bypassed Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, AN has not to date been very interested in either proposal. Our report recommends that the feasibility, costs and benefits of these proposals should be further investigated. Standardisation of the Melbourne-Adelaide route would link all the mainland capitals by standard gauge line. While this would be costly, in our view it is too important to continue to be neglected. some of the other recommendations in this report may seem to be radical. For example, at a time then the emphasis is on efficiency and micro-economic reform, we have recommended retention of the  Indian Pacific, Trans Australian and Overland passenger services, which have to be subsidised to the tune of about $60m per year. This is for two reasons; first, these trains do provide a service to various communities; and, second, if the Indian Pacific particularly were to be abolished, it would not be possible to undertake the marketing campaign `Journey of a Lifetime' we have recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area where our recommendation could be seen to be radical is in the area of funding for railway infrastructure projects. The Committee believes that as both rail and road pay excise duty on the fuel they use, it is reasonable that both get a fair return from the Federal Government of the amount each has contributed. This simply does not happen. While something like $1.25 billion has been spent on the national road system, little or nothing has been spent on comparable rail projects. The Committee recommends a return to the rail systems of amounts equal to the percentage level of funds available to road from the fuel excise contributed by road. This is hardly unfair or radical, but is very necessary. It is necessary because rail has been denied funds and, more importantly, because of the urgent need to do something about the amount of long-distance freight carried by heavy vehicles which rail should move. That heavy vehicles damage roads and cause noise and other pollution cannot be denied. It is also impossible to ignore the awful accidents on the Pacific and Hume highways-to mention but two-with their tragic consequences for so many innocent people. </PARA>
<PARA> In evidence AN estimated that if it could improve its efficiency, it could gain about 50 per cent of the existing road market for the east-west corridor. This would increase its tonnage over a two-year or three-year period by about 85,000 tonnes and take about 3,000 trucks off the highway, which is extremely significant. If this could be done on a national scale, how much safer our highways would be, how much longer they would last and how much money would be available for other desirable projects for the nation. In the context of improving AN's east-west efficiency, this is what we believe should be a national goal: putting rail into its rightful place as the means of transporting long-distance freight. This idea is very well captured by the excellent drawing on the cover of our report. It shows a semi-trailer giving way to a freight train. This is how it must be, to save the country money, to reduce pollution and to improve safety on highways. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for their support of the sub-committee of the honourable member for Aston (Mr Saunderson), the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and me. It will be quite disappointing if the honourable member for Farrer does not get the opportunity to make a contribution in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I refer to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled Rail: Five systems-one solution, which is a report on the efficiency of Australian National's east-west operations. This is an exciting report to be considered in the closing stages of the Thirty-fifth Parliament. It offers a solid blueprint for arriving at the right policy mix in respect of rail at both the national and the related State level. If the parliamentary timetable had permitted, perhaps it could have been a more comprehensive report, because it is an enormous subject. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have a deep interest in this subject in respect of your New South Wales north coast electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, too, thank my colleagues who served on this Committee. It was a privilege to serve on the Committee and to take steps to initiate and help bring about the terms of reference which brought about this inquiry. I also thank the staff who at times put up with most detailed questioning of various witnesses in relation to rail and the operation of rail in Australia. I have studied this topic for nearly two decades and have built up a fair compendium of information. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the shadow Minister for land transport and shipping, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), has canvassed macro policy issues and it is not possible for me to do that at this time, but I take an interest in rail for other reasons, including the fact that so many veterans and elderly citizens utilise public transport, and trains in particular, to travel within our capital cities or, under their entitlement, to travel once a year between capital cities. I am very conscious of the fact that so many elderly citizens rely heavily on rail as a form of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> It is food for thought that the debate on transport in Australia has escalated in recent months due partly to that horrific bus coach accident north of Grafton and partly to the fact that people are starting to think again about the correct balance between rail and road and the correct policy mix to achieve that balance. If one goes back through history, it is also food for thought that, if the planners of the previous century had got the tramtrack gauge wrong in Melbourne and Bendigo and got the rail gauge right in Victoria, many of the problems faced by this Committee in its inquiry would not have arisen. As I pointed out yesterday morning on Ian McNamara's program Australia All Over, the Melbourne and Bendigo trams run on the New South Wales standard gauge, or the world standard gauge, of 4 feet 8 1/2 inches, whereas the engineers made the rail gauge for Victoria, and subsequently South Australia, the so-called larger and broader gauge, which is 5 feet 3 inches, or whatever is the metric equivalent. That tremendous error has caused great difficulty ever since for the Australian economy and for our transport infrastructure. This report seeks to continue the process of overcoming some of those difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that a standard gauge runs all the way from Sydney to Perth does not fully overcome the problems confronted by a person sending an average container from Sydney to Perth. Page 9 of the report points out as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> As it crosses Australia, it will or could be subjected to the following:</PARA>
<PARA>3 totally different non-integrated rail systems (AN, SRA and Westrail);</PARA>
<PARA>4 changes of locomotives;</PARA>
<PARA>5 different safe working systems;</PARA>
<PARA>6 different sizes of loading gauge;</PARA>
<PARA>10 or more different engineering standards of the basic standard gauge rail track . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It also involves many hours waiting at sidings and junctions for crew changes, refuelling, inspections and passing of other trains along the single gauge track involved. Indeed, as far as the system stands at the moment, even if no train is coming the other way, a super freighter rolling out of Parkes to Broken Hill is required to stop 11 times between Parkes and Broken Hill, in order to carry out the antiquated safe working system at each of the sidings between Parkes and Broken Hill. That process incurs great cost in terms of bringing a 3,000-tonne train to a halt. It affects the ticket and staff systems. It involves obtaining clearance for the next section of track and then accelerating. It is an incredible process. Ian Hill and others associated with the State Rail Authority of New South Wales are working on this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> This report provides a very clear blueprint as to how to overcome that problem and other problems associated with the east-west corridor. Time does not permit my dwelling on all the detailed aspects but I highlight the fact that an $18m package is identified in this report. It provides for the introduction of long trains west of Parkes, with marshalling facilities at Parkes at a cost of $3m; crossing loops between Parkes and Broken Hill at a cost of $1.2m; reduced transit times between Sydney and Perth through high speed bogies at a cost of $1m; and an improved system of train order working between Parkes and Broken Hill at a cost of $5m. That would save two hours in transit time for every train. The package also provides for through-working of locomotives and mainline refuelling at Broken Hill at a cost of $750,000. That aspect has been highlighted by the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks). The package would also develop loading facilities at Parkes at a cost of $2m at Goobang Junction and increased terminal capacity at Chullora at a cost of $5m. The total cost of the package is $18m. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention those points in detail because they involve places that are close to my own electorate. The package stops short of the more comprehensive proposal which I want to see evolve at Parkes, which by its very location at a major junction of lines going north, east, south and west, lends itself to becoming a major intermodal component as further progress is made with redeveloping and revamping rail transport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Parkes has a key role to play. I know that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) shares my views on this matter. I believe that Parkes should be a major forwarding depot. The double-stack container super freighters should power out of Parkes to Perth and run as super-freighter unit trainloads without interference between Parkes and Perth. Efficiencies would flow as a result. Parkes is not in my electorate, but I fully recognise the synchronised energy available from that development at Parkes. This report touches on that matter and affirms my views. It perhaps stops short of laying down the massive development which we would like to see occur, but it provides the initial basis for the development which, as it builds momentum, and because so much activity and potential are available at Parkes, will follow quite naturally. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's rail system is chaotic. There are five different systems on mainland Australia and quite often they are in absolute competition with each other rather than being a coordinated and integrated approach. I can point to example after example where problems occur at each of the borders, including shunting problems at Albury-Wodonga. There are problems with the arrangements associated with shunting and the through-running of locomotives, but some progress has been made in that regard. Problems are also experienced at Broken Hill, Kalgoorlie and elsewhere and they are identified throughout this report.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia must grasp the nettle now and provide a basis for revamping rail before it is too late. Europe is undergoing a massive swing back to rail involving containerised freight and high-speed trains. The French TGV system has operated successfully and at a profit for about five years with an impeccable safety record. In Australia we also have the opportunity to make that progress. The report provides a blueprint for revamping conventional rail. I understand that this week there will be a further progress report released by the very fast train syndicate. It is to be hoped that it will provide more information and that there will be the prospect of seeing that project proceed between Sydney and Melbourne, subject to its stacking up economically and environmentally. A Senate committee is undertaking a detailed investigation in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that a steel wheel on a steel rail has about one-seventh or one-tenth of the friction of a rubber-tyred wheel on a bitumen surface. In that statistic, we see the reason that rail is so efficient and economic if operated properly and in conjunction with road networks. Australia must act to get in place the right transport policy mix before it is too late. That correct policy mix must contain a considerable boost to the priority for efficient, effective, conventional rail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report entitled Rail: Five systems-one solution on the efficiency of Australian National's east-west operations is intended to set in motion Government action to increase awareness of the necessity to upgrade freight rail systems in Australia and, in particular, rail systems from east to west. The report is perhaps the most important in relation to any type of transport to come before the Parliament this session. Although everyone will not be pleased with everything in the report, it is not so much anti-roads as pro-rail. It is important that there be changes to the transport industry in Australia and although the report is pro-rail, is certainly cannot be said that at any stage it is anti-road transport. The report is an attempt to improve the speed and efficiency of transport between east and west and vice versa. A great deal of money has been spent on the national road system. I travel continually by road from Sydney to Canberra and have seen the standard of the road change dramatically in the 6 1/2 years that I have done so. A great deal of money should now be spent on improving the rail systems of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure travelled extensively as part of this inquiry. The Mayor of Kalgoorlie entertained us there and was a witness at a hearing; he provided every consideration and courtesy to us, as parliamentarians. Members of parliament are accorded such courtesies, particularly when on such important investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank members of the Committee's staff, Pat, Malcolm and June, and the many others who assisted. I also thank members of the Hansard staff whom one expects to be on hand and provide a report. They did so very efficiently. Each member of the Committee can thank the Secretariat. I would also like to mention my friend the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). The other speakers did not bother to mention him or me, so I take the opportunity of doing so. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) also attended meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> I also thank the officers of Westrail and officers and train crews of Australian National. We were fortunate enough to be allowed into the engine compartment of a train for some 600 or 700 kilometres across the desert, an area that could be called one of the most uninteresting in Australia, but it was an experience and a thrill that I will remember as long as I live. Last, but not least, I thank officers of the State Rail Authority of New South Wales who, whenever asked, provided all the information they could. There is some reservation as to how far they will go in meeting any commitment to hand over the Parkes establishment and upgrade the section between Sydney and Parkes. Some thought should be given to changing the rail system so that it goes through the flat country to Parkes rather than over the Blue Mountains which is very costly and reduces the amount of tonnage able to be carried on any one of the trains. I thank anyone who contributed to the report, the members of the Committee and the staff. </PARA>

I join with the others in thanking the staff and the other members of the Committee who participated so enthusiastically in the inquiry. As others have said, there was a spirit of real cooperation and enthusiasm which imbued the Committee as it travelled around Australia and did its work on this issue. Throughout the investigation there seemed to be two features that were pulling in different directions. One was the romance of railways, the enthusiasm that many people to whom we spoke and some members of the Committee had for railways. I suppose that I am one of those members of the Committee who like the concept of railways and find them romantic. Pulling in the other direction are hard economic realities: the hard economic analysis that needs to be done to understand what future railways have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the conclusions the Committee came to, one I strongly support, is that railways have a real future in Australia, particularly in the area of freight. Their future is much more doubtful with respect to passenger services. Rail is unfortunate in that it got off to such an appalling start in Australia because, as the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) mentioned earlier, we have five different rail systems and three different gauges. It is one of the great disasters of Australian economic history and is often written up as such. If over time we can overcome some of the local, parochial interest of State governments and ensure that the issue is addressed, as in this report, as a national interest on a national scale with a national dimension and a national vision, we can make rail freight economically viable. That is certainly the case in Canada and the United States, where private companies are able to make a real go of rail freight. In Canada, one government company and one private company are involved. That could be replicated in Australia. We can make it a goal. </PARA>
<PARA> It came out very much in some of the economic work we did in this report that we do not have an adequate economic analysis of where subsidies and efficiencies lie. The report talks enthusiastically about the subsidies that apply to road transport and it is true that there are significant subsidies. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has done a lot of work on that. However, when one tries to find out where the subsidies in relation to rail lie, one finds that it is almost impossible to obtain a reliable figure. I think I am right in saying that the Inter-State Commission has done some work on that, but a lot more work needs to be done on the distribution of subsidies so that we can ultimately understand the true economics of this issue of rail transport. There are long-term economic advantages in restructuring the railways in Australia and ensuring that they can become viable, but there is still a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make three brief points. What the report recommends is very important. I hope that the Federal Government and the relevant State governments will take up the recommendations of the Committee. The first issue is that of coordination. It is absurd that five different rail systems are responsible for interstate freight in this country. What is equally absurd is the way in which some State governments came before our Committee and said that the way to solve the problem of five different systems was to establish a sixth system. There are two things wrong with that. The first is obviously that when the problem is five systems, it is absurd to propose a sixth. The second is a problem of logic. We already have Australian National. If we were to establish a new national freight system, Australian National would lose its point to exist. Its whole raison d'etre would disappear. So there is a contradiction in the argument of some of the States that we should establish that sixth system. I hope that that argument, which has been put forward by some of the States, will be strongly rejected by the Federal Government and that those States will reconsider their positions in the years ahead and realise that, whatever may be in the interests of pork-barrelling politics in those individual States, that is not in the long term interests of Australia as a nation. State governments have to think more about Australia as a nation, not just about their regional and parochial interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I would like to allude to briefly is that of investment. This report talks about the need for an increase in investment in railways, but it does not actually say where the money is to come from. I think that, in a way, that is a pity, because I have a view about where the money could come from which I know other people on the Committee were reluctant to endorse. I think that railways is one area where we can very comfortably move towards privatisation, albeit partial privatisation in the initial stages. It may be impossible early on to sell the permanent way, but the whole concept of privatising the rolling stock and, perhaps, the locomotives-if you like, privatising the trains but not the track-is something that we have to look at very carefully in the years ahead. That is one way we will get additional capital invested in railways. In a sense, there is already market pressure for that to happen. We saw many examples of that around Australia. We spoke to major private transport companies who expressed an interest in remaining involved in railways, getting further involved in railways and investing further in railways, but the whole process is inhibited by the fact that railways in Australia are effectively nationalised. By being nationalised, there are of course two problems. One is that politics has intervened in so many decisions about the efficiency of railways and the other is that there has simply been an inadequacy of capital investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to allude briefly to the issue of passenger services. I am very dubious about the viability of passenger services, and I point out some information in the report: for travel from Sydney to Perth it would be cheaper to give somebody a first-class air ticket than to provide the subsidy to travel by train. We really have to think very carefully about where we are spending taxpayers' money and whether that really makes any sense. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me say that I enjoyed very much participating in this work. As a South Australian I am very optimistic that, if this report is implemented, South Australia will become the railway capital of Australia, with the headquarters of Australian National already established there. If Australian National is to become, as it should, the national interstate freight operator for railways in Australia, South Australia will become the freight capital of Australia. That will provide more jobs in South Australia. It is with great regret that I report to the House that the South Australian Government did not even bother, despite an invitation, to produce a submission to this Committee. That was very negligent of it. However, once more I congratulate the staff and the members of the Committee on all that they did. I hope the Government will implement the bulk of the recommendations of this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Most of the points I would have made have already been made, so I will spare the House from my going over them again. As a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure who attended most of the hearings, I very strongly support the recommendations in the report. It was, as people have said, a very hard-working Committee whose members permitted their political differences to remain behind them. Some points of difference were raised. I know that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has a particular interest in privatisation and so forth which was not shared by everyone, but the points of view of every member of the Committee got a good hearing, even if some of those points were rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I should say that I actually thought that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), had a bit of gall to make some of the remarks he did. He is a member of this Committee but, as such, he did not attend one meeting. So his criticisms of the report-I will admit that they were muted criticisms-might have had more validity had he attended at least one meeting or come to the Committee as a member and made the points he made in the chamber today. Had he done so then, they could have been considered by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is essential that as much heavy freight as possible be removed from roads to rail. Rail is the cheapest, most effective and safest way to transport heavy freight for long distances. We hear much debate in this chamber about roads. If our highways are deteriorating, one of the contributing factors is the amount of heavy traffic that they are being forced to carry. If the goods carried by the traffic went by rail, where they belong, there would be less need to put more money into roads and the money that is put into roads could do a lot more. One of the real problems with our roads, even the highways, is the amount that has to be spent on doing them up all the time because of the deterioration caused by the heavy traffic they carry. Rail, as many have said, and as this report emphasises, does have a future, especially in the freight business. This report shows a way to that future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I was not a member of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and, as the report has just been tabled, I am not yet able to comment upon it. However, I wish to participate in the debate because there are a number of factors that I think have to be taken into account before people get carried away in the business of playing trains. Firstly-I think this figure is still relevant-Australians spend about one in every seven of their dollars on freight. It is a very significant factor, and the criterion for this Parliament in laying down rules by which our transport industry should develop is to take into account that huge national expenditure and how it can be reduced. There are many arguments, including the social arguments, to which particularly the rail system turns to defend itself and to hide many of its other inefficiencies. Of course, there is a social cost and, where people's lives can be protected, I would be the first to stand and say that some cost may be incurred there. It is not possible to say that that can be passed to government; it can be in specific areas but, in the end, it is a cost to the community. On the other hand, as recent press reports have pointed out, anybody who thinks that travelling on rail is absolutely safe should look at a couple of the recent crashes and some that have happened before. It is wrong of those representing the railways industries constantly to put up this sort of non-tariff barrier that somehow or other they have a mortgage on safety. Nevertheless, there are problems on the road in that area and I would be the first to admit it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Really and truly, when one looks at rail one has to look at the load, at the amount of freight that can be carried. In addressing the issue of carting wheat, I put information to the royal commission pointing out that 1,200 tonnes of wheat were shifted in my electorate for every kilometre of railway line servicing its wheat-growing areas. In the north-west, in the iron ore province, the figure is 80,000 tonnes of iron ore shifted per kilometre of track. Putting aside work practices and other inefficiencies, there comes a time when we cannot justify having that capital investment lying on the ground to shift 1,200 tonnes of freight. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that, quite naturally, it being a Commonwealth responsibility, this Committee has sought to look at the freight patterns primarily, I gather, between Perth and Sydney on the national line, or maybe from South Australia onwards, where in national terms the freight demand would be at the lowest. If ever railways are to be efficient in making deliveries, it will be between Melbourne and Sydney where, as no doubt it would have been pointed out had it been touched on, there are two rail systems even to get it that far. I know that the Government has changed its position, but I think the very fast train (VFT), in terms of both freight and passenger movement, has a huge potential for one reason only: it will link up Melbourne and Sydney and that highly populated strip in between. It is interesting, as I say, that the Government has changed its mind because the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) was at pains to bucket the VFT idea when it was first promoted. I do not know why he did that. At the time I thought that, before he came in here and did that, he might have taken a bit of advice before coming to a conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other points I want to make, and it has been made by a colleague of mine, is to contest very strongly the argument of this massive cross-subsidy to rail. I have operated a trucking business and I have to put in a few words for the small business truckie. On any calculation, 30 per cent of the revenue of an owner-driver goes in one tax or another. It is all right for the bureaucrats, government and others to say that that does not all go on roads by the choice of government, but the truckie cannot be blamed for that. Thirty-three per cent of his revenue-not his profit-goes in one tax or another. So that the Parliament knows what I am talking about, about 15 years ago I calculated that the sales tax on the tyres of the trucks I operated represented a cost of 50c a tonne for me to cart 1,000 miles and return empty. Whoever takes the sales tax on tyres into account? It comes directly to this Government here in Canberra. The trucking industry pays, and pays very well. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that successive governments have failed to put sufficient of that back onto the roads is no fault of the road transport industry. In the north-west of Western Australia in particular, where only road transport is available, appropriate roads have been constructed which are 25 feet wide, sealed and have white lines in the middle and on the edges. Those roads stand up very adequately, to freight transport. Roads do not deteriorate-as the experts would like us to have it-because of the traffic going over the top of them. It helps the surface, to a degree, and that is why there is so much trouble with sealed runways at airports. They often have to run rubber-tyred rollers up and down the runways to keep the bitumen alive. The reality is that rubbery-tyred traffic on a properly constructed road is beneficial to a degree, but if the seal is made too narrow then the bigger rigs go over the side and break the road from the edges inwards. These roads contribute to other great dangers for motorists because motorists get off the road when they see big vehicles approaching them. The motorists get onto the rough edges and that is what causes a lot of the road deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> The other great non-tariff barrier to trucking has been caused by the State governments protecting their own rail system by making it uneconomic to operate trucks. The main roads departments in successive Western Australian governments have taken the reverse attitude, to the great benefit of the community in terms of both safety and economy; that is, they have allowed decent sized trucks on the road-big ones. There is a great theory that the bigger truck is more dangerous. Every time another trailer is put behind an existing prime mover, another truck is taken of the road. The motorist only has to pass one truck, although it might be 30 feet longer--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member is dumb enough and has not experienced it, I cannot do anything for him. I am telling this House my experiences over 20 years both in running trucks, knowing the business and the sufferings of small business families in that industry who have provided the most economical and competitive service to Australians over a long time. I see trucks operating out of the town of Carnarvon, and there is no problem passing three semitrailers on a piece of properly constructed, decent road. The other fact is that those fellows do not find it necessary to speed and overload their trucks. There is no point in it. They have a good economic load behind them. These points should be taken into account by State administrators when they set out to protect-and they do not always protect. Modern engine technology will allow for speed-limiting. I support that. But if one says to a typical owner-driver, `Mate, you can pull another 20 tonne, but you've got to do it at 40 miles an hour maximum, and I want a speed-limiter to make sure that happens', he will buy it. He will be careful. If he is told that if he is involved in too many accidents he will lose that extra trailer licence, he will be careful too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government must not be like the New South Wales Government, which is bleeding people to death with huge licensing fees. I have a truck on my farm in Western Australia and get an extra 20 tonnes for a fee of $10 a year. That is enough, because it is not my $10. I cart wheat only off my property and do not cart commercially. It is not my $10; that goes to the consumer and the price is paid by somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a place for rail. Up in the iron ore provinces it does very well. If the railways are to work carrying small freight, government activity must be restricted to maintaining the line. Hopefully it will do that by subcontract. Brambles, a well known Australian company, is one of the biggest owners of rolling stock in Europe. That is how it should be. The wagons and things should be the property of freight forwarders. Anyone who wants to be in the business can run the wagons over to their place and have them filled up. The railways can provide the locomotive, which can be linked up and leave at such and such a time, and away it goes. The recommended efficiencies will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a role for rail, but it has to service a huge capacity if it is to work. It does not matter where a railway line is built in Australia; we have a disposition to build a road alongside it. Both are sustained because the community will not cop anything else. We should also bear in mind that electric railway lines do not stop pollution; it is simply transferred out to the country where the power to run the railways is generated by using coal. Those myths can be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that other members might like to participate in this debate, but there were a few remarks that I wished to make. Trucking has a real role to play and the Government should not be frightening it off the roads. There must be some improvement, but unless the improvement to the railways is very large that will not work. The capital costs of that will be too great. Work practices can be put to one side, although I might say to those people who work within our railways that they have a huge responsibility for their own future. Unless they are prepared to do it better as individuals, they will pay the price of no work. There will be a continuing decline in the rail system. The fact of life is that even if we want to run a railway line to Woop Woop-and even if no people are involved-it is still too expensive. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Aeronautical Research Laboratory site, Fishermens Bend, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>The Aeronautical Research Laboratory (ARL) is part of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation of the Department of Defence. ARL's terms of reference are to develop, maintain and exploit scientific and technological skills and facilities in areas generally central to the military, air vehicles and relevant aspects of weapons for the benefit of the Australian Defence Force. Existing laboratory and office accommodation at ARL is crowded and unsuitable for effective research, development and investigation in a number of areas of technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 30 June 1988 ARL operated from a 9.55-hectare site at Fishermens Bend, Port Melbourne, leased from the Victorian Government for a period of 50 years. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) occupied an adjacent 2.75-hectare site also leased from the Victorian Government under the same arrangement. On expiry of the leases on 30 June 1988, the entire 12.3-hectare site was purchased by the Commonwealth from the State Government. The Department of Defence is planning to purchase usable ex-CSIRO buildings on the site this financial year with the aim of refurbishing them to accommodate the expansion of ARL. The redevelopment proposal also includes refurbishment of some existing ARL buildings. The redevelopment proposal has evolved from a need to rationalise the operation and management of the research facility. It will provide badly needed laboratory and office space and enable staff of the scientific divisions to be collocated. This, in turn, will enable other buildings to be appropriately modified to provide more flexibility and efficiency and assist ARL to meet its research and development objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Health and safety surveys and site investigations commissioned by Australian Construction Services, and coordinated by Scientific Services Laboratories, identified areas of hazardous chemical and radiation contamination on the ex-CSIRO site. Specifically, asbestos and dangerous wastes have been found in or near buildings previously used by CSIRO. The asbestos found in some buildings will be removed during the refurbishment of those buildings and recommendations have been made regarding the management of organic constituents found in soil surrounding a former disposal facility. </PARA>
<PARA> The third item highlighted through the site investigations was the presence of low levels of radiation within or near 10 buildings. This radioactive waste will be removed from the site by the CSIRO, which has advised ARL that this will be achieved by the end of the year. The Department of Defence will monitor and survey the removal of the contaminants from the site. I can assure the House that all appropriate action has been taken and that the proviso written into the environmental certificate of compliance that construction not proceed until the site is cleared of contaminants will be strictly observed. </PARA>
<PARA> The project will consist largely of refurbishment and demolition works and will provide functional laboratory facilities to support the advanced technologies embodied in recent aircraft acquisitions, such as the FA18 fighter and the Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters. The works will also rectify temporary arrangements for laboratories, workshops and offices that have evolved over the past 40 years and rationalise facilities and accommodation. To put the importance of these proposed works into perspective, seven of the eight Australian Defence Force priority capability areas, as identified in the Defence White Paper of 1987, involved aircraft and air operations which have required or will require support from the ARL work programs. Approval of the proposed work is necessary for ARL to progress current and planned work programs to meet national defence objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the proposed work includes demolition of seven ARL and 19 ex-CSIRO substandard buildings and annexes to two buildings; and refurbishment of five existing buildings on the ex-CSIRO site and four existing ARL buildings. Also included is the provision of roads and car parking, additional electrical power to refurbished buildings, extension of the existing ARL security system to ex-CSIRO buildings, and extension of the communication ducting network. A feasibility study of the site redevelopment included the inspection of buildings on both the ARL and ex-CSIRO sites and buildings identified as suitable for continued use undergoing structural inspection. Results of these inspections have shown that sufficient of the existing CSIRO buildings can be modified, at reasonable cost, to satisfy current and to a certain degree future ARL space requirements. The total useable floor area available to ARL currently is 33,700 square metres. This will increase by around 17 per cent to 39,500 square metres once refurbishment of the combined ARL-CSIRO site is complete. This increase in area is necessary to provide ARL with essential and specific purpose facilities and accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit of cost estimate for the proposed work, at December 1988 prices, is $16.2m and comprises $13.9m for building refurbishment and modification and $2.3m for site works and services. The work will be undertaken in two phases to accommodate funding arrangements of ARL. Phase A, $8.5m, will commence in 1990-91 and phase B, $7.7m, is planned for commencement after 1994. The proposed work is expected to provide employment on site for some 50 people and opportunities for the local building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I table selected plans for the proposed redevelopment of the ARL site and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) for making available to me earlier today copies of his speech in relation to this motion. The Opposition does not oppose the reference that is before the House. I am very pleased to hear the Minister's remarks on the environment. There have been other instances around Australia when areas have been identified with hazardous chemical and radiation contamination and, rather than dealing with the matter there and then, an attempt has been made to bury the problem. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that construction will not proceed until the site has been cleared of the contaminants and that that matter will be strictly observed. I commend the Government for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the coalition I wish to make a few brief points. The first relates to an issue which the Opposition has raised repeatedly when the Minister has moved Public Works Committee motions in respect of defence facilities. In spite of repeated calls from the Opposition spokesman on defence matters and, more recently, me for the production of a long term defence facilities policy and a planning document supporting this policy, there is no evidence suggesting that the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) has complied with these calls. This failure to produce a defence facilities document also, as I made clear in this chamber only last week, flies in the face of a report commissioned by the Defence Minister recommending such a policy. Until such time as the Government ceases to apply the extent of adhockery evident in its management of defence facilities and produces a coherent, long-term facilities policy which accords with general defence policy, problems as highlighted in this referral will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> It comes as no surprise to the Opposition that, as the Minister has just said, existing facilities at the Aeronautical Research Laboratory at Fishermen's Bend `are crowded and unsuitable for effective research, development and investigations'. Only last week we were advised that a defence facilities proposal dealt with by the Minister in respect of Oakey aimed to rectify `significant exceptional health and safety deficiencies and upgrading of working conditions'. I make the point that until such time as the Government is prepared to improve its standards of management of defence facilities with the production of a comprehensive policy, men and women within the Defence Department will continue to work for some considerable time to come with facilities which are of an unsatisfactory standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point relates to the management of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), of which the Aeronautical Research Laboratory is an important element. I note from the 1988-89 Defence report that the DSTO, as a policy objective, is seeking to make further management improvements within its corporate and science functions. I join with my colleague the Opposition defence spokesman, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), in commending the DSTO and the Chief Defence Scientist for the considerable management restructuring which has occurred in the DSTO over the past few years. The extent of management devolution which has occurred inside the DSTO is a credit to the organisation and its chief executive. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the great management initiatives characterised by the recent advances in the DSTO are not matched by similar improvements in other defence functions, save for the defence support area. The Defence Department as a whole is in desperate need of fundamental management improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> This point has been made repeatedly by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar and, of course, it is one of the cornerstones of our recently released defence policy. It appears that the Government is prepared to leave to an incoming Liberal-National Party government this initiative of fundamental management improvements in the Department of Defence. The coalition supports the referral before the House and welcomes the obvious improvements that it will bring to the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of terminal facilities at Alice Springs Airport. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposed work was recommended by the Public Works Committee in its report of 21 November 1989 and it involves the redevelopment of terminal facilities at Alice Springs Airport. The existing building, which was built in 1963, has already been extended twice. It now contains some 1,460 square metres of covered space but excessive overcrowding is common due to the high levels of sustained growth over many years. The terminal now handles some 960 passengers in a peak hour and annual passenger numbers have increased from 210,000 in 1980 to 509,000 in 1988. This has resulted in airline passenger handling areas operating well below acceptable standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Airlines use the airport as a hub allowing interconnections between flights from Cairns, Sydney, Darwin, Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth and Yulara and their operations result in severe overcrowding of the terminal. The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is proposing a new terminal and surrounding infrastructure at an indicative cost of $20m at July 1989 prices. The proposed terminal is designed to handle some 1,500 passengers in a peak hour made up of 511 arrivals, 513 transfers and 445 departures. </PARA>
<PARA> The conceptual design takes into account forecast passenger and aircraft movements, the space requirements requested by both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines and forecast aircraft parking requirements for the the mid to late 1990s. The design also allows for expansion should further major airlines seek to operate through Alice Springs after airline deregulation. To date the Federal Airports corporation has received no firm proposals and it is therefore unwilling to commit itself to expenditure that may not be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> The work comprises a new terminal of approximately 9,000 square metres, a new access road system, associated landscaped vehicle parking areas, covered walkways between the terminal and airport apron, and the upgrading of engineering services. The Federal Airports Corporation intends to start construction at the end of this year with works to be completed in mid-1991. I repeat: the Federal Airports Corporation intends to start construction at the end of the year with works to be completed in mid-1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal was referred to the Northern Territory Conservation Commission, the Australian Heritage Commission and the Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority, all of which judged the project environmentally acceptable. During the Public Works Committee hearing, the Institute of Aboriginal Development proposed inclusion of a mural in the terminal building. The Federal Airports Corporation has agreed to this proposal and is waiting for the Institute of Aboriginal Development to send it details of the design. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Works Committee in its report commented on two aspects of the proposal, the first being the cost of landscaping the terminal environs. The Federal Airports Corporation, as suggested, is approaching the Northern Territory Government and the Alice Springs Town Council for a financial contribution. But the FAC believes that this unique beautification will be a significant attraction to visitors as it will represent the beauty of the central Australian environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect was the recommendation that the Federal Airports Corporation should prepare a master plan for Alice Springs Airport. The Federal Airports Corporation will undertake this task as soon as practicable. The proposal will be funded from non-Budget sources and will incorporate measures to maximise commercial returns to the FAC. The proposal will assist the Northern Territory by boosting construction activity and by providing a more attractive gateway to the many internationally renowned tourist attractions in central Australia. It will generate work for an average of 100 on-site construction workers, peaking at about 240. This project is another example of the Federal Labor Government's ongoing commitment to the people of the Northern Territory. I think the Public Works Committee for its report, its expeditious treatment of the matter and its hearings. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The coalition does not oppose this motion. However, there are a number of matters which I think the Minister should bear in mind. I draw attention to that part of his speech which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The conceptual design-</PARA>
<PARA>as proposed by the Federal Airports Corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>takes into account forecast passenger and aircraft movements, the space requirements requested by both Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines and forecast aircraft parking requirements for the mid to late 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the things that give the Opposition mild concern about that part of the Minister's speech is that it does not seem to take into account the possibility of third parties being involved at Alice Springs Airport. Although I appreciate that the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works has reported on this matter, nonetheless I think it is something that the Minister should bear in mind as he authorises this work to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I draw to the Minister's attention is the question of what is going to happen to international charters after the deregulation of the airlines takes place in about a year's time. It does not seem to me that sufficient emphasis has been placed in the report from the Public Works Committee on what will happen to international charters. It is an area in which I acknowledge forecasting is difficult, but it is still something that must be taken into account because, unlike some other airports around Australia where the Government has got it quite wrong, we want to ensure that in this instance the Federal Airports Corporation, as it proceeds with this project, makes sure that international charters are properly taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I draw to the attention of the Minister is that passengers on the largest capacity aircraft which will service Alice Springs will have to negotiate some 260 metres of uncovered distance before reaching the covered walkway. So in addition to the distance travelled under the covered walkways, these passengers will have to negotiate 260 metres of uncovered distance. As those of us who have spent some time in Alice Springs all know, historically the movement of passengers on the apron has been a problem. Passengers are often held up pending the start-up or movement of aircraft. This uncovered distance will increase passenger exposure to the elements and create an unhealthy mix of passengers and airside ground vehicle movements. There does not appear to be anything in the report to suggest that this problem can be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter I draw to the Minister's attention is the question of the relocation of some of the roads. Although this has been discussed, the Federal Airports Corporation has apparently given three options. It is not clear from the report which option is going to be chosen, but it does appear that the proposed arrangement is not entirely acceptable because of traffic management considerations. We also draw to the attention of the Minister the hope that air cargo transportation through Alice Springs Airport will increase very significantly in the years ahead. There is some concern that the facilities there will not cater adequately for that. There appears to be limited provision for heating/cooling in the airport. I also draw the Minister's attention to the question of internal insect control. I have sought to get assurances from the Minister at the table that these matters will be looked at on a number of previous occasions, always regretfully, unsuccessfully. The Minister looks at me rather mournfully, as if to say that it is not his problem, but since the Minister is bringing the matter forward it is his problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We want the Minister to get Alice Springs Airport right. We do not want to have arise at Alice Springs the situation that has arisen at a number of airports around Australia in the past. It will be a few years before we will know whether the Minister has got it right, but, if the Minister gives some attention to the matters that I have raised here, we can be sure that the Government will get Alice Springs Airport right and that the airport will meet the needs and aspirations of the people of Alice Springs and the Northern Territory. The coalition does not oppose this motion. </PARA>

In this context, like many occasions before in this House on which the honourable member for Deakin has talked about public works being undertaken in the Northern Territory in the manner in which it is proposed they are tonight, he has again suggested that it is an effort by the Hawke Government to pork-barrel the Northern Territory. I would like the honourable member for Deakin to go to the Northern Territory and suggest to the Northern Territory community that the only reason that we have got these airports is that we are pork-barrelling. I am sure that he would be treated with some sort of derision with which he would deserve to be treated, because anyone with any commonsense or understanding of air traffic through Alice Springs or of the abysmal condition of the Alice Springs air terminal would know that this facility is very much needed. It is highly warranted.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am sure his constituents have got a hard enough time accepting that he is the member for Deakin. I am sure that he would attest that both Senator Collins and I have been extremely successful in impressing the need for a new air terminal upon the Government and, indeed, achieving the result which is before the House tonight. I might add that it has not been done without the support of the Minister or the Government. Indeed, I take this opportunity to thank the Minister and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works, and your Committee, for the work it has done in ensuring that projects such as these are handled expeditiously by the parliamentary processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last week or so we have seen a number of fairly asinine attacks made upon this Government by various Northern Territory Ministers, including the Chief Minister, about subjects such as the Alice Springs Airport and the intention of this Government to proceed with the development of that airport. Indeed, as the honourable member for Deakin tried to suggest, there has been an attack on this Government's expenditure on housing. I do not mind having a debate on those issues, and I am pleased to have one with the honourable member for Deakin at any time he likes. The fact remains that in relation to the Alice Springs Airport work is to be undertaken valued at around $20m. Last week we saw the pathetic contribution of a Northern Territory Government Minister asserting that the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) for some reason was not going to ensure that local industry benefited by participating in the contracting for that airport. I say it was asinine because it was; it was stupid. As the Northern Territory Minister and, I am sure, the shadow Minister for employment, training and youth affairs know, the FAC has given undertakings, which I expect it to give effect to, that it will maximise as far as possible the participation of local subcontractors and consultants in work on the Alice Springs and Darwin airports. Indeed, in the course of last week that was acknowledged by a Northern Territory Minister in relation to Darwin airport. </PARA>
<PARA> That was having a cheap shot because the Party dumped its preselected candidate for the House of Representatives because he was an Aboriginal and was unacceptable to the Party, and put in place someone else. I understand that polling had demonstrated that it was not in the hunt for the Federal seat. It has identified a course of action-which it pursued last week and will continue to pursue this week-using the resources of the Northern Territory Government Ministers, to mount an attack from within the Northern Territory Government on me as the Federal member for the Northern Territory. To do so they attack various Ministers, such as the Minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services. They will be singularly unsuccessful. No-one is impressed with the nonsense of the arguments they are putting. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the honourable member for Deakin will not support the vacuous accusations in relation to the Alice Springs airport. We have seen already two local companies based in Alice Springs-two local branches of national companies, Theiss Contractors Pty Ltd and Hansen Yuncken (NT) Constructions-tendering for the project management together with three State companies, Turner Corporation Ltd from Sydney, and Resource Development Pty Ltd and Sabemo (SA) Pty Ltd from Adelaide. The FAC is providing every opportunity for local contractors to be involved. It has stipulated that the tenderers for project management must use local contractors and consultants where they are appropriately experienced and price competitive. I reiterate that the FAC will be involved with the project managers in the engagement and selection of all subcontractors and consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Government, because it is part of it, ought to be aware that two of its own instrumentalities-the Power and Water Authority and the Northern Territory Department of Transport and Works, the Department for which the Minister to whom I referred is responsible-are involved in contracts directly related to the Alice Springs works. The Northern Territory Department of Transport and works is involved in a $700,000 contract for the surveying and construction of an alternative road and the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority has been charged with a contract to provide $200,000 worth of work for electricity reticulation. One does not have to be too smart to work out the sorts of tactics that are being employed by the Government in the Northern Territory against this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has made available an unprecedented level of capital funding and commitment to the Northern Territory. In Alice Springs alone we are talking about $20m for an air terminal and the works accompanying it. Last week $8m was allocated for the construction of a Commonwealth centre in Alice Springs. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Deakin, also referred to what we might be doing in relation to the tourism industry. I am happy that he did because it gives me the opportunity to respond to what he said. I will not sway from the topic; I will only respond to what the shadow Minister said. He asked what I had done. He might ask what the Northern Territory Government has done. There is absolutely no doubt that as a result of my work we have achieved a targeting of the Northern Territory community-in relation to the local economy and the tourism industry-in relation to the package which was formulated by Cabinet after consultation with the various State and Territory Ministers--</PARA>

In the course of discussions about the rejuvenation of the tourism industry as a result of the disruption caused by the pilots' actions, the Northern Territory Government could not get its act together to make appropriate representations to this Government in discussions with the various State and Territory Ministers, as I am sure the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) will attest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is absolutely no doubt about the value of the construction of this terminal for the Alice Springs regional economy or that it is a further demonstration of the commitment of this Government to all sectors of the Northern Territory community but in this case particularly to central Australia. But this must be taken in tandem with the other commitments which have been made by this Government in relation to public works which will be undertaken in the Northern Territory in the coming months. I remind honourable members of the $70m which will be spent at Darwin Airport, the $62.7m which has been allocated for relocation of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment which will be undertaken by 1992, and the accompanying works which are being undertaken at the Royal Australian Air Force bases at Tindal and Coonawarra. </PARA>
<PARA> They are only some examples of the ongoing commitment of this Government to the capital works development of northern Australia. When one takes into account the amount of money that has been put into capital works in northern Australia by this Government since the start of the Tindal project, including projected development, one is looking at a figure very close to $500m. That does not take into account various program funding which has taken place in the areas of education-including special purpose funding for schools-community services, health, et cetera. There can be no doubt about the commitment of the Hawke Government to the development of northern Australia, the Northern Territory economy and the Northern Territory community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Expansion of international terminal facilities, Melbourne Airport. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposed work recommended by the Public Works Committee involves the expansion by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) of the international terminal at Melbourne Airport. The Melbourne international terminal was opened in 1970 and is now recognised as Australia's second busiest terminal. It was originally designed to process, on average, 1,000 arriving and departing passengers per hour. Regularly, 1,800 passengers per hour are now processed. During some periods when off-schedule arrivals occur the demand on the building can reach peak loads as high as 1,900 arriving passengers per hour. Peaks of this magnitude are causing deterioration in the levels of service provided to passengers and inconvenience to airline operations and other terminal users. </PARA>
<PARA> To overcome this problem the FAC developed a concept plan for the expansion of the international terminal complex at Melbourne Airport to meet current and forecast growth demands for passenger facilities and aircraft parking requirements to beyond the year 2000. The development of this proposal will result in increased handling capacities within the terminal. Instead of processing only 900 arriving and 900 departing passengers per hour, staff will be able to process 1,800 arriving and 1,800 departing passengers per hour. The proposal will be implemented in phases over the next six years for overall completion in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> A program has been developed by the FAC to match the provision of facilities with demand whilst generating funds to assist the financing of further development. The project will provide an additional six B747-400 air bridge connected gates and a further two aircraft stand-off positions. It will involve new building construction of 28,100 square metres, the complete refurbishment of 35,100 square metres of the existing building, and work associated with the provision of additional building services. The Federal Airports Corporation estimates the cost of development at $170m at December 1988 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Phase 1, involving the expenditure of $48.9m, will involve the infill of 450 square metres of garden courtyard at the departures level and its incorporation into the departure hall. It will also involve the enclosure of some 2,000 square metres of the existing observation deck on the departure level and the provision of shop fronts for leasing to retailers and other tenants. It will also involve the relocation of stairs and escalators connecting with the ground floor arrivals hall, first floor departure hall and the second floor to provide more efficient circulation, particularly at the departures level. </PARA>
<PARA> The infill of the concourse at arrival and departure levels to allow relocation of outwards immigration and Customs services and of transit escalators to allow the development of an efficient retail area in the departure hall will also be incorporated in phase 1. It is planned for completion by the end of 1990. Further phases will progressively achieve completion of all the stated improvements by 1995. Phase 1 will employ an average on-site work force of 65 people, peaking at 130, while the total project is likely to employ, all up, about 425 workers on site, which should peak at about 700. The Committee expresses no reservations about the proposal. I thank the Public Works Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

The Minister knows that we have to have some spreading of these projects to make sure that we do not put too much pressure on the financial markets. I just say it is strange that the Minister should be bringing all these matters before us now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, the coalition does not object to this motion. However, anything concerning Melbourne Airport is a bit worrying. Honourable members will recall that in the last couple of years in this House we had the unfolding story of the extraordinary radar fiasco at Melbourne Airport. The Government-not the Federal Airports Corporation-purchased radar and tried to modify it itself. The radar did not work. Planes disappeared, reappeared, and disappeared. The separation times stepped out from I think three minutes to five minutes. So anything about Melbourne Airport is a bit of a worry, particularly to those of us who fly into and out of Melbourne Airport frequently. We certainly do not want another fiasco such as the radar fiasco we had there. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want another fiasco such as the fiasco we had at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport either. A few years ago the Government decided to spend $20m-odd upgrading its international facilities. Almost before it had started, it found that the development was completely inadequate. It then had to go the next step and spend a lot more money on additional facilities. The $20m that it proposed to spend upgrading Sydney Airport was essentially wasted. At the time we drew the Government's attention to this. We said, `Look, this is not going to work. Demand will be higher than you think. All the tourist people are saying that the number of tourists into Sydney will increase. Don't spend this $20m. If you spend it, you'll have to spend a lot more later on and the money you spend will be wasted'. We do not want a fiasco such as that occurring at Melbourne Airport. We do not want another Melbourne radar fiasco; we do not want another Sydney international facilities upgrading fiasco. </PARA>
<PARA> That prompts a couple of questions to the Minister for Administrative Services-as well as to a couple of other Ministers, including the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), the ex-Minister, who will lose their seats. Clause 26 of the Standing Committee on Public Works report relating to the Expansion of International Terminal Facilities, Melbourne Airport states:</PARA>
<PARA>Large peaks accompany these `average' busy periods, with 1,900 arriving and 1,500 departing passengers recorded in a one hour period in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that at present only 500 passengers can be handled. If I read the Minister's motion correctly, he only alludes to the fact that this peak can be handled. One has to ask what does that really mean. Does it really mean that there will be times when Melbourne Airport will be overloaded?</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 28 refers to the forecast growths that have been estimated in the planning that gives rise to this project. Again I remind the Minister that the forecasts made in the matter of Sydney Airport were wildly astray. All we have is reports from Qantas Airways Ltd and from a consultant on what the rate of growth will be; we do not appear to have any reports from the tourist industry. Although the tourist industry, particularly in the Northern Territory, north Queensland and Tasmania, has been decimated by the pilots strike that is not a strike--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says that there is no dispute, but people in Tasmania, the Northern Territory and north Queensland tell us that there is a pilots strike. Those circumstances really prompt the question to the Minister of whether the forecasts and the assumptions that have been made, which get out of date very quickly, are really valid. I recognise and appreciate the work put in by the Public Works Committee but still the Government has a responsibility to ensure that it takes account of any contingency that might arise in regard to Melbourne Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to clause 119 of the report, which refers to the processing of 1,800 departing or arriving passengers, not 1,900, as is said in the report, during peak periods. That was back in 1988. So the Opposition does not oppose this motion. We again want to draw the attention of the Minister to these matters that we have raised and ask him to ensure that we simply do not have the kind of difficulties that arose at Melbourne Airport in relation to radar or with international facilities at Sydney Airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the amendment be disagreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's reason for rejecting the amendment is that the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) money to be remitted to the Australian Taxation Office is not money that belongs to a group employer; therefore, the status of the employer, that is, the public hospital, the public benefit institution or the public university, is not a matter of principle regarding the timing of remittances. The PAYE money withheld is money to be forwarded to the Australian Taxation Office for payment of employees' future tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is of the view that no case can be made for allowing an employer to retain the money longer than is necessary. In a perfect world the money should be paid over by an employer as soon as it is withheld. However, administrative considerations in respect of both the employer and the Australian Taxation Office require some time lag between collection and remittance. The change announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech was in the context that the deferral of tax payments arises with the present monthly remittance arrangements and that a new requirement on major employers reduced this deferral. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment would reduce the effectiveness of the Budget measure. In money terms, the amendment would reduce the revenue gained from the measure by $50m. The Opposition sought to argue that the organisations named in the amendment should be exempted from the twice monthly requirement, because they apply their resources to public rather than to private purposes. If this rationale is accepted, the entire public sector-Commonwealth, State and local-should be exempted. The proposed change is the first step in moving larger group employers to a twice monthly system and smaller employers, comprising a majority of remitters, to a less frequent payment system. With this background, the Government rejects the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition disagrees with this motion. We rest our case on the Government's own argument when it introduced the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill-that is, that companies were withholding payment of tax instalments for private or company use. In doing so, the Government has overlooked the fact that the Bill refers to group employers and early remitters, such as institutions, which utilise public money for community use. It is against that background that we believe this amendment should go forward and the specific form of the amendment was such, as an amendment to clause 4, that, in addition to subsection 221ec (9) a new subsection (10) should be included so that the Bill would not apply to a public hospital, a public benevolent institution and a public university.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would have to question the Government's motives in this matter. Our position all along has been to question the desire of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to make his Budget surplus look better than it otherwise would have been. This provision has nothing to do with tax reform or with meaningful changes to tax payment arrangements; rather, it is simple Government greed, with the Treasurer trying to dress the numbers up to placate his own ego and to give him a better looking fiscal record than would otherwise have been the case. In so doing, and on the basis of a number of representations, we are aware of the magnitude of the problem this provision will pose, particularly for institutions like public hospitals and public benevolent institutions. We do not believe that the Treasurer's ego is worth that price. </PARA>

I have given him a chance to tell me what he actually said, but that is the essence of what he said. Anyone who has ever been charged with the responsibility of deducting and remitting group tax instalments would know that some administration is involved. The books must really be balanced. One has to reconcile the account with the ledger control account and at the end of the financial year and within a specified period soon thereafter, one has to justify all payments; they must add up exactly, to the cent, to the remittances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister made some sort of inane remark along the lines I have just referred to and said, `Well, that is all right'. That ranks with the nonsense of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech when he said that, because company taxes must be paid by instalment in August, November and February, and the remaining amount in April each financial year, an interest free loan was being given. That contravenes the spirit of anything I understood about the law and that is that the property of a man or entity remains the property of that entity or person until it is otherwise decided. It is a matter of right. It is nonsense to say that under those circumstances it is an interest free loan. As mentioned by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) that nonsense was presented in order to prop up and to mislead about a spurious surplus, as the Treasurer has managed to do in a couple of recent Budgets. </PARA>

It would have been plain, even to the Minister at the table, that we would be back here debating this amendment. In order to save the time of Parliament and this House, perhaps it would have been preferable if we had dispensed with some of the argument at that stage and had behaved as a true legislative chamber. This discussion was forecast by both me and the honourable member for Wentworth during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment moved and passed in the Senate seeks to exempt hospitals, charitable organisations and universities from the requirements of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill that advance the collection of group deductions under certain circumstances for those institutions that have annual payroll deductions in excess of $5m. It is now sought to bring that forward for not only corporations but also those public institutions. The effects will be the same as for the corporations that will be affected. That would eat seriously into their cash flows. They, like the corporations, will have to take some stock of their cash requirements. It is not inconceivable that they will have to borrow to make up the difference. Having borrowed, they will have to pay interest on that money, like everyone else. That is where we run into the problem-as I see it, and as was accepted by the Senate as the reason for the amendment-that many of those institutions receive sometimes a great part of their funding from public subscriptions. </PARA>
<PARA> People who make subscriptions to charitable organisations, public hospitals and universities which run appeals from time to time and seek money from other than government sources are quite happy to make those contributions in the knowledge that their payments will in some way go towards the running costs of those bodies. If the Government insists on being intransigent, part of those contributions will be applied to paying interest. That, in itself, might not be enough to persuade the Government. It might be that it thinks hospitals, charitable organisations and universities are no different from corporations. That runs counter to section 78 of the principal Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act, which specifically recognises these institutions as something separate. They are separate, as that acknowledgment in the principal Act verifies. They are different; they are treated as different; they are regarded as different; and in most cases they do not even have to pay income tax. However, under this requirement they will be treated the same as corporations. The Government chooses to ignore the considerations I have outlined and which were outlined at great length in the Senate, even though section 78 acknowledges that there are special considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Wentworth pointed out, we support the Senate's amendment. It is entirely supported, after all, by reasonable men and women and should be acceptable to the Government. The Government has lost touch with reality in so many ways that it is not surprising to see once again that it cannot distinguish between the profit-earning private sector and institutions of the sort that will be adversely affected by these requirements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and his colleagues that we have a guillotine in this place because of a decision in the party room of the Liberal Party that its members would participate in a vote in the Senate to set a deadline by which this place must transmit legislation to the Senate. It ill behoves members of the Opposition to come into this chamber and lecture us about how they are participating in making the House of Representatives subservient to the other place year after year in recent times. The decision was that of the Opposition itself. (Quorum formed)</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer also to another matter raised by the honourable member for Curtin. He accused me of making some inane comment. I think he may have misunderstood what I said in reference to pay-as-you-earn money being withheld, so I will repeat it in clear detail. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>In a perfect world the money should be paid over by an employer as soon as it is withheld. However, administrative considerations in respect of both the employers and the Australian Taxation Office require some time lag between collection and remittance. </PARA>
<PARA>As those are almost the same words that he repeated to me, it seems that he may have misunderstood what I said when I put that message to the chamber earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing is that in respect of this matter there was a revenue loss of some $50m. If one were to start financing some public authorities in this way, one would not select only some of the public authorities and public organisations, as suggested in this amendment. The Government rejects the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of points should be clearly understood in this debate. The first one relates to adhockery. These decisions were taken at the last minute under pressure to make the numbers look good. This decision and the decision about bringing forward the payment of company tax are in the same category-blatantly ad hoc with a host of unintended consequences. Last week in this place we saw how the Government panicked on that other Bill after having it pointed out over a period of weeks that it was sending the small business community out backwards as a result of that decision. Here we have another dose of adhockery in terms of the treatment of these institutions under the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) identified some funding cost. It is very good of him to put a number on it; Government Ministers usually do not. They did not cost last week's decision to change the company tax arrangements for one year. The Government generally has quite fictional costing numbers when it comes to looking at legislation before the Parliament, particularly in the taxation area. If the Minister wants to know where we will fund this one from-I am not sure that we should accept his $50m figure-I inform him that we will start by knocking off the Kodak decision, which will give us $6m this year and $12m next year. We will also cease paying compensation to the airline industry, which will give us $100m or so. We can go through and undo all such deals. I have absolutely no embarrassment about taking money back from Kodak and Ansett Airlines of Australia, a multinational company in one case and a major airline in another, and giving it to benevolent institutions and public hospitals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take issue with the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) in the sense that during my remarks I invited him-and I am sure it would have been entertained by you, Mr Deputy Speaker-to repeat what he said. I am grateful to him for taking the opportunity to clarify what he said. Nevertheless, it seems to me to be a pointless exercise to say that in a perfect world something would happen but the Government does not expect it to happen. It would strike me as being unnecessary to recite that sort of garbage when we are here dealing with an amendment of this sort. To postulate about an ideal world and to accept that it is not an ideal world seems to be quite unnecessary, but I do thank the Minister for eventually giving the clarification that I sought of him during my remarks. If he had done it at the time, we might have saved a little time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister insists on this nonsense about the guillotine, it might be as well to remind him once again that the guillotine is not always contingent upon what is insisted upon by the Senate. Let me say about the Senate in that context that on present indications it will be sitting right up until Christmas eve, so it is not being unnecessarily obstructive; the senators simply want to discuss the legislation. Because when he comes into the House the Minister does not know enough about legislation to discuss it intelligently and to take it through the committee stage, I know it is very convenient for him to avoid that procedure. Nevertheless, the procedure exists in Standing Orders and he might well do the extra work that is required to understand the legislation of which he has charge in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, comparatively we have sat only a handful of days this year. The Minister would be only too well aware of that. After all, he will not get any help from his Treasurer, because his Treasurer knows absolutely nothing about the administration of the tax law. He does not know what goes on in that area of his responsibility and he is only too willing to sublet it to the Commissioner of Taxation, who does not hesitate to take him for a ride whenever it suits him. In this place we see example after example-we saw it during our term in government, I have to confess-of a Commissioner of Taxation coming along and insisting upon law to conceal and to obscure a lack of administrative skills and ability within the Australian Taxation Office. He is still pulling that stunt. There is no better example than what he asked the previous coalition government to do when he had section 260 at his disposal and administered it in such a way that prompted him then to ask for more and draconian powers. Of course, subsequently the courts found that section 260 was perfectly good to deal with the circumstances for which we eventually legislated at the behest of the Commissioner of Taxation. This goes on day after day and time after time; it is only with a Treasurer of the general incompetence of this one that it is perpetuated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say that the guillotine is used mercilessly and unnecessarily by this Government. I take the chamber back only to the sitting week before last when a tax Bill, which had been brought before the House on 31 May, was brought before this chamber under the guillotine. A tax Bill of great complexity was debated in this chamber only the sitting week before last, even though it had been sitting in this Parliament since 31 May. There was no excuse and no embarrassment on the part of the Government, and certainly none on the part of the Minister. It is a classic example of how unnecessarily incompetent this Government is in managing the business of the Parliament. Of course, the Minister at the table is as much a party to it as is the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> For reasons advanced by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and myself, we maintain our opposition to denying this amendment from the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate, I present the reasons which have been circulated to honourable members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Reasons of the House of Representatives for disagreeing to the amendment of the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment made by the Senate is not acceptable because:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the amendment would reduce the effectiveness of the 1989-90 Budget measure seeking to overcome the deferral of tax payments-that otherwise arises with monthly remittances of income tax instalment collections withheld by employers from the salary or wages of employees-by closer matching of remittances to collections;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the amendment would reduce the 1989-90 revenue gain from the measure by an estimated $50 million;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the income tax instalment collections to be remitted twice-monthly by major employers, including the employers the subject of the amendment, do not belong to them, and there is no case for allowing any such employer to retain the money for a longer period;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the measure is the first step in a strategy aimed at moving large employers to a twice-monthly system of remittance of income tax instalments deductions, and small employers, comprising the majority of remitters, to a less frequent system than at present; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Government assistance to public benevolent institutions, hospitals and universities is appropriately provided by means of outlays measures which are subject to review and compared with competing demands for Commonwealth funds in the Budgetary process. It would subvert this process to provide part of this funding by means of allowing selected institutions to use their employees' tax deductions for an extended period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill 1989. The object of the Bill is to put into Australian law some provisions that are required before ratification of the recently concluded United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The convention requires countries that ratify it to take substantive action to help stamp out the international traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, which I will refer to as drugs. This action is in several forms. It will require Australia as a country that is going to ratify the convention to ensure that manufacturing, growing and dealing in drugs and money laundering of drug proceeds are all made criminal offences under domestic law; to ensure that the local courts have jurisdiction over drug crimes; to ensure that there is a domestic law for the tracing, freezing and confiscation of drug proceeds; to ensure that there is an adequate regime for the extradition of drug criminals; to provide other countries with legal assistance in investigations and prosecutions; to provide for good communications, exchange of information, joint task forces, liaison officers, research and training; to identify miscreants by allowing international controlled delivery of drugs; to prevent the diversion of specified substances used in the illicit manufacture of drugs; to prevent the illicit cultivation of and promote the eradication of plants containing narcotic or psychotropic substances; to prevent the commercial carriage of drugs; to promote the proper documentation of drugs lawfully exported; and to suppress the illicit traffic of drugs by sea and air through the mails and in free trade zones and free ports. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the objectives that are sought to be achieved by the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Those matters are the matters that Australia will be required to implement within its own law. Many of the obligations assumed by Australia under this convention are in fact already legislated for by State laws and by Federal laws such as the Customs Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act, the Extradition Act and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. Other obligations will be implemented by ongoing consultations with the States. The object of those consultations will be to encourage the States to implement those parts of the convention that can be implemented only by State law, and to do this by having their laws comply with the convention. By this Bill the Commonwealth is not overriding any State laws and, indeed, that proposition is at least to some extent enshrined in the Bill itself because the Bill provides in clause 5 (1):</PARA>
<PARA> This Act is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth or any law of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably this is not to be one of those cases where the Commonwealth will be using the external affairs power to override State laws. </PARA>
<PARA> The area which needs to be legislated for by the Commonwealth, and which is the principal concern of this Bill, is extraterritorial jurisdiction. Enforcing the full international rigour of the convention requires nations to provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction by their courts over drug crimes when the domestic law might not give jurisdiction. Thus the Bill gives Australia extraterritorial jurisdiction over drug crimes in a number of cases and the most important of them are as follows: firstly, where the crime is committed by an Australian national, but committed outside Australia, and in that case normally the Australian courts would not have jurisdiction over it; secondly, where a foreigner commits the crime outside Australia but he is subsequently located in Australia; thirdly, where the conduct in the example given in the second reading speech is growing a crop of a drug where the conduct is engaged in with the view to the commission of a drug crime in Australia; fourthly, aiding and abetting, et cetera, outside Australia the commission of a breach of a State or Territory drug crime; and, fifthly, dealing in drugs on an Australian aircraft or ship. Normally those matters would not come within the jurisdiction of the Australian courts and the object of this Bill, pursuant to the convention, is to bring them within the jurisdiction of the Australian courts, and that is a worthwhile objective. </PARA>
<PARA> To maintain a vigorous fight against international drug crimes, these extensions of Australian jurisdiction-for that is what they are, extending the jurisdiction of the Australian courts over new crimes-are, we believe, like the Government, justified. Without them, to give one example, those engaged in hatching a conspiracy on an Australian ship in the Persian Gulf to smuggle drugs into Australia when the ship returns to Australia may not be subject to Australian jurisdiction but, when this amendment becomes law, or when this amendment to the law is implemented, they will of course be subject to Australian jurisdiction, as clearly they should be. The Bill fixes a variety of penalties for these offences, ranging up to life imprisonment, depending on the quantity of drugs involved. As I read it, the penalties are broadly in line with those prescribed under the Customs Act for dealing with similar quantities of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known that there has been some opposition in certain quarters to the convention on the ground that it perpetuates what is called the law and order approach to drugs which, it is said by those who advance this argument, has not succeeded in stamping out the drug problem. It is argued that we should be looking at what is referred to as decriminalising drugs or legalising them. This has been particularly argued for in the case of heroin. A number of organisations and individuals have been advancing this argument in recent times. The Foundation for Drug Policy, which was established recently, is one such body that has advocated this approach. In other words, the people advocating that sort of argument say that this Bill and the laws associated with it are undesirable and unnecessary, as indeed is the convention, because they perpetuate what is popularly referred to as the law and order approach towards stamping out the drug problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the merits of that argument may be, and some maintain that the argument has merits, the short point we believe is that it is false to suggest that the convention prevents the examination of other options for dealing with the drug problem. There again we find ourselves to this extent on common ground with the Government. Indeed, the most cursory examination of the convention makes it plain that this is the case. The convention provides that, despite the obligation imposed on nation states which are parties to the convention to make drug crimes punishable; nevertheless parties to the convention may, and I quote from the convention, `provide as alternatives to conviction or punishment'-in other words, as alternatives to the law and order approach-`measures such as education, rehabilitation or social reintegration as well as, when the offender is a drug abuser, treatment and after care'. So the convention itself, on its plain terms, throws up as an option an alternative approach to prosecution, conviction and imprisonment, which is legitimised under the convention, of treatment and after-care. So it is quite plain that it does not prevent non-criminal sanctions and it does not prevent non-penal sanctions for abuse of the use of hard drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the second reading speech that this is the Government's argument, for we were told in the second reading speech that the convention `does not preclude the re-examination of policy in relation to personal use of prohibited drugs'. I say that I understand that this is the Government's view because there seems to be some difference of opinion amongst at least some government officials on this issue. Although, on my interpretation, the convention itself does not prohibit or rule out an alternative approach to dealing with the drug problem, nevertheless it is appropriate to highlight the discrepancy of opinion that seems to be emerging among some government officials. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we have noticed remarks by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chairman of the National Crime Authority. We have noticed that they have been having some publicly expressed differences of opinion about this very issue. I refer to a news item in the Age of 15 November, although the same matter was canvassed in other newspapers. It seems from that report that the Director of Public Prosecutions was himself in favour of the decriminalisation of hard drugs and that the Chairman of the National Crime Authority was not. I emphasise that I am basing this on the report, but it is plain from the terms of the report that the view of the person writing the report in the newspaper was that the Director of Public Prosecutions was in favour of the decriminalisation of hard drugs and that the Chairman of the National Crime Authority was not. Let me refer briefly to this newspaper item. It commences:</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Peter Faris, QC, was in conflict last night-</PARA>
<PARA>last night being 14 November this year-</PARA>
<PARA>with the federal director of public prosecutions over laws used to fight organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Faris said he disagreed with views expressed by the director, Mr Mark Weinberg, QC, on money laundering and the decriminalisation of drugs, and was likely to take up the matter with the federal Attorney-General, Mr Bowen. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say of Mr Faris:</PARA>
<PARA>He said he wanted to know whether the Government intended to decriminalise hard drugs `as called for by the DPP'. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is quite plain that the view being attributed to Mr Faris is that Mr Weinberg's view is that there should be decriminalisation of hard drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other differences of opinion between the two, so it would appear. But I want to emphasise the point that, on the basis of the report-and I certainly have not seen it denied-there is really a quite substantial difference of opinion between the two officers concerned. They are two senior law enforcement officers-probably the two most senior, subject to the Attorney-General himself-employed by the Commonwealth and, on this major issue of public policy, which is in fact directly addressed by the second reading speech, we find a very disturbing difference of opinion between the two of them. </PARA>
<PARA> What we want to know, especially in view of what has been put in the second reading speech, is whether the Director of Public Prosecutions, to use Mr Faris's words, has called for the decriminalisation of hard drugs. We want to know, to put it concisely, whether he has and, if so, what response has the Government given to him. It really is quite an extraordinary situation if the Commonwealth's senior prosecuting officer has called in effect for the negation of laws he is supposed to be enforcing. We are not saying, of course, that this is positively the view of the Director of Public Prosecutions; what we are saying is that the public controversy has arisen as a matter of fact-there can be no doubt about that-between the two of them, and we believe that it is the Attorney-General's responsibility on behalf of the Government to clarify this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add, because it is relevant to the Bill and to the United Nations convention, that the same point applies to the dispute about money laundering. Mr Weinberg, as we understand him to be saying from the newspaper report, maintains that the Proceeds of Crime Act, which is a very important Act, is draconian. That is the word he used, apparently. On the other hand, Mr Faris says that the provisions should be tightened. He says that they are not draconian enough; that they should be much tougher. There is a body of opinion to the effect that we should have a much more stringent Proceeds of Crime Act. Apparently, that is the view held by Mr Faris. </PARA>
<PARA> What we want to know-indeed, the public has an entitlement to know this-is who is accurately expressing the Government's view in the first place and who is accurately expressing the view in so far as what happens on the ground is concerned? Is there any attitude of going soft on using the Proceeds of Crime Act because it is too draconian? Is there any lessening up in the efforts being used to pursue the money trail? Is there, as an alternative, any proposal to strengthen the Proceeds of Crime Act? It is a matter of debate. No doubt there are arguments on both sides, but the point remains that there is a difference of opinion which should be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> This public disagreement between senior law enforcement officers is very unfortunate because it saps public confidence in law enforcement. Although these officers are, in the broad sense of the word, independent, there is an overriding responsibility on the Government to maintain public confidence in the fight against crime. One part of maintaining public confidence in the fight against crime is to satisfy people that the policy is clear, that the resources are there, that the attitude is there and that all officials have their heart in what they are doing and are vigorously and rigorously going to pursue and use the law which is there. It would be in the Government's own interests to have this difference of opinion resolved; as well as it being in the public interest to have this difference resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the Government's position may be, the Opposition's position is quite clear because for our part we are opposed to this so-called notion of decriminalisation or legalisation of hard drugs. We believe that to embark on that course would be reckless in the extreme. It would create more drug addicts, it would do nothing for the present unfortunate victims of drugs, and it would create a new social problem of immense proportions. In addition to that, what is overlooked by those who advance the decriminalisation argument is that even if some drugs were `legalised' or `decriminalised', laws would still be needed to prevent illegal trafficking in heroin and also in other far more dangerous drugs which would still be illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot imagine any supporter of decriminalisation advocating that some of these completely illegal psychotropic substances should be legalised. Even if we decriminalised heroin, there would still be many illegal drugs and there would have to be laws to prevent their illegal traffic. What those who argue for decriminalisation overlook is that in that case we would still require laws and the enforcement of those laws. Surely it is not suggested that all narcotic and psychotropic drugs should be decriminalised or legalised. If it is not, stringent laws, matched with heavy penalities, will still be needed to stop the traffic in those particularly dangerous drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the convention will provide a substantial weapon in the international fight against illegal trafficking in illegal drugs, but it will do that only if it is used and only if the Bill, when it becomes law, is used. If there is a single significant point above all that we want to make tonight, it is that we express the hope that the Bill, when it is passed, will be used. I say this because I am not convinced that the Government in all cases uses the powers that it has and I am not yet convinced that the Government will use all the powers that it will have under the Bill when it becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, to use an analogy, I have noticed the grand proposition in the second reading speech that our extradition powers have been modernised, the implication being that this has brought about some new, extensive and vigorous use of extradition laws. It may be that the extradition laws have been modernised, but they have not always been put into practice. There is one case which is quite notorious where they have not been put into practice when clearly they should have been. The case I refer to is the Fiji arms cache incident of last year when the Government had a very clear case before it for using the extradition powers that it had. But it was, we believe, guilty then of the most spineless abrogation of responsibility, such that I wonder whether its heart is always in law enforcement of this international sort. In that case the Government seemed to think that its role was to discover reasons why extradition should not be used. It refused to extradite one of the miscreants to Fiji, where he should have been sent to stand trial, and it even refused to try to extradite the other miscreant from the United Kingdom to Australia to stand trial, although he was going around London-for all I know he is still doing so-telling anyone who cared to listen that he was responsible for the arms cache being imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting in that regard, because again it is reflected and picked up in the second reading speech to the Bill, to look back on the words of Senator Tate, the Minister for Justice, at the time we made our extradition arrangements with Fiji. He said that, as a result of the extradition arrangements that he was responsible for making with Fiji, neither Australia nor Fiji should become a haven for fugitives from justice. He went into some quite poetic flights on that occasion, before he went to Fiji and when he returned, painting this glowing picture of new extradition arrangements between Australian and Fiji and advancing the argument that now we had proper and efficient extradition arrangements between our two countries and the full rigour of the law would be used to ensure that criminals were brought to justice in the place where they should be put on trial and that would be done through the extradition arrangements that he had made. </PARA>
<PARA> He made those arrangements at about the time the Fijian arms cache was on the high seas. Little did he know-I presume that he knew little about it-that very shortly after that a wonderful opportunity would be presented to him for using those very extradition arrangements which he was heralding and lauding at that time. He said that the Fiji-Australia extradition arrangements would prevent Australia or Fiji being a haven for fugitives from justice. What a hollow threat that turned out to be because when an opportunity arose only a few months later to put those lofty propositions into practice, the Government simply threw in the towel and did nothing. To this day it has done next to nothing about the whole matter. It did not use the extradition powers that it had. The only consolation is that one day there will be proper enforcement and use of those powers in this country. So we reserve our view on whether the powers being given under the Bill will be used by the present Government. We support the Bill and simply say to the Government: when it becomes law, use it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final matter which is a little technical and I am sure that the Attorney-General will be able to assist us. It seems to have been an oversight, although it may not be. I am sure the Attorney-General will be able to throw some light on it. I ask him whether there should not be in the Bill some provision by which the Proceeds of Crime Act, the Extradition Act and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act are used. We are creating new offences under the Bill and the question arises as to whether those offences are subject to the machinery provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act. We hope that they are. We would support any move to ensure and guarantee that they are. But are those new offences subject to the machinery set up under the Extradition Act. Are they subject to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act? The Bill is silent on this. It seems to us, on reading it, that there may well be a need for some expansion of its provisions. So we simply ask, in a constructive sense, whether there is a gap there, and perhaps we may get some explanation for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all in this debate, we want to make the basic point that this is an important convention, because the traffic in illegal drugs is one of the great evils facing the world today. We believe that the international nature of the convention is such that it will probably turn out to be a very effective weapon indeed in stamping out the international traffic in illegal narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. We support the convention. We support the Bill. We reject this notion that seems to be becoming the fashion of the times that we should be looking at decriminalisation and legalisation. That is not going to solve anything. That is probably going to create a greater evil than the evil we have at the moment. We simply say to the Government that we are giving it these powers under the Bill, which we are now supporting, and expect it to use the powers to their full extent as part of its ongoing fight against the international traffic in illegal drugs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I make some comments in support of the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill, I wish to pick up a couple of observations made by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). I think that he is to be commended for his speech in the second reading debate tonight. We welcome the fact that, for once, the Opposition is accepting legislation that has been put forward by the Government and is not simply opposing legislation for the sake of opposing it. That is a very rare but pleasurable occurrence in this House. I thought that the contribution the honourable member for Menzies made in discussing the Bill was considered, and I commend him for it. I do not agree with a number of the things the honourable member for Menzies said, but he raised matters that are at the core of quite wide debate in the community and some disagreement is to be expected in some of the points he put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One matter on which I take issue with the honourable member for Menzies is his attempt to make something of the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions might have a particular view on the application of the Proceeds of Crimes Act and other matters raised by the honourable member for Menzies, and that the Chairman of the National Crime Authority (NCA) might have a different view. The honourable member for Menzies then said that some clarification needed to be made by the Government as these two officers should not be at odds and expressing different views because of the effect on confidence in law enforcement. This is where I take issue with the honourable member for Menzies. He has been around for a long time and knows that these two officers are very senior Commonwealth appointees and are expected to carry out their duties independently of each other and have views independent of the Government. They are certainly not expected to be out there simply putting forward the Government's view on particular matters, and especially matters as substantial as these. In other words, no-one expects them to express the Government's view. It is a matter for debate. They are paid to do a job. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Crime Authority has four terms of reference, and the Chairman of the NCA is paid to carry out the responsibilities of the NCA, which are, in part, to make sure that the NCA meets its obligations under the Act. Part of its obligation is to give advice to the Government on strategies that ought to be adopted in the national fight against organised crime, to give advice and direction to the Government on where it ought be looking at changes in practices or in legislation. That is the role of the NCA. The Director of Public Prosecutions has an entirely different role, as the honourable member for Menzies well knows-and I do not need to spell these things out to him-which is independently to assess the evidence, assess the case, set about prosecuting the case and make judgments about prosecutions. It is very clear that they will have different views about these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the proceeds of crime approach and in fact the broader approach that the National Crime Authority is now taking in its linked activities with the Australian Taxation Office. Mr Faris is quite openly saying the strategy is now being adopted of following the money trial. It is very difficult to catch these very practised, skilled and intelligent criminal organisations in an illegal act. All sorts of government techniques have been tried in all sorts of countries over a long period to try to catch these organisations in an illegal act. But it is difficult to trace the proceeds of crime and use other avenues via the tax Act to point up criminality and approach the problem in a different way. I suppose it is a lesson that many of us should have learnt from the experience in the United States with A1 Capone 60 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria-and I very much welcome this-we have seen the Australian Taxation Office and the National Crime Authority acting in collaboration in the raids in Mildura last week. One cannot comment about the possible outcome of those raids, but very clearly we are seeing a cooperative action between the Tax Office, which has identified particular targets, and the NCA, which has identified the same targets but in its own field. I would like to see that cooperative approach continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> The point on which I take issue with the honourable member for Menzies is that one cannot come into the House and try to make out that there is some sort of difficult conflict going on in law enforcement circles when the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chairman of the NCA have differing views about the degree of application of particular measures. They are expected to carry out their duties independently, not only of the Government but of each other, and it is not surprising that they do have different views.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Menzies has properly said, the Bill is something of a landmark in legislation in Australia and in the fight against crime and narcotic drugs. As the honourable member noted, it brings the Commonwealth Government's obligations into line with the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances which is part of an international commitment by the developed countries for a cooperative approach to this world-wide problem of illicit drug traffic. As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons) made clear in his second reading speech, article 4 of the convention requires a number of areas of extended jurisdiction to be created, which I certainly welcome. For instance, where an Australian national engages in conduct outside Australia which is an offence under the convention, we will have jurisdiction. I note, too, that there is provision under the convention for us to have reservations about extraditing a national of another country to that country if we do not secure satisfactory undertakings about the likely penalties that might be applied. Those sorts of practices are to be welcomed and are part of a broader international approach which I certainly support. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take up some of the comments made by the honourable member for Menzies on the question of decriminalisation. He devoted quite a bit of time to the issue of whether the Government ought to be looking at decriminalisation. He was putting a very strong view that we should not and that we should maintain prohibition. He raised this issue, I acknowledge, because nothing in the Convention prevents governments which are parties to the Convention going down the road of decriminalisation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which oversees the operations of the National Crime Authority, I was party to a report which was tabled in the House a couple of months ago and which the Attorney-General is considering at the moment. Among other things, that report has set the parameters for genuine consideration in this country of the issue of decriminalisation. It was handed down by my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), who is the Chairman of the Committee, and it was entitled Drugs and Crime in Society. That report essentially has tried to examine, first of all, whether we have been successful in the fight against organised crime and whether decriminalisation in the end is the approach that needs to be followed. It has set out parameters by which a further judgment can be made, and it is recommended that that should be in about three years time. For the first time a set of criteria has been laid out by which we can ask whether we are succeeding. If we are not succeeding, we have to look at other options. </PARA>
<PARA> The report really brings the debate very close to its final stages of conclusion in this country. I believe that all Western nations must now be aware that prohibition does not work. Whether the issue is prostitution, gambling, trafficking in drugs or sale of alcohol, there is no significant evidence that I know of in any country that prohibition actually works. I take the view that the issue of decriminalisation will have to be faced down the road and I think that this report has set out the relevant parameters very well. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very interesting aspect of the report concerns its two principal recommendations. The honourable member for Menzies tried earlier to make something of the conflict between key approaches and the fact that this conflict might be undermining public confidence in the fight against crime. We also had some conflict regarding the handing down of the conclusions of the report that the honourable member for McEwen tabled. The two principal recommendations fit very closely with the United Nations Convention. They really address the question of education, particularly among young people, and perceptions in the community. They join with the general theme of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which, of course, concerns awareness and education. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal recommendation was that the Government consider seriously the means by which we could bring about a ban on the advertising of alcohol and tobacco products. The reasoning behind that recommendation was that when one talks to young people in particular about the immorality and dangers of what they see as perhaps their drug area-particularly cannabis-the first thing they do is say, `What about grog and smokes? They are the things that are causing all the health problems in the community. If you are going to ban our stuff, why won't you ban your own? If you are going to talk about advertising and promotion, why don't you take your own drugs seriously?'. That is what young people actually think and say. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of our Committee, from both sides, were quite comfortable about these recommendations until it came to the crunch of actually putting the name on the dotted line, particularly in relation to the banning of alcohol. I do not need to raise in the House the links those opposite have with certain figures who are key brewers in this country. But we came up with a finding which was supported. Members of the Liberal Party of Australia were prepared to support a ban on tobacco advertising but they were not prepared to support a ban on alcohol advertising. One is entitled to ask who is pulling strings and why they would not support such a ban when during the processes of consideration this did not seem to be a problem. There is some genuine conflict there. The issue of who is pulling the strings, who is determining policies and whose interests are really at stake when one considers banning the advertising of alcohol products, are matters that have been raised elsewhere. That is something that the honourable member for Menzies might like to discuss in his own party room. </PARA>
<PARA> I also say to the honourable member for Menzies that there is a need to overhaul the law in a number of ways. As a Queen's Counsel, he ought to know that and he ought to know also that there are many lawyers in this Parliament and that they generally tend to be very conservative about law reform. Not the least conservative are those in the Opposition who go around preaching these views until it comes to the crunch of actually changing some of the techniques. Honourable members should look at the proposal that we consider scrapping committal hearings. Why do we not get down to the crunch and start making some recommendations? If we did, conservative lawyers opposite would come right out of the woodwork to oppose such a measure because genuine law reform which actually brings the law a bit closer to ordinary people is not very high on the agenda. As the recent report says, justice delayed is justice denied. It is very interesting to see the long heritage of conservatism in the field of law reform, particularly from those on the other side of the House who have had so much time and opportunity to do something about these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I have wandered a bit from the specific points that I intended to talk about in relation to the Bill but I was drawn into debating the points that the honourable member for Menzies made. I repeat that, certainly from my point of view, we on the Government side welcome the fact that the Opposition supports the legislation and is not again going down the road of opposition for the sake of opposition. We all welcome the United Nations Convention and the cooperative approach of all countries to it. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following on from the comments of the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), I was particularly interested in the latter portions of his address to the House this evening and some of the comments which he made in relation to the decriminalisation of certain drugs. I paid particular attention to his comments that around the world there is no evidence that, by making the taking of drugs illegal, one actually stops people participating in drug taking. By making drugs illegal one will not stop people participating in drug taking. But if we follow the argument that the honourable member for Burke has put-that, because there is no evidence anywhere in the world that people are discouraged from taking drugs by making the taking of drugs illegal, it is therefore worthwhile making it legal-we can apply that argument to virtually every crime that we have on the statute books today. We could say that by making, say, murder illegal we have not stopped murders occurring in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The argument that was extended by the honourable member for Burke was that, because it is illegal to take drugs in countries around the world but people are still taking drugs, therefore it is a good argument to get rid of the illegal aspects of the taking of drugs and make them legal. I am afraid that that argument does not hold a lot of sense or logic for me. Indeed, if one looks around the world at countries which have tried to decriminalise or legitimate the use of drugs, one will find that that has not solved the problem. No matter where one looks, one finds that if drugs are decriminalised there is still an illegal element, a criminal element, in the sale and distribution of drugs. One finds that rather than drug participation decreasing it actually gets worse. </PARA>
<PARA> People such as the honourable member for Burke who say that if we decriminalise drugs tomorrow we will reduce the problem, get rid of the criminal aspect, are really not at all realistic. They are certainly not very practical. They look at the argument from one side only and do not consider the fact that in countries that have experimented with the decriminalisation of various drugs, there has been no beneficial effect whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also quite a nonsense for people to say that because it is legal to drink alcohol, it should be reasonable to expect it to be legal to take drugs. Honourable members on this side of the House would be very much aware of the fact that in this country it is illegal to consume in excess of a certain amount of alcohol. If one does consume in excess of a certain amount of alcohol and gets caught, one is brought before the law and punished in a proper and due manner. I am bringing to the attention of members of this House the fact that a certain partaking of alcohol is illegal, so it is not correct to say that because alcohol is legal drugs should be legal. Alcohol consumption in excess of a prescribed amount is illegal. The argument put forward is a complete and utter nonsense. If one were to look at the deleterious effects that drug taking has on the human body and on the mind one would agree that it is a far more dangerous and far less socially acceptable activity than are the normal social drinking habits that most Australians engage in in the course of their daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Burke unreasonable, unrealistic and indeed quite a nonsense. It is simply not good enough to say that because in countries where drugs have been made illegal drugs are still being taken, this is evidence that we should not continue to make drugs illegal. It is a nonsense. It is also a nonsense to say that because alcohol is legal in this country we should also make drugs legal. This problem concerns millions of Australians. The matter before the House tonight goes very much to the heart and mind of the ordinary Australian. It is a problem which has got worse over the years and it will continue to get worse unless we are prepared to have legislation such as the Bill we have before the House tonight. It will get worse unless we, as a society, are prepared to tackle this issue in a more serious fashion. It will get worse unless we, as a government and as a society, are prepared to put more resources towards overcoming the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wants to see how bad drugs in Australia can get one has only to travel to countries such as the United States of America, where the drug problem is really getting out of hand. It is taking over the lives of many very good young Americans. It is taking up a great deal of America's crime fighting resources. It is taking up the resources of the courts and the legal system. The problem in the United States is really quite alarming. It is getting worse and it is an indicator of what can happen here in Australia unless we are prepared to address the matter in a proper, responsible fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does address some matters which honourable members on this side of the House believe need to be addressed. Many Bills such as this need to be introduced into the Parliament before we can properly overcome all of the deficiencies in our legal system. Two or three years ago I had a far more active role in matters pertaining to drugs. At the time there were a number of loopholes in our legal system. The Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) would possibly remember the Tailon case, which involved, I think, a Canadian person transiting through Australia on his way to Canada. He was caught having in his possession some drugs, I think cocaine, in a video unit. The law said that because he was in transit he was not theoretically in Australia; therefore the law enforcement agencies in Australia were not able to apprehend him despite the fact that it was known that he was in possession of a substantial quantity of these drugs. Those sorts of loopholes are evidence of the fact that we have many problems to overcome. I know the Attorney-General has done some work to try to overcome them in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> We have many loopholes in our system today. One can become quite alarmed when looking at the laws that differ between the States. From State to State, laws that relate to drug crimes differ quite substantially. In fact, people who engage in the selling and distribution of drugs may find it easier to live in a particular State simply because the laws in that State are more lenient or make apprehension more difficult. If one is apprehended the penalties that apply may be much less in a particular State in Australia. So the argument could be put-and I believe quite reasonably-that there is a need for more uniform laws around Australia. We should get the States to cooperate so that there is no difference, from one State to the other, in terms of the law's application to those people who try to break our drug codes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also some deficiencies in the legal weapons we give some of our law enforcement officers. Three or four years ago I remember raising in the House the fact that argentine ant inspectors theoretically had more powers than officers of the National Crime Authority in the course of investigating a suspected drug crime. In fact, at the time an argentine ant inspector could march into anybody's house or premises and carry out an inspection if he or she had reasonable grounds to suspect that argentine ants were on the premises. At the time, National Crime Authority drug agents were not able to enter premises if they had reasonable grounds to suspect that somebody in those premises may have been in possession of drugs. These sorts of differences highlight the fact that those who are given the task of capturing people who engage in the drug business feel very frustrated because sometimes they do not have the necessary legal powers to carry out the job in the manner in which they see fit. Many people on this side of the House would say that in order to overcome the problem I have just highlighted we may have to go a little bit too far and be a little too draconian. I raise the matter not seriously believing it can be addressed tonight or in the near future but to highlight to the House the frustrations and difficulties many people who are given the task of carrying out law enforcement in this country have to face. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other improvements in recent years-it has come from the Attorney- General, who is sitting opposite-has been in the telephone tapping power. This has been a welcome and useful tool that our law enforcement agents have had to try to capture people engaged in the business of selling and distributing drugs. Telephones are a means of communication which people engaged in this business have in the past believed to be a fairly secure means of communication. This power has been a very useful weapon in catching these people. </PARA>
<PARA> I, like the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), have been disturbed by recent arguments put forward by senior Commonwealth officers that indicate that we should decriminalise some drugs. The honourable member for Menzies mentioned the Director of Public Prosecutions. The comments made by him in a recent conference draw concern not only from me and the honourable member for Menzies but from many reasonable Australians simply because here we have a senior Commonwealth legal officer who has, according to newspaper reports, been espousing the decriminalising of a number of drugs. This not only causes confusion and alarm but also places pressure on the Government to make a clear and definite statement about its opinions in this area. I believe that there is a need for the Government to show true leadership in this matter and for the Attorney-General to give his views on this point tonight. I do not think it is right or proper that comments such as those made by the Director of Public Prosecutions should be allowed to go without some sort of clarifying statement from the Attorney-General. We look forward to those comments. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that many people who engage in this debate about legalisation of drugs often have not had to work at the coalface of the drug industry. They are often the people who talk on the cocktail circuit. It is a trendy, pseudo-intellectual subject and a person's alleged superior intellect can be established simply by discussing something that is controversial, radical and somewhat different. Those people, whom we hear every couple of weeks on television and talkback radio shows, espouse the argument that we should decriminalise drugs without really understanding what they are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, in my early parliamentary career I had an opportunity over a period of about two years to talk to a lot of people who work at the coalface of the drug problem in this country. I found that, almost to a man, those people who work there urged us not to get into the business of decriminalising drugs. I often asked the question, `Do you think we should decriminalise drugs?', and they said, `No, definitely not; it would only make the situation worse'. I believe that the views of those people who work at the coalface should be taken into consideration. The people who often espouse the decriminalisation of these drugs have very rarely had any contact with the problem at the coalface. I therefore do not believe that we should give any credibility to their views because they really do not know what they are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that those who say we should decriminalise drugs are wrong. By decriminalising drugs, we would introduce into our society another vice that we cannot live with, do not need and could not handle. Society has enough vice problems with which to deal at the moment. Those problems are difficult enough to deal with now. It would make it almost impossible for parents throughout Australia and for people in positions of responsibility to try to persuade young Australians that it was wrong to take drugs if those young Australians were able to say, `It is legal to take drugs, therefore the Government must think that it is all right, therefore society must think that it is all right. Because of those things, we will take those drugs'. </PARA>
<PARA> Society and governments must show some leadership. They must set an example and I believe that the best way to set an example, to show how society reacts to something, to show what a society thinks of something, is to show people that we reject it by making it illegal. That course of action helps the task of many parents in this country who are trying to control their children as they grow up. It also helps to control people in the broader sections of our society because, without that sort of legal backup, it is very difficult for authorities to implement proper and decent standards in our society. If people want to talk about solving the drug problem, there are ways to do it. They are long term rather than short overnight cures, but there are ways to overcome the problem. I believe that Australia does not use the facility of education properly. We have some very good education programs which are still not properly utilised in our schools and various community groups. I have been involved with the life education centres which were set up by the Reverend Ted Noffs at the Wayside Chapel some years ago. Life education centres are very useful tools to help educate young people in our schools. However, they are not the complete answer to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> This year I visited the United States of America where I saw a very successful scheme called DARE, which was originally established by the Los Angeles Police Department. I believe that if life education centres were complemented with the DARE program, we would probably have the best education program available in the world today. Proper education of our young people will help to reduce the drug problem in Australia in the long term. The energies and efforts that are put into the arguments as to why we should decriminalise drugs would be better directed towards this argument. If all those people who sat around at cocktail parties directed their energies and efforts to this problem perhaps by raising some money and gaining community and government support for more resources towards the education of our young people in relation to the dangers and problems of drugs, then those people would do the world a great deal of good. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we must increase our efforts. We must coordinate our law enforcement bodies throughout Australia. So many law enforcement bodies have a role to play in the detection of drug problems and drug trafficking, but they are not properly coordinated. I have seen examples where three or four officers from different drug enforcement agencies have all been involved in the one case but have not communicated properly with each other. As a result, the very limited resources of governments are wasted. We must have better intelligence. I commend Mr Newman, I think it was, who in the Fraser Government was the Minister for Administrative Services and who set up Australian Federal Police officers in some of these drug capitals around the world to feed back advanced intelligence to Australia in order to warn us of possible drug shipments into this country. Those people have been very useful indeed and have helped to deal very effectively with drug trafficking from those countries. We must use more methods like that. </PARA>
<PARA> We must become more involved in the world's cooperative effort to reduce drug trafficking. We were involved with 12 other nations in the crop replacement program in Thailand. That is a good program which will be slow to get going, but it will have some long term benefits. We must be prepared to do more in this country about extraditions so that, when possible, we can cooperate with our colleagues around the world in capturing people and sending them home or bringing them back to our country when they participate in drug trafficking. If we are prepared to do those things and take a long view of the solution to the drug problem, then I believe that in 10, 15 or 20 years time we will actually come to grips with the problem and start to reduce it. However, decriminalising drugs will only make the problem worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a wonderful, simple world it must be in the electorate of Gilmore. We have heard some of the most extraordinary propositions that I can recall being expressed in this chamber. It was proposed that, by an edict of this Parliament, we will somehow affect the behaviour of people to such an extent that we will eliminate a problem that most people in our community regard as one of the most singularly pressing issues of our age. I do not accept that analysis and I do not think it is only the cocktail set who would also disagree with it. I fear that the reservations about the kinds of simplistic propositions put forward by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) are shared by people who would not normally be thought of as members of the cocktail set cognoscenti.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They include, for example, the Police Commissioner of New South Wales, Mr Avery, who has expressed real concern as to whether or not we should look at amending our social policy with respect to how we respond to the question of drugs in our society. They include the Deputy Commissioner of the Victoria Police, Mr Delianis, and Mr Justice Fox, and I will return to his comments shortly. They include Senator Peter Baume, the colleague in the Senate of the honourable member for Gilmore, and the whole membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which reported to both the House of Representatives and the Senate earlier this year and was chaired by the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland). I will refer to that detailed report shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this is not an issue upon which we would be wise to rely on shibboleths or simple assertions of propositions that are undeniably false. The propositions put forward by the honourable member for Gilmore were undeniably false. (Quorum formed) Undeniably true it is that the present policy that has been in operation in Australia has failed by way of prescription of legal norms to staunch the use of illegal drugs in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the specifics of the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill. I raise no objections to it and recognise the merits of most of the proposals in the Bill in terms of making sure that the procedures that exist in Australia to control the domestic trafficking of drugs and to prohibit it are extended, so that it is impossible to slide outside their ambit by engaging in conduct in other countries. The measures included in the Bill will be of considerable value in terms of making arrangements for the prosecution of those who are involved in overseas transactions in relation to drugs and making certain that we are not without the legal means to reach out to Australian subjects, even those who are out of the country, who are engaged in trafficking. To that extent, I welcome the initiatives in the Bill, but I also want to express some serious concerns about the schedule that is attached to the Bill because I do not believe that either on constitutional grounds or as a matter of necessity that schedule should exist. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise some concerns about the schedule because I believe that it presages, it leads to, the likely ratification in due course of the third United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. That is a matter of concern because it would seem to me to rule out options which both sides of the House say should at least be considered. It is premature for anybody in the Parliament to say that it is time to abandon the policing methods that we have applied in the past and move to an entirely new model, yet we are being consistently challenged to look at our practices and approaches by people who are entirely responsible in the field of policing and in the field of treatment and control of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also being challenged to think about these issues by our members. Some members have taken a very bold position in relation to this issue. For example, Senator Peter Baume has come forward and led a public debate arguing that a wide variety of drugs that are presently illegal in our society should be made freely available. That is not a view that yet commends itself to me, but certainly it seems that we need to do more than have a knee-jerk response to some of these issues and that the very real options that we are being asked to consider by responsible leaders in the law area require some substantive response. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the schedule to the Bill provide some concern to a number of people who are in expert positions to comment in relation to this area? The first reason is that the schedule provides that each state party, subject to its constitutional principles and basic concepts of its legal system, shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the possession, purchase or cultivation of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for personal consumption, contrary to the provisions of the 1961 convention. On its face, that would seem to exclude the possibility of there being any consideration subsequently in Australia-without breach of our international obligations, if this is adopted-of a different response, a response where, for example, it might be permitted to have personal possession and use of, say, small amounts of marijuana. </PARA>
<PARA> The complexity of the issue is compounded by the fact that the convention deals with marijuana as a narcotic drug and treats it in the same manner as a range of other drugs which we now commonly regard as of a greater degree of addictive or dangerous quality. For example, we find in the list of narcotic drugs in schedule 2 annexed to the Bill drugs such as benzethidine cocaine and dihydromorphine and various other drugs which are obviously very potent, as well as cannabis. That obviously presents us with some difficulty if we are looking at this from society's point of view because there is no doubt that, although it is not a widely held view, there is a substantial body of opinion in our society that holds a view that possession of a small amount of cannabis should not be treated in the same way as possession of other drugs. Again, this is not a matter upon which one needs to hold any concluded view, but it is no doubt the point-and surveys show it-that many Australians have used cannabis and that there is some degree of hypocrisy. What the report entitled Drugs, Crime and Society by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority puts forward is, in a sense, a tacit program of decriminalisation by neglect, as it were. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the convention is that it does not permit us to look at the possible options that many commentators raise. For example, the Police Commissioner in New South Wales and the Deputy Police Commissioner in Victoria have both said that the policing cost of making narcotic drugs illegal is a cost which impacts on the force, in terms of both corruption and the social cost to many in society, to a degree such that we should consider the alternatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise tonight because a constituent of mine has drawn my attention to a matter of considerable inconvenience caused to him by a lack of cooperation between the National Acoustics Laboratory and a major public hospital. I raise this in the adjournment debate in the hope that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) will review what is clearly an unsatisfactory arrangement. My constituent must wear a hearing aid because of a war service disability. He is still working, and this makes the use of a hearing aid of vital importance to him in his working environment. On 20 October this year his hearing was tested at Concord Repatriation General Hospital, where the audiobiologist advised that a new and more powerful hearing aid was needed. The audiobiologist telephoned the National Acoustics Laboratory at Chatswood to make arrangements for the supply of a new aid, and was told that my constituent would have to be re-tested by its own staff. However, he was told that, due to staff shortages, this could not be done for at least six months. The Concord audiobiologist offered to send his test results to the National Acoustics Laboratory in order to reduce the six months delay, but was informed that his tests were not acceptable to the laboratory and that re-testing by its own staff was necessary. The Concord audiobiologist admitted to my constituent that he has encountered this difficulty before and that he has, unsuccessfully, written to the Minister pointing to the delays and inconvenience which this double testing requirement is imposing on its patients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the shortage of staff at the National Acoustics Laboratory was of a short-term nature, I could be tolerant of circumstances which might be causing a temporary blow-out of its waiting lists. But the staff shortages are apparently of a long-standing nature, and a long waiting list is the rule rather than the exception. Under these circumstances I would have thought that the National Acoustics Laboratory would have welcomed revised testing arrangements which took the pressure off its own resources, reduced its waiting lists, and provided a more acceptable service to the public. If there is a serious shortage of audiobiologists, or the National Acoustics Laboratory is having difficulty in attracting their employment, why are we persevering with a system which is forcing patients to be tested twice? Surely the circumstances cry out for a little bit of commonsense, where the laboratory accepts the test results of approved or accredited audiobiologists in other institutions or practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be happy to provide the Minister with the name and address of my constituent, and to do so in the hope that his community action in bringing this matter to my attention will assist those people with hearing defects who are presently being inconvenienced by long and unnecessary delays in having their hearing tested by the National Acoustics Laboratory. My constituent has a disability caused by war service. One would have hoped that this Government would, as any government should, take that into account and that we would have a more sensible approach to what is obviously a matter of great importance to this constituent. It is of great importance because his very livelihood depends upon his being able to hear and to respond in his dealings with his clients. But what we have is a bureaucratic mess which has been drawn to the attention of the Minister by those people working in his own Department. From what I hear of it, the Minister, as is not unusual for this Minister, has taken absolutely no notice whatsoever. The situation simply is not good enough and something should be done about it, not just at some time in the future but immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this last week of the Queensland State election campaign, it is apparent that the National Party has suddenly come into a great deal of money. It is widely understood that the National Party will practically buy out the Courier-Mail advertising space in the last couple of days of this week. This in itself will cost nearly a quarter of a million dollars and is in addition to the $3.2m that the National Party is currently spending on television and radio advertising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A principal source of this sudden abundance of National Party funds is Kevin Will Seymour, who has funded the National Party for its election campaign in return for the Party's support for him in the recent allocation of major projects totalling $191m. Mr Seymour's relationship with the National Party is recorded in some detail in the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. Seymour is a property developer and friend of Russ Hinze. Hinze had Seymour appointed as a member of the Queensland Trotting Board, deputy chairman of the Queensland Harness Racing Board, one of the three trustees of Brisbane's Albion Park raceway, and finally as chairman of the Albion Park trotting club. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fitzgerald report records the details of various financial transactions between Kevin Seymour and Russell Hinze from December 1985 until March 1988. Yet, despite the revelations since the Fitzgerald report, the National Party had engaged in three major land deals involving Mr Seymour and totalling $191m. The first is Admiralty Wharf. This prime commercial site in the heart of Brisbane's central business district was sold to Seymour Land two years ago for an astonishingly--(Quorum formed) Seymour bought the land two years ago for $4m. This land is now being negotiated for sale with the Japanese at a price of approximately $30m. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Shute Harbour development. On 31 October 1989, one week after the announcement of the 2 December election, the Queensland Cabinet decided to allocate to Mr Seymour yet another major development project to the tune of $135m. That happened even though another developer had spent 18 months trying to get approval for that development and even though Seymour did not submit an environmental impact statement, as is warranted under local authority planning guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with land for a Roma Street office block. A week after the Shute Harbour decision, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Cooper, suddenly decided to purchase land for a central business district office block from Mr Seymour for a price of $52m. Property market analysts were astounded at the price. Mr Seymour paid only $30m for the block 18 months ago. Are we to believe that the value of this land had increased by 75 per cent? The National Party cannot justify this decision. First, there is a surplus of Public Service office space in Brisbane, with two major service buildings-Mineral House and Education House-already having vacant floors. </PARA>
<PARA> What these dealings mean is that not only is the Queensland National Party totally corrupt but also it is without morals, principles or any fibre whatsoever. A second reason the National Party Government cannot justify the decision is that the Seymour block of land at Roma Street is approximately one kilometre from the existing, well-established Public Service precinct. Third, the Government, through Suncorp Insurance, already owns a significant block of land-the former Trittons site-which is closer to the Public Service precinct. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to say that Kevin Seymour's relationship with Russ Hinze, the $26m-plus profit he stands to make out of the sale of Admiralty Wharf and the sudden decisions during the lead-up to the election to award him the Shute Harbour development and to purchase his Roma Street office block land raise fundamental questions in relation to the propriety not only of the relationship but also of the Queensland Government. The election on Saturday is not just about party politics; it is about whether Queensland will go forward with a bit of integrity and decency or whether it will stay in the cave, as it has for the last 32 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Saturday the people of South Australia were asked to send a message to Canberra, and they did just that, loud and clear. They are fed up with this Government's high interest rate policy. Today in debate the Government sought comfort from the fact that, whilst there was a swing away from Labor, nevertheless it appears to have won the election. Let me set the record straight. The election result does not reflect the strength of feeling of the South Australian people. The fact that we may not have won the election itself is more a quirk of the electoral boundaries than a lack of support for the Liberal Party. The final figures will show a vote for the Liberal and National parties of around 52 per cent, and yet we have won only 23 seats. In 1985 the Australian Labor Party received around 53 per cent and won 29 seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The undeniable fact is that the people reject this Government's economic policies and its inability to deal with the basic problems confronting the nation. South Australia has given the thumbs down to the Hawke Government. Whilst many overseas countries are enjoying quite rapid rates of growth and are tailoring their economic policies to cope with that growth, our Treasurer (Mr Keating) is trying to choke off our growth while leaving his other hopelessly outdated policies in place. Why is growth good for overseas nations but bad for Australia? Of course it is not, but the Labor Government cannot bring itself to relax the rigid controls on our economy to allow it to cope with more rapid growth without generating higher inflation or balance of payment problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Garnaut got it right in highlighting the need to deregulate, internationalise our economy and achieve a level playing field. We have already lost valuable time and as a result are losing our competitive edge. The rapid rate of innovation and change in our major competitor nations is leaving us in Australia for dead. We cannot afford to wait any longer. I acknowledge that the Government started to make the changes required by floating the Australian dollar and freeing up the banking sector, but then it dropped the ball. For example, how on earth can Australia hope to compete internationally when our waterfront is more suited to clippers than container ships? We will get nowhere until we have a basic restructuring of the waterfront, including the introduction of truly competitive stevedoring companies with their own work force. How can Australia compete internationally when we have so many of our resources tied up in Government-run enterprises, protected from competition and adding to our basic costs of production?</PARA>
<PARA> Nearly every Western country in the world has seen the benefit of transferring public sector activities into the private sector. The results have been increased competition and efficiency with lower prices, wider choice and better services for consumers, and greater rewards and job satisfaction for employees. The economy also benefits through higher returns on the capital employed in the privatised industry. The United Kingdom led the charge, and almost everybody is following-Canada, Japan, New Zealand, even the Soviet Union, but not the Hawke Government. Privatisation has revolutionised Britain, resulting in less regulation, lower cost services and greater innovation. Since British Telecom has been privatised its profits have risen and the service improved. A competitor has been established and the consumer is the great beneficiary in the form of lower costs, today even to the extent of being offered free mobile phones. The communications revolution is booming in the deregulated economies of the world. While overseas business is continually confronted by and is adapting to these new technological advances, we bumble along in our heavily regulated and controlled cocoon. </PARA>
<PARA> The wages accord is yet another example of the Government's outdated thinking. Everyone knows that we have to have greater flexibility and responsibility in our wages system. The Business Council of Australia says we can have efficiency gains of up to 25 per cent if we move to enterprise-based industrial relations, but not the Hawke Government. It clings like grim death to its accord. The electors of South Australia called for lower interest rates which can be achieved only with new economic policies and micro-economic reform. The call has fallen on deaf ears with this Government, but the electors will not give up. They cannot afford to give up, and they will get their way at the forthcoming Federal election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this month I presented to the Parliament a petition signed by some hundreds of residents of the Bendigo area calling on the Government to get behind the One World campaign. This evening I want to speak briefly about the importance of the One World campaign. I fully support the campaign. Earlier this year in the Parliament I spoke at some length on world population growth and sustainable development. Our world presently faces serious environmental, demographic and economic pressures. I think there is a pressing need to ensure that economic growth in the future is environmentally sustainable and that the income gap between the rich countries and the poor countries is reduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the One World campaign is an important campaign and a very timely campaign. I think it is important to inform the Parliament of the main goals of that campaign. The One World campaign has two main goals: firstly, to increase our understanding of the global crisis, how it is linked and what needs to be done; and, secondly, to commit Australian political parties to the strategies needed to save the world, knowing that these strategies are supported by the Australian community. The One World campaign has four items on its agenda. Campaign agenda item No. 1 is the environment. One World campaigners call for the Government to respond to the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. They say that a commitment is needed from government to make sustainable development central to all planning and activities and to work for a fairer economic structure internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> The second campaign agenda item concerns foreign aid-a matter on which I have very strongly held views. One World campaigners urge politicians to increase Australian aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national product by 1992 and to direct more aid to the poorest people becoming self-sufficient. Campaign agenda item No. 3 concerns human rights. One World campaigners seek clear government policy on the relationship between aid and human rights. Campaign agenda item No. 4 regards and concerns reduced military spending. One World campaigners call for a one per cent cut in military spending, with the savings to be allocated to overseas aid. As I say, I support the goals of the One World campaign. I believe that the campaign agenda items are realistic and achievable. I encourage individuals who feel strongly about these issues to make changes in their own life to express concern for the future of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to talk about Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. I would just like to say that I heard a member of the Government this evening speak about Queensland. I am interested that honourable members hear this because the whole of Australia wants to go to Queensland. It is an interesting, progressive State. When I talk of airports, I mention that Queensland has four international airports. The Australian Customs Service operates in three of them. Coolangatta Airport is the only international airport without this service. Just fancy a State of Australia with four international airports! Honourable members should look at the planning that Queensland has done with a conservative government over the years to attract four international airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet, we had a member come in here tonight condemning the conservative Government because it has built up a State of Australia, it has created employment and it has created investment in Australia. Queensland is the leading State in Australia. Mind you, on Saturday honourable members will find that the people of Queensland will think again. They will say, `Righto, we will invest in the party or the parties that will give us the better deal'. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about Kingsford-Smith Airport. It is some time since this matter has been raised in the House to any degree because economic issues have been the matters that we have been attacking the Government on, and rightly so. We can talk about a number of issues in this country at the moment. But let me come back to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport because it is some months since the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) said anything regarding this airport. We know that an environmental study is under way concerning it. But when will this environmental study end? When will the Minister come into this House and tell us that there is some progress being made concerning an extra runway at Sydney Airport? It is of vital concern. I know, Mr Speaker, that the two of us, as part of a delegation, visited British Aerospace in northern England some time ago. You, Mr Speaker, were vitally concerned, as we all were, about getting a quieter type of aircraft to come into Sydney Airport. We would like to do this and we support you in it because we think it is very important if ever the curfew is lifted. The point is that something must be done with Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. With the pilots strike today-and I call it a strike--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There might not be a pilots strike in the eyes of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) but there is in the eyes of the citizens of Australia. We are very concerned about it. Delays are still taking place at airports. Overseas tourists look upon Sydney as the central entry airport in Australia. This is the point of entry to which they wish to come. If we want to attract money to this country we cannot do it better than by attracting tourists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is standing resolutely still waiting for the next election before doing something definite about Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. If there is a half Senate election and this Parliament meets until next November, which is possible, will it be that the people of this country, particularly those in New South Wales who depend on intra- state travel, the country councils which are so concerned and the interstate people who are travelling into Sydney who are so concerned with the delays, not to mention the airline companies themselves, are not entitled to know what is going to happen? This issue is not dead and it will never be dead while some of us are so concerned about it. We will continue to raise it in this House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Direct marketing is one of the most effective means of retailing in modern society. It is a very useful method of purchase for those who live in isolated areas, those who are housebound, those who are handicapped and those who are elderly. Direct marketing has become a very important means of retailing through television, the post and radio. We have ongoing promotions of people having this direct contact from the retailer to the consumer without going through the normal retail house. It has resulted in our being inundated with unsolicited mail to the point that it has now spread not only to mail but also to facsimile messages and I was pleased that the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) acted today to try to do something about fax machines being clogged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This technique is used not only in the direct marketing of merchandise; it is used also by charities and all sorts of groups trying to raise money. It has led also to a new enterprise, and that is list brokering. The direct marketing directory of 1989 which is put out by the Direct Marketing Association includes all sorts of groups in the list brokering side. For instance, one group is called Drake List Management and another Dun and Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd. Surprisingly, another group is called Logos Foundation. Another is called Logos List Services. Recently I wrote to all of these groups asking that they please advise as to their activities because children of nine years of age are receiving lottery tickets, and material coming from Madam Daudet in the United States is getting children to sign oaths of secrecy and then, for $30, sending them her Golden Wave which will change their love life and their riches. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone in this country is selling those lists of children, because children of 10 and 11 years of age are getting these letters. I have some with me which I will not table because I will be sending them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They are coming from somewhere and I have appealed to the list brokers to set some new standards. I looked up the material published by the Logos Foundation the other day, and there is nothing on its material which has been circulated throughout Queensland in recent weeks to say that, if anyone subscribes to the letter this Foundation is asking them to, his name shall be used and his name and address shall be sold. I have spoken to some of the charity heads, asking them to desist from sending nine-year-old children art union and lottery tickets. But I think we need to call upon the industry to set its own standards. No person should have his name or address sold without prior consent or approval and no child should be targeted or put on these lists without parental consent. I do not know whether the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) would agree with that, but I would suggest that most members of this Parliament would say, `We have to put an end to the targeting of children'. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to do something to upgrade and protect the rights of individuals, the rights of privacy. Any member of parliament and any citizen will know that when one goes to one's mail box it is clogged up with mail that one did not ask for. In many instances it is because one's name has been sold without one's permission. This will be the marketing method of the future. But if that is the case, we need rules for the future. We need the Logos Foundation-I did not know it was involved in this-the Logos List Services and all these many other listed on page seven of this directory and the hundreds of others that are listed that are buying and collecting lists of people, to have some tough standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I met with Greg Baker, the general head of Australian Direct Marketing, the other day in the Parliament. That company is going to bring down some new rules. But that will only work if we as a parliament and the other legislatures throughout this nation are also prepared to enforce the rules, if necessary, by legislation. We have to ensure that list brokers are sticking to standards. We have to ensure that those who collect the names of people get their permission. We have to ensure that we do something about the Madam Daudets and all these others who come out of New Jersey and California who are targeting Australians and asking them to send money to phoney lotteries. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that this is the sort of thing that needs a full and thorough inquiry. It is the sort of thing that should be referred eventually to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to try to come up with what we would see as uniform laws and protection. In the meantime, I appeal to those who are involved-the list brokers and the direct marketing merchandisers-to set some standards, to stop targeting children and to ensure that they have obtained the prior permission of the people whose names are listed. I suppose it is fair play that, if people write away for some project, they should expect some like product coming back to them. But it is wrong, it is immoral and it is insidious that kids of nine, 10 and 11 are receiving art union tickets, their names are being listed and their addresses are being sold. This Parliament needs to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to pay tribute to a constituent of mine who died in Melbourne last Friday, the late Sir Norman Coles, who was a well-known public figure. Although well-known, he was very much an unassuming and quiet Australian. He was, and had been, Chairman and Managing Director of G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd, which is now known as Coles Myer-a great Australian institution, company and organisation. But the late Sir Norman was very much a people's person; he was a man in touch with the needs of ordinary, average people in Australia, and that came through in his private and public life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was a personal man and, as I have said, he was very much a private man. His family was fundamental and dear to him, and he was not one to seek publicity or fame in spite of the important position he held in Australian society. In fact, he was modest and humble. When he was Chairman of that company I can remember one day shopping in Coles in Bourke Street and there was Sir Norman shopping and buying something at the counter. He had not sent his secretary or asked for a discount; he was just a man at a counter in the store and to me that sums him up. </PARA>
<PARA> The organisation which he headed for a while provided merchandise and goods for all Australians. It made a great contribution, and it continues to do so, towards making goods available to everybody at the lowest prices possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Norman was a man of standards; he was a man of integrity in private and in business. I think the standards that he adopted have been abandoned by some in the Australian business community today. I extend my sympathy to Lady Coles, his widow, his son, Bruce Coles, and his daughter, Pam Learmonth, and their children who, of course, are his grandchildren. Sir Norman Coles made a great contribution to Australian retailing and to Australian society. He was a quiet Australian but a great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) An outline of the implementation of access and equity principles within the Attorney-General's Department is included in the portfolio Access and Equity Plan published by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Copies of the booklet are available from either that Office or the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Bankruptcy forms are not presently available in languages other than English. Work is proceeding on standardising the Official Receiver's Information Sheet and the Bankruptcy Warning Notice, so that they can be translated into community languages.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) All Official Receiver's Offices have arrangements with the Telephone Interpreter Service to provide assistance to persons who require it. The cost of interpreter assistance is an expense incurred in the administration of the person's bankrupt estate and as such is paid out of his or her assets. However, where there is no money in the estate, the cost of interpreter assistance is paid by the Official Receiver out of general administration funds. As an access and equity initiative, Official Receiver's Offices have installed dual headset or loud speaker phone facilities in interview areas to enable the use of telephone interpreter services. It is not possible to provide details of the costs of this.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 does not permit plaintiff election of a jury in suits before the Federal Court. Section 39 of the Act provides that in every suit in the Court, unless the Court or a Judge otherwise orders, the trial shall be by a Judge without a jury. Section 40 of the Act enables the Court or a Judge, in any suit in which the ends of justice appear to render it expedient to do so, to direct the trial with a jury of the suit or of an issue of fact. A direction for a trial with a jury has not been made in any matter relevant to the Trade Practices Act by the Federal Court in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Federal Court has held, in Insurance Commissioner v. Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd (1982) 65 FLR 172, that before a direction is made for a trial with a jury, some substantial reason must be shown for a departure from the normal method of trial in the Federal Court of trial by a Judge without a jury.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon notice, on 31 October 1989:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Medical Letter of 28 September 1989 that his Department is pressing for the cessation of Medicare rebates for pathology and radiology services rendered by general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is such a course of action being considered.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2996" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TANGNEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are no plans to make any changes to the existing arrangements covering the provision of pathology services by general practitioners. Action is to be taken, however, to impose controls on the provision of diagnostic imaging services. These services cover diagnostic radiology, CT scanning, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear scanning.</PARA>
<PARA> The control measures, which have been recommended by a Department Diagnostic Imaging Services Review, include the proposed introduction of an ``arms length'' referral arrangement in the provision of imaging services. This would be effected by specifying that Medicare benefits are generally not payable for these services unless they have been requested by another practitioner who has no direct financial interest in the ordering of those services.</PARA>
<PARA> I approved the establishment of the Review in 1987 because of concern about the rate of growth in the utilisation of diagnostic imaging services and because it was claimed, particularly by the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists, that much of this growth could be attributed to the activities of certain medical entrepreneurs. These practitioners purchased imaging equipment with a view to maximising income.</PARA>
<PARA> The measures recommended by the Review seek to ensure that there is a financial distance between the providers and requesters of diagnostic imaging services. In this regard, they address the relationship which is expected between practitioners providing services and referring practitioners, technicians (e.g. radiographers), and the owners of imaging equipment and medical centres. They also call for compliance with State licensing laws and specify action that should be taken in respect of any breaches. In essence, the control measures seek to impose restrictions similar to those which have applied to pathology services for some time.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted, however, that the Review recognised that strict referral arrangements posed potential problems in remote areas. Accordingly, to ensure that access to necessary services would not be denied, it recommended that the proposed referral requirements not apply in remote areas where there is no other practitioner equipped or able to provide services and where visiting services, if any, cannot adequately meet the needs of the community. Although further discussions will be needed to determine exactly how this exemption should operate, the Government is committed to the implementation of the Review's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> Also excluded from the referral arrangements will be those radiology services which have historically been seen as falling within the competence of general practitioners and which have been specified in the Medicare Benefits Schedule as non-specialist services. These include X-rays of the extremities, shoulder, chest and abdomen.</PARA>
<PARA> It is regrettable that curbing the activities of the unscrupulous elements of the medical profession necessarily impacts on responsible practitioners but, as in the pathology area, the Government believes that it has an obligation to take all reasonable steps to prevent the manipulation of the benefits arrangements.</PARA>
