<TITLE>Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House, that pharmacists, in Australia, have had their very livelihood placed in jeopardy, by the totally unreasonable decisions, of the so called ``independent'' Pharmaceutical Benefits Tribunal, in drastically reducing the remuneration paid to pharmacists for dispensing of prescriptions under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these decisions, the essential primary health care functions and services provided (largely free) by pharmacists to the public, have been seriously put at risk.</PARA>
<PARA> The replacement of such services could only be fulfilled by an already overtaxed medical profession and at a financial cost that would be virtually impossible to be funded by the Government or the Community.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to, as a matter of extreme urgency, negotiate with the appointed representatives of Australian pharmacists, to ensure that an equitable financial remuneration is granted to these pharmacists for dispensing prescription under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and so protect the essential services now provided by these pharmacists to the Community.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain electors of the Division of Wannon draws to the attention of the House the following:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. In 1987/88, Australian motorists paid in the order of $6.5 billion in fuel taxes to the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. In that same year, the Federal Govenment allocated some $1.25 billion for expenditure on roads-less than 20 cents of each $1 collected from fuel taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In the past 120 years, only during the two World Wars has investment in road formation in Australia been lower, as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, than it is at present.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Since 1960, vehicle density per kilometre of Australian roads rose from 0.95 vehicles to 2.7 vehicles in 1985-a rise of 184%.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. In the same period, investment in roads as a proportion of GDP fell from 2.7% in 1960 to slightly more than 1% in 1985-a fall of 61%.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. In 1987, local government expended more on roads than either the Federal Government or the combined State Governments.</PARA>

<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1F4">Mr BRUMBY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The restless years is the fourth report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It is the result of a comprehensive, year-long inquiry conducted by a subcommittee chaired by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). The inquiry examined the factors that influence year 12 retention rates in Australia-that is, the factors which determine whether or not students stay on at school and complete year 12. In essence, the report concludes that if more young people are to realise their entitlement to a complete secondary education, governments-both Commonwealth and State-must encourage schools to improve both the relevance and quality of senior secondary education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the report's 25 recommendations are directed towards improving the educational opportunities and outcomes for all young people, the report focuses in particular on the opportunities and outcomes for young people from educationally disadvantaged groups in our community. For example, we refer particularly to students whose parents may be employed in jobs which have a low social or economic status, to students living in country areas and to students from Aboriginal or non-English speaking backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I very briefly draw the House's attention to three of the report's key recommendations: employment, education and training options for young people; basic learning in primary schools; and teacher retraining. In relation to employment, education and training opportunities for young people, the Com- mittee has recommended that the Govern- ment introduce what we term a youth guarantee, which would be provided to every young person in Australia. It would guarantee them the opportunity of participation in secondary education, an apprenticeship, a traineeship or some other form of education, training activities or employment. That is a key recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's second key recommendation relates to the role of primary schools. In this report we have said that Government should adopt a national strategy to ensure that all young people achieve proficiency in mathematical, reading and writing skills in their primary school years. In that respect we refer to the very successful basic learning in primary schools program which operated in Australia in the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> The third key recommendation relates to teacher retraining and professional development. In this report, as in our previous report entitled An Apple for the Teacher? Choice and Technology in Learning, we re- iterate that improving Australia's teaching force is an essential prerequisite to strengthening our schools. We recommend the development of a national retraining strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Many members of the subcommittee wish to speak in this debate today. Therefore, in conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation for the significant contribution to this report made by all of the subcommittee members, particularly the honourable member for Chifley, who chaired the subcommittee. They have all worked very hard on the report and I believe it is an excellent one. I place on record my thanks to the Committee secretariat for the time and effort it has put into the report, particularly the subcommittee's secretary, Grant Harrison, who has worked tirelessly. I also thank the House of Representatives duplicating section for producing copies at short notice. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, entitled The restless years-Inquiry into Year 12 retention rates, is dedicated and mainly addressed to Australian students and their parents. The subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training had the opportunity to meet with students, parents, teachers and school administrators in each State and Territory. Whilst many of these meetings were informal, much of what was said has been incorporated into and forms the basis of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee believes that every Australian has a basic right to an education to year 12. The objective of all governments-Commonwealth and State-should be to ensure that this is a real option for all young people. The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people staying on. In 1978 only 35 per cent of students stayed on to year 12 and by 1988, 58 per cent. The national goal is to have 65 per cent of students stay on to year 12 by 1992. This goal is on line to be achieved. While this increase is welcome, there is still a long way to go before the aim of year 12 for all is met. </PARA>
<PARA> Success at school too often depends on where students live, the income of their parents and what type of job they do. At a time when the level of one's education is still the best determinant of whether one gets a job and the type of job, too many young Australians are missing out. Why should young people's chances of successfully completing year 11 or 12 depend on whether they are attending a government or private school, whether they live in the western suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney, whether they live in the city or country, whether they have parents who migrated to Australia, or whether they are Aboriginal? It is towards improving the educational opportunities and providing equal opportunities for young people from these backgrounds that national attention must now be urgently directed. Renewed joint effort is needed to ensure that the momentum that has been built up is increased and better focused. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that schools must be held accountable for the educational outcomes of their students. Schools have the responsibility for educating our young Australians. They should also have accountability and should be accountable. Students and their parents should not be blamed. At a time when more young people are staying on and still more are being encouraged to do so, schools and teachers are facing new challenges from a majority of their students who are not tertiary bound. In many cases, old education policies and practices often tailored by inflexible tertiary institutions can no longer be expected to meet the demands of an increasing number of young people, whose wide range of interests and abilities I never doubted. </PARA>
<PARA> Schools must be encouraged to improve both the relevance and quality of senior secondary education. In The restless years,  the Committee identified a number of ways of improving the educational opportunities and outcomes for young people, such as providing adequate financial support for young people from low income families; introducing more programs to involve parents and the community in schools and their learning programs and to involve the schools in their community; empowering parents and developing and adopting a charter of parents' rights and responsibilities; offering a broad range of courses in years 11 and 12; developing public awareness campaigns about the value of staying on and finishing school; introducing more appropriate forms of assessment and more comprehensive records of achievement; establishing more year 11 and 12 senior secondary colleges, sometimes called senior high schools; and giving better information and counselling about course options, job opportunities and avenues for further study. </PARA>
<PARA> Some schools and school systems have already taken steps such as these to encourage more young people to complete secondary school. Much more needs to be done. The Committee urges governments to support and build on these initiatives by ensuring that a more coordinated and consistent effort is made. If governments do not act promptly, a large number of young people will continue to be denied their basic right to a complete and relevant secondary education. In this event Australia will be the poorer socially, culturally and economically. To students and parents, the challenge is now theirs to see the recommendations implemented-it is their schools; it is their education system.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I add my thanks to those expressed by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby) for the support, hard work and dedication of my fellow members of the subcommittee, which are reflected in this important report. My thanks also go to the Committee secretariat for their sustained efforts-Grant Harrison, Bob Dupree, Louise and Laura, without whom this report would not have been possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I am delighted to speak to the tabling of this report on year 12 retention rates. I would firstly like to congratulate and express my appreciation of the tireless work of the staff of the Committee and, in particular, the subcommittee's secretary, Grant Harrison. The subcommittee travelled widely and took evidence in every State and Territory in many different areas-rural and urban, rich and poor. I would especially like to congratulate two schools which we visited in the inner west of Sydney-Domremy College and St Patrick's College. Both the staff and, in particular, the students that we met made invaluable contributions to the Committee's deliberations. Those associated with these schools should justly be very proud of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue of retention rates is one of the most important in secondary education in Australia today. It is vital to the future of this country that all who want years 11 and 12 education and would benefit from it should have access to it. It is vital not only from a functional point of view in regard to training for a job or a trade but also for increasing the depth of knowledge and cultural understanding that should be present within our community. It is also vital to the individual that he or she should have access to years 11 and 12 education regardless of background, financial situation, area of residence or race. Australia has always striven to be a fair and just society with opportunity for all, and access to education is a vitally important part of this society. </PARA>
<PARA> It was clear time and time again from evidence given to the subcommittee, both formally and informally, that the single most important factor regarding whether children stay on at school is the involvement, encouragement and motivation given to them at home by their parents. Unfortunately it was also clear that, while many parents were very involved with their children's education, a large number were not. In some cases this was probably due to apathy on the part of the parents, but in many cases it was clear that parental involvement was actively discouraged by some school authorities. For example, one woman in Darwin who tried to become more involved with her child's school was put off and told that, after all, she was only a mother. Lack of information about the activities and progress of children at school, and lack of consultation with parents during the formation of education policies were complaints which were all too common. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clearly necessary not only to encourage parental involvement but also to make parents aware of both their responsibilities and their rights in regard to the education of their children. Accordingly, in this report, amongst a number of other recommendations which have been touched on by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the Committee has produced a draft charter of parents' rights and responsibilities which we hope will be adopted as a national standard. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Parents have the primary responsibility to educate their children. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Parents may be aided by governments or accredited education authorities in the education of their children but this does not usurp the primary responsibility of parents. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Parents are entitled to be consulted and involved in the formation of education policies. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Parents are entitled to be considered by school principals and teachers as equals and partners in the process of schooling. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Parents are entitled to be treated by school principals and teachers with respect, courtesy, honesty and openness. </PARA>
<PARA> (f) Parents are entitled to full and frank information about the activities and progress of their children in schools. </PARA>
<PARA> (g) Parents are entitled to hold schools accountable for their actions and outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> (h) Parents are entitled to play a greater role in the selection and appointment of principals and key teaching staff. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe this is a landmark development in secondary education. If we are able to in- crease the involvement of parents and produce better motivation of our children then Australia will be the beneficiary. I commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to speak on the tabling of this report by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled The restless years-Inquiry into Year 12 retention rates. I thank the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), for his comments. I particularly thank the Chairman of the subcommittee, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), for the great zeal, imagination and skill that he brought to his task. I am sure that my comments are supported by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), who worked with us on the subcommittee. I extend my own thanks to them for their commitment, co- operation and comradeship in the course of the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a member of the subcommittee which took evidence in a number of States during the inquiry, I am delighted with the content of the report and the relevance of its recommendations. I believe that it will be a useful addition to the body of information which already exists about teacher, parent, student and community attitudes to staying on at school for the senior high school years and offers some constructive suggestions for change. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Committee was determined that its findings should take proper account of the views of all groups of people involved, it went to considerable lengths to ensure that evidence was specifically sought from people who might not normally respond to advertisements, and consultations were often conducted in an informal manner, aimed at putting witnesses at their ease. In particular, we made a point of visiting schools to talk to students and teachers and held special public meetings with parents to ascertain their views. These ventures proved to be very successful, with the comments and opinions obtained being refreshingly frank and relevant additions to the more considered evidence received in the form of written submissions and formal public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> At one school the Committee was provided with the opportunity of speaking to a student who had decided to leave high school and ascertain his reasons for doing so. He wanted to undertake an apprenticeship the following year and was taking a job in an unrelated area of activity in the interim. School was no longer relevant to his life and his aspirations. Both the school and the Committee realised that this situation was not right. It should have been possible for such a student to pursue a course at the school which would help his transition into his chosen trade. However, another student provided the Committee with an example of delayed good sense. She had been restless and decided to leave school to take up a relatively unskilled job. It was a salutary experience for her. Realising that this would continue to be her lot without the benefit of higher education, she quickly returned to school and proceeded to tackle her studies with vigour, at the same time advising her friends of the merit of the lesson she had learned during her short time in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity of thanking two schools in my electorate for their hospitality during the inquiry. Both Girrawheen and Morley senior high schools hosted a visit of the subcommittee, the former for a discussion with teachers and students and the latter for an inspection of its alternative upper school program. Like the honourable member for Lowe, I think these schools should be congratulated on their contribution to the Committee and for the way the students, in particular, responded to our questions. Their evidence and experience contributed to the Committee's conclusion that the environment in the school was as important to senior students as was course choice and credential recognition. The importance of parental factors in encouraging students to remain at school was also recognised. I also endorse the draft charter of parents' rights and responsibilities outlined by my colleague the honourable member for Lowe. </PARA>
<PARA> Before concluding, I would like to put on record my thanks for the subcommittee's hardworking and competent secretary, Grant Harrison, who was ably assisted by Laura Gillies, Bob Dapre and Louise Carney. The latter two are no longer on the Committee. They performed their duties admirably in a competent, cooperative and amiable fashion. I think that this report will be of interest to many people in the community and trust that the Government will choose to implement the majority of its recommendations in pursuit of our national goal of increasing the number of young Australians staying on to year 12. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to speak briefly on the report by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled The restless year-Inquiry into Year 12 retention rates. Before doing so I congratulate the chairperson of the Committee, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), and the subcommittee chairperson, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), for their astute stewardship. I also thank members of the subcommittee for their valued contribution and our most supportive secretariat for the professional attentiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will confine my comments to three aspects of the report: the role of primary schools; the resource implications for State governments; and the need for the Commonwealth Government to continue to take the lead in developing national strategies for education. In chapter 6 the Committee affirms the contention that the role of primary schools in ensuring that students acquire basic skill levels is paramount, and also states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if primary schools are unable to impart basic skills and capture the interest and imagination of students from an early age the education future of young people thus affected will be severely limited. </PARA>
<PARA>In Chapter 13 the Committee acknowledges that there appear to be no clear reasons, other than historical, why quite large cost differentials exist between senior and junior secondary schools in the provision of educational services. The Committee recognised the importance of early intervention in the learning process. The very real possibility was raised by the Committee that a reallocation of resources to the earlier years of schools-years 1 to 7, my emphasis-may be more cost effective. Reports are not merely ends in themselves; they should identify future directions. Recommendations 24 and 25 of the report point the way for the Commonwealth to assume a more substantive leadership role with the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recommends that a study be sponsored into the cost implications of increasing year 12 retention rates and the nature and extent of additional resources required to provide for increased retention. The report further recommends that a major study be sponsored into the economic and social implications of achieving universal retention to year 12. It is significant to note that the Inner London Education Authority's major longitudinal study of the mid-1980s found that schooling between the school years 3 to 7 is the most significant factor in determining the future success of young people, and that schooling is a far more significant determinant of success than race, religion, socio-economic background or gender. Unfortunately, that message has not yet reached educational bureaucracies, especially when it comes to allocating the educational dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary sector of this nation's schools, government and private, is very much under-resourced when compared with other sectors of education where the elite decision making power lies. As preventative health measures are in the long term more cost effective and beneficial than curing illnesses, so too will it be proved that preventative education measures are also more cost efficient and beneficial to the nation. It is interesting to note that 40 years ago only 8 per cent of our students completed year 12; 20 years ago it was 25 per cent; and now it is almost 60 per cent. The Committee's aim of universal retention is attainable before the turn of the century. I endorse the recommendations of the Committee and commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Fin- ance and Public Administration, I present the Committee's report entitled There's no place like home-A review of an efficiency audit of the Department of Community Services and Health: Home and Community Care Program, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled is the third report of the Committee to be presented this year, and the eighth report of the Committee for this Parliament. It is perhaps fitting to follow on from the restless years and now look at the resting years as far as people's lifestyle is concerned. The report reflects the longstanding interest of the Committee and its predecessor, the Expenditure Committee, in the care of the aged. It was the two reports of the Expenditure Committee that led to the establishment of the home and community care (HACC) program. The first report-In Home or at Home: Accommodation and Care for the Aged, with which you would be most familiar, Mr Speaker-had a major impact on thinking about care for the aged. Too often people were consigned to a home when, with some support services, they could have continued to live in familiar surroundings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the report there is a quote from the Department of Community Services and Health which sums up one of the major achievements of the HACC program:</PARA>
<PARA> Assessment teams are probably proposing for nursing homes about 50 per cent of those who previously would have been recommended for nursing homes by the Department's Commonwealth medical officers. </PARA>
<PARA>Our report, There's no place like home, is a review of an efficiency audit of the program by the Auditor-General. It draws to the attention of the Parliament one of the problems faced by the Audit Office in the audit of joint programs. The auditors cannot go out and question State officials; they are forced to rely on written reports. This problem has also been commented on by the Public Accounts Committee. The Auditor-General in his response noted:</PARA>
<PARA> The history of the issue is being researched as a preliminary to exploring with State Auditors-General whether there is a role for the Commonwealth Auditor-General to play. If so, it would then be necessary to examine the resource and mandate implications. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has suggested that the Auditor-General pursue those investigations. The audit identified a number of problems with the home and community care program. It suggested:</PARA>
<PARA> After more than two years operation of the program, the Department has been unable to find details of specific service being provided, who is being serviced and to what extent. </PARA>
<PARA>Not surprisingly, the Department of Community Services and Health did not accept that statement. It suggested that the program was in the early stages of development and more recognition could have been given to the progress made with assessment and co-ordination. The Department of Community Services and Health was not alone in the criticism of the audit. There was much concern about the timing of the report. For example, the New South Wales Government said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it was a very unfortunate time to undertake an audit that was as far reaching or sweeping in its scope and at a time when the program had really only commenced. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the Queensland Government:</PARA>
<PARA> The commissioning of an efficiency audit less than two years after the national starting date of this relatively large and complex joint Commonwealth-State programme did not allow adequate time for Commonwealth-State relationships to develop and for the development and smooth functioning of networks between service providers. This was unrealistic and could only have been expected to find fault in the administrative processes of the programme. </PARA>
<PARA>There was also concern about the focus of this report. The South Australian Government acknowledged that the report has high-lighted a number of legitimate concerns with the current operations of the program, yet it was critical of the conduct of the audit as `it fails to provide a balanced view of the program from the State's perspective'. The re- port criticises the Commonwealth Depart- ment for its perceived inadequacies in ensuring the fine print of the agreement is complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the Committee was conducting the inquiry there was a working group of Commonwealth and State officials reviewing the program. The report of that review has been made available to the Committee and it appears to have addressed the problems raised in the audit report. It remains to be seen whether the problems will be overcome. A second triennial review is proposed for 1990 and the Committee has recommended another efficiency audit after the completion of the second review. However, it was the comments in the audit report about meals on wheels which generated the most interest. The audit report included a section on delivered meals. It noted that it is Meals on Wheels that has the largest voluntary component. It went on to suggest:</PARA>
<PARA> Departmental documents record that meals are one of variable quality, often poorly prepared and lack nutritional value. </PARA>
<PARA>This comment was not accepted by those organisations involved in that delivery of meals. The South Australian association said:</PARA>
<PARA> We were well aware of the unjust attack made in the audit report on meals service nationally. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tasmanian association said:</PARA>
<PARA> Any attempt to reduce the number of delivery days for any reason, economic or otherwise, would destroy a very important and distinctive component of the Meals on Wheels service. </PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland association said:</PARA>
<PARA> This association is extremely concerned at the adverse publicity generated by the press printing criticism from the report regarding the delivered meals services. This publicity has resulted in unwarranted anxiety and anger in both recipients and volunteer workers. </PARA>
<PARA>The members of the subcommittee met with Meals on Wheels volunteers in Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney during the inquiry. In fact, we assisted in one delivery service in Sydney in appalling conditions. This gave us an opportunity to see first hand the importance of a service of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The report concluded that the Meals on Wheels service makes a significant contribution to the home and community care program. It also noted that a feature of the Meals on Wheels service is the daily contact that it provides for the recipient of the meal. It also provides an acknowledgment for the volunteer. While the efficiency aspect might be worthy of further investigation the Committee, because of the wider social issues, would be reluctant to endorse such a proposal for a weekly delivery unless there were special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also recommends that the Department of Community Services and Health facilitate the establishment of a national Meals on Wheels organisation. Such an organisation would facilitate the exchange of information and the sharing of experience. The home and community care program is a community program and involves the three spheres of government. The level of involvement of local government varies significantly from State to State and the Committee has suggested that the involvement of local government be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also commented on accountability, as there were accountability problems identified in the report. Other issues covered include data collection, assessment teams and consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is not a sensational report; it is a positive one. It is a commendation to those in the community who give up some time each day to care for others. In caring for other people they also help reduce the costs of caring for the aged. But there is more than just the costs involved. There is also the time taken to talk, to listen and to respond to other's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the committee secretariat who worked so diligently on this report: Monica Teleseny, before leaving the secretariat; Phil Bergin, the Secretary; Sharon Fisher and Amanda Garlick, who worked tirelessly on the preparation of the manuscript. I extend a vote of thanks particularly to the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), who made up the subcommittee and gave of their time in the course of the subcommittee's deliberations on this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by stating again that, although this is not a sensational report, it clearly identifies that the home and community care program is making a valuable contribution to our society and to the care of the aged. It indicates that there are intrinsic matters that need consideration more than simply looking at the dollars and cents aspect of the provision of care for the aged, including the fact that people go and talk to these elderly people in their homes. The aged look forward to those visits in their homes and the visits make their days go a lot more quickly. I commend the report to the house</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a lot of pride to be able to speak on this report and also to join the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) in extending our thanks and appreciation to the secretariat, who served the subcommittee and the Committee itself in bringing forward this report. As important is the efficiency audit conducted by the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is great to be able to focus on some of these programs even in their infancy. While there has been criticism of the timing of the Auditor-General's report, I believe that, in the short and long term, the report will be beneficial because it allowed our Committee to look at it and to bring forward certain recommendations which I believe will be of benefit to the scheme. The recommendations or criticisms contained in the efficiency report have already been outlined in a fair amount of detail by the Chairman of the Committee. It is then very important to look at our recommendations concerning those criticisms and, as the honourable member for Macarthur said, the positive nature of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to include in the report the fact that the review was conducted by the old House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, which has been subsumed, I suppose, by the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. It is interesting to note that the review in connection with aged care, In a Home or at Home, was commissioned back in about 1981. I had the pleasure of being a member of that previous Committee, under the chairmanship of Stephen Lusher, and of the subcommittee under the chairmanship of the present Speaker. Having gone through the list of names of the people on that Committee at that time and those on the present Committee, I am the only continuing member. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a lot of pride in the home and community care (HACC) program. Nothing can be perfect after a trial of only three years, the first years of the legislation. But it appears to have been able to deliver on many of the recommendations included in the McLeay report In a Home or at Home presented in this Parliament in October 1982. That report was probably unique in that it never received a response from the Government of the day. But there was a response in a following report, in the present HACC program and the aged care program. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important issue. Ten per cent of Australians are in their greying years. According to the statistics, by the year 2021 that percentage will have increased measurably to the extent that it is suggested that over 15 to 16 per cent of the population will be in that age group. So, by tackling the problem now and putting programs in the right perspective, we are going a long way towards fulfilling the ambitions of government not only now but through to the years 2000 and 2021. By that time I will certainly be one of those aged people. The honourable member for Macarthur should not smile because by the year 2021 he will be well advanced in years, too. The Minister at the table, the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), need not smile at that prospect either because he is three days older than I am. </PARA>
<PARA> The October 1982 report was a very significant one in so far as we have acted on the recommendations and dealt with care for the aged. Those recommendations included a reduction in the number of programs and concentrating them on an extended care program both within the community and within nursing homes, to provide home care and accommodation. That is what the HACC program is about. It also recommended extended care, which is now delivered by domiciliary nursing services, meals on wheels and home help. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important issue is that I remember from those inspections that quite a few things came vividly to light. We heard about the open manner in which deficit funding and other funding was available to the private centres participating and also how the building of institutions-hostels and nursing homes-was sometimes inappropriate but encouraged by the availability of money. As we went around the country we saw many such inappropriately placed homes. We saw many institutions inappropriately delivering services that could have been provided back in the community. We mentioned in the report that such constructions should be on the basis more of need than of population. It is interesting to note that now the need is determined by the percentage of frail people aged over 70 in the community. Ten per cent are being catered for in institutions, nursing homes and hostels. We want to keep the other 90 per cent at home with the proper services available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with some pride that I look back on the recommendations of that report and see what has happened as a result of them. I do not know whether any other report presented to parliament has had such success. Other recommendations concerning residents' rights are included in legislation to be introduced this afternoon. When inspecting some homes back in 1981-82, we were very concerned that residents' rights were not being properly addressed. There was a lot of regimentation, residents' needs were not being met and their rights were not being respected. The legislation being introduced this afternoon will address the issues in that report. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pay tribute to the volunteer services. Basically, the HACC program has a high percentage of voluntary workers and these services can only be delivered by encouraging these volunteers. The unfortunate part about the efficiency audit is that we have to come back to having in place a good, flexible program but we have to have accountability. Over the last three years a lot of comments have been made about the HACC program and it has been subject to that review. But, as the Auditor-General has suggested, the most difficult part is to try to be accountable where funds are incorporated with State funds and delivered on that basis. While that is a difficulty, the flexibility that allows the States to deliver these programs is indicated in Victoria. The Victorian Government, in order to divest itself of the people in hospitals who could be cared for at home, has given a grant to one of the domiciliary nursing services in Melbourne to extend that care at home. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be of interest to every member of this Parliament to go out on a Meals on Wheels delivery and on a domiciliary nursing service-whether it be the blue nurses, the white nurses or the district nurses. It is a tremendous experience to go out and see how these people are working and delivering these services. They are doing a great job. They are changing their methods and they are innovating. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay a particular tribute to the deliverers of those services in my electorate of Dawson. They are doing a first-class job in a voluntary capacity and are putting in a tremendous amount of effort. I hope that the Committee's report and recommendations, following on the Auditor-General's report, will provide a flexible program within the community, one that is accountable and, more importantly, one that delivers services to that 10 per cent of aged people in the community. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak in one of those rare parliamentary debates which bring before us, as law makers, the question of first principles. I rise to speak on and support the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1989. In making my comments today I am conscious, to quote a well-known theologian, John Stott, that the debate over abortion is complex. It has medical, legal, theological, ethical, social and personal aspects. It is a highly emotional subject and involves acutely painful dilemmas. I have presented this Bill, however, and sought to have it debated, because for too long the Parliament has avoided the issue of abortion precisely because of its complexity. In that regard, I thank the Selection Committee of the House, under the Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), for its decision to allocate time for this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In presenting this Bill in this place on 17 August this year, I outlined both the reasons for and the objectives of the Bill, but it is appropriate now briefly to summarise both. The Commonwealth's main involvement with abortion is through Medicare subsidisation of abortion procedures. The Bill, therefore, addresses the Medicare subsidisation of abortion and seeks to allow Medicare funding only for abortions performed to avert the death of the mother or in cases where the procedure is for a different purpose and where the doctor was unaware an abortion would occur. The Bill also requires doctors to certify that the reason for any abortion was to avert the mother's death or it occurred indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall the extent of the Commonwealth's involvement with abortion through Medicare: an allocation of around $7m each year via Medicare involves honourable members in the abortion each year of nearly 70,000 unborn babies. I ask honourable members to reflect on what I have just said: they are and I am, through the policy and legislation of the Government and the Parliament, involved in the abortion of tens of thousands of unborn humans every year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us today presents honourable members and me with an opportunity either to end that involvement or, by opposing and defeating the Bill, to reaffirm that involvement. It seems obvious to me, then, that each of us is faced with the task, first and foremost, of settling in our own minds and hearts, according to our own consciences, the basic moral questions inherent in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the eighth century BC an unknown peasant named Micah, angered by injustice and by contempt for the weak and defenceless in his country, put this simple question to the leaders of the land: Is it not your duty to know what is right? We face today the same question, the same duty, in this place. Let us first ask whether there is one question, among the many in the abortion debate, the answer to which will place all the others in context and order. I put to the House two claims: first, that what is called scientifically the embryo and foetus is an individual human being; and, secondly, that abortion is therefore the denial of the most basic of rights, the right of life. These two claims constitute together such a primary question. People are saying to us that abortion is murder. Others are saying that the foetus is not a person, has no rights and is, as part of a woman's body, her property and business. We have a duty to decide which of the claims is right, relating as they do to an assertion of the denial of basic rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried over many years to give this question the consideration it is due. As I said in this place on 17 August and 26 October, I feel compelled by scientific and medical evidence and by moral logic to conclude that an individual's antenatal and postnatal development constitutes a single process of becoming what she or he already is-an individual human person. I am yet to see that evidence and logic discredited by opponents of this Bill or by pro-abortion advocates. I am therefore compelled to provide that unborn individual protection under the law. Let no-one enter this debate who is not willing to address this fundamental question. Let no-one avoid the duty he or she has to tell us whether he or she accepts or rejects the existence of two sets of rights in an abortion situation. Let no-one deny the humanity and rights of the foetus who will not also show at which point-two months, three months, eight months-the foetus suddenly becomes human, or show why a two-day-old child has rights that the two-month-old unborn baby does not have. The questions are those that I put to honourable members last week: Is the embryo-foetus a human person some of the time or any of the time before it is born? If only some of the time, what is the suggested non-arbitrary marker point? Why is it right for the community to involve itself in the affairs of a seven-month pregnant woman but not a two-month pregnant woman? If the foetus is worthless and a woman's property, what would be wrong with women falling pregnant with the intention of having an abortion for the purpose of selling foetal tissue to transplant or research clinics?</PARA>
<PARA> Those who have followed the debate outside the House over this Bill will know that its opponents wish to focus not on the primary question of rights recognition for the unborn, but on the question of whether the Bill will have a greater impact on low income women than on high income women. I acknowledge that there are many compassionate men and women in this place whose concern for the poor, and poor women in particular, and whose anger at the capacity of the rich to buy their way around their moral and legal obligations blind them to the question of first principles. In failing to focus on the primary question, however, their response to the Bill is misdirected. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not deny that in this instance, as in so many others, the rich have the capacity to cushion themselves against the impact of the law. State tobacco and liquor taxes, levied to pay for health programs, hurt the poor more than the rich. The abolition of slavery hurt poor farmers more than it hurt rich farmers. The rich will always have the capacity to act above and outside the law. That is one of the reasons why Jesus said that it would be very hard for the rich to enter heaven. To those, however, who use a woman's poverty to justify government subsidisation of abortion, I say this: know that, in aborting the children of the poor, you not only add to the litany of tragedy in a poor woman's life, you actually oppress the poor. You say to the poor woman, `My heart goes out to you, your poverty is a scandal, but I will not free you from your poverty, I will relieve you of your child'. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to those who see their opposition to this Bill as an act of solidarity with the poor that the problem facing a pregnant poor or dependent woman is not the pregnancy but the poverty and the dependency. It is the poverty that is unwanted, not the child. Just as I can understand but never institutionalise desperate acts of infanticide by poor women, I understand but cannot institutionalise abortion by poor women. I do not deny that a society marked by inequality will place unbearable burdens on many women facing parenthood, but I say to honourable members: let us not take the easy and cheap path of paying Medicare money to suppress the problem on an abortion clinic table. Let us develop families policies that sustain a woman in pregnancy and parenthood. There are those who speak mindlessly of unwanted pregnancies leading to abused and neglected children. To those people I say: look at the staggering growth of abuse and neglect and at homeless youth in a society with free and legal abortion. Is it not possible that the subversion of respect for life by the abortion industry and abortion philosophies is responsible for the increasing violence against children? It is not likely that there is some deeper spiritual problem in our society at the root of violence against both the unborn and children?</PARA>
<PARA> There are some who raise the questions of rape and incest. The reality is that pregnancy after rape or incest is very rare indeed. In South Australia-the only State to publish reasons for abortions-abortions due to rape or incest represented zero per cent in 1985 and 1986 and 0.1 per cent in 1987. It is not clear, in those very few cases of pregnancy after rape or incest, that there is less risk of emotional stress if an abortion is performed than if the pregnancy were allowed to continue, especially where support and counselling services are made available. I am not convinced, therefore, that there is a case for subsidising abortion after rape or incest, which again, I believe, would represent the easy, violent social response to an already tragic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other arguments have been put against the Bill. Some argue that we should look towards education and family planning to stem abortion, oblivious to the evidence that substantial funding for sex education and family planning services has had no impact on abortion figures. Some play on the fear that women will be forced into backyard abortions. What they will not admit is that the legalisation and provision of free abortions has not lowered the incidence of maternal deaths at all; nor will they acknowledge that in the United States of America the predicted boom in backyard abortions failed to occur after subsidies were removed. Some critics argue that the Bill will only lower, not eliminate, abortions. The evidence in the United States is that withdrawal of subsidies will lower significantly the incidence of abortions. It seems that the necessity of having to fund one's own decision does make an impact on a woman and her partner; they reflect on that decision and reconsider their circumstances. Nevertheless, the critics are correct that the Bill will not eliminate abortions altogether. It will fail to do so because abortion is allowed under, or in spite of, the law in every State. It will fail to do so because, notwithstanding talk about poverty, an abortion costs less than most poor women will spend on cigarettes in a year. It will fail to do so because some doctors will perform abortions free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the Bill worth the effort then? If it will save thousands of lives, thousands of unborn babies-and it will; there is no doubt of that-of course it is worth it. Let me finish my remarks on that point. This Bill will significantly lower the incidence of abortion in Australia. It will ensure that at the Federal level the relevant legislation embodies what is right and just. The Bill, if passed, will free up funds which could be used for pregnancy support rather than pregnancy termination. This Parliament should be about saving lives, or at the very least doing no one harm and minimising evil. This Parliament should be about wisely weighing and balancing competing sets of rights. It should be willing to affirm that some rights are basic and carry more weight than others, no matter how difficult the politics of explaining our judgment. The right to life of the unborn is one such right. This Parliament's laws should reflect what is right and its Budget should not fund what is wrong or harmful. This Parliament should not, therefore, fund abortion. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the Bill, we have before us, individually and as a parliament, two choices: we can choose life, or we can choose death. I urge honourable members to choose life. I urge honourable members to support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very controversial issue. The views held by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) no doubt are well considered, sincere and honest. It is a question that one looks at from a number of different angles-scientific, religious, moral and legal. But, in the end, it is moral differences which distinguish this issue and which are often aligned to political and religious views. Generally, the law in this land operates on a moral consensus. If one places abortion with issues such as contraception and divorce, one finds that many people find those things morally reprehensible. Indeed, our democracy allows those people to preach and try to persuade those who undertake those practices to change their mind. We have the freedom of conscience in those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In placing abortion with issues such as robbery, rape and murder, one puts it with issues where there is a universal belief in the law that those activities are reprehensible. Indeed, the law provides for sanctions and prohibitions against them. If abortion is to be put in with those categories we should not be talking about removing funding for Medicare: we should be talking about the main game, if that is what we think it is. If one in five pregnancies terminates spontaneously, how do we decide which of the cases are those of murder and which are the ones where there would have been spontaneous termination anyway?</PARA>
<PARA> When we debate this issue we have a tendency to look for scientific solutions. However, science cannot offer a solution here. It is just a debate about when an acorn becomes a oak tree. There is no clear evidence about that and about when life begins. I draw the House's attention to a submission in the Webster case which was heard in the United States Supreme Court last year. A total of 167 eminent scientists-11 of them Nobel laureates-summarised their view thus:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no scientific consensus that a human life begins at conception, at a given stage of fetal development, or at birth. The question of `when human life begins' cannot be answered by reference to scientific principles like those with which we predict planetary movement. The answer to that question will depend on each individual's social, religious, philosophical, ethical and moral beliefs and values. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I am trying to make is that if we can have no confidence in the scientific community-and it has no confidence-about the definition of when life begins then what the honourable member might say is that we ought not to interfere with the chance of a human life eventuating. If one takes that to its logical conclusion, one says that there can be no contraception and family planning. If that is the issue, perhaps we should be debating it, but certainly not Medicare funding. If that is the issue about contraception and whether we ought to allow the chance for human life to eventuate, it is not an issue on which I could support the honourable member. So we look for religious guidance and again we find that there is no consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a system of government in Australia which provides for secular government-a division of powers between the state and religious organisations and a freedom of religious expression. Taking the views of those who most strongly hold the view that the honourable member puts-the Catholic Church-again there is division. Any theological discussion within the Church about when ensoulment takes place will cause division. There is no certainty about when ensoulment takes place and theologians will tell you that. The pro-life people would say that they want the foetus to have some superior right, or at least the same rights as the mother, on this issue. However, when a miscarriage or even a stillbirth occurs, the Church rarely performs baptism and it rarely performs a funeral mass. So it does not place the same status on the miscarried foetus, or on the stillborn, that it does on other human life. That distinction exists in the Church. The second Vatican Council refused to make a judgment on the question of ensoulment. So even within the Catholic Church there is division. McBrien, in his book Catholicism, talks about individual conscience and states:</PARA>
<PARA>If, after appropriate study, reflection and prayer, a person is convinced that his or her conscience is correct, in spite of a conflict with the moral teachings of the Church, the person not only may but must follow the dictates of conscience rather than the teachings of the Church. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, if one looks at the scientific evidence and asks for religious guidance, one finds there is no consensus on the moral position on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Abortion Funding Abolition Bill relates to the abolition of Medicare funding. If I put the best complexion upon it and the motives of the Opposition and the honourable member opposite, I would say that the honourable member's intention is that there should be fewer abortions. Such a proposition would have my support. I have no difficulty with that because I too would like to see it occur. I think that it is desirable. However, Medicare benefits do not underpin abortions. Medicare benefits do not cause abortion. It will not go away if we remove the benefit, just like unemployed people will not disappear if we remove the unemployment benefit. That is something which the honourable member has to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are abortions necessary? Why do we have unwanted pregnancies? There are many causes. I admit that rape and incest account for very few. They often occur due to ignorance, lack of sex education, poor sex education, failed contraception or just because of a mistake of judgment. An unwanted pregnancy is never deliberate. Whether a Medicare benefit underpins it or not, the choice remains for the woman involved: she has to make a decision. That needs to be understood very clearly. I suggest that it is a gut-wrenching decision for that woman. For some the consequences must be overwhelming into their future lives-in the weeks and years afterwards-just as the suggestion that adoption is the answer produces gut-wrenching problems and overwhelming guilt. That is not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> The best way of reducing the number of abortions is to have better sex education, better and more family planning and, indeed, more support for those who find themselves in these circumstances. That support should come from the partner, who is often forgotten, and, I suggest, it should come from us. Tolerance and compassion are necessary. I do not think that fixing the blame solves the problem in any way. Removing the benefit clearly does not. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the legislation will not change the number of abortions but will change the nature of the available treatment. We will see a return to the backyard abortion, which is undesirable. One has only to look at mortality rates in developing countries where abortion is illegal to see that that procedure is very dangerous. It is a women's health issue and we, in this Parliament, need to consider it in that light. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is to be real freedom in our country-freedom and rights are words that we throw around in this place-we need the freedom to differ on the big issues; not just on whether someone wears a seat belt and matters such as that, but the big issues that are matters of human conscience. To say that we do not want a portion of our taxes going to things that we do not like is a facile argument. Many people in our community decide not to have children. According to the same argument, why should they be supporting child-care funding or schools funding? There are people who do not drive cars. Why should they be funding roads? That is a facile argument and it does not stand up. </PARA>
<PARA> This argument is about individual choice. It is about the person who is in the best position to make that choice. The mother has to weigh the consequences; she has to weigh up the effects. I support her right to do so. In the end, any of us who thinks deeply about this issue and other issues is left with the lament of Shakespeare's King Lear, who said, `Who is it that can tell me who I am?'. Indeed, in the end, it is individual conscience that must make this decision. I support the right of people to make that choice. I reject the Opposition's legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill I wish to pay tribute to the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) for the courage he has displayed over a period in bringing this Bill before the national Parliament. The honourable member is highly respected and has been at pains not to turn his Bill into a partisan debate. He, as have others in this chamber, has always conducted the debate in a very measured way. For that reason, I will not analyse point by point the matters raised by the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth). In the very limited time available to me in the House to debate this issue this morning I would much prefer to put my views on record, except to say that I do not think it is incumbent upon the honourable member for Perth to represent the Catholic Church in the fashion that he has. The Catholic Church has unambiguously stated time and again its total and unreserved opposition to abortion. Whatever individual theologians may claim, Catholic bishops, even in recent days, have again stated their total opposition to abortion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe, as I know other members believe, that this debate is long overdue. It is well past the time when the Parliament of this nation should be discussing the issue of funding for abortions. Surely no-one would deny the validity of the debate if, for no other reason-leaving aside the moral and ethical questions-than the fact that about $7m of taxpayers' funds per year is involved. After all, if the cosmetic surgery aspects of Medicare funding were to be abused they would be the first thing discussed by this Parliament. This debate will allow honourable members to let the electorate know where they stand on this issue. We are accountable to our constituents on any number of issues-tax, social security and immigration-surrounding government administration. But too often we duck for cover on the issue of abortion. Frankly, there is nowhere for honourable members to hide from their constituents when answering questions on abortion. They cannot hide behind party affiliation because it is a matter of conscience. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an unstated conspiracy of self-interest to keep abortion off the political agenda. It is regarded as too hot an issue to handle: it is all too hard. It is an emotional issue which fires up people both ways-it is unpredictable and difficult to control in political terms. It is far better for governments and oppositions alike to fight elections on tried and true issues. This is too great an issue for too many people for legislators to ignore. We are accountable, not just as members of a political party but as individual legislators. Economic issues dominate the political debate-tax, balance of payments and foreign debt. The standard of living of Australians occupies most of our thinking and working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the very few quality of life issues debated in this chamber is the environment but rarely, if ever, do we debate the morality of our society. As honourable members would appreciate, morality is defined in a very subjective manner. There would be almost as many definitions of morality as there are members in this place. Yet surely there is a base which should be commonly accepted, namely the Judaeo-Christian ethic. The cornerstone of the Judaeo-Christian morality is the sanctity of life. If one believes that life begins at the moment of conception, what choice does one have but to oppose abortion? To do otherwise would be to repudiate the notion of morality, to abandon one's faith. It only becomes a question of how one opposes abortion: to what lengths does one go?</PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious expression of opposition is not ever to have an abortion. For many people opposition is expressed in private prayer but for others opposition takes a more public form ranging from letter writing to parliamentarians to demonstrations and incarceration. Scorn is poured on these people; they are frequently ridiculed by the proponents of abortion in a compliant press. Yet those who lie in front of bulldozers or cling to the bow of an American naval ship are elevated to sainthood. The double standards are breathtaking. There is a kind of religious fervour amongst many of the fanatics who demonstrate about trees and animals but those who oppose abortion are so often dismissed as cranks. Yet the issue of abortion-the issue of life itself-is infinitely more important than the popular causes that dominate our society today. </PARA>
<PARA> The scientific evidence establishes beyond doubt the commencement of life at the moment of conception. The destruction of that life through abortion is murder. No matter how one talks around the issue, the inescapable truth is that the taking of life is murder. There are those who do not accept that life commences at conception; rather, they believe that life commences at a later time. Abortion to them is therefore not murder. I do not agree and believe that such a judgment is not substantiated by medical or biological knowledge. If that judgment is a matter of conscience, as with the honourable member for Perth, for example, obviously it is a matter for the individual. No-one can see into the soul of another person; only God can do that. I do not stand in judgment. But all human beings, to one extent or another, shape their consciences to their convenience. This is the weakness of man flowing from original sin. Any person who reaches a deep and abiding conviction that life commences at the moment of conception cannot stand idly by as more than 80,000 lives are aborted every year in Australia-more than 70,000 at the taxpayers' cost. </PARA>
<PARA> We have often heard the argument that it is the right of a woman to control her body. Is that right so supreme that it extends to the destruction of a life? Examples are also given of the terrible hardship and sadness, even tragedy, that result from unwanted pregnancies. They are emotional and at times superficially convincing arguments but, nonetheless, as the honourable member for Macquarie has laboured, one has to measure any rights in our society against others. Like it or not, we deem some to be more compelling, more superior than others. The right to life is the most basic, the most important and the most honourable. As has been said in this debate and often at other times, pregnancies resulting from incest or rape should be terminated; but as a percentage of the 80,000 abortions every year, such pregnancies are infinitesimal. Overwhelmingly, the majority of abortions are of convenience. We have to ask: What is more horrifying-an unwanted pregnancy or the taking of a life?</PARA>
<PARA> I endorse the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill and commend it to the House. There is no more important issue that this House could consider than the legislation before it at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the compelling realities of this debate is how different it is in this chamber with the emotion certainly real and yet constrained. The sort of debate we are having here could well be a way of showing leadership to those in the community who have erred on both sides of this debate to extremist positions on occasions and, very often, extremist actions. For my part, I do not demur at the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) in relation to understanding the position of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). I believe that he has genuine views in relation to this issue, as do most members of this chamber. It has been interesting in the past to me to see how, on a bipartisan basis, the views in relation to this issue and related issues can go far beyond party-political positions. Many people have in the past adopted non-partisan positions based on their own ethical and moral understanding of these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do have one significant problem, however, with the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill. To me, it seems a backdoor route by which to come to the issue of abortion when this Parliament has, as we all know, discussed the merit or otherwise of abortion per se in considerable detail. I know that the honourable member for Macquarie did not argue this, but those who argue that the end result of the acceptance of this sort of proposal would, because of its moral dimensions, be acceptable, accept that we do discount the very real impact of poor women in our community. There is a coalition of women. It is interesting to see that it is four males talking about this issue in this chamber. Perhaps we ought to regret that. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate will be adjourned at 11.27 a.m. I know that some of the previous speakers went a little over time, so I will not have time to touch in very great detail on most of the points that I wish to raise. But let me list some of the organisations which have expressed genuine and very real concern about this particular proposal. I have correspondence from the Young Women's Christian Association, expressing very serious reservations about this proposal, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, the National Society of Community Based Children's Services, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled, the Australian Women's Health Network, the Australian Women's Educational Coalition, the Campaign for Economic Justice, the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Catholic Women's League of Australia, the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia, the Association of Non-English Speaking Background Women of Australia, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, amongst numerous others. Every member of parliament, conversely, has received representations from those who very strongly supported this legislation. But it is incumbent upon everyone in this chamber to reflect for a moment on two matters. First, if we are going to have a debate about abortion, let us all have the guts to debate the issue of abortion. This Bill seems to me to be just so obviously a backdoor method that will lead to backyard abortions. One needs only to look at some of the statistics in terms of the deaths resulting from backyard abortions. They are not matters of assertion; they are based on empirical data. The end result of this decision would be-I do not believe that there is any way that people can argue against this-the rise of backyard abortions and all the corollaries that go with that in terms of increased deaths for women who participate. The criminal element has not been adverted to here, but anyone who has an understanding of how crime has developed in this country will be aware that the genesis of many organised crime groups was money derived from backyard abortions. It corrupted our police forces in the 1960s. Again, that is a matter on the public record. Everything that flows from that has been debated in this chamber on numerous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the Commonwealth has a responsibility to maintain funding through the Medicare system for medical procedures which meet State prescribed legal criteria. I ask the honourable member for Macquarie: Has he debated this proposal in the councils of his Party? Has he consulted his colleagues? What is his attitude to the New South Wales Government, which continues to conduct the laws as they are at this moment? If the issue is one of such great moral dimensions for him, there are many other actions he should be taking. He has been a member of this chamber now for some five years. This move seems to be a little late in the day, if I may respectfully say so. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of women's rights, I think that it is fundamentally a woman's basic right to choose in relation to this issue. That does not discount the responsible role of men in our society, but it is fundamentally a woman's right to choose in consultation with her medical practitioner. I feel entirely discomfited in contemplating the adoption of a position that seeks to impose on that fundamental right. Were I a woman, I would not accept an argument whereby someone could seek to impose his view on me in a similar regard, and I do not expect women to take the same position from men in our community in that absolute assent. As I have indicated, the proposed change to the system would openly discriminate against the less well-off and the young females in our community. That is a position I would not countenance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member. These are truly issues of our time. They are critical issues which confront not just the Australian people but the people of the world. The One World or None Campaign does focus on those four interconnected issues. I think it is important that I emphasise what they are, because it is clear to me and, I think, ought to be clear to all of us, that these four issues are absolutely interrelated and are questions which we ought to address as a parliament, as a nation and, indeed, as part of humankind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first of those issues is environment and development. The issue here is how to achieve sustainable development; that is, development which meets our needs while leaving resources for future generations, and the need for development to be in harmony with the environment. The second major issue is the global economy and the fight against poverty. The issue here is how to get more aid for those who need it, how to develop further fairer trading practices, and how to lift the burden of debt repayment from developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major issue is disarmament for development. That involves redirecting global arms expenditure for food, shelter, health care and the education of the world's poorest people. The fourth and final interrelated strategy is for the protection of human rights, to ensure that people all around the world have a right to participate in decisions affecting their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of introducing this motion in the Parliament today is not to engage in partisan debate but, hopefully, to raise the public profile of the important campaign One World or None, sponsored by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. The Council is supported by its 84 member organisations, which include a wide diversity of organisations in Australia: the Association of Apex Clubs in Australia, Australian Baptist World Aid, Australian Catholic Relief, the Australian Teachers Federation, the Federation of Australian Jewish Welfare Societies, World Vision and the Young Women's Christian Association, to mention just a few. A wide cross-section of Australians are prepared to lend their names to this campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to the campaign is the proposition that we, as individuals, are not powerless, that we are not able to turn our backs on the rest of civilisation and that each and every one of us in this chamber and people listening to this debate has a positive role to play in lifting public awareness about these crucial issues. These issues, of course, have been on the international agenda for some considerable time. Even comparatively recently, in 1983, in response to the concerns of nations about the future of the world's environment, the United Nations brought together some 23 experts from around the world. That Commission on Environment and Development was chaired by Norway's Prime Minister Brundtland. It brought together the world's attention, focusing on the urgency of global degradation and its impact on the poor. The report, called Our Common Future, is popularly referred to as the Brundtland report. It was published in 1987. Our Common Future highlighted the need to put environmental concerns at the centre of all decisions made about development. Unless we have a healthy environment we will have no basis at all for our requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issues are involved in this campaign. The limited time for this debate precludes me from making more than a brief reference to some of those crucial issues. To address the world's environmental crisis, as recognised by the Brundtland Commission, the poverty crisis must also be addressed. The tragedy is that the world's poorest people live on land which has been most seriously environmentally degraded, that is, land which has often been stripped of trees, which is overused, which has lost its topsoil and, with that, the capacity to grow trees or healthy crops to feed the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of energy conservation is one which we all have to address because in Australia we consume 80 times as much energy as a person in sub-Saharan Africa. The reality is that Australia's population of 17 million has the same impact on the world's resources as 1,280 million Africans. The consequences of that unrestrained energy utilisation include many things: the greenhouse effect, the growing urban industrial air pollution and the high incidence of acid rain, to name just a few. I remember being on a parliamentary delegation to Poland and seeing in Krakow buildings that had stood for centuries and that had never been subject to destruction and erosion literally beginning to crumble because of the effect of acid rain. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now entered a new dimension of world history. It is very important that we respond as a civilisation to those things. The issue of the loss of forests has been mentioned before in this House but we need to be reminded of a simple fact. Imagine 43 football fields with trees standing and then imagine those same football fields with no trees standing. That loss is occurring every minute of every day. The loss of trees means loss of life in a very direct way. In 1988, de-afforestation in the catchment areas of the Ganges and the Nile turned heavy rains into catastrophic floods. In Sudan, the floods left 1 1/2 million people homeless and in Bangladesh the Ganges floods left 25 million people homeless. There are many other environmental problems which I do not have time to refer to in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to some other important issues, such as foreign aid. The Australian Labor Party Government's record on foreign aid is not a good one. I am not proud of my Government's record. I am an outspoken critic of the failure of the Government to do more. I want to place this on the record in a bipartisan way. I say to the Opposition that the proposals to cut foreign aid recently announced by the Opposition are wrong; they are in the wrong direction. It is very easy as parliamentarians to go for the cheap option, the easy way, to play on public prejudice. How much more important it is that we as parliamentarians take the high moral ground, that we try to educate Australians about the importance of being good international citizens. I call on the Opposition to reverse its stand on aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important matter is the integration of environmental concerns into our aid program. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a major statement on the environment. Some important initiatives have been announced in relation to the integration of environmental protection in Australia's aid program. I welcome those recent developments. The issue of poverty is almost beyond comprehension for us as Australians. The statistics are absolutely frightening. The 1989 report of the World Bank estimates that 950 million people in the developing world live in conditions of poverty. They are not statistics that we, as global citizens, can afford to ignore. Another issue of integral importance in the One World or None campaign is the issue of disarmament for global development. Again, some statistics need to be drawn into this debate. Simply, three weeks of global spending on arms would pay for primary health care for every child in the developing world. That would include their access to safe water. </PARA>
<PARA> The time available to me in this debate has run out. My purpose has been to put these issues on the agenda of the Parliament and to say to my fellow parliamentarians that we are not neutral, that history will judge our contribution to raising public awareness about these important issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the House is very wide-ranging and encompasses many interlocking issues. The One World or None Campaign is a challenge for us all. In its campaign for One World, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid draws the attention of the Australian public to four matters to which it can make a contribution and commitment: firstly, the environment; secondly, economic problems, with a view to reducing poverty, hunger, malnutrition and diseases; thirdly, protecting human rights; and, fourthly, disarmament, with the intention to guide the world away from its massive expenditure on weapons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> India, a regional neighbour of Australia, is a recipient of a significant amount of both government and non-government aid from Australia-deservedly so, some would say, as India is a country with great economic problems that have seen a large number of her people languishing in a seemingly hopeless poverty trap. Yet, despite the terrible conditions of many of her people, India's expenditure on her huge rearmament program has more than doubled since 1983. It is the equivalent of $US8,300m in 1988-89, or about 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product. In marked contrast, Australia's defence spending in terms of gross domestic product is only 2.3 per cent. Instead of concentrating on the basic social needs of its population, India has chosen to pour billions of rupees into both her rearmament program and her nuclear weapons program. Indeed, such is the scale of India's military expansion that signs of a regional arms race are now evident. It is an arms race provoked by India and is entirely at odds with the aims of One World. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate the obstacles posed to One World by India. On 27 September 1989, barely a month ago, Admiral Nayyer, recently retired from the Indian Navy, gave a most interesting address to the United States Global Strategy Council Forum in Washington, DC. The Council has a set of rules for such addresses, the most notable being that `it is off the record-no one can be quoted directly'-and one can use the content as long as the speaker is not identified. I have been provided with a certified transcript of Admiral Nayyer's address which should be compulsory reading for the Australian Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and particularly his Department, given its pitifully poor submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which is currently examining Australia-India relations. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that Admiral Nayyer was in Washington as part of a delegation sent by the Indian Government to explain its policies, but he was not an official spokesman. Admiral Nayyer also describes himself as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . involved with a lot of organisations which deal with national security concerns outside the Government, and my views reflect the concern of a large number of Indians. </PARA>
<PARA>In his address Admiral Nayyer, referring to the 1978 Carter initiative for the United States and the Soviet Union to demilitarise the Indian Ocean, said it is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in the interests of unilateral states that there is an indigenous power in the area which can ensure stability. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I'm not suggesting that we . . . want to dominate the countries in the region, but what I am saying is this, that any hope of stability in our region, negative India stability and India power, is rusery. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement lends yet further credence to the belief that India's advocacy of the Indian Ocean zone of peace is nothing more than a blatant attempt to ensure that the only significant and thus dominant naval presence in the Indian Ocean is the Indian Navy. This hardly fits in with the objectives of the One World campaign if for no better reason than to maintain a navy sufficient to dominate the region, India's defence expenditure will have to remain high, which is to the very great detriment of its impoverished people. </PARA>
<PARA> Admiral Nayyer's vanity got the better of him at one stage when, talking of India's naval expansion, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>For almost 30 years I have provided the philosophic rationale for India's maritime power . . . it is not India's fault that the rest of the world refused to recognise it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, recognise India's expansion and not his vanity. However, Admiral Nayyer's observation that the rest of the world refused to recognise it is a condemnation of the Hawke Government's strategic assessment, because the period of greatest acceleration in India's naval expansion has been in the 1980s. As far as I can discover, the Government's official position remains one of being `intrigued'. </PARA>
<PARA> In justifying India's acquisition of a nuclear submarine force, Admiral Nayyer advanced an argument that has ramifications not just for the stability of Australia and the Indian Ocean region but also the stability of the world as a whole. Admiral Nayyer said:</PARA>
<PARA> We-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, India-</PARA>
<PARA>should have an indigenous capability of serious production of nuclear submarines and not just staying with propulsion, but that we should propose the whole strategic spectrum of fitting them with missiles and all that. </PARA>
<PARA>Even taking into account that India regularly engages in bluff and that its missile program is very much in its infancy, the fact that an unofficial spokesman of the Indian Government is canvassing the development of nuclear ballistic missile submarines is, I would have thought, a quite significant point. </PARA>
<PARA> Of special interest to Australia is that Admiral Nayyer was tackled on the issue of Indian intervention outside of India and its sphere of influence in cases where an ethnic Indian population was perceived to be threatened, and Fiji in particular was raised. Given the fact that Admiral Nayyer's views present us with a window into current thinking in respect of the Indian decision making elite, his response deserves mention. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad that the Fijian problem has occurred before India had the military capability to do anything. </PARA>
<PARA>I should add that Admiral Nayyer presaged his response by indicating that he would answer `lightheartedly', but this does not detract from the fact that such an opinion was voiced. He then went on to describe the application of military power in varying degrees and talked of exercising restraint of power, but there is a none too thinly veiled threat in his remarks that needs to be seriously heeded. Indeed, that threat fits in with the current strong belief that India has set about pursuing its pre-Mogul destiny. It is a destiny wherein India regards itself not so much as a country but as a civilisation-a civilisation not constrained by the present man-made borders of India or other regional countries, and a civilisation that embraces the numerous overseas Indian populations that are to be found around the Indian Ocean littoral. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government's total inability to come to grips with the changed strategic situation in the Indian Ocean region is, to a large degree, illustrated by the fact that it was only in May this year that the position of military attache in New Delhi was reinstated after it was abolished three years ago. Lest anybody be in any doubt that the Hawke Government has entirely misjudged the strategic environment, I will quote a remark by a senior Defence bureaucrat to the Senate Standing Committee investigating Australia-India relations. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I would not like the Committee to think that you have a team of experts on India before you . . . in some respects that is illustrative of the nature of defence concerns about India that we could not put together a team from Defence of experts on India. I would doubt that we would be able to do so in the foreseeable future, nor would we see a need to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very disturbing quote. It is little wonder then that the Minister for Defence is in a position only to describe himself and therefore the Australian Government as `intrigued'. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the certified transcript of Admiral Nayyer's address to the United States Global Strategy Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate quite readily. I was approached only two weeks ago by some women who work with the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. They presented me with a number of petitions in support of the One World Declaration which is the end point, in a sense, of the One World or None Campaign. I was pleased to receive that declaration, and I will mention the six points that these people seek to impress upon the Australian Government. They are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. Focus Australia's aid program on fighting poverty and protecting the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Restore Australian aid to 0.5 per cent of GNP by 1992 and work for a fairer international economic system. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Cut military spending by 1 per cent and allocate the savings to overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Ensure that aid promotes human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Develop a code of conduct for Australian businesses investing in countries where serious human rights abuses occur. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Develop new policies for Australia's representatives to the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank that give top priority to fighting poverty and protecting the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>I might say in the spirit of this debate that I cannot agree with all of the six points that they present for consideration by the Australian Government. I can agree with most of them but, for instance, a great deal of complexity lies behind what they ask of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the third point-`Cut military spending by one per cent and allocate the savings to overseas aid'-and I say this especially to the younger ones who are listening: I suppose it is obvious to suggest that we should shift spending from military purposes to overseas aid. I would hope that at some stage we will do that but we cannot do it simply in one step or two steps. We have to ask ourselves what is the apparent situation in which Australia-and the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) was talking about India-finds itself in the real world. In other words, if a nation is to feel secure it must spend a certain amount of money on military hardware. Unfortunately, that is a fact of life. The real question is not the simple one of `Let's transfer money from military expenditure to overseas aid', but the more complex one of how we achieve security between nations such that we can lessen our expenditure on military hardware. That is the key question. I guess this debate allows us to raise the more complex things that lie behind the One World Declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it most encouraging, for instance, that in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) at present there are two events taking place. The first is an attempt to reform the USSR economy and the second is an attempt to reform its political life through some sort of democratisation. It seems to me that the USSR has been forced into a revamping of its economy simply because that country is going broke. There are both wins and losses in this process. We might find that the USSR reforms its economy and integrates itself into the Western economy, thus lessening its need to invest in military hardware. In other words, to the extent that it can reform and integrate its economy with the rest of the world it might feel less out on its own and will not have the need to spend so much on military hardware. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fairly hopeful that what is happening at present in the USSR might be the first step in the cutting of military expenditure in that country and in the whole of the Eastern bloc, that it will follow to the United States of America and so forth. The steps are not simple. We do not just make a neat accountant's transfer from the defence budget to overseas aid. Let me go through this once again. It is possible that the reforms taking place right now in the eastern European bloc will mean a greater integration between that bloc and the Western world. If that greater integration occurs there will not be the need to spend so much on military hardware. That is what I am hoping for. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that is happening in the USSR is that there is now an ability to speak out and tell the rest of the world what happens in that country. I was speaking recently to an eminent biologist from the University of Queensland who had visited the USSR in the last couple of years. He said that just three or four months ago he found that Soviet scientists for the first time were able to speak out not only about some of the scientific achievements of that country but also about some of the crises that had occurred in the industrialisation of the USSR. For the first time we will learn about some of the awful environmental and pollution problems within the Eastern bloc. He tells me that every press conference to which a Soviet scientist goes now is sold out because they are so interesting. For so long we have heard little about what is happening in the USSR, but now journalists are asking question after question of Soviet scientists about what happens in their country with respect to environment destruction and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that a positive thing too. It is possible that while Soviet scientists can now speak out our scientists can speak to them. Our biologists and environmentalists can go to the USSR and debate with them the best ways of promoting new technologies that will mean a safer and better environment in the USSR. These joint movements for reform of the Soviet economy and reform of its democratic process will, in the first instance, reveal in the next decade an awful picture--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). He was not necessarily to know what the arrangements were. Like other members of this House, I received a delegation last week in my electorate office in relation to the One World or None Campaign. I spent an hour and a half with that delegation discussing some of the issues it raised. Inevitably everybody agrees with the basic motherhood propositions it put forward-that is, that we all want peace, we all believe in the importance of human rights, we would like to have a sustainable long-lasting environment and we all want to destroy poverty. There is no argument with any of that. I think it is important to recognise that just about everybody I have ever met in my life would agree with those particular propositions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are debating how we achieve these sorts of objectives. For example, let us take the issue of poverty, in particular poverty in the developing world. The solution to the problem of poverty in the developing world is not a constant flood of aid to those countries, although emergency relief aid is fundamentally important in certain circumstances. The solution to the problem of poverty lies in domestic economic policies, the generation of investment, including foreign investment, and responsible land policies, and also the opening up of international trade to developing countries. If we want a sustainable environment we have to introduce the concept of polluter pays and ensure that environmental degradation is properly recognised in national accounts. If we want peace and disarmament we have to be realistic and move towards that objective in the context of multilateral disarmament, not through unilateralism, as is suggested but not spelt out in the One World or None Campaign. Unilateralism will lead to instability. Multilateral disarmament based on trust is something that is fundamentally achievable. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about moving towards alleviating poverty, when we talk about moving towards a sustainable environment, when we talk about peace and disarmament, we must try to achieve these things in practical and constructive ways. There is no point in going around with beads and flowers hoping that people will sit down and be kind and loving to each other. Even in a peaceful place such as this Parliament not everyone agrees with everyone else and there is scope for very fierce debate. That applies worldwide. It applies between nations. It applies within nations. The resolution of these debates will always be a constant struggle for mankind. But if we move towards intelligent solutions to those problems, not wishful thinking, then we can indeed achieve one world and we will not have to confront future generations with the prospect of none. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the light of the focus on the environment that has been so much a part of the nation and the Parliament in recent years, and in the light of the comments attributed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) over the last 24 hours, I move the following motion appearing in my name on the Notice Paper:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) recognises the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin in the economic development of Australia and its continuing contribution to the nation's primary production, industrial and recreation activities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on the Federal Government to give a higher priority to salinity mitigation schemes in south-eastern Australia and to foster greater cooperation between the State Governments involved in the Murray-Darling catchment areas in order to ensure that the long-term interests of river users are met. </PARA>
<PARA>Thanks to the generosity of the Opposition Whips and the fluctuating fortunes in Parliament House, my office in this building is located in the northernmost room in the north-eastern wing. It has a particular advantage. From my office desk I can look down into the courtyard which is used by the parliamentary staff to obtain access to the staff dining area. In that courtyard there is a rather magnificent fountain arrangement. It comprises a slated area with a 3-inch PVC pipe gushing water vertically into a reservoir. The water overspills into what from my point of view very much resembles an irrigation channel, which runs for 25 or 30 metres and then makes a right-angled turn into an even wider area. </PARA>
<PARA> With my background, sitting at my office desk in this place I am very much at home. I spent my first 40 years, either as a child or as a practising irrigator, on irrigation properties in the Riverland area of South Australia. The presence of a 3-inch pipe gushing water into what appear to be irrigation channels is something with which I am very familiar. With the boyish exuberance of all Riverlanders, I have, as you would not be surprised to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, had an illegal swim or two in an irrigation channel and even accepted a challenge to swim across the river. So I suspect that in my veins I have more than my fair share of muddy River Murray water. </PARA>
<PARA> From that perspective, I have a great deal of sensitivity about what is happening to the Murray-Darling basin. The importance of that basin to Australian agriculture cannot be overstated. The basin provides something like 40 per cent of Australia's total agricultural production. The area from Murray Bridge in the electorate of Mayo to Toowoomba in the electorate of Groom, and from Canberra where we are at present to the South Australian gulfs, one-seventh of the land mass of Australia, is caught up in the catchment area of the Murray-Darling Basin. Relying on this water resource for domestic water are 1.25 million Australians; and half of our sheep, a quarter of our cattle and three-quarters of our irrigated land depend on the Murray-Darling catchment area. </PARA>
<PARA> As a South Australian I am acutely aware of its importance to that State. In a normal year, more than 50 per cent of the water requirement in South Australia is met from the Murray River. In a drought year, that rises to 70 or 80 per cent. In the electorate of Grey, 90 per cent of the Iron Triangle depends on the River Murray for its water supply. It is an ecological feature without parallel in Australia. It is an ecological feature on which I have been totally dependent for my livelihood. I use the motion before the House this morning to emphasise the point that I am irritated by the underlying impression abroad in the community that the ecological problems of the River Murray result from irrigation and that the irrigators are principally to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts do not underscore that point. History shows that this huge south-eastern area of Australia was once a great inland sea. Under this catchment area lies a basin of saline water which is constantly flowing into the Murray-Darling system. The Murray-Darling system never comprised sparkling freshwater streams fed from snow-covered mountains. That is true only of the uppermost regions of the River Murray. Only in the electorate of Farrer has that any semblance of reality. The River Murray is a very low flow river by world standards. Its flow is only 16 per cent of the flow of the Nile River, 3.5 per cent of the flow of the Mississippi River, and 0.25 per cent of the flow of the Amazon River. The River Murray flows over a huge salt underlay which is constantly making its way naturally into the Murray system. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of this Parliament have heard me say before that, if I were to sit with the Berri hotelier, Mr Malcolm Hill, at the front bar of his hotel and look at the River Murray as it flows past that hotel early on its entrance into the South Australian system, every 12 minutes the equivalent of a semi-trailer load-24 tonnes-of salt would flow past my nose, borne from the eastern States and through South Australia to the sea. My point is that not all of this salt is irrigator-induced. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission statistics show that the maximum amount of irrigator-induced salt in the Murray-Darling system is about 31 per cent, with 69 per cent coming from natural inflows that existed before white man occupied that area. In the 1860s, before irrigation was even dreamt of, Salt Creek, which flows into the Murray River, was aptly named by early explorers because it was so saline. In 1914, a drought year, the salinity levels at Morgan in South Australia, where the River Murray turns dramatically south towards the sea, were recorded at 10,000 EC units. Salinity, whether it is man-induced or naturally induced, has to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Parliament to act as if irrigators were guilty of the ecological damage done to the Murray-Darling Basin area is quite wrong. It is an area of enormous natural inflow which has gone on since well before white man occupied this continent. The truth remains that the cost to irrigators of rising salt levels in the Murray-Darling catchment area is calculated at $65m a year and $37m is the cost to urban users as a result of industrial corrosion, hot water services not lasting as long as they should, and other difficulties that urban users in South Australia face because they are dependent on Murray River water. If nothing is done to address the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin it is calculated that, by the year 2015, the cost to irrigators, in today's dollar terms, will be at least $95m a year and the cost to urban users will be closer to $60m a year. The cost will accelerate, and the additional and unforgivable cost will be the loss of up to 500,000 hectares of presently irrigated or occupied farm land because of encroaching salinity. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede, as would every member of the Opposition, that the Government is well aware of this dilemma. The reports on the Murray-Darling Basin would make a pile so high that even you, Mr Deputy Speaker, could not jump over it. What is needed is not more reports but action to address this problem. I am also prepared to concede-and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) will be anxious to correct me if I am wrong-that the Government is taking action, but it is too little, too late. </PARA>
<PARA> Upstream from my property is the Woolpunda area. Through the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, the Government has introduced a salt interception scheme which is designed to pick up the natural underground inflows of often unseen salt coming into the Murray-Darling system and transfer them to evaporation basins located somewhere in the Cadell area. It is a great idea. The construction is in place and we look forward to the scheme working. It is estimated to cost $29.9m. That money is being spent, but it is only a drop in the ocean. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief contribution to the debate on this motion from the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and to pick up on a couple of his comments. It is time that everyone in Australia came to understand that in the Government's view soil degradation-salinity is one of the principal issues-is the major problem facing Australia and has been identified as such. One can take lots of approaches to these sorts of things. The honourable member for Wakefield takes the practical approach of someone who comes from the land and has seen the effects of soil degradation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When, in the late 1960s, I was first posted to northern Victoria with my work, to a little place called Pyramid Hill, I just could not believe what I saw around the area in sloppy watering practices and just sheer ignorance. I guess that over time that caused me to reflect on the wisdom of such things as soldier settlement and other schemes that we have embarked on to open up irrigation. We have taken what we now understand to be a very fragile aspect of this continent-the crust of the soil, the balance that nature had evolved over time. When we do things such as turn the Murray River into a 50-mile wide lake using irrigation and take flat land that has a very delicate crust and start to water and overuse it-using it for all the things we have managed to do in that region in the last 150 years-we produce very dramatic outcomes very quickly. It is a bit like computers: they are terrific when they are working well but when the darned things start to go wrong they go wrong in such a hurry that it takes a lot of time to backtrack and fix them up. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened with the proliferation of subdivisions, dairy farming and all the other things, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin, has been that we have taken something and started to change it at such a rapid rate that the damage has been major. Farmers understand this. Nothing that I say here now is critical of the future approach of farmers and people in general. I know that the honourable member for Wakefield is sensitive about governments and other people saying, `You are the ones who have caused it; you are the ones who are guilty'. I agree with him that no one sector of the community is responsible; we are all responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have been questioning these things for a long time in places such as the Murray Valley, up around Kerang. I am sure that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, would have seen these things for himself when he went around the area as a union official in the old days. In such places one sees water lying around and the sun beating down on it. The water table comes up to about one foot from the top and six months later it is just salt. One can see it happening very dramatically and very quickly before one's eyes. To turn all that around does not involve just turning around practices; it involves turning around attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's interjection was a valid one. I know that the honourable member for Wakefield was sensitive to the Minister's saying, `What did you do about it?'. But it is all very well for the honourable member to say that the Opposition when in government was going to throw money at this problem. It threw a lot of money at a whole lot of things, but we finished up with a minus $9 billion Budget to deal with. What we have managed to do-this ought to be kept in perspective-is not only to take the Budget from minus $9 billion to plus $9 billion and deal with all the other things associated with restructuring the economy, but also to fund the things that the previous Government would have liked to fund. It would have liked to fund these things but instead it threw around all that money and got us nine billion bucks in the red. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also introduced the environment statement handed down by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in July this year entitled Our Country, Our Future. Australia is the first nation in the world to accept the United Nations' global approach to the environment and other such issues. I know that the Opposition agrees with and welcomes that. We all welcome that approach. This is a government of action. The approach involves a land care program and a national soil conservation program. The Murray-Darling Basin is a key feature in these programs. Only last week we had in Parliament House the national launch of the land care program. This is an historic occasion because it is the first time that organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation and the National Farmers Federation have taken a cooperative approach. The Opposition, to its credit, has agreed to work in cooperation with the Government on the issue so that people in the structure that has been set in place know that it has a budget and a direction and that, irrespective of which government is in power-I do not see any prospect of change-they will at least have an assurance that it will be able to continue with its priority and direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the chance to speak this morning to the motion on the Notice Paper from the honourable member for Wakefield. Any attempt by anyone in this place to raise the profile of these environmental issues, and particularly to focus on the issue of soil conservation and land degradation, must be commended. To the extent that the honourable member's motion raises even more awareness and commitment to these issues in the community in general, it is certainly worth supporting. </PARA>
<PARA> But I have to take issue with the second part of the honourable member's notice because it actually calls for the Government to give priority to these issues. I simply have to point out to the honourable member that we finally do have a government in Australia that is giving priority to these issues and that has actually adopted a comprehensive environment statement which has been recognised around the world as the leading position of any government on the environment in general. A key feature of the statement is the commitment to this issue of the Murray-Darling Basin. That commitment is matched with the dollars necessary to make it happen. The real test of the Government's commitment is that those dollars have been provided from real money in a real Budget and not from a minus $9 billion, `hope we could, wish we could, wouldn't it be nice if we could' Budget. This money has actually been provided and it is committed from a real Budget with real dollars. It will really happen, and everybody in this place ought to applaud that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure that I second the motion moved by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), which recognises the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin in the economic development of Australia and its continuing contribution to the nation's primary production and industrial and recreational activities, and calls on the Federal Government to give a higher priority to salinity mitigation. Very few Australians today would not be aware of the environmental problems that this nation faces. In particular, very few would not be aware of the real problems we face in caring for and in rehabilitating Australia's greatest environmental resource-the Murray-Darling Basin. As Malcolm Fraser once said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's greatest natural recurring resource. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been claimed that its resources are worth $10,000m annually to the nation's economy. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, an intergovernmental body that met formally for the first time in August 1986 to promote and coordinate effective management and planning for the basin, brings together 12 Ministers from the Commonwealth and three States. Queensland, which contains one-quarter of the basin, currently holds observer status. One of the first fruits of the Council is the new Murray-Darling Basin Commission, formed by the Commonwealth, Victorian and New South Wales governments to have a coordinated management approach to the resources. This caretaker organisation is aware of the many problems facing the basin, but is frustrated by inadequate funding and long term financial commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that $100m annually is required over the next 10 years to help rectify the problems of salinity, both man made and naturally occurring. The honourable member for Wakefield referred to that when he said that there was just not enough funding for this valuable resource. As a South Australian member of parliament, Peter Arnold, has stated, in broad terms the problem can be rectified by means of on-farm improved irrigation practices, engineering works and reafforestation of the Murray-Darling Basin, both on and off the farm. There is a strong argument, in coordination with the works that I have mentioned, that the residual saline effluent should be piped to the sea. It is the dream of many irrigators, farm users and the general public along the river that this pipe will take the effluent to sea and, therefore, allow the Murray to run free, at least of some of the salt. </PARA>
<PARA> As with most environmental issues, we have instant experts on everything. When I first went to the bush, which is many years ago, I travelled throughout the grazing and irrigation areas. I, like the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), would have looked at those areas and said, `These people are doing something wrong here', or `They are providing too much water. They are sloppy in their attitudes'. But I am not an expert on farming or irrigation. I think the problem we have in our country today is that we have too many instant experts. Certainly we have researchers and people who are looking into these problems and I think we should be advised by them. But people should not go into an area and say, `This farmer is doing it wrong', although he might have been there a lifetime and have made a living from it. Farmers-I include amongst them irrigators-are very environmentally conscious because they have to make a living out of the soil on which they live. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe many civilisations-we all know of them; we have read about them in ancient and modern history-have risen and fallen on their irrigation practices. Some have lasted for thousands of years and others have not lasted very long at all. Egypt, the Nile delta and the Nile River are good examples. Those who have been to Egypt would realise just how important irrigation is to that nation, having only a narrow fertile plain along the Nile River on which to grow its crops. Of course, Australia is a much newer nation and we have a lot to learn. In the main, we have adopted European practices and perhaps those practices have not been as good as we would have liked them to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Referring to what the honourable member for Wakefield said, I know that when Deniliquin and north of the Murray were in my electorate of Riverina-Darling some problems were faced there. Great work has been done to overcome those problems. What the honourable member for Wakefield has said is right: the whole Murray-Darling Basin contains what we call prior streams-salt streams-which continually feed salt into the main river system, particularly in times of drought. If anyone travels through those areas in times of drought he will be able to see in some areas exactly what I am talking about. But certainly irrigation enables a fair amount of salt to go into the rivers. We now have to worry about how to contain that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a particular interest in this because in my electorate I have the Murrumbidgee and the Coleambally irrigation areas. In those areas, as in most irrigation areas, we have a rising water table which we have to do something about. Most of what we have to do will be on-farm. We will have to try to stop the problem there by putting in tillage and by trying to keep the salt levels down. Of course, the overall problem we face is that what we intend to do will require a great deal of money. As I have said, a South Australian member of parliament, Peter Arnold, stated that the whole problem will have to be controlled by improved on-farm irrigation practices; probably large engineering works and reafforestation of the Murray-Darling Basin, both on and off the farm. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken about the River Murray Commission but many organisations will have to be involved in controlling not only the salt menace but also many other pollution problems that we will face. One of the organisations that I wish to speak of today is the famous Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). All honourable members are aware of the CSIRO. They would also know that, over the past few years, it has come upon hard times due to a lack of funding and we are losing some of our best scientists. But, if we are to do something about this water problem in the Murray-Darling Basin, the CSIRO has a major role to play. The CSIRO Division of Water Resources pamphlet states:</PARA>
<PARA> In January 1988, CSIRO, Australia's national research organisation, established the division of Water Resources. The Division will play a major role in research into the use and management of water. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of the Division is:</PARA>
<PARA> To carry out research that will enable public agencies and the private sector to develop improved methods for the definition, use and management of Australia's water resources. Of particular importance is the maintenance of the quantity and quality of urban, rural and industrial water supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Division has a total staff of 230 including 56 research scientists and operates from four sites across Australia-Perth, Adelaide, Griffith-</PARA>
<PARA>which is in my electorate-</PARA>
<PARA>and Canberra. As well, it has strong links with the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre at Albury-Wodonga where it has several staff seconded. One of these, Dr David Mitchell, is Director of the Centre. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr David Mitchell is a well-known scientist who was once stationed in Griffith where I met him and got to know him and respect the work he was doing. Recently I attended the CSIRO establishment at Griffith and met Dr Wayne Meyer, the principal research scientist and crop physiologist, and Kathleen Bowmer, program director of ecology and management of surface water. They have a very responsible job in carrying out research into water not only in the Murray-Darling area but also in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a list of the accomplishments of the CSIRO in the 1980s. In the irrigation system management area it introduced water-run urea for efficient nitrogen fertiliser application; developed aquatic weed control practices in irrigation channels and paddocks; identified crop losses due to waterlogging; and improved soil drainage using gypsum enriched slots. Of course, in all its research it is trying to make the most efficient use of our freshwater supplies and it is trying to stop pollution and salinisation. In the area of environmental and community issues it heightened the awareness of potential water table and wetland salinity problems; identified the cause of odours in drinking water from the Murrumbidgee River; reported on the hazards associated with water recycling following herbicide application; and used aquatic plants for industrial, mining and community waste water treatment. In the area of farmer education-I spoke earlier about how important it is for farmers to be educated, particularly in irrigation areas-it introduced quantitative descriptions of crop growth stages; identified limitations to potential crop productivity; and made estimates of crop water use readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the CSIRO makes a great contribution to the world development of science. Its world scientific contributions were: to develop the use of current weather information for agricultural decision making; to release disease resistant safflower varieties and sunflower breeding lines; to develop systems to study root growth in real world soils; and to improve the understanding of ways to reduce nitrogen fertiliser loss in rice. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time that is available to me I would like to reiterate just how important the CSIRO will be if we are to save the Murray-Darling Basin and if we are to make a good and proper use of the limited water resources that we have in this great nation of ours. I believe that our development will depend on the availability of fresh water and the use we make of it. As honourable members who spoke earlier said, we are not endowed with a great deal of fresh water compared with the Americas, Africa, China and places like that. So let us make the best use of our water. I call on the Federal Government to make sure that the CSIRO gets the funding it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am bubbling with enthusiasm after that. At the outset let me say that I will take it easy and keep my blood pressure down because I am told that that is the normal thing to do. My good friend the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, walked across to me earlier and said, `Bruce, take it easy and don't get stuck into us too hard'. I do not intend to do so. About a month ago I received a box-not a five-foot seven-inch one-containing very nice brochures on Tasmania. The brochures described Tasmania as `an island so much a part of Australia yet so very different' and `rich in heritage and wild in natural beauty'. The contents were all about Tasmania-north, south and west-and all the beauty of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XD4">Mr GOODLUCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And east. They depicted Tasmania's wonderful tourist industry. Alas, things have gone radically wrong since I received that box. For the first time in my life I have been too embarrassed to hand out in Parliament House brochures on Tasmania and to talk about Tasmania. Every time I go to the airport I see a line of taxi drivers who say to me, `Bruce, what are you going to do about the strike?'. They tell me that they are battling to pay their mortgages and get wages. They say, `What are those fellas up in Canberra going to do about it?'. Fortuitously, today Mr and Mrs Keith Farrell from Tasmania and their in-laws from Canberra, Mr and Mrs Burton, joined me for morning tea. I am not lousy. I always give Tasmanians a cup of tea: they deserve it. Those people said to me, `Bruce, the front page of today's Mercury says that the strike is over'-or Mr Hawke said that it is over, which is rot-`Planes are back to normal in Tasmania. Ansett is flying normally'. I spoke to Keith at the airport the day he left Tasmania. It took him seven attempts to leave. The planes were cancelled seven times. Tasmania is going down the tube. Regrettably, we are allowing it to happen. I will not start allotting blame. It would be stupid to do so at the moment because there is so much blame that one could allot it for a fortnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the other day I read an article in the Launceston Examiner, which is not my local newspaper; it is the Hobart Mercury. After being a member of this place for close on 14 years I find that I like some journalists and some do not like me, but never mind. In that article the journalist criticised politicians. He did not name them; journalists never do. They never say, `Goodluck', `Kerr', or whatever. They always say the politicians are not doing enough to solve this strike. I rang the journalist and said, `Why don't you name the politicians that you think are not doing enough to solve this strike?'. The journalist replied, `No, no, no. Everybody is suffering in Tasmania'. I said, `You are not helping matters, you know, by demoralising politicians like me who are trying to get people from Tasmania, who are trying to get sick people back to Tasmania, and who are doing their utmost to achieve the impossible and overcome this strike'. I sent the journalist a white feather in an envelope and he said to me, `Why did you do that?'. I replied, `Because you do not have the guts to tackle me face to face. You have to do it by pen'. I thought that that was the best way of tackling him. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that this very serious strike is a national disaster, and regrettably the island of Tasmania, which is so dependent on tourism, is suffering badly as a result. I have mentioned the taxi drivers. Motel proprietors keep ringing me saying, `Bruce, what are we going to do about this?'. Hotel proprietors say, `We are not getting the people into the hotels'. The casino is not just important to the people who stay there; it is important to Hobart's economy in terms of the food that is provided and all the other things that go on down there. I cannot give these people a definite answer. For the first time in my 14 years in political life I feel helpless in overcoming the problem. Many honourable members are in a similar position. Creeping into this is a bit of politics. I do not want to criticise anybody-the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and Michael Field--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Campbell" NAMEID="CF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XD4">Mr GOODLUCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will do so. The other day after an Australian Labor Party conference they went on television. Looking as angelic as they normally do-they were beautifully garbed and ready for the fray-they said, `Robin Gray is going to Canberra with a group of Hobart dignitaries-the Mayor of Clarence and the Lord Mayor of Glenorchy-and a few business people to try to draw attention to Tasmania's position, but they will not do any good because they will not be able to see Mr Hawke or whoever'. That is typical of what is occurring at the moment. People are trying to be political without getting to the root evil of solving a strike which is having a devastating effect, particularly on Tasmania because we cannot swim across to the mainland or drive our car across. The ferry service is inadequate. We need another ferry. The present one is overloaded to billyo. We depend on planes coming in and taking our people across and we depend on people coming to Tasmania to stimulate our only economy of importance at present-that is, the tourist industry. Christmas is approaching and everybody is worried. They are ready for the peak season. They want to get a bit of money back into their till during a boom Christmas. But regrettably many people have cancelled their visit to Tasmania. Many people are hesitant to go there. That will have a devastating effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everybody knows that I do not like the greens. I do not like single-issue politicians. I do not like somebody who sticks to the birds and the bees and forgets the people. At the moment I am worried about the ordinary people of Tasmania who are battling to make a dollar. I am not so worried about the greens. When all this was at its height-when everybody was talking about the strike and worrying about it-the greens and the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania, because they are in cahoots, were talking about locking up 20 per cent of Tasmania by making it a national park. They were not worried about what was happening to the tourist industry. They were not worried about what was happening to the taxi drivers and the ordinary people involved in hotels and motels-the ordinary people making the beds and doing the little jobs. They are the people I am worried about. They are being laid off. They do not have a voice. They are the ones who are always discarded. I said openly to the greens, `Why don't you start worrying about the ordinary people of Tasmania instead of worrying all the time about wilderness and preserving Tasmania as a park? You are always talking about trees. Why don't you start talking about the people down there? Why can't you, for once in your life, all come together in a conciliatory way and work on overcoming this problem?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Labor Party has a dilemma. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was the great conciliator previously. He seemed to be able to overcome strikes after they had done all their damage, but this time he is unable to do so. I say to him-and many people are saying the same thing-`For God's sake, try to overcome this, even if you have to give an inch'. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who is at the table, nods his head. This important matter is affecting many people. It has got past the laughing point. I know that the Minister is not laughing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was more than enough. I want to talk about the environmental movement today. I have been critical of the media in this country because I believe they have been very slothful in the way they have reported on the environmental movement. But I would like to congratulate the Melbourne Herald for an article it published today. The article was written by Dr Rolf Gerritsen, a very good friend of mine. In fact, he was a foundation member of my faction within the Australian Labor Party. He has had a longstanding association with the Labor Party, having worked for the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) for some time. Dr Rolf Gerritsen is now the senior lecturer in public policy at the Australian National University. I will read this article because it is very good. Hopefully, it will be read by many people. Dr Gerritsen says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wilderness conservation has assumed increasing importance on the political agenda over the last two decades. Following the Franklin Dam issue in the early 1980s, conservationism has gradually achieved a dominant influence on government policy. Indeed, since Senator Richardson's conversion to its nostrums, the conservation movement has become seemingly invincible in the making of resources policy. In part this is because it has managed the media's presentation of environmental and resource management issues better than the advocates of development. </PARA>
<PARA> But the ``greenies'' have also had the considerable political advantage of controlling the moral high ground of ``principle'', while successfully labelling any opposition as inspired by venal self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In reality, of course, many conservationists do have vested interests which are well served by their movement. For example, biological and environmental scientists are advantaged by governmental regulations requiring environmental assessment for large-scale development projects. </PARA>
<PARA> That illustration provides one clue about the distributional implications of wilderness conservation. For in practice conservation measures, like any other governmental interventions, create advantages for some people and disadvantages for others-in other words, winners and losers. </PARA>
<PARA> These redistributions occur in a variety of ways, some not immediately obvious. For example, wilderness conservation can see the imposition of a particular aesthetic of recreation. Restricting access to a wilderness area mostly favours those persons (usually tertiary educated and from leafy suburbs!) who prefer to walk through it communing with nature, as against those persons (most likely neither tertiary educated nor from leafy suburbs) whose preferences lean to challenging nature by traversing bush on a trail bike or in a four wheel drive vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> More serious than such ``social'' redistributions are the economic redistributions following unbridled conservationism. The Commonwealth government's enthusiasm for preventing development projects is threatening, if not Australia's economic future, certainly that of a large segment of our population. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, if we persist in preventing export income-generating projects, unemployment will be an eventual consequence. And it will not be greenies from the urban professional classes that suffer that unemployment but predominantly rural and blue collar workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The greenies argue that tourism to these wilderness areas will replace the employment effects of mining and forestry. Even if this were true it requires the present generation of workers to sacrifice their employment prospects for the next generation. In addition the tourism job market is a very different one from that of Australia's extractive industries. Skilled jobs would be replaced by unskilled jobs. Should our future lie in our children being waiters and cleaners rather than skilled tradespeople?</PARA>
<PARA>I think not. Dr Gerritsen continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There are other economic consequences from shutting down projects such as the Wesley Vale pulp mill and the Coronation Hill mineral prospect. Initially they come principally from the diminution of our future foreign exchange earnings. That means future redistribution of income from the marginal and insecure working class to the educated, secure middle classes. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of social equity this Government's obsession with conservation is paradoxical. Further foreign exchange constraints must eventually be met by extra fiscal restraint by government. Given that governmental transfer payments are most important to the living standards of less privileged Australians, this coming restraint portends decreasing living standards for the weakest in our society. These are the very people the Labor Government has thus far devoted much effort to protecting. </PARA>
<PARA>And that is an effort that I certainly applaud. </PARA>
<PARA> This paradox should not surprise, merely replicating the vacuity of a Commonwealth government ready to give Kodak a $40m production bounty, because it will earn Australia export revenue, while at the same time preventing the paper pulpers and miners from doing the same. </PARA>
<PARA> Another monetary consequence of continuing current account constraints will be the relatively permanent imposition of historically high interest rates. This is okay for the middle-aged ``baby boomers'' and the comfortably off. They have houses either with controlled 13.5 per cent interest rates or most of the principal repaid. Their life cycle has reached the capital gains period of home ownership. But for young couples who wish to enter or have recently entered the housing market, high interest rates are crushing their standard of living. They are paying disproportionately for Senator Richardson's sellout of working people's interests to middle-class consumers of conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> The intergenerational implications of untrammelled conservationism are similarly inequitable. Shutting down the Australian economy to preserve the rustic romanticism of the urban middle classes is going to be paid for by the next generation of taxpayers who will be saddled with the burden of increasing numbers of welfare beneficiaries. This intergenerational effect is exacerbated by the growing antagonism to population growth by the environmental militants. They propose, in effect, that today's numerically smaller generation of children shall bear disproportionately the taxation burden of funding the ``baby boomer'' generation when it becomes aged. </PARA>
<PARA> The greenies have legitimate desires to preserve Australian landscapes unspoilt. But this is achieved at a considerable cost to all Australian citizens. Whether or not we share their preferences we are forced to pay equally for them. So the greenies are obtaining a transfer of economic goods to themselves from the generality of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The ``me-too'' generation is forcing its aesthetic and physic preferences on this and future generations regardless of the economic costs. Militant ``greenies'' are really individualistic ``greedies'' who threaten the economic future of Australia's children. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, that quote is from an article in today's Melbourne Herald entitled `Behind the trees: greenies or greedies' and I think it gives a lot of food for thought. </PARA>
<PARA> This sort of concern has recently prompted me and a few of my colleagues here in Parliament to launch a coalition for sustainable development. We believe that the environment must be protected, but we recognise that environmental protection costs money. It just cannot happen for nothing and it has to be paid for by industry. Industry is generally prepared to pay and I might add that today some of the best conservation efforts are found in the private sector. For instance, in the State of Western Australia, Alcoa of Australia Ltd is now recognised worldwide as being a very good regenerator of forest. The work that the company has done is certainly a pleasure to the eye and will establish for future generations the sort of environment we all like. Similarly, the regeneration work done by APEA, the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, is superb. In many cases one simply cannot see where it has been, and in some cases I would say that the environment has been restored to a condition better than that which existed before its efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> We really do have to come to grips with this as an issue because it afflicts all political parties in Australia, not just the Australian Labor Party or the Liberal Party of Australia. The greenies have managed to create the illusion-and I believe it is an illusion-that they have disproportionate political power and they can guide and control the destinies of governments. If the Government were to change nothing would change as far as they were concerned. They would simply transfer their pressure to the incoming government. Until we get a bipartisan agreement across the political field in Australia that they are just one other competing influence, we will not get any rational debate. The truth is that these people have an open-ended agenda and any compromise that they reach today, they will repudiate tomorrow. One sees examples of this: they make allies when it suits them. For instance, they told us that in Tasmania tourism would replace the blue collar jobs. This was never true. Tourism does provide jobs but they generally tend to be low paid jobs for women and kids; not the skilled blue collar jobs that existed before.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As this Government decays, its lack of principle becomes very clear. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised to abolish child poverty by 1990. He has failed to do so and he now says that he did not mean to use the words he did when he made the promise. The Government has no difficulty whatever in deciding to subsidise a multinational company so that it will remain in Australia. It has no difficulty whatever in subsidising the airlines in order to prolong the pilots dispute. Had it not so subsidised the other employees' wages, the dispute would have been resolved by now. As it is, the dispute could go on indefinitely. The Prime Minister, of course, says that there is no dispute. Well, tell that to anyone trying to run a tourist industry dependent on air travel. Tell that to anyone trying to travel by air in Australia today. Of course there is a dispute and the dispute is compounded by the Government itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has adopted outrageous policies regarding the media. It gives me no pleasure to say this but I must say that I have been warning of this to a point where some people have said I am obsessed. But I cannot be obsessed about something as important as free speech, and the concentration of media ownership in the hands of very few people threatens our capacity to get information and to make judgments about matters that are important to us. As a result of these polices, we have not only a threat to our right to know, but also hundreds of people out of work and the prospect of thousands of others losing their jobs. They will not be subsidised by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow is the fiftieth anniversary of Actors Equity. I hope that its members have a wonderful party in Sydney because its fifty-first year looks very bleak indeed. Hundreds of people are being retrenched from the television networks now and the prospect is that those who work in support industries, such as production houses, will lose their employment as well. Very probably thousands of people will be affected by the absurd policy of this Government, which forced through the Parliament an audience viewing reach in television of 60 per cent. That meant that increased prices were paid for licences because if one managed to get hold of 60 per cent then it seemed that one had the world at one's feet. Massive borrowings were made in order to pay these highly inflated prices. Some of that was made overseas, worsening our balance of payments and, of course, all the borrowings were really subsidised by the taxpayers because the interest is tax deductable. </PARA>
<PARA> The result is that the same taxpayers who subsidised the policy are now suffering from limited programs. The services are being reduced, there is a real prospect that we will have only two networks in the next 12 months and there will be, of course, a loss of Australian content because Australian programs are costly to make, even though they can be sold overseas. We will be virtually deprived of free-to-air television. The networks are afraid of these `people meters' because they will show that sets are not being turned on-there will be a big turn-off. In dozens of speeches I warned of these and other consequences. I also warned of the loss of local programs in regional areas by this absurd policy of aggregating markets. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most distinguished television executives in Australia, Mr Nigel Dick, said the other morning on AM that regional stations were going broke as a result of this policy; they were reducing local programs because these are costly to make; they were even unable to pay the networks the prices that the networks needed to recoup their program costs when the programs were sold on to the regional stations. Mr Dick estimates that by the year 2000 the stations in the four aggregated regions of Queensland, northern New South Wales, southern New South Wales and Victoria, will have lost $800m-that is in current terms. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the print media? The Trade Practices Commission, of course, needs more power. Its recently released report on the lack of competition in Adelaide and Brisbane is very disturbing. The so-called competition is so friendly as to be virtually non-existent. What it amounts to is `warehousing'-that is, where an alleged competitor actually appears to operate as a warehouser for the Murdoch newspapers in those two cities. The report also revealed that originally the Trade Practices Commission had refused Mr Murdoch the right to buy the Canberra Times, but it is now widely believed in the industry-and I certainly believe it-that the Canberra Times is effectively owned by Mr Murdoch. It was of course, we recall, bought by Mr Packer, who had got out of newspapers. He has no interest in newspapers now; he runs magazines very successfully and he loved running television. He did not want to run newspapers at all. He bought the Canberra Times when Warwick Fairfax was obliged to sell it. Then, of course, when Mr Stokes bought the Canberra Times he flew to the United States to talk to Mr Murdoch about the purchase. Mr Murdoch is, effectively, the owner. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting that one of the most senior executives of the former Fairfax empire, Mr Fred Brenchley, who was a distinguished member of the Press Gallery here, has written in a very widely circulated trade magazine that he asked a number of direct questions to the people involved in order to ascertain whether indeed the Canberra Times is effectively warehoused by Mr Stokes for Mr Murdoch. I wish to read part of what he wrote. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if Kerry Packer wasn't warehousing the Canberra Times for Rupert, and if Rupert has no hidden deals over the paper, these should be easily denied by those involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Not so. Direct questions to Trevor Kennedy, managing director of Consolidated Press, Ken Crowley at News Corporation and Kerry Stokes brought forth a fusillade of no comments, but no direct answers to questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions to all three were framed in a brief, direct manner to avoid innuendo. They queried some of the financial stratagems for a third-party involvement in a financial transaction, including put and call options, non-competitive clauses, and profit top-ups, some of which Murdoch used in the sale of his Brisbane and Adelaide afternoon newspapers. All questions could have been answered with a simple ``no''. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course they were not. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While there would be many business people and politicians who wish Kerry's journalists-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Kerry Packer-</PARA>
<PARA>were as passionate about their privacy as he is about his own, Trevor still could have protected that privacy better by ticking off ``no'' to the six questions asked. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead of that he said he was protecting the privacy of Mr Packer. Mr Brenchley continued:</PARA>
<PARA> At News Corp, Ken Cowley was equally adamant on not responding to market rumour. ``The reasons for this policy are purely pragmatic, and include the fact that we are not prepared to waste resources which would be involved in responding to all the questions we receive,'' he said. ``Having this policy, it is obviously better for us not to make exceptions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Brenchley went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I put straight questions and straight answers from Mr Cowley would have saved resources all round and killed the rumours that indeed News Limited is the ultimate owner of the Canberra Times. </PARA>
<PARA> At Kerry Stokes' Australian Capital Equity, spokesman Andrew Cohen said that while it was not company policy to respond to rumours, ``We depart from our well-founded custom so as to stem the irresponsible propagation of rumours''. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The acquisition of the Canberra Times from Consolidated Press Holdings was a cash deal with no unusual conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Canberra Times was 100 per cent beneficially held by entities associated with Stokes. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. All powers of management and control of the Canberra Times were exercised by Stokes as chairman and the other directors on behalf of the company, the staff, and the readers of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Fine, Mr Cohen, but these were not the questions which were asked; and once again a straight ``no'' would have been sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> It's quite odd that media companies with the scar tissue of News Limited and Consolidated Press can't summon up a straight no to a question. </PARA>
<PARA> My own guess is that if Murdoch ever had any ambitions of owning the Canberra Times they were ended by Paul Keating's warning that he should not acquire any more newspapers . . . Still, it would be nice to know . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the policies of this Government have been absolutely outrageous in all of these fundamental ways and history will damn it for them. The Government can talk of its big pictures, but it is letting Australia down in so many fundamental ways that it is truly outrageous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak today about a debate that is going on in the community around Australia on the compelling prospect of `one world or none' and its relationship to the Brundtland report, Our Common Future. I was recently approached by some of my constituents about this campaign and have lodged a number of petitions calling on the Government to take specific forms of action. The people who approached me included representatives of a local church congregation and an urban environmental group. They are concerned citizens who have a commitment to securing the future of their children and who sincerely believe that many young people are in danger of having their natural optimism stamped out by the gloom which tends to pervade our own comments on the future of our world environment. Some of these people have already written to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), voicing their belief in the need to conserve our environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to quote from one of these letters in order to provide the House with an idea of the genuine feeling for humanity and the environment that they convey. My constituent says:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the need to make changes in lifestyle and outlook in order to reduce pollution and other waste, and to ensure as much material is recycled as possible. But there is a limit as to what individuals can achieve. It seems to me that it is also the responsibility of government, as the voice of all Australians, to encourage a clean and healthy environment through the preservation of our forests, the reduction of industrial and other waste and encouragement on a national basis of a reduction in energy consumption via an associated recognition of the need to preserve energy resources . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise my, and my family's position, from a global viewpoint, is an economically-privileged one, and that it is on this basis that I am able to concern myself with this issue. However, that is by no means to lessen its importance. Instead, it highlights the extent of the problem of achieving environmental aims since it is only through addressing the issue of poverty both in an Australian and a world context that awareness of the needs of our planet, and thereby the means of our survival can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter ends by asking what our Government's position is with regard to Our Common Future-the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development-whether a full study of it is under way and whether a formal response will be made to it in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as a brief response from the Prime Minister's office, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has replied to my constituent referring to the Prime Minister's statement on the environment and the consequent fact that the Federal Government is committed to the principle of sustainable development, at both the national and international level as outlined in the Brundtland report. The reply goes on to say that many Government policies and programs are already consistent with the major principles of the report and the specific recommendations are taken into account as relevant issues arise. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituents do not take issue with any of these claims and I am sure that they acknowledge our Government's excellent policy on and work towards conservation of our environment, including a number of decisions which will aid the preservation of important areas of our natural heritage, both nationally and regionally. However, they remain concerned that we, as a Government and a nation, should make a considered response to the content and recommendations of the Brundtland report, given its implications for the international community's attitudes and actions for the future of our world. I concur with this view and believe that the excellence of our Government's record on many aspects of conservation make this response all the more necessary, as it will be useful to other countries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to put the Brundtland inquiry's findings into context now by reading from page 3 of the report, which refers to the time at which the Commission was considering its report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>The World Commission on Environment and Development first met in October 1984, and published its report 900 days later, in April 1987. Over those few days:</PARA>
<PARA> The drought-triggered, environment-development crisis in Africa peaked, putting 35 million people at risk, killing perhaps a million. </PARA>
<PARA> A leak from a pesticides factory in Bhopal, India, killed more than 2,000 people and blinded and injured over 200,000 more. </PARA>
<PARA> Liquid gas tanks exploded in Mexico City, killing 1,000 and leaving thousands more homeless. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion sent nuclear fallout across Europe, increasing the risks of future human cancers. </PARA>
<PARA> Agricultural chemicals, solvents, and mercury flowed into the Rhine River during a warehouse fire in Switzerland, killing millions of fish and threatening drinking water in the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands. </PARA>
<PARA> An estimated 60 million people died of diarrhoeal diseases related to unsafe drinking water and malnutrition; most of the victims were children. </PARA>
<PARA>I also believe that the findings of Our Common Future deserve a hearing. It is only a short quote. The findings are summarised in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> We must all adopt a policy of sustainable development-wherever we live. This means development which does not degrade and destroy global resources. </PARA>
<PARA> We must meet our needs without wiping out the possibility of future generations meeting their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> We must leave behind us forests, soil, clean air and clean water-without these resources future generations will be unable to live. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those are very important recommendations. In her foreword to the report the then Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Harlem Brundtland, indicated that the Commission was addressing governments, but most of all it was addressing people `whose well-being is the ultimate goal of all environment and development policies'. The Commission also calls for `a common endeavour and for new norms of behaviour at all levels and in the interests of all. The changes in attitudes, social values and aspirations that the report urges will depend on vast campaigns of education, debate and public participation'. </PARA>
<PARA> The people are certainly responding with campaigns, contacts and debate. A specific response from the Government would assist in focusing some of this activity, as well as providing them with encouragement and information on the immense undertaking they have begun. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) has raised a number of points concerning the environment, and basically I want to raise a matter today that I believe will certainly assist the Australian environment. I refer to the use of the growing number of farmlets that we have in our countryside. My electorate is on the New South Wales coast between Newcastle and Port Macquarie, and that is an area in which, over the years, quite a number of larger properties have been subdivided. Most of the land that has been subdivided is not good agricultural land, yet there are certain areas that would be most productive if they were treated properly. There are many of these areas-hundreds, in fact-within my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that in those geographical areas of Australia where it is convenient to subdivide land and it is possible for people to live, there will be many property subdivisions in the years ahead. Basically, this depends on the ordinance of the local government body concerned, and the policies of the various State governments throughout the Commonwealth. There has been a tendency, though, to allow people to subdivide land because of the way of life that most Australians want. It has been most noticeable, particularly in the last few years when the price of real estate has risen in the Sydney metropolitan area, that many Sydney people, particularly those who are retiring, have moved to other parts of the State or to Queensland, seeking a better climate and a better way of life generally. Many have had a particular desire throughout their lifetime to move on to these smaller farmlets. </PARA>
<PARA> When I speak of smaller farmlets, I speak of areas from 10, 20, 30 or 40 acres up to 100 acres or even more, depending upon the quality of the soil. As time goes on, it concerns me more that these lands are getting rather run down in some instances. If we look at our farming production within Australia, we have to appreciate that there are a lot fewer farmers today, occupying our rural lands. I do not say that production has fallen overall, particularly in the wheat, sheep, beef and fruit industries, but over the years there has been a decline in the numbers. The family farm has tended to disappear and bigger corporations and more moneyed people are occupying many of the properties. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia itself is looked upon as a country that will be responsible, and is responsible now, for supplying much of the food needs of the world. Many countries want to buy from us and I am very optimistic about the future of primary industry, irrespective of the droughts and the vagaries of the market that occur in this country all the time. I would like to see a close examination, undertaken in company with many of these people and the various agricultural departments. I know that this is primarily a matter for the States but the Commonwealth is involved, particularly in relation to the taxation aspects. I would like deeper thought to be given to the way in which we can make these farmlets productive. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 November there is to be a seminar at Taree in my electorate when officers of the Australian Taxation Office will address the farmers. We have asked them to attend; it is not a political matter, it is aimed at giving advice to people. We are emphasising the fact that we would like the owners of these farmlets to come along. If they are working in town, their wives may be available to attend. We want to encourage these people to make greater use of their soil. When I say `make greater use of the soil', I refer to the planting of trees. The idea of this seminar arose when I was approached by a farm machinery representative who said that he mixed with the farmers and many of these people would like to know what possible taxation concessions were available for them for the growing of certain crops. Some of them have spoken to me as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This is why I mentioned the environment. If we want to improve the environment we have to look at the best way of using soil. Much of the country that these farmlets are on is rather poor; they might be situated on iron bark ridge country; they might be on heavily timbered land; they might be on land that is basically clear of timber. Most of those that come to mind immediately are smaller properties that have very little timber on them. We have to encourage people to plant trees on these small properties. Trees need a lot of care; I have planted a lot myself. I find that rabbits, hares and vermin around the place tackle them and the seasons also, of course, have a big effect on them. </PARA>
<PARA> We must encourage these people to care for their properties. They are living on the spot; they want to improve the look of their property and if there is a possibility of commercial advantage we should encourage this too. That is why I raise specifically this tax issue. The owner of the farmlet might be a person who works in town; he might be a retired person; he might be a pensioner. But the fact is that that land is there and we want to see some use made of it which is of benefit to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to speak not only of growing trees but also of growing vegetables. Not enough people today are growing their own vegetables and fruit in their own backyards and I think that this is a great shame. Perhaps we are too lazy. I have a little plot myself and I like to see my beans, lettuce and potatoes growing. Why not utilise a 10-, 20-, 30- or 40-acre piece of land? Even if a person has only an acre, he or she should be encouraged to develop a small amount of that, to cultivate the land and sell the product in the market. Vegetables and fruit today are pretty expensive. That opportunity is there. That is why I wanted to raise the matter today in the House, to draw attention to a matter that is very important for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, although many people have left the industry, principally for family and economic reasons, we have, coming up behind them, a multitude of smaller property owners. Some of us worry about them because we feel they regard their farmlets as `only a hobby'. Some people come from the metropolitan area, find that they have not got the health or the funds to develop the property and they sell again. We should encourage a certain number of these to recognise the potential of that small amount of land, that they can farm it for their own interests which will, I am sure, keep them in better health. Then, perhaps, they may be able to produce commodities which others can buy. We will have to look very closely at the situation with a view to giving them some encouragement which will then benefit our nation as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is only the second time in seven years that I have participated in a grievance debate. I do so because of my concern about the Liberal Party's action plan. The part of the action plan that I want to discuss is the proposal to scrap the capital gains tax. I believe that the Labor movement throughout Australia should be outraged by this proposal because workers have to pay tax on all of their income; yet the Liberal Party's proposal is that those people who make a capital gain and can get around the loose taxation laws that will replace the capital gains tax, will pay no tax on that income. It is a step backward-back at least five years into the sort of situation we had before where people could shuffle paper and arrange their affairs in such a way that they paid no tax at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose what is really galling about this is Mr Elliott's-and I will only refer to Mr Elliott once-statement that the action plan was `taking money off the bludgers and giving it to the workers'. In this case, the removal of a capital gains tax, exactly the reverse would be true. The Liberal Party proposes to take money off the workers and give it back to the bludgers, the tax bludgers who are always in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to a couple of statements made in the press and elaborate somewhat on them: What is in a name? `McCrann on Sunday' in the Sunday Herald said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Libs have called it a speculative gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only guess they chose the title because there would be considerable speculation as to whether anyone in Australia would be dumb enough to ever pay it. As well, we could all start `speculating' on how much income tax it enabled people to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA>I will touch on that a little later because people can avoid it and the sums are quite staggering. Ken Davidson in the Age asked, `Who will get the windfall profits from this?'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> If the coalition wins the next election, the capital gains liability on asset appreciation between 1985 and now will be retrospectively abolished and the windfall of $450 million-</PARA>
<PARA>those are the Liberal Party's figures-</PARA>
<PARA>in the first year will go virtually exclusively into the pockets of the richest members of society who have been notorious in escaping from wage restraint, have benefited greatly from the property and share boom and have received the biggest marginal tax rate cuts from what used to be laughingly called, the Hawke Socialist Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of the capital gains tax would once more open up the tax avoidance industry. Creative accountants and lawyers will market schemes to the rich to turn taxable income into non-taxable capital gains. </PARA>
<PARA>In my State of Western Australia we know all about that with the bottom of the harbour schemes that flourished during the previous Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke before about who will benefit. There is just one statistic that will show who does benefit from this action plan. In the 1987-88 financial year, the take from capital gains tax for those people earning $50,000 and over-not the poorest people, but those in the top income bracket-was $78.5m. A total of 9,963 individuals collectively paid $78.5m in capital gains tax. On average, that works out at $7,900 per annum for each individual, or $150 a week. So the abolition of the capital gains tax really means a cut in tax of $150 a week for those people earning $50,000 and over who are subject to the tax. One does not have to be Einstein to know that they are the richest people in society. They are the people who will benefit from the action plan. While the Liberals might throw a few crumbs to the middle income earners, overwhelmingly it is people on high incomes who will gain from the abolition of the capital gains tax-and that is only for the 1987-88 financial year. What we are really seeing is a dramatic build-up because over time it will escalate quite rapidly as more and more assets get caught up in the capital gains tax net. To do away with it and retrospectively take the situation back to 1985 is, in my view at least, criminal in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> Daryl Dixon, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, points out, quite rightly, that the rich will not only get the benefit once, but they will actually get it twice. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the ill-considered capital gains tax proposal (estimated to cost some $500 million annually), the Opposition has not exposed itself to obvious criticism. </PARA>
<PARA>If one looks at the action plan in detail, one sees that perception meter politics has taken over. One does not have to be an Einstein to know that putting the boot into the disabled and the poorest members of society-Aboriginal people, the long-term unemployed and recently arrived migrants-gets some votes in some parts of Australia. That is what the Liberal Party is counting on. As the Canberra Times headline said, `Appeal to greed by Coalition'. It really is. Putting the boot into those sorts of people will always get a few votes. Daryl Dixon, of the Sydney Morning Herald, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax proposal will involve a much higher cost than that revealed by the Opposition and opens avoidance opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>I have touched on that. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition proposes to replace the present capital gains tax by a speculative gains tax, which exempts all gains on assets owned for longer than five years. </PARA>
<PARA>He then made this point:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal will open negative gearing opportunities for taxpayers owning assets for five years or longer. Such investors will be able to get tax deductions for investing to obtain tax-free capital gains, a clearly inequitable situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite right. On the way through one is getting a tax deduction in buying the asset; when one sells the asset one gets it tax free again. Any money one takes out to buy the asset is tax deductable, and so is the asset when one finally gets rid of it. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Labor movement must act. What I propose to do today is this: I am organising a drive across Australia for signatures on a petition to keep the capital gains tax. I believe that this is one area where this Government can be clearly seen to be a government that cares about the average family, those who are never touched by the capital gains tax. The capital gains tax is paid by 0.8 per cent of the taxpaying public-less than one per cent. Put another way, 99.2 per cent of people never pay it. I believe that with odds like that on our side we can mount a substantial case against the Liberal Party's proposal on the capital gains tax. I will be circulating the petition, not only to back bench members of this Government, but also to back bench members across Australia and those in the Labor movement. What the Liberal Party has not realised is that there is no great push in the Australian community to get rid of the capital gains tax. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) quite rightly referred to this in Question Time earlier in the week. People out there are not calling on us to get rid of the capital gains tax. The Australian Financial Review, quite rightly, says:</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, whatever the outcry, particularly from rural areas, people have come to accept the Government's existing capital gains tax. If the Opposition had not chosen to make it one, it would not have been a political issue. </PARA>
<PARA> By putting it on the agenda, the Opposition has created a political issue by proposing a weak and philosophically unconvincing proposition. Its policy response, instead of showing some fiscal spine, lacks philosophic coherence and will harm revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Amen to that! Through the petition on capital gains tax that I am organising and circulating throughout Australia, the Labor Party can mount a massive campaign against this proposal by the Liberal Party to take from the workers and give to the tax bludgers, to bring back the bad old days of tax avoidance and to bring back the sort of paper shuffling bottom of the harbour schemes that we saw not so many years ago under the Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that when we present these petitions to the Parliament, we will have collected hundreds of thousands of signatures from people across Australia. This will enable us, as members of parliament, to make sure that the Australian population knows just what will happen if the Liberal Party were ever to sit on this side of the House again and implement a silly proposal to get rid of the capital gains tax. We will wipe the floor with the Opposition on this one. It just shows how sophisticated the Australian people have become in just eight short years, because the Liberals used to scare them with the spectre of a capital gains tax, but not now. That tax has now been in place for four years and the people out there know what it is all about. The Opposition will not get away with this again; it has made a major slip on this one. I believe that if the petition I am organising is as successful as we can make it, then Opposition members will have egg all over their faces and in the end they will have to back down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard the voice of fear from the Labor Party which sees electoral disaster looming. I want to address a question which arises in the pre-election crisis that that Party is going through-that is, the bail-out of Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd by this Government. Some $36m of taxpayers' funds are being committed in this pre-election period to bail out a wholly-owned subsidiary of a United States corporation. The questions that arise are: What is the deal? What is the Government's economic track record? How does it relate to this deal? What about the position of ordinary people under this Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the deal with Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, which is the second largest manufacturing exporter from Australia. That tells one a great deal about the state of Australia's manufacturing industry-the fact that, after seven years of this Government, the second largest manufacturing exporter is a foreign-owned corporation. That corporation is going through a rationalisation process, As part of that rationalisation process, Kodak intends to close plants in different parts of the world and Australia has been selected as one of those to be closed. There are no prizes for guessing the reason. The reason is, of course, that Australia is not regarded as a good place in which to invest. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking about the subsidiary of a small company. Let us have a look at the track record of the US parent company, Eastman Kodak over the last five years. Between 1984 and 1988, there was a 15.2 per cent sales growth on average. What were the sales? Sales for the last financial year were just over $US17 billion. In this same period there was a 12.8 per cent growth in net income-that is, after taxes. Its pre-tax income for 1988 was $US2.236 billion, and its post-tax income was $US1.397 billion. This is the owner of the subsidiary that we intend to bail out. Its pre-tax income for 1988 was greater than this Federal Government's forecasted spending on housing and community amenities, culture and recreation, transport and communications, law and order and public safety, foreign aid or general scientific research. In 1988 Eastman Kodak paid $US5.1 billion for an acquisition. This company should be able to look after itself. Certainly, its subsidiary did not need the hand of the Australian taxpayer to reach out and help it. But it is said that Kodak has fallen upon hard times; its recent figures have been bad, so the decision has been made to rationalise. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Australian subsidiary, which has been here for a long time. According to the Australian Financial Review of 30 April 1984, an investment in plant and machinery in previous years has paid off. It noted that:</PARA>
<PARA>Profits before tax for the 14-month period to December 31 of $32.8 million are double the previous 12 months' earnings . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Kodak says that in 1985-86 another $100m was provided by the parent company as an investment in the Australian subsidiary to fund export expansion, capital investments and working capital needs. Why close it down? The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has praised Kodak. He said in a statement on 30 October 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>We had to recognise that we were at a major turning point. Either Kodak's successful Australian manufacturing operation be closed or it could become a major on-going export earner. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said that the $36m that we are to provide in bounty payments `will be invested by Kodak in further improving the competitiveness of what is already a world class operation'. We should note those words, `successful Australian manufacturing operation' and `competitiveness of . . . a world class operation'. Why has this competitive, world class operation been closed down? Let us look at some of the answers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coburg plant, which is the headquarters of the Australian operation, has 18 unions and 18 awards. According to the corporate affairs manager, who was reported in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 22 September this year:</PARA>
<PARA>The thing that makes the difference from country to country is the costs from the factory gate, infrastructure, freight and how much support can be given to location including export support . . . That is where Australia is presently disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>We should note the opening words, `the costs from the factory gate'. Let us now look at a Kodak issues paper, which tells us about Kodak's situation and why it needs help. One of the things said in it is this:</PARA>
<PARA>At alternative sites, Kodak's manufacturing exporters enjoy benefits not available in Australia such as special economic zone, tax advantages, freight subsidies and better work practices. </PARA>
<PARA>To cap things off, the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) has looked at Kodak. Its report is referred to in the article in the Australian Financial Review to which I referred, and this is said of it:</PARA>
<PARA>The BIE found the Australian plant had the highest wastage figures as a proportion of input, while Brazil had the lowest . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The cost of labour also differed significantly. Australia had both the shortest working week and the lowest number of standard working days-the number of working days before overtime was paid. Australia had 206 working days, following by Britain with 210, Canada 233 and Brazil 235. </PARA>
<PARA>Brazil also had the lowest rate of absenteeism with 2 per cent compared to Canada and Australia at around 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the answers, the reasons. Kodak has gone to the Government, knowing that the Government is in political difficulties and an election is coming up in a few months, and has said, `Give us the money or we will close down the plant and reveal the shambles of your economic and industrial policies and what a shambles and a disastrous state the country is in'. We all know that is what has happened. It did not say, `We have to consider this on a rational basis and we would like some help'. It knew it had the Government over the barrel. </PARA>
<PARA> When we hear a subsidiary of a foreign company speaking about work practices and costs at the gate, we know it is saying, `This country, in which we have invested for many years, is uncompetitive and cannot compete with other countries'. That is a verdict on us. It is saying, `Liquidate and perhaps we can screw some money out of the Australian taxpayer'. This company certainly screwed some money out of the Australian taxpayer-$36m. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how my electorate would like to see that money spent. I wonder how that reflects the concerns in my electorate-not at all. People in my electorate and every electorate around this country are concerned about interest rates on homes and businesses. What has this Government done? It has jacked them through the roof. People want a chance to get ahead. The Government has given them no chance to get ahead at all, given inflation and interest rates of 22, 23, 24 or 25 per cent. Those are the rates people in small businesses are paying for overdrafts. People want a real economic future for their kids. Kodak tells us there is no economic future for Australia so long as the country is run by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, run by a crowd that has learnt nothing and forgotten everything. </PARA>

<PARA>And if I could only win your love</PARA>
<PARA>What a wonderful world this would be. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the wonderful world that the honourable member for Wentworth would bequeath to Australia. The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who is holding up a piece of paper on which is written `3 out of 10', is being very cruel. </PARA>
<PARA> The world of the honourable member for Wentworth is based on the quaint notion that, despite 89 years of industrial history in this country, despite the presence of very strong trade unions in various sectors of the economy and despite the fact that we are enjoying record employment growth and large periods of demand, somehow we could have a system of enterprise wage bargaining which would result in wages falling, not rising. We would not have the situation where metal workers or building workers would go to their employers and say, `The employment growth is strong and there is a shortage of skills, so we expect, in return for those shortages, to have our wages increased'. That would not happen; what would happen is that the Builders Labourers Federation and the Building Workers Industrial Union and their respective employers on individual job sites would agree that the wages should be linked to gains in productivity, and that would put a good clamp on the level of wage increases. When that magically happens, inflation will fall and the floor under interest rates also will fall. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the magical, wonderful fantasy world that the Opposition and the honourable member for Wentworth want Australia to believe in. It may be a wonderful world or a perfect world, but it is not the real world. The real world is where trade unions play a legitimate part in negotiating positions for their members and, where they are in a strong industrial position, they can extract-and have extracted in the past-large wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> That only has to be examined against the recent past in 1980-81 and 1974, when we had a wages free-for-all and collective bargaining. The centralised wage system was ignored and abandoned for the idea of collective bargaining and face to face negotiations at the work face, without any overriding central system to control it. Did wages simply go up in terms of productivity? Did wages magically trend down, so that inflation and interest rates fell? Unfortunately for the honourable member for Wentworth and for those who have to live in the real world, such as the Government, the Treasurer and my colleagues, that did not happen. We had a wages explosion, and interest rates and inflation soared. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are serious about our economic direction and grappling with our very real problems, we must face up to the realities; not the fantasies and hopefulness of magical, marvellous different sorts of worlds in which the honourable member for Wentworth would like us to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> We find ourselves in the real world of industrial relations, and we need a real practical solution to control wage pressures. That practical solution is provided by the wages and incomes accord worked out between the Government, the trade union movement and most of the employer organisations throughout Australia. The system protects those in weak industrial positions, restrains those in strong industrial positions and delivers to our nation and economy a level of wage growth below the inflation rate which is enabling productivity to increase through negotiation at the work face, and also is improving the profit shares of businesses to enable them to improve employment prospects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw to the attention of the House an advertisement on page 11 of yesterday's Australian, entitled `How to make the Australian Government pay for your medicine', which relates to the very topical pharmaceutical benefits scheme. As a result of a telephone call this morning from one of my constituent pharmacists, I draw to the attention of the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) two points of error in the advertisement: firstly, the paragraph on the left-hand side of the advertisement states that the price for prescriptions charged is a fair one set by an independent tribunal. This is not true. It was a price suggested to the Government and accepted by it and no-one else. Government officers who were phoned on the 008 number admitted that the advertisement was misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, on the question of the yellow book price referred to in the advertisement, no-one in the Health Insurance Commission could confirm that there is a legal requirement for the pharmacists to show the book to anyone. Furthermore, it is not a yellow book, but a primrose book, which is now out of date. It came some 12 months ago, and the chemists agreed to show it to customers if they inquired about prices. The yellow book, which is the official list of pharmaceutical benefits, was never intended to be available to the public. In my constituent's view, this is yet another Government avenue of inviting the general public to `dob in its friendly local chemist' in its continuing conflict with the Pharmacy Guild. I hope that the Minister will take immediate steps to correct the errors. </PARA>

Some 34 per cent of the unemployment beneficiaries in my electorate have been on unemployment benefits for longer than 12 months.

That is the record of the Government. The Government has served the interests of the long term unemployed and the welfare recipients in the community, and it has done it well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today my friend the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) spoke about the effect of the pilots dispute on Tasmania, and I strongly support the comments made by him. All of Australia is absolutely amazed at the outrageous statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the pilots dispute has ended. One can only conclude that for the Prime Minister to make such an outrageous claim he must be living in some self-created fantasy land. Clearly, the dispute has not ended and anyone who goes to an airport and tries to get a seat on an aircraft knows jolly well that the pilots dispute has not ended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The association between the Prime Minister and Sir Peter Abeles during this dispute has been given much currency. I consider that the association also between the Prime Minister and his friends at the Australian Council of Trade Unions, particularly Mr Crean and Mr Kelty, in their efforts to protect the wages accord between the Government and the ACTU, is having as much impact on perpetuating this dispute as is the association between the Prime Minister and Sir Peter Abeles. One knows from the comments made in this House and other places that the protection of the wages accord is more important in the mind of the Prime Minister than the resolution of the pilots dispute. I hope, for the sake of Australia and to get our economy back together, that he will give more consideration to our airline services. </PARA>

I had not intended to speak on the matter, but if someone attacks the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), it behoves Government members to speak up on its behalf. We owe a lot to Kelty and Crean for the tremendous role they have played in the wages accord. If the Opposition had its way with the pilots dispute, there would be a gung-ho approach, we would all be going for a 30 per cent pay rise and the whole of the economy would be wrecked. The ACTU has played a very constructive, positive and objective role in the wages accord, which is one of the reasons why the economy has held up so very well in very trying times. Government members are very proud of their association with the ACTU. We do not run away from it, we do not deny it and we are very proud to be part of the ACTU movement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. On the Pru Goward program this morning, the Minister said that there was some evidence that people within the Government were cynically exploiting the environment for votes, and criticised the anti-development part of the Government and others who think there are votes in it. Would the Minister name those who are cynically exploiting this issue? Does he include the Prime Minister among this lobby he referred to? Is the Minister intending to resign from the Cabinet in protest at this deliberate and cynical economic irrationality which he finds not only offensive, but also contrary to the economic interests of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently on the back of the hand of the Leader of the National Party is, `Call for a Minister to resign'. This is absolute hypocrisy from the Leader of the National Party. This is the National Party that talks about bringing back the gallows. Part of the reason why Ahern went was the move by the National Party to bring back the gallows. The National Party's policy is: if it grows, chop it down; it it moves, shoot it. That is what it is on about. The difference between this Government and the National Party is that after decades of neglect this Government has given the country the Decade of Land Care. The National Party has never focused on the environmental issues of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I have been trying to make is that nearly every area of industry under my control, in my portfolio, is under attack by various environmental movements. There is a lot of misrepresentation. I think it is a very good thing if there is a healthy debate, but someone has to balance the whole question out.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of green consumerism. In Europe we face hormonal growth promotion bans on our meat. There is very little scientific fact in that at all-the European Community even said that there is no scientific fact in it-but because there is a green consumerism movement, our meat is banned. Unless someone takes a stand against some of these movements, we will lose more trade because some of the green issues will be used as trade barriers to our goods.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem we face all the time is that our fruit and vegetables have to be chemically free. This is the latest call. Again, the whole question of chemicals is being misrepresented. If a store has some crook apples, it puts a sign on them saying they are organically grown, doubles the price, and it has solved its problem. This is the sort of thing we have to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA> There are people within the Australian Labor Party, as there are people within the Liberal Party, who share those views. There is a very active green network within the Labor Party and I think it is a very good thing because there have been years of neglect in this country. Decisions were taken in the interests of the `develop at all costs' crowd which was most represented by the National Party. There is only one banana republic in this country and that is Queensland, where the developers were on the roll for 32 years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Community Services and Health been drawn to reports that hospital charges in New South Wales are to be reduced? Can he inform honourable members of the implications of this decision for privately insured people in both New South Wales and Queensland?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2360" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the New South Wales Government has backed down on its decision to force private patients in public hospitals to pay a $10 a day out-of-pocket surcharge. I welcome this as a victory for the privately insured and for commonsense. I think we need to look at the background to this decision. Hospitals have now reduced their charges from $170 to $160 a day. That means that they have effectively abolished the surcharge that they have applied for the last four months. I am delighted that sanity has prevailed in New South Wales and that the Government has finally accepted, after four months, my original compromise proposal that the increase in public hospital private in-patient charges should be held down to $10 a day, which was roughly equivalent to the rise in the consumer price index (CPI).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that I refused to accede to the New South Wales Government's request to approve health insurance benefits to cover the proposed new day charge of $170 from 1 July; that is, I was not prepared to endorse a 13 per cent increase in charges from $150 to $170 a day, almost twice the rise in the CPI, particularly as this was the second increase of that magnitude. Hospitals in New South Wales have had a 31 per cent increase in 12 months. I informed the New South Wales Minister that the increase was unjustified and had the potential not only to force private insurance premiums up, but also to force people out of private health insurance. I told the New South Wales Minister that we could approve only $160 a day, in line with the CPI. Nevertheless, he went ahead and charged $170 a day and private in-patients had to pay the extra $10 out of their own pockets.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision was unpopular with patients. It was disapproved of by the funds and their organisation, the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia (VHIAA). I would like to thank both the funds and the VHIAA for making their views forcefully known both to the New South Wales Government and to private patients. It is a pity that the Federal Opposition, which prances around here pretending to be interested in the privately insured, never made a single statement supportive of the Government's stand. Nevertheless, the New South Wales Minister has admitted that he was wrong and that my prediction was accurate; that is, that if he went on with this policy it would simply force privately insured patients to opt to be public patients in the public hospitals. Of course, like many people forced to admit the error of their ways, the Minister scuttles out casting excuses and claims that the Commonwealth had cut funding to the New South Wales hospitals. That was his excuse for putting on the charge. That is utter rubbish.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the new Medicare funding arrangements this year New South Wales hospitals received $1,200m from the Commonwealth-an increase of 8.7 per cent in front of the rate of inflation. As the honourable member for Forde knows, while sanity prevails in New South Wales, the Queensland Government, which just simply copied the New South Wales procedure and raised its charges to private in-patients in public hospitals to $170 a day-a rise of 30 per cent in 11 months-is continuing to force patients to pay a $10 out-of-pocket surcharge. The Queensland hospitals are experiencing the same difficulties as the New South Wales hospitals as a result of this policy-indeed, the issue was discussed in the Queensland Cabinet this week-but unlike New South Wales the Queensland Cabinet has stuck with a policy which is absurd in its own interests and in the interests of private patients. I am confident that that will be one further reason why the people of Queensland will reject the Queensland National Party Government at the coming election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only in my Party, but throughout the country and in the Western countries generally, on this issue of the environment and development there are perfectly legitimate differences of emphasis. There are those who, in regard to a particular issue, would see that the emphasis should come down in terms of a particular development, while others would say that environmental considerations should outweigh the particular developmental considerations on that issue. This is not something of which we should be afraid or about which we should be surprised. Indeed, it is the very essence of sensible government, as indeed it is the essence of sensible debate in a democracy. Where people rigorously hold particular emphases they should express them. And so it is in my Cabinet. When an issue like, for instance, the development of Coronation Hill was before the Cabinet there were differences of emphasis as to what the proper approach should be. But, intelligently, we allowed debate and discussion on that issue, a decision was taken and every Minister of the Government supports the decisions that have been taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Social Security to the very significant decline in the number of unemployment beneficiaries-down from 635,000 in 1983 to 363,000 now-and to the equally significant decline in the number of people unemployed for nine months or more, which is down from 257,000 in 1984 to 159,000 now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question, knowing his concern about the issue of unemployment, particularly the issue of long term unemployment as it affects rural and provincial areas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about people who the Leader of the Opposition suggested would need to be impoverished to be eligible for special benefit. I ask: What would the honourable member for Wentworth do if the Administrative Appeals Tribunal said that it was illegal to administer special benefit in the way he suggests-that is, illegal simply to make the amount of money fit the number of people one wants to pay-and started exercising its legal powers to grant benefits to people who the honourable member says should not get them? Remember that the Leader of the Opposition has made it perfectly clear that the criteria will not change. But what the honourable member for Wentworth says is, `If, under the criteria, we are spending too much money, we will make the money fit the number of people'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, I ask a question in relation to people who qualify for special benefit. It is a serious question and one that goes to the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition. Have the people to be demoted, if you like, to special benefit by the honourable member for Wentworth been classified as people no longer of interest to the labour market? For example, would it be mandatory-as it is under this Government-to register with the Commonwealth Employment Service for someone transferred to special benefit? Would it be mandatory actively to seek work each fortnight, as it is for someone on unemployment benefit but certainly not for someone on special benefit? Would it be mandatory personally to lodge an application to have unemployment benefit continue each fortnight-again, as it is under our administration? Would the benefit be cancelled if a person moved to a low employment area? Or would all those current controls on unemployment benefit be dropped, or not relevant, as currently they are not relevant to the criteria with respect to special benefit?</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, what would happen to the Newstart strategy described last week by the honourable member for Bradfield as `spectacularly successful'? Would the employment entry payment be abolished? Fourteen thousand people have taken up the employment entry payment so far this year. Would it be abolished? Would the joint Social Security-Commonwealth Employment Service interviews be abolished? Would the provisions for long term unemployed people to receive benefit while undertaking approved training or voluntary work be abolished? In other words, would the links between this system of benefit and the possibility of re-entry to the labour market be smashed and broken, and those people sunk in the sink of the poverty trap of special benefit?</PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that this Opposition should put a proposition to this Parliament with respect to unemployment benefit regarding those people who have been unemployed for more than nine months as the centrepiece of its savings strategy, supposedly to assist families, and not ask itself quite fundamental questions-questions, for example, about individual people.</PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House are going to do what needs to be done, that is, we are going to ask questions, not in the abstract; we are going to ask questions about individual people. We will go to electorates in which there will be, for example, a 44-year-old widow whose children have just finished school, and who has not had a job since she was married 25 years ago, and we are going to say, `Does she get special benefit?'. Is that all the Opposition can offer-special benefit? The Leader of the Opposition can laugh, but I do not laugh about the unemployed and I do not laugh about the poor. I ask the members of the National Party, those who still have some lingering compassion, about the options for the 40-year-old ex-farmhand who lives in a small town and whose back can no longer handle heavy work. Is he to be written off? Is he to go into the sink, into the scrapheap?</PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the Opposition argues that $1,145m can be taken out of social security and transferred to some of the wealthiest people in the community. The Opposition asks this Parliament to believe that an error of something of the order of half a billion dollars in the estimate of those savings is to be disregarded. The Opposition asks us to believe that somehow there is some fairness and equity in what it proposes. More importantly-and I end on this point-the Opposition asks us and those who observe to believe the incredible.</PARA>

If one looks at the way in which the formulation of economic policy has been followed in the period since we have been in government, one will see that a centrepiece of the formulation and the execution of that policy has been the very sensible concept of having detailed discussions with the trade union movement in this country. That has enabled an outcome of which this country is entitled collectively to be proud. I remind the honourable gentleman who asked the question just what has come out of this process in the past. As a result of giving ourselves an arm of policy which in government members opposite completely eschewed, that is, a wages policy, we have been able, firstly, to turn around the most massive recession in the history of this country-a recession we inherited from members opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>

We promised this country that we would move away from that negative growth situation that members opposite gave us-simultaneous double digit unemployment and inflation-and that we would do it on the basis of an accord with the trade union movement whereby we would say to it that it made a great deal of sense that, rather than making its claims on employers for excessive money wage increases, it should exercise considerable restraint in its money wage claims and, in return for that restraint, the Government would undertake expenditures in the area of the social wage.</PARA></TALK.START>

What I am about to say is directly relevant to the question that has been asked in respect of how we will conduct the economic policy of this country next year. If one looks at that graph one will see what has happened as a result of the discussions with the trade union movement. Whereas in the past economic growth as measured by the overtime rate was going up with wages following it and then the country moving straight into recession, under this Government the growth has gone right up in record terms and wages have remained flat. That has happened because at the appropriate time in the formulation of economic policy we sat down with the trade union movement and said that there was an alternative to excessive money wage increases. That approach has been spectacularly successful in getting the country out of the worst recession in 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that the average annual rate of economic growth has been twice as high under this Government as was the case under the previous Government, and the rate of employment creation has been five times faster under this Government than it was under the previous Government. That has not been achieved by accident; it has been achieved by making the decision at the appropriate point to talk with the trade union movement about what the wages policy will be for the next 12 months and what the relationship of that wages policy will be to what happens in the areas of taxes and social wages. As we have been spectacularly successful in the past in having these discussions and producing these economic results, at the appropriate time next year we will again have similar discussions with the trade union movement.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2365" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member, I point out that I have seen such statements, particularly from the Opposition and most notably in its so-called Economic Action Plan, where it is stated that there has been a stalling of reform on coastal shipping. Such statements are totally off beam. The fact is that coastal shipping is going through a program of substantial structural change and over the next three years there will be the most wide-ranging reform of the coastal shipping industry in its history. It will result in the crew sizes of Australian ships being at Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development levels by the middle of 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the program of reform that we have implemented. The brief has been, firstly, to give effect to the Crawford report, which provided for some reduction in crew numbers. We then established the Maritime Industry Development Committee, which came up with a further reform package to modernise the industry, and particularly to reduce further crews on new ships. We then established the ship reform task force, which reported to the Government earlier this year. It proposed further reforms not just to reduce further crew sizes on new ships but for recrewing existing ships.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that I can now advise the House that, under the auspices of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority, the industry parties have now agreed on the recrewing program to apply over the next three years. For pre-Crawford ships-that is, ships that came in before the Crawford reforms-there will be an average reduction of four in crew size from the end of this year and a further reduction of two by the middle of 1992. For ships which came in under the Crawford program, there will be an average reduction of six in the next three years, most of which will occur in the next 12 to 18 months. Altogether, the reforms will reduce crew numbers in Australia by 640, and half of that number will be from the end of this year. This means that in the Australian fleet the average size of a crew, which was 33 when we came into office, will fall to 25 by the end of this year and is well on track to be 21 by the middle of 1992 as a result of the introduction of lower crewed ships and the conclusion of the recrewing program. In relation to the tug industry, which was not affected by the shipping reform task force, we now--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought members of the Opposition were interested in coastal shipping. They are always saying that we are not doing anything about it. Now when I tell them what we are doing they do not want to listen. They cannot take it. I have a report from the towage industry review committee. It recommends reducing the maximum crew size in a tug involved in harbour work to five and for those on open sea operations to nine by the end of this year. That will reduce crew numbers on tugs by 145, or 13 per cent, by the end of next month. There will be a further reduction in the maximum crew sizes to four by the end of 1992, reducing crew numbers by a further 190, which will bring about overall reductions over the three-year period of 335, or 29 per cent, and reduce the total towage industry costs by 15 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear that, far from progress being stalled in relation to coastal shipping, or the shipping industry in its broader sense-because this relates not just to coastal shipping but to our overseas ships as well-we are seeing a dramatic program of reform. As distinct from the previous Government, this Government has taken a number of steps to bring about substantial reform. As a result, by the middle of 1992 we will see Australian ships operating with crews at the same level as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average, which is something that the previous Government could never have hoped to achieve.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The system of family payments which the Government inherited from the conservatives was one that was poorly targeted. It was set without reference to the cost of caring for children, particularly for low income families. It was certainly not indexed. The result was that the payments declined over time. Arising from the very detailed and rigorous analysis of the Social Security Review, the Government has been restructuring family assistance arrangements. We have introduced the family allowance supplement. In each year that we have been in government we have raised the additional pension and benefit rates for children, substantially increased family allowance rates, met standards of adequacy central to our fight against child poverty and introduced for the first time ever the indexation of family payments, including the family allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has given a great deal of thought to issues relating to family assistance and has placed the issue of child poverty squarely on the political agenda. That policy had generally been supported by the Opposition. It is particularly difficult to get much sense of Opposition policy when there are so few questions directed to these matters. The family allowance supplement, the honourable member for Bradfield said recently, provides significant support for Australian families. He also said that the coalition, when in government, would continue to provide indexation for those payments. Senator Chaney, in an interjection the other week, confirmed that that indeed was the Opposition's view. However, last Friday, a spokesman for Mr Peacock was reported in the Australian Financial Review. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Opposition would maintain the Government's programme in its first years of Government . . . However, he said `We have not, as yet, made any decision on the details of expenditure in our second and third years, including any decision not to maintain indexation on family allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>The previous day, Senator Chaney was saying, `There is no problem. We are right behind you'. The day before that, Mr Connolly was not only congratulating the Government but also saying that indexation was part of the Opposition's policy. Mr Peacock set the issue straight on Thursday night and his spokesman's remarks were published in the Australian Financial Review on Friday. In a real sense this is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed in terms of the policy of the Opposition. We hear a great deal of cant from the Opposition about the Government, the Government's attitude to families and what the Government has or has not done.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Government has proceeded to do fundamentally is to achieve reform. Reform is not only about achieving a fairer distribution of income and recognising families; it is also about sustaining those reforms. That is why I do not think it would cause any great surprise that Bishop Hollingworth of the Brotherhood of St Laurence was prompted to produce a statement last Thursday headed `Coalition economic package will divide nation'.

<PARA>Before the Opposition clarified its situation, Bishop Hollingworth said that it was something of a lottery and depended on inflation. The following day, the Leader of the Opposition made it clear in the Australian Financial Review that we should forget about indexation because it has no reality in Opposition policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all the issues in Australia today and in the areas covered by my portfolio, this is the best that the shadow Minister can come up with! The term `yellow book' is the colloquial reference to the document in which this information has been provided for many years. I do not know what is said to people who ring on the hotline. The prices for pharmaceuticals are available in both books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Right throughout Australia, people are concerned about the prices that they are paying for medication, and quite rightly so. Under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, Australians have the right to receive medication at the appropriate price; that is, free for pensioners, $2.50 for concessionary card holders and up to $11 for general patients. People have a right to know the price they should be charged for medication, particularly if the item is to be included on their prescription record form, the safety net card. That has not always been the case and ordinary Australians need to have that information. To carry that information from chemist to chemist would be very difficult, considering the number of items covered by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The hotline is provided to give people that advice. Judging by the genuine calls, people are quite happy with the advice that they are receiving.</PARA>
<PARA> While we are talking about the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, let me outline what the Opposition has not yet proposed in relation to its health policy. This year, the Government has provided more than $1,200m to fund the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to ensure that people get access to the medication they deserve, but nothing has been heard from the Opposition. It is afraid to release its health policy because it would diminish its very low to minimal changes in the Queensland and South Australian elections.</PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition was in government millions of people were left without effective health cover and people are not prepared to allow that situation to occur again. The success of the Opposition's health policy can be gauged by the number of former Ministers and shadow Ministers littered around the back benches. It is about time that the Opposition had a health policy and, if it believed in it, stood up and brought it to the attention of the Australian population, but the Opposition is afraid to do that. As the honourable member for Tangney knows, the honourable member for Wentworth and Senator Stone are having great difficulty in supporting anything that he puts forward in a politically credible way. Because of the failure of the Opposition to evolve a health policy and the failure of the many former Ministers and shadow Ministers who litter the back bench, the people of Australia do not trust the Opposition's health policy, whereas they trust the Labor Government's health policy. They know that under this Government wealth does not determine health.</PARA>

<PARA> The Kuala Lumpur CHOGM was attended by representatives of 46 countries, including 35 at head of state-government level. The meeting, most ably chaired by Dr Mahathir, was significant in a number of respects: it marked the fourtieth anniversary meeting of the modern day Commonwealth; it saw the most welcome return of Pakistan, under the leadership of democratically elected Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; and it provided a valuable opportunity for wide-ranging and productive discussions on global political, economic and environmental issues between the leaders of one-quarter of the world's population. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking ahead to the l900s and beyond, the meeting agreed to establish a high level group to oversee a review of Commonwealth institutions and activities to ensure the Commonwealth's continued important and constructive role in international affairs. The group, to be chaired by Dr Mahathir, will consist of a number of heads of government, including me. A report will be submitted at the next CHOGM, to be held in Harare in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the active and constructive foreign policies pursued by this Government since 1983, Australia played an energetic and positive role in the discussions at CHOGM and in contributing to the thrust and direction of the final outcomes. In doing so, concrete and important Australian interests were further advanced, both globally and regionally, and in areas as diverse as southern Africa and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will note from the Communique the endorsement and encouragement given to the far-reaching changes under way in East-West relations. This is, of course, very much consistent with Australia's own approach, as evident in my discussions with Presidents Gorbachev and Bush and in my announcement on 15 October of our positive response to the current needs of Poland and Hungary. These issues will also be the subject of discussions I will be having tomorrow morning with the United States Secretary of State, James Baker, and the Secretary of Defense, Richard Cheney. In the context of their concerns about the need for continued progress in arms control and disarmament, Commonwealth heads of government welcomed the positive contribution to the elimination of chemical weapons made by the government-industry conference hosted by Australia in Canberra in September. </PARA>
<PARA> Other global political developments discussed included the Middle East, especially Lebanon, Cyprus, Afghanistan, Central America, Cambodia, Hong Kong and the South Pacific. Heads of government acknowledged the concerns of the people of Hong Kong and stressed the importance of Hong Kong's continued success as an international trading and financial centre. They welcomed the reaffirmation by China and Britain of their commitment to the full implementation of their joint declaration on the future of Hong Kong, the success of which is vital to the maintenance of international confidence in Hong Kong. I also had the opportunity to discuss Hong Kong with Mrs Thatcher during our separate bilateral discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> On Cambodia, Commonwealth leaders urged the continuation of efforts to intensify dialogue and promote negotiations to achieve a comprehensive settlement. In this context, they welcomed the various initiatives, including those of the Association of South East Asian Nations countries, to achieve that objective. Noting the continuing flow of boat people from Vietnam, heads of government welcomed the progress towards a comprehensive solution to the problem, made at the International Conference on Indochinese Refugees held in Geneva in June. Australia does, of course, support the comprehensive plan of action agreed at Geneva, including the screening of boat people to ensure that only those with a genuine claim to refugee status are resettled in third countries. For its part, Australia has accepted over 120,000 Indochinese refugees since 1975, and this financial year will take some 6,000. Certainly, this Government will continue to play its part in resettling genuine cases. In addition, the Government will continue to give strong support to the bilateral migration arrangements it has with Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> Heads of government welcomed the positive developments in New Caledonia-a subject which I have discussed directly with Prime Minister Rocard of France in recent months-and again acknowledged the importance of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> Fiji was not the subject of formal discussion at CHOGM and its possible re-entry into the Commonwealth was not at issue, as no application was before the meeting. I was, however, able to exchange views on developments in Fiji with other South Pacific Commonwealth leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be familiar with the vital role played by the Commonwealth in leading international action against the abhorrent practice and philosophy of apartheid. The Kuala Lumpur Statement on Southern Africa continued that process. I am pleased to inform the House that it was significantly as a result of the contribution made to this meeting by Australia that this further progress was made. I acknowledge especially the important assisting role of the Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans. The task at CHOGM was to decide on the course of action which would maximise the prospect for reform in South Africa. As I said in urging a five-point program of new Commonwealth initiatives to bring pressure to bear on South Africa-it has been said in this House before-`We do not seek to bring South Africa to its knees but to bring it to the negotiating table'. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the appropriate strategy, Commonwealth leaders took into account the fact that all the fundamental and repugnant elements of apartheid remain in place, such as institutional discrimination, epitomised most vividly by the Group Areas Act; and on the other hand, the more positive recent developments, especially the release from prison of eight prominent political leaders and President de Klerk's talk, however vague, of reform. With but one exception-the exception of Britain, to which I shall refer in a moment-the Commonwealth was united in its view that sanctions had begun to influence the policies of the South African regime, a fact acknowledged in South Africa itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Where we refer to acknowledgments from within South Africa, that is from within the Government itself and from within the most relevant institutions. I refer to statements by the Minister for Finance, Mr du Plessis, and the late Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr de Kock, both of whom did two things: Firstly, they recognised unequivocally the impact upon South Africa and the constraints on its economic development that have been involved in the imposition of sanctions; and secondly, and most importantly, in acknowledging that effect both of those gentlemen indicated their understanding that those constraints would be removed only if they got their political act together in South Africa. So that acknowledgment has come right from the centre of the Government and of the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> It was against this background that the Kuala Lumpur Statement endorsed each of the five points I had proposed. The Commonwealth heads of government noted with satisfaction the strong preference for a negotiated and peaceful settlement inherent in the Harare Declaration; and endorsed, with the exception of Britain, the maintenance of existing sanctions and the tightening of financial sanctions. For instance, the statement called on all relevant banks and financial institutions to impose tougher conditions on day-to-day trade financing, specifically through reducing the maximum credit terms to 90 days. The Commonwealth heads of government endorsed, again with the exception of Britain, the establishment of a small, independent agency-the initial funding of which Australia has expressed its willingness to provide-to review and report on South Africa's international financial links; and agreed to ask appropriate international institutions, and in particular the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to examine how resources might be mobilised for South Africa upon evidence of clear and irreversible change. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to give further emphasis to the positive way in which Commonwealth leaders approached this matter. There is a clear understanding that under the present leadership of the anti-apartheid movement within South Africa, including some amongst the leadership of the black trade union movement in South Africa, and including the leadership of the frontline states-it is very important that this should be understood-they are not seeking to see a resolution to the situation in South Africa which involves the driving out of white capital, white entrepreneurial expertise and all the accumulated experience that is represented by white South Africans. Indeed, there is a clearer understanding that a democratic, non-racial South Africa at the end of the apartheid period will be a much better place for all its citizens if the white people who are there now are able to stay on and make their contribution through their capital, their entrepreneurship and their experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The great challenge that faces the world at present is that we should take the opportunity while there is that attitude amongst the current leadership of welcoming and wanting to see stay in South Africa all that accumulated experience. If that opportunity is not taken and the sort of leadership that is now there and has that attitude is replaced by a more radical leadership that would rather see the elimination of the white presence and contribution, that would be a tragedy not merely for white South Africans but also, in the longer term, for all South Africans. So when we talk about approaching the IMF to see what sort of package of assistance would be available, that view is consistent with the view of our Government that we want to see a peaceful resolution, not a bloody ending to apartheid. We want to see a peaceful resolution of this matter and we want to see the emergence of a South Africa in which blacks and whites together will be able to cooperate economically, politically and culturally to make South Africa a country of which they can be proud and which is the more likely to contribute to an elevation of the living standards of all people. So that is the sense in which we were contemplating the approach to the International Monetary Fund to see whether some package could be formulated, the implementation of which would be contingent upon the ending of the abhorrent apartheid regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth heads of government also agreed, again with the exception of Britain, that the Committee of Foreign Ministers, the CFMSA, should continue to review the situation in southern Africa and should meet again in April of next year, by which time the new Administration in Pretoria will have had six months to demonstrate its commitments to genuine reform. I am proud to say that all Commonwealth Heads of Government at the meeting were not dismissive of the new President and saying that he was just talking empty phrases. In this respect I was personally assisted in my consideration of these issues by a lengthy discussion with my friend President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, who has had the opportunity of meeting with President de Klerk. My friend Kaunda was generous in his assessment of the attitude of the new President. He thought he was somewhat innocent in terms of his understanding of all the implications of what was involved, but he was prepared to accept that there were signs in the new President that he understood that there was a need for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> In that sense, this concept of giving a period of about six months is an intelligent thing to do, to give the new leadership in South Africa an opportunity to translate into acceptable decisions and action the indications of a desire for reform. The Commonwealth heads of government also agreed that, while legislative action progressively to dismantle the legal apparatus of apartheid may take some time to put in place, it is within the executive power of the South African Government to back its words with deeds by, for instance-this does not necessitate waiting for the meeting of the South African Parliament-executive decision, by which the South African Government would be able to release all political prisoners, it would be able to lift the state of emergency, and it would be able to unban currently banned organisations, including the African National Congress. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the message from CHOGM was that normality can only return to South Africa's economic and financial relations with the rest of the world when the ugly abnormality of apartheid disappears. South Africans cannot ask for and seek normality-because it will not happen-in its economic and commercial relations with the rest of the world while it tolerates the abhorrent abnormality of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> On other matters relating to southern Africa, Commonwealth leaders identified a continuing need for assistance to the front-line states, decided to examine actively increased special assistance to Namibia and looked forward to welcoming a free Namibia into the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the differences in Kuala Lumpur between Great Britain and the other Commonwealth members over South Africa. Let me say that at Kuala Lumpur, as at London and Vancouver, the British position was in a minority of one in the Commonwealth. That, of course, disappointed all the rest of us. What sharpened that sense of disappointment on this occasion was the fact that Britain, having initially explicitly accepted the text of the statement, and indeed, having been instrumental in having the statement accepted by other Heads of Government, then promptly issued a unilateral declaration disavowing its entire thrust. I believe that honourable members would understand that if such an approach became the norm at Commonwealth meetings, the whole institution would be undermined. It was not an acceptable course of behaviour. I expressed this view, as did Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada. In doing so, we clearly spoke on behalf of our other colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, it is worth noting that Malcolm Fraser, in delivering the B'nai B'rith Oration last Sunday, said:</PARA>
<PARA>There should no longer be a debate about whether sanctions work or not, it is now widely accepted that they do. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to say to the Leader of the Opposition and honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) that the remarks I am about to make are made with full sincerity and in the hope that there can be a positive response. I would very much like to see bipartisanship on this important issue. At the moment, unfortunately, we do not have it. The Future Directions document says unequivocally, `We do not support the use of economic sanctions'. The Liberal and National foreign policy statement, issued in April this year, includes a detailed criticism of economic sanctions and states directly that a Liberal-National Government `will not impose any obstacles to investment and to business, commercial and travel links with South Africa'. </PARA>
<PARA> These two documents bear the unmistakable imprint of the former Leader of the Opposition and his former foreign affairs spokesman, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). From what one knows of the positions formerly espoused by their replacements, the honourable member for Kooyong and Senator Hill, such views should be unacceptable. They are certainly unacceptable not only to this Government and to  the previous Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know there is no hope for the honourable member for Maranoa, and I do not look for any hope for him. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to identify himself with the honourable member, that is his choice. But I have a little bit of hope for the Leader of the Opposition in this one area-not in the area of economics-and I do hope that on this issue he has the courage to express what I do believe are his points of view. If, however, he shares the honourable member's point of view, that is a tragedy not only for the Opposition but also for this country because the honourable member is an unreconstructed hopeless case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those views in Future Directions are certainly unacceptable not only to this Government and my predecessor as Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, but also to the Progressive Conservative Government of Canada, to regional neighbours such as the governments of Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and India, to the other members of the Commonwealth, to the Congress of the United States and not least to the moderate forces for change within South Africa itself. So I look forward to hearing what the Leader of the Opposition will have to say on where, under his leadership, the Liberal and National parties stand on this important issue of principle, a principle which has the support of the whole of the rest of the Commonwealth except Britain but including the Conservative Government in Canada, as well as the support of Malcolm Fraser and all the countries in our region. That is what the position is, and it is a matter I hope we can get bipartisanship on. </PARA>
<PARA> As always, CHOGM paid close attention to international economic issues. Against the background of the Uruguay Round negotiations, which are to conclude next year, Commonwealth leaders issued a strong call for a renewed effort to capitalise on the progress made at the mid-term review in Montreal and, after that, in Geneva. It was noted that substantial and persistent protection, as in agriculture, was particularly damaging and needed to be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of regional economic cooperation, CHOGM noted the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference to be held in Canberra next week. Consistent with the aims of the initiative, which I launched in Seoul early this year, heads of government expressed the hope that regional trading efforts would promote an expansion of trade in an open and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will note from the documents tabled, issues relating to poverty alleviation, debt and financial flows, and women and structural adjustment, were also discussed in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> At Dr Mahathir's initiative, the environment was a centre point of the Kuala Lumpur CHOGM. Against the background of my comprehensive statement on the environment in July, Australia welcomed the initiative and took an active role in the formulation of the Langkawi Declaration, and in discussion of environmental issues generally. The Declaration is a forward looking document which outlines in clear and precise terms many of the environmental problems facing the world today. It provides a clear-sighted program of action encompassing, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>Support for measures to improve energy conservation and efficiency;</PARA>
<PARA>Promotion of the reduction and eventual phase-out of substances depleting the ozone layer;</PARA>
<PARA>Promotion of afforestation and sustainable forest management;</PARA>
<PARA>Support for activities relating to the conservation of biological diversity; and</PARA>
<PARA>A strengthening of national, regional and international institutions responsible for environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA>I would draw the attention of honourable members to developments in three specific areas:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's initiative, welcomed by other Commonwealth leaders, to develop a technical assistance program to provide training for assessing the effects of climate change on rural land productivity;</PARA>
<PARA>The explicit support in the CHOGM Communique for the Tarawa Declaration on Fisheries and the conclusion of an international convention to ban pelagic driftnetting from the South Pacific, as a first step towards a comprehensive ban on such fishing practices the Tarawa Declaration was, of course, an initiative taken by this Government at this year's South Pacific Forum; and</PARA>
<PARA>The explicit recognition in the Communique of the need for `every effort' to be made `to protect and conserve' the unique Antarctic environment, and it is relevant to add that, while Commonwealth heads of government were meeting in Kuala Lumpur, a meeting in Paris of members of the Antarctic Treaty System agreed to convene a special meeting next year to discuss proposals for protection of the Antarctic environment, including the Australian-French proposal for a comprehensive environment protection convention. I am sure all members will join with me in thanking all those who have worked so hard to achieve this significant step towards our goal. For Australia, mining in the Antarctica is simply out of the question and I reaffirm today my Government's decision not to sign the Minerals Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, as with other CHOGM, the meeting at Kuala Lumpur covered the full range of practical cooperative arrangements which give substance to the Commonwealth. These arrangements cover education, youth training, science and human rights. In respect of the latter, I am especially pleased to inform the House that, at the request of heads of government, a working group is to be charged with recommending possible areas for enhanced cooperation. Also, there is to be an examination of what might be done within the Commonwealth to strengthen democratic institutions. I mention this, as I know that subject is of genuine interest to honourable members on both sides of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian sports men and women will be pleased to know that Commonwealth heads of government reaffirmed the importance attached to the Commonwealth Games. The Secretary-General has been requested to invite sports administrators, representatives of the Commonwealth Games Federation and suitably qualified government nominees, to form a working party to examine issues associated with the Games, including the desire to see all regions of the Commonwealth hosting the Games. It is intended that the report of the working party be finalised in time for the next CHOGM. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Sonny Ramphal, will retire in June next year after 15 years of dedicated service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member keeps his silence for a moment, he will hear. I joined with other heads of government in paying tribute to his contribution with which, I know, many members present are familiar. The Commonwealth was fortunate in having two excellent candidates to replace Sonny Ramphal: the former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and Chief Emeka Anyaoku of Nigeria. The Commonwealth is, of course, one of the principal global organisations to which Australia belongs. I was, therefore, pleased to be able to give the Government's full and active support, within the framework of proper diplomatic norms, to Mr Fraser's candidacy. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his support in that respect. Chief Anyaoku was elected in a close race. It goes without saying that Chief Anyaoku has Australia's wholehearted and unqualified support, which I made clear to him personally immediately he was chosen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made reference at the beginning of my report to my separate discussions with a number of other Commonwealth leaders. These were important in their own right and served to progress matters of common interest. My talks with Mr Lee and Dr Mahathir, for instance, covered both regional economic cooperation and Indo-China. In addition, Dr Mahathir and I discussed ways of strengthening our cooperation in the fight against the illicit drug trade. </PARA>
<PARA> My discussions with Prime Minister Namaliu focused on developments in Bougainville. My talks with Mr Mulroney saw significant progress in resolving the problems confronting Australian canned fruit exporters as a result of the United States-Canada free trade agreement. I am confident that, as a result of my talks with Mr Mulroney, Australian fruit growers will retain competitive access to the Canadian market. </PARA>
<PARA> As we enter the l990s, the Commonwealth remains a strong and relevant international organisation. The Kuala Lumpur meeting, superbly organised by the Government of Malaysia, addressed substantive issues confronting us all-political, economic and environmental. My Government has maintained an active involvement in Commonwealth affairs. My attendance at the Kuala Lumpur CHOGM was consistent with that involvement and, as is evident from my report, has enhanced Australia's position and interests. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Visit by the Prime Minister to Singapore and to Malaysia for the 1989 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting-Ministerial Statement, 2 November 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on his recent visit to Kuala Lumpur to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). It comes at an important time for the future of the Commonwealth as an effective international association and raises some serious concerns about whether this Australian Government is at all capable of pursuing policies to help bring about such a future. There are two levels at which I want to direct my comments on the Prime Minister's statement. One concerns the future prospects for the Commonwealth as an organisation; the other is the particular outcome of the Kuala Lumpur meeting and Australia's role in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps more so than any other Commonwealth meeting of recent times, the Kuala Lumpur meeting generated extensive criticisms in the Australian media and the community of the Commonwealth as an anachronistic, divided and ineffective organisation, reflecting more on historical coincidence in the national development of its member states than any future potential for effective common action based on shared political ideals, economic priorities or development needs. Let me make it quite clear that the Opposition unambiguously rejects such a view of the Commonwealth. It has always regarded it as an important organisation with great potential for enhancing international cooperation among developed, developing and underdeveloped countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's geographic and cultural diversity should be sources of strength, not weakness. The Opposition remains committed to this dynamic view of the Commonwealth's future. There were aspects of the Kuala Lumpur meeting which provided some reassuring signs of the Commonwealth's continuing growth and potential. The return of Pakistan to the Commonwealth was a most welcome development. The Langkawi Declaration on Environment addresses many of the deeply felt concerns of citizens throughout the Commonwealth about the interaction between development needs and environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise the point about the growing public scepticism of the Commonwealth's role not to endorse it in any way but to shed some light on its causes. It is interesting to note that the Commonwealth leaders themselves sensed something of the same need. They agreed in their Kuala Lumpur communique to a wide ranging reappraisal of future roles and structures for the Commonwealth to be completed for consideration at their next meeting in 1991. The communique called for this to:</PARA>
<PARA>identify possible roles which the Commonwealth might need to play, and to examine whether its institutions, including the Secretariat, are adequately equipped for the task. </PARA>
<PARA>This review will be an important process in which any Australian government must be closely involved. One cause of the unfortunate but growing public scepticism about the Commonwealth is that it appears to have lost something of its sense of wider purpose in international events. This is highlighted by the dominance that the issue of South Africa has assumed in recent CHOGM meetings, and the Kuala Lumpur meeting in particular. I will return later to the substance of the meeting's consideration of the South African sanctions issue. The point I want to make is that the issue of South Africa, important as it is, has assumed a disproportionate role at CHOGMs. The effect has been that other issues of very great concern to Commonwealth countries have been either neglected entirely or not accorded the attention they deserve. Issues such as the future of Hong Kong, the situation in Fiji, the fate of Indo-Chinese refugees, resource development possibilities and the implications for small developing states of changes in the global trading system were totally overshadowed at the Kuala Lumpur meeting by the South Africa issue; nor were they the only issues of wider significance for Commonwealth countries to suffer such a fate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not denying the relevance of southern African issues for the Commonwealth. They are, and will continue to be, a subject of concern and, where appropriate, common action. But the Prime Minister's fixation on grand initiatives on major international political issues is likely, in the long run, to serve the interests of the Commonwealth less effectively than carefully targeted and quietly pursued programs directed at specific smaller scale problems. I am concerned that Australia should lead in the Commonwealth's reassessment of its priorities with the objective of giving greater prominence and emphasis to a range of issues in addition to South Africa in which the interests of the Commonwealth countries are also directly engaged and where there are good prospects for effective common action. Australia's involvement in the Commonwealth must avoid drifting into a one-dimensional framework. The Opposition believes that the future effectiveness and viability of the Commonwealth, to which the Opposition is fully committed, demands nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the second level at which I respond to the Prime Minister's statement-that is, the principal outcomes of the Kuala Lumpur meeting and the Prime Minister's role in it. We congratulate Chief Emeka Anyaoku of Nigeria on his election to the position of Commonwealth Secretary- General. He brings considerable expertise and special ability to his new position and we wish him well. Of course we were disappointed that Malcolm Fraser missed out. He was a most worthy candidate who ran a good race. I was pleased to be able to support his candidacy in meetings with various Commonwealth leaders, in particular with Margaret Thatcher only a few weeks ago. I join the Prime Minister in congratulating Sonny Ramphal on his tireless service as Secretary-General. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, the Commonwealth meeting was dominated by the issue of South Africa and Commonwealth sanctions. In fact, it was largely overshadowed by the public dispute between Mrs Thatcher and our Prime Minister. Not being a participant at the meeting and not being privy to all the relevant information, I do not want to comment specifically on this most unfortunate distraction other than to say how regrettable it was. Whatever the real cause, it was a most unseemly and unfortunate occurrence that did absolutely nothing to serve the Commonwealth cause. There is much in the Kuala Lumpur statement entitled Southern Africa: The Way Ahead, with which the coalition is in agreement. Our opposition to apartheid is unequivocal and longstanding. We agree with the statement's condemnation of many of the continuing unjust apartheid practices, such as the detention of political opposition and the banning of organisations. We support its call for genuine negotiations towards a peaceful settlement that safeguards the rights and interests of all South Africans. We agree that opposition to apartheid should be peaceful and not violent. We fully endorse the views expressed in the statement in support of a genuinely independent Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Kuala Lumpur statement on South Africa comes at a critical time in South Africa's history. It is a period of significant and hopeful change within South Africa. A new government is bringing a new perspective to old problems. We do not delude ourselves that a new dawn is imminent but we need to take careful account of the changes that are occurring. It is against this background that the Kuala Lumpur statement calls for the maintenance of all the Commonwealth's existing sanctions and measures and, with the British disclaiming, for the tightening of financial sanctions, particularly in the area of trade financing and trade credits for South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's view of sanctions against South Africa is clear, and no selective quoting from it by the Prime Minister will change that: we do not oppose sanctions in principle. We have been strong supporters of a range of Commonwealth sanctions against South Africa, such as the arms embargo. We welcome the moves made in Kuala Lumpur to strengthen that embargo but we do not support the use of punitive economic sanctions, which we believe do not advance peaceful reform, the end of apartheid or the transition to full democratic power sharing in South Africa. We believe that punitive economic sanctions increase social tensions, exacerbate divisions, encourage extremism and slow down the internal dynamics making for reform. Time and again I have said this in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The new financial sanctions called for by the Commonwealth would be implemented by the relevant banks and financial institutions. The extent and manner of their implementation have the potential to be punitive, in effect if not in intent. The coalition parties will be carefully monitoring this implementation process and the extent of the punitive impact that these new sanctions exert. We believe that the Kuala Lumpur statement could have been strengthened by a greater recognition of the changes taking place in South Africa and by less emphasis on the stick of punitive economic sanctions and more on carrots to promote a practical program of reform. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of issues other than South Africa were addressed in the communique in a very summary way. In the communique and the Declaration on Environment the Prime Minister commits the Australian Government to some positions that are, quite frankly, inconsistent with recent Australian actions and to undertakings which require further explanation and detail, neither of which his statement today provided. A few examples will suffice. The Langkawi Declaration on Environment, which we endorse and which reflects many of the proposals in the coalition's environment policy, commits the Australian Government to a program of `sustainable development' to enhance economic growth. But this Government has no coherent idea of what `sustainable development' is. The open public dispute on environmental and development issues between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is about the fundamentals of policy. It reveals how deep, irreparable and confusing are the divisions in the Government's ranks over what sustainable development means in practice. The Prime Minister has done nothing to clarify this issue by explaining precisely what Australia's commitment to sustainable development in the Langkawi Declaration actually means. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the communique endorses the requirement for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian problem, an objective which the Opposition has consistently and fully supported, but which the Government has not. Only recently, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and our Ambassador in Thailand, the well-known spokesman at Australian Labor Party disarmament conferences, floated the possibility of a partial settlement, which in no way would guarantee democracy and self-reliance for the Cambodian people. I always noted how frequently the Ambassador in Thailand returned to Australia when there was a disarmament conference. It does not reflect badly on his work as a diplomat. I simply note that he seemed to return with regular frequency when Labor Party conferences on disarmament matters were to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The communique calls on all States to establish a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South East Asia-our old friend ZOPFAN, which has been around for as long as many members have been in this Parliament and which, as Foreign Minister, I described, in diplomatic terminology, as `a noble aspiration'. This Government, however, has agreed to endorse and establish the elements of the zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South East Asia. But the Prime Minister today certainly failed to spell out how he intends doing so in a way that is consistent with our regional security strategy and our alliance objectives. Furthermore, the communique notes the threat posed by inflation-it reads very well: `to sustain growth in industrial countries and the need to avoid recession'. </PARA>
<PARA> But neither the Government's economic policies nor, unsurprisingly, the Prime Minister's statement today, let alone this Government's actions, offer any way out for Australia. We go off to Malaysia; we are opposed to inflation; we are opposed to recession; but we come back and practise the very opposite! Then again, the Langkawi Declaration on Environment commits Australia to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . strengthen and support the development of international funding mechanisms and appropriate decision-making procedures to respond to environmental protection needs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But the Prime Minister's statement provides no details of costings or timings on this undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my response to the Prime Minister's statement by reiterating that the coalition's underlying perspective on the role of the Commonwealth is a positive and dynamic one. I look forward as Prime Minister to continuing the long tradition of active and constructive involvement by coalition governments in Commonwealth affairs.

Something has caused the agitation, and it is certainly not the Government's standing in the polls. As leader of the nation and attending these prime ministerial conferences and Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings, I can assure the House that I will not be getting into the sorts of skirmishes the Prime Minister did with Mrs Thatcher. It seemed to be quite an obsession with him because he came back here and carried on with his endless criticism about whether she endorsed this program and what she did afterwards. In other words, what he is saying is that Mrs Thatcher is a textual deviate. I would not get into that sort of argument, but that is what he was on about and he is continuing it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The concern we have to have with the recent Kuala Lumpur meeting and the Prime Minister's role in it is that it reinforces the growing perception of the Commonwealth as a one-dimensional body divided against itself. The Prime Minister has shown himself to be too easily tempted to use the Commonwealth as a vehicle for his own brand of moralising, largely for the benefit of a particular domestic political audience. He has done so at the expense of meeting the less spectacular, less grandiose but nonetheless vitally important challenges that confront Commonwealth countries. The future of the Commonwealth depends on a more balanced sense of its priorities and possibilities. By his statement today the Prime Minister has demonstrated that this Australian Labor Party Government is incapable of addressing that historic challenge, but the next Australian Government, a coalition government, will redress that failure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today when we awoke we had the spectacle on the front page of a newspaper of two senior Cabinet Ministers brawling. We had quotes from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) which were not even veiled criticisms of his colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson). From answers to questions in this place today it is obvious that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is chastened. I might go so far as to say that he is almost emasculated. He would not follow through on his criticisms; he deviated from the question and answered anything but the real issue of the day. That is a great pity because if ever there were a time for a sensible, mature debate in Australia about those issues, it is today. What we need is far more logic, rationality and commonsense in our political debate and a lot less party politics and emotion. The media had blazing headlines, but what Australia needs is that mature debate. We desperately need a consistent and coherent policy from the Government that balances the competing needs of the environment and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that Australia's economy is in crisis. The Australian people know the statistics; they know the forecast by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for the current account deficit of $18.5 billion; they know that it is more likely to be $25 billion; they know that our foreign debt is approaching $140 billion; they know that inflation is rising; and they know that the Treasurer's high interest rates are bleeding Australian families and businesses. We need a responsible Australian government that can provide leadership and a clear policy direction. What do we get? We get stunts from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), slander from the Treasurer, and a brawl between two Cabinet Ministers over direction. Where is that leadership? There is not any. We now have one Minister-the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy-belatedly arriving in the chamber. We welcome him. The fact of the matter is that this Government has never accepted--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. What is far more important is the failure of this Government on such a significant issue. This Government has never provided any leadership. What we have seen today is the surfacing of a brawl that has been going on for seven years. This Government has never governed in the national interest. In the seven years that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, has been responsible for this portfolio not one major resource project has been approved. All the major resource projects in Australia today were approved under the previous coalition Government and there is not one project valued at more than $500m planned for implementation in the near future. The Minister knows that; he knows that it is a stark condemnation of his administration. There are dozens of examples of the Government's failure to address the real issues that confront Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could spend literally hours talking about its failure to come to grips with these issues, but today I would like to go very briefly through three significant issues: the ridiculous three mines policy; the way the Government handled the Wesley Vale pulp mill decision; and, of course, the latest fiasco-Coronation Hill. I could talk about Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, about the trauma that the third runway decision presented for this Government, or about dozens of other issues, but I will not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the pilots?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WE4">Mr BLUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pilots dispute is over. There is no point in talking about the pilots dispute; it is over, according to the Prime Minister. Let us look at the three mines policy. This policy is based upon the ludicrous proposition that there is good and bad uranium. Good uranium comes out of the mines that the Government has approved; bad uranium is that uranium in deposits that the Government will not approve. It is illogical, it is irrational, it is a sell-out of the national interest, it is a sell-out to the left wing, and it is a sell-out to pressure groups. The cost of that decision-the Government does not worry about the cost-was $8 billion in the 1980s and it is projected to be $10 billion in the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us come to Wesley Vale. The blatant politicisation of that decision is amazing. Everybody, including the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on occasions, accepts the need to add value to our primary exports. Everybody also accepts the need to impose controls to limit the impact of pulp mills on the environment. But where are the Government's guidelines for pulp mills? Look at the number of inquiries we had into Wesley Vale. Look at the brave statements that came from the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and various responsible Ministers about commitments to guidelines. What was the deadline for those guidelines? It has come and gone and we have not seen them. Of course, we will not see any guidelines before an election. The reality is that politics have overcome the urgent need in this country to provide business with some sort of framework within which to take decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The last example is Coronation Hill. The estimated value of Coronation Hill is $500m to $700m. The way the Government behaved in that area is amazing. First of all, assurances were given to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd that the mine would go ahead. The company went ahead and spent $10m on an environmental impact study and all the concerns were complied with. Because we are close to an election, the Government did a backflip-the Minister, who now protests his concern so loudly around this country, conveniently was overseas; he did not even leave a proxy-and reversed its decision. </PARA>
<PARA> But even worse in terms of the Minister's statement yesterday was the decision on the conservation zone. On one of the most highly prospective mineral zones in Australia, by the Government's own estimates valued at between $8 billion and $15 billion, a decision was taken arbitrarily to reduce its size and limit access. Let me paraphrase what the Minister said yesterday when speaking about these issues. He said that each proposition should be considered on its merits. What did his Government do? It took an arbitrary decision in globo to sterilise an area, to prevent exploration, to limit even the concept of looking at the area. It was not even prepared to examine whether there was a possibility of developing a resource there without damage to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have in Coronation Hill is sheer tokenism. The Government sought, in the most blatant and obvious way, to do a transparent deal with people who purport to be able to deliver, en bloc, the votes of the conservation movement. Of course, that cannot be done. There is no such thing as a corporate vote for the conservation movement. Everybody in this country is concerned with our way of life. Everybody is concerned to protect the environment. But not everybody will vote the way they are told to by one or two leaders of the conservation group. Only the simplistic and desperate approach of the Prime Minister and his Government would have them believe that sort of vote can be bought. They would earn far more respect and, dare I say it, get far more votes if they had a rational and responsible approach to these issues rather than this craven pursuit of political popularity at any price. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a Minister in the other place who by his own words has disqualified himself from participating in decisions on resource development, a Minister who says of the mining industry, `There is no greedier, more impossible to satisfy group in our society than the mining industry. They are unbelievable'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has endorsed it. Well done! I wonder how many other honourable members opposite would endorse it. The Minister, out of his own mouth, disqualifies himself from taking part in these decisions. No wonder the major business organisations of this country are putting out statements saying that because of the Government's inconsistent, unpredictable policy there is a crisis in business confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Less than a week ago a press release was issued by nine major business organisations, including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, the Mining Council and the National Farmers Federation. This press release, which is comprehensive in its criticism of the Government, says in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Resource development and business investment are subject to short term political expediency. The uncertainty created by a government which goes back on its undertakings is undermining business confidence. Australia's resource industries are committed to environmental standards that are equal to the best of the world. Australia needs sustainable development which recognises the fundamental link between economic growth and the environment to maintain our living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the Government's response? Where is the response from the Minister? Where is the response from the Prime Minister? I asked him in this place the other day for a response and I got nothing but lunatic ramblings, ramblings that did not address the issue, that carried on about Access Economics and cited statistics that were irrelevant to the issues. That is the response that we get from this Government to the most pressing economic issue that confronts Australia today; that is: how are our resources to be developed? What is going to be the fundamental basis of Australia's economy? The Minister's response has been nothing short of pathetic. He knows the policy is wrong, he knows that he has no influence, he knows that he has been frozen out, and he knows that Cabinet will not listen to his complaints. So we have an angry and public conflict, a conflict which must be an embarrassment to a responsible government, but a Prime Minister who will not act on it. Let me take a minute or two to read out the Minister's comments on radio this morning in answer to questions from Pru Goward:</PARA>
<PARA> PRU GOWARD: But are you the only one in Cabinet who is a bit worried that the green debate is going a bit far, and we are losing out on our major developments?</PARA>
<PARA> KERIN: I wouldn't know. I've not canvassed it with my colleagues. I suspect quite a few would support what I'm saying. But I haven't done a poll within Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> PRU GOWARD: What does the Minister for the Environment say to you?</PARA>
<PARA> KERIN: Well . . . not much. </PARA>
<PARA> PRU GOWARD: You don't talk?</PARA>
<PARA> KERIN: (laughs) Well . . . we are both very busy, quite honestly. He wanders around the country bagging the miners and the farmers and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA>My goodness! What sorts of Cabinet meetings do they have? They must sit at each end of the table throwing paper balls at each other. One can picture it. This is an absolutely appalling state of affairs. What should be a serious political issue, which is subject to serious and considered debate, is really determined by the political ambitions of this Government. The Government is operating not on an economic strategy but on a political strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has set up something known as the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC). That, in fact, is a lap-dog of the Government, and it has no impact. It could be a first class organisation. It could do the job that so desperately needs to be done, but it has become a dumping ground for difficult decisions. There is no guarantee that any report that comes out of the RAC will be treated any better than the report of the Helsham Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests. The Minister knows that, and he knows that the RAC legislation is flawed. He knows that it is skewed and he knows that recommendations that do not comply with that ridiculous schedule are subject to legal challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few moments left to me, let me draw this whole situation together. What we have is paralysis on the part of this Government when it comes to deciding on policy issues, fundamental policy issues that will determine the capacity of this country to survive and pay its way into the future and to sustain a standard of living as well as a quality of life. There is a concept known as sustainable development. The Minister is aware of it. He has taken to speaking of it recently. But when it comes to arguing it forcefully with his colleagues, he is strangely silent. We have a government that has shirked its responsibility. It should be concerned about economics and Australia's future, but it is motivated entirely by politics. Not only does it not have a coherent economic policy-we have not seen one word from the Treasurer about that-but the Government's commitment to the environment is about as deep as the ballot box. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government had no difficulty in accepting the proposition raised today by the Opposition; namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for the Government to determine its environment and development policies based on a rational and objective assessment of both environmental and economic consequences which accepts the principle of sustained development. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what we are doing as a Cabinet and as a Government. What the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), has just confirmed is basically what we on this side of the House have always said; that is, that the National Party is profoundly anti-environment. There is only one banana republic in this country and that is Queensland. His Party has raped and pillaged the landscape in Queensland. New South Wales gets a new government, and straightaway the Nats are into it. They use the same old rhetoric and have the same anti-environmental approach to government. </PARA>
<PARA> I went through the Hansards to look at the Opposition's performance on environmental issues. I went back to 1 April 1987. The drift of one of the questions put to the Government was that mining should go ahead. `World Heritage listing should not go ahead for the Queensland rainforests', `World Heritage boundaries are specious in the Queensland rainforests'. Then there were two questions criticising Minister John Brown because he wanted to build a railway in Uluru. Then there was a question to me about logging. Again, it was pro-logging. Then there was a call for a Helsham-type inquiry prior to World Heritage listing. Then the Nationals wanted the speedy implementation of the Helsham recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I can go through every question that has been asked in this House that has some vague connection with the environment, and every one was pro-development and anti-environment. That is the reason why yesterday in my speech I mentioned posturing, tokenism, vote chasing and cynicism. They refer exactly to the Opposition. I nearly fell off my perch when I heard that the new Premier of Queensland-whatever his name is, they change them so regularly; Sir Robert Sparkes sees to that-would run on the environment in the election campaign. What a joke! I have dealt with forestry Ministers in Queensland who think that the only good tree is a horizontal one-sheer tokenism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Opposition's policy is to establish priority national parks. That is clearly a threat to all the others. It is vote chasing. I refer to the statement of the Leader of the National Party that the Opposition will set greenhouse gas emission targets. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that this is a target. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the target does not have to be met at all. I refer to the Opposition's cynicism in respect of its attempts to rewrite history by claiming, for example, that it had a soil conservation program when that was not the case. In that respect the Opposition referred to Mr Fraser's heritage classification of Fraser Island. I can just imagine the brawl that went on in Cabinet about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Leader of the National Party also talked about splits between Cabinet Ministers. One of the biggest debates in the community today is about development and the environment, and it is a healthy debate. I will certainly not shirk from putting forward my point of view in this area. It must be one of the easiest things in the world to maintain shadow Cabinet solidarity-there would not be anything easier. The decisions made by shadow Cabinet do not mean anything and, if the Opposition gets into government, it could easily overturn those decisions. Even in this area of shadow policy, it cannot maintain solidarity-it cannot manage it. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) were in a great mess over child-care last week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the National Party is a genius. He wanted me to spend six weeks in Riyadh drinking coffee while following the live sheep issue. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) is another genius, a diplomatic one. He wants me to de-recognise the People's Republic of China and recognise Taiwan in order to reward Taiwan for limiting our beef exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of my speech yesterday was all about sustainable development. Rational assessments have underpinned all the Government's environmental decisions, and I will go through some of them. The Franklin River runs free. In respect of the protection of World Heritage areas, the most important to my mind is the wet tropical rainforests. Another was my introduction of national soil conservation in 1983. That was not done by the Fraser Government, as the Opposition's Stalinist attempt to rewrite history would have it. The work we have done on fisheries management is an environmental success story of this Government which goes largely unnoticed. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one can argue that there was not a very great objective assessment in respect of the Tasmanian forests. There was also the agreement with New South Wales in respect of the south-east forests. That agreement is working well at this stage, partly because New South Wales knows that the Commonwealth will use its constitutional powers to protect the forests if that becomes necessary. We are leading the world in protecting the ozone layer at international conferences, and we are doing more research per capita on the greenhouse effect than any other country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the work that led up to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in July on the environment. That is a magnificent document which is well suited to the interests of my portfolio and the concept of sustainable development. The document contains a substantial expansion of the national soil conservation program, a commitment to plant one billion trees, saving remnant vegetation, and expansion of the national afforestation program. The document also deals with expanded work on the greenhouse effect, development of pulp mill guidelines, assistance to local government for environmental management, and the promotion of paper recycling, including the removal of sales tax from recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> What a record-a record that justifies calling that environmental statement one of the greatest. It is all based on rationality, because we have established the institutions to provide rational, objective advice-the National Resources Information Centre; the Bureau of Rural Resources in my Department; expanded resources for the Australian Heritage Commission; and the most important of the lot-the Resource Assessment Commission, which the Opposition tried to water down out of existence in the Parliament. In fact, the Opposition nearly wiped it out in the Senate. The most important announcement of the lot was the very first in the Prime Minister's statement on the environment: that the overriding objective is ecologically sustainable development. That is why we can accept this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this concept of sustainable development-a concept the Opposition has now started talking about without having a clue what it is talking about. Sustainable development means that we, this generation, must bequeath to future generations a total environment that is at least as good as the one our predecessors bequeathed to us. That is an historic commitment by the Government. It goes beyond `balance' in environmental decision-making. `Balance' can be held to mean that some rate of environmental decay is appropriate-sustainable development means that no rate of decay is appropriate. It goes beyond `conservation', as `conservation' does not allow for restoration. In a whole host of areas, we need to improve the environment we inherited. The most obvious is in the area of land degradation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in Question Time today, after decades of conservative parties' neglect, we are introducing a decade of land care. It was Prime Minister Whitlam and former Minister Moss Cass who set up the environmental impact process in this country. They were responsible for the study by the States and the authorities on Australia's land degradation situation which eventually came forward during the term of the Fraser Government. What did the Fraser Government do with it? For a while poor old Kevin Newman thought that he was on a goer and he promised that the then Government would bring in a national soil conservation program, but that was all wiped out by the 1980 razor gang affair; it never got up. I recall pointing out in this House that this was Australia's greatest conservation issue, but what was I always told by the then Leader of the National Party and other people? I was told that it was a State matter. It was this Government that achieved it. Members opposite neglected the land. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first raised this question as a shadow Minister, the farmers said, `Here is Kerin. He is a bit of a pinko, a bit of a greenie; he should not be talking about these things'. The farmers are now backing this Government on land care, because they know that it is one of the most important issues facing them. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing about sustainable development is that it recognises that people want improvements to their overall quality of life-including both environmental amenity and material standards of living. Sustainable development means providing both. It recognises that stopping economic growth is not the solution to the world's environmental problems. Indeed, in comparing the environments in rich and poor countries, it is obvious that economic growth is a nexessary part of the solution to those environmental problems. If one is going to talk about the environment, there is also the built environment, the urban environment. To service it and to continue to spend billions of it will require economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Sustainable development also recognises that the community deserves a decent return from the exploitation of its resources. As I have been at pains to point out recently, the rents belong to the community. That is what the Government is all about. That is what our decisions to date have been about, and it is what all our future decisions will be about. Let there be no doubt that further decisions are required. Our agriculuture is still not sustainable, although it is getting there. Only parts of our forestry-such as those administered by the Victorian Government-are sustainable. I have got fishing to be almost sustainable. But it goes on throughout all industry activities. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what we will do, but what will the Opposition do? What will the slash and burn merchants of the National Party do? What will the Liberal Party do with the millstone of the National Party around its neck? We all know the answer. They engage in what I called yesterday posturing, tokenism, vote-chasing and cynicism. There is high cynicism by the Opposition parties as they now claim, because of the opinion polls, that they have the true greenie credentials. </PARA>
<PARA> Only this Government is capable of providing leadership and vision to policy-making in this country. We have demonstrated this in many ways: our economic policy, where we have created 1.5 million jobs; our social policy; and our environmental policy. This whole question of sustainable development is going to take a lot of work. Much of that work will be done in my Department as we work with industry on the concepts of sustainable development. If we look at agriculture, forestry and fisheries, the concept is well established. If we look at other areas where we are dealing with finite resources it is quite obvious that a different approach needs to be taken. There seems to be a lack of knowledge in this country about exploration techniques. There is a lack of knowledge about alternatives, substitutes and processes-all of the things that can be incorporated into an approach to sustainable development for the mining industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brundtland report, the major report in recent times that emphasises the whole concept of sustainable development, has been pushed harder by one group in this country-the Australian Mining Industry Council-than by any other. I was recently in the United Kingdom, where the Government has brought out a report by Professor David Pearce on sustainable development which tries to define the concept in terms that make sense in the United Kingdom. Defining the concept of sustainable development in this country is going to take time but it is the only possible way to work through the dilemma we have with respect to conservation and development. This country has pressing economic problems. We cannot ignore the fact that we need to have growth. Above all, we cannot ignore the fact that the way out for this country is sustainable development. </PARA>

Just as the Treasurer did not answer the charge of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock)-that he had chased the big lie in regard to allegations of John Elliott and the capital gains tax supposed link-up-nor has this Minister answered our central charge, which is that the extremist environmentalists, aided and abetted and encouraged to a wild degree by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Richardson, are determining the level of development in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who is determining development? Is it the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, and the Cabinet, based on rational objective decisions, or is it the Minister responsible for the environment, Senator Richardson, in a cynical ploy with the false hope of winning votes at the next election? The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy gave us a rambling and very carefully worded statement but he backed away in a very obvious manner from his comments of the last couple of days, not least of all on the Pru Goward Australian Broadcasting Commission program this morning. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>You would also be forced to say that there are people in your own party who are cynically exploiting this for votes, wouldn't you?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister answered:</PARA>
<PARA>I think there is evidence of that in some areas, yes. I think the anti-development party of my party sees that this is a new cause . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister has been silenced. In the face of provocation from the extremist environmentalists, assisted by Senator Richardson, he has gone to water. When asked in Question Time yesterday to dissociate himself from the outrageous and inaccurate comments of Senator Richardson, as reported in the Illawarra Daily Mercury of 8 October, he certainly gave tacit endorsement. Those comments are almost indelibly etched on the minds of most members. Senator Richardson made a gratuitous and generalised attack on the mining industry when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no greedier, more impossible to satisfy group in our society than the mining industry, they are unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, Senator Richardson did not stop there. I quote further from the article:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson said the only reason BHP wanted to go ahead with mining in Kakadu was because of gold, but that tests had shown there was not a scrap of gold in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> `There are five or six areas in Australia richer than Kakadu, but money isn't spent prospecting on those, it's only spent in an area that looks like going into a park,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA>The stupidity of a remark like that from a Cabinet Minister defies logic. Is he alleging, as the plain words would have us believe, that members of the mining industry get out maps and say, `Let's forget about the resource-rich areas. Let's go straight to a national park where there is not a scrap of resource to be mined in any event. Let's spend $10m on exploration within Kakadu stage 3, but there's not really any gold there?' That is the level of bigotry which it is incumbent on the Cabinet, but more specifically the development Ministers, to counter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is utterly powerless. The supposed Hawke of the bush has been reduced to the galah of the Parliament. He goes around muttering under his breath about the cynicism of Senator Richardson and the short-sightedness of his obsession with blocking any sort of development, whatever environmental guidelines can be guaranteed. He always complains that he cannot negotiate with the environment movement because Senator Richardson is forever egging it on. When it negotiaties with Minister Kerin he cannot in any way strike a compromise because it knows that it can get what it wants at any price from Senator Richardson. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy goes around the mining industries and resources sector saying all this, muttering under his breath and trying to make a big man of himself; but when he is asked finally to stand up on a matter of principle he backs away as fast as he possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA> The loser in all of this is obviously our nation. The Government has tried to characterise itself as adopting a consenus approach to potentially divisive national issues. It certainly employed that sort of all-econom-passing soothing language when it introduced the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) which the Minister made great play of, citing it as evidence of his Government's determination to reach balanced and rational decisions on the development-environment debate. The truth is that that Resource Assessment Commission has been gutted before it even gets off the ground. The Government has referred to it for decision, for advice, not the whole of the conservation zone of Kakadu Stage 3 but only that small strip extending from Coronation Hill to El Sherana, a matter of a few kilometres. Cabinet has already made the decision to do away with the potential of $7 billion worth of resources. The RAC is left with only a narrow reference. Moreover, its reference has been delayed many months so that there will be no recommendation derived from the RAC until many months later. So much for the rhetoric of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that there is no balance and no consensus; nor is there any rationality to the Government's approach on environment and development issues. There are only winners and losers. The environment Minister is the winner; the development Minister, the resources sector and the nation are losers. Where is the consensus that the Prime Minister promised us in his July supposed world's greatest environment statement? Where are the new mechanisms for an accord process in regard to development projects and the environment? Where is the trade-off and the compromise and the balanced perspective on this issue? The Resource Assessment Commission, which is the only possible example of a government trying to inject rationality into this debate-which to a very large extent has galloped away from it, having been inflamed by Senator Richardson-has failed. It has already been corrupted by high politics. Once we were told that the RAC would remove the divisiveness from the development scene, but now we have seen the RAC turned into the political arm of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cabinet's decision on exploration and mining in stage 3 of Kakadu marked the loss of innocence for the RAC. If the Government had been legitimate in its hopes for the role of the RAC, it would have at least referred the entire conservation zone within stage 3 to the Commission for assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knew that this delay mechanism would enable decisions on crucial development to be deferred until the next Federal election, and all persons within the RAC know it. They know that they have been sold down the drain and now know that their fate is merely to serve as an extension of the Government and not as an arbitrator trying desperately to inject rationality into this debate. The industry knows it also. </PARA>
<PARA> So where are these consultative mechanisms about which the Prime Minister has boasted? The Prime Minister has not pursued these initiatives simply because the prospect of a balanced discussion is anathema to the political course that he has charted based on the best advice Senator Richardson can give. How tragically disappointed the Government will be. There is no forum for any consultation or sober discussion, nor any likelihood of reasoned outcomes. The development Ministers within the Government are totally isolated and the anti-development part of the Australian Labor Party, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy described them this morning on the Pru Goward show, have won the day. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the man who has some claim to be the next Leader of the Opposition, so all is not lost. Even now that he has been reduced to irrelevance in the Government, the one bright light is that he will make a better Leader of the Opposition than the Treasurer. So one slight, bright hope may come out of all this. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will make a good Leader of the Opposition because, by heavens, Government members are coming over to this side of the House--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the main planks of what the Opposition has been talking about is lack of investment and development in Australia. I quote, from Access Economics Investments Monitor, a unique listing by sector and State of 500 investment projects worth over $5m each under construction, committed or under consideration in mining, manufacturing, tourism and public sector investment relating to foreign exchange earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The projects listed have a total value of $90 billion. I will repeat that so that it will sink into some people's heads. There is $90 billion worth of investment in Australia. Do honourable members know how much of that is in the mining industry?-$6,932m on projects under construction or committed. So who said the Government was letting the mining industry run down? We agree with some of the miners and some of the mines going ahead. However, we must ensure that those under construction, committed or under development are environmentally sensitive. I repeat that $6,932m worth of mining is involved in construction and development in mineral sands, gold, iron ore, coal, oil and gas, uranium and others. I correct that. There is nothing in uranium, I am pleased to say. To tell the coalition's environment story, I should like to give a few quotations from Opposition members. The first comes from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who used to be the environment spokesman at one stage. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The third factor was the extraordinary irony that we were roundly criticised for our decision to abolish the Environment Department. </PARA>
<PARA>This is their secret agenda. If ever they get back into power, out goes the environment department. The next quotation comes from Charles Blunt--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. The next quotation comes from the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Charles Blunt), who warned that the recently announced Decade of Land Care program would be reviewed if the coalition were returned to office, and said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We may change the program, but it will be from the day we come in. </PARA>
<PARA>That appeared in the National Farmer of 25 August 1989, not that long ago. So obviously, land care is on the skids. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is referred to in the next quotation as the Leader of the Opposition. It was printed only a couple of weeks ago and he is now the Opposition spokesman on industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't beat about the bush. I admit that after the election I said we should look at environmental issues and that it was no longer a sufficient response from a Liberal to automatically say `Well, we have nothing to say on that subject because it's entirely a matter of State Rights'. </PARA>
<PARA>On 7 November 1986 a journalist interviewed the honourable member for Bennelong at Parliament House. The transcript of the interview read:</PARA>
<PARA> Journalist: On Kakadu, will a Coalition Government allow mining of Stage 2 of Kakadu?</PARA>
<PARA> Howard: The Coalition Government believes that the proposed plan of management is unacceptable and we will be moving in that direction when the Parliament resumes. </PARA>
<PARA> Journalist: But more concretely, does that mean that you will allow mining in Stage 2?</PARA>
<PARA> Howard: It could, yes. </PARA>
<PARA>All of the Opposition members agree to mining in stage 2 of Kakadu. Again, the Leader of the National Party said:</PARA>
<PARA>For us a rational policy for the Government to follow is to take a decision on the development of Coronation Hill project and allow further exploration of the Kakadu National Park with EIS studies for each new proposal as they come in. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition members say all the time that they are environmentally conscious. Judging by the statements made by some of their leaders, it is obvious that they are not. I now quote that great man of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who was extolling the potential for investment in Queensland. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> You can do so much with a bulldozer. </PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly the policy of the National Party. Peter Garrett responded to the Opposition's assurances that stages 2 and 3 of Kakadu National Park would remain open to the mining industry under any future coalition government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Peacock wants to take two steps back into the dinosaur and destroy path then he will do that at his own peril. </PARA>
<PARA>Peter Garret also said:</PARA>
<PARA> He, Mr Morgan, claims that environmentalists are the logical successors to communists and socialists. If that's the case, then we're in the same boat as President Bush and Mrs Thatcher and Prime Minister Hawke. The Federal Government's decision about Kakadu was a responsible decision. What it does do is extend the ambit of Kakadu National Park and that's something which all Australians will welcome. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst I am talking about communists I point out that the honourable member for Flinders was mentioned in a recent article in the Independent News, in talking about environmentalists, as follows:</PARA>

<PARA>any green candidate in the next Federal election will be `watermelons'. They'll be watermelons because they'll be green on the outside and red on the inside. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that as if he had just invented horticultural analogies. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the greens people who claim to be green, most likely will be a front for the Labor Party. It's as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA>That reaction created quite a storm in my area and I must say that the Labor candidate for Flinders, Mr Tony Moore, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Is Mr Reith saying that anyone who dares vote against him, or dares to have a different opinion to his, is not a conservationist but a communist (a red) in disguise?</PARA>
<PARA>That is what honourable members opposite imply. They imply that I am a communist because I stick up for the environment. They are trying to intimidate us once again. I say for the benefit of everyone in the gallery, including all the children in the gallery if they are listening, `Stick up for the environment. It is the only way. Don't be scared when people like members of the Opposition call you a communist or anything like that because you know what you are doing is correct'. </PARA>
<PARA> Something I have done recently in regard to the environment was to draw attention to the toxic waste from the BP refinery. For some years I have been trying to learn where it was. On 13 June 1989, I mentioned in this House that some toxic waste was buried. On 4 October the State member for Mornington, Mr Robin Cooper, said that what I had stated was a cynical beat-up about the waste dump in Hastings. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Late last May, Mr Chynoweth grandstanded in Federal Parliament on this . . . then sought out and obtained local publicity which has seriously alarmed local residents. </PARA>
<PARA>It is claimed that my remarks were a cynical beat-up. However, on Tuesday, 17 October, in an article in another local paper, I named the location of this dump. Surprise, surprise! Over last weekend the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) went there and put a bulldozer or back-end loader into the ground. What did it dig up? There were 200 to 300 drums, each containing about 200 litres of waste material. They are now being analysed and I am informed by the EPA that it is the largest dump of this type of BP waste ever found in Victoria. The EPA is analysing it at the moment and there seems to be bituminous waste and also some viscous liquid substance. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the site that I gave the location of, through further digging the EPA has located several other drums. Tom Roper has thanked me for my help in the matter. I would like to congratulate Tom Roper and his Department for the speed with which they acted to investigate this location of waste. The waste is located in the electorate of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). But what has he done over the last five years that I have been raising this matter? The Opposition has never even bothered to look into it. Opposition members just laugh about it. I would have thought, after I had made a claim such as this, that he would have asked around about it. He knew that the Hastings Council knew about it. He knew that certain people in his electorate knew about it. Maybe we should see who these certain people support in this political game. I want to make certain that this sort of thing never happens again, so I hope that whoever has put this waste there will be penalised severely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports this motion relating to the proposed chemical weapons convention which I had assumed the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) would speak in support of. In any event, I understand the matter has been spoken to in the Senate. The Opposition supports this motion basically for two reasons. The first is that the Opposition shares with the Government an abhorrence of chemical weapons. The horrors of chemical weapons are well known, as are the dangers of chemical warfare. I understand that at least 22 countries are known to possess chemical weapons. By the end of the century an estimated 30 developing countries will have ballistic missiles capable of delivering chemical warfare warheads accurately over great distances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second reason we support the motion is that we support any step towards a comprehensive and verifiable global chemical weapons convention that would ban not only the use of chemical weapons but all chemical weapons entirely and in perpetuity. We are well aware that the chemical weapons convention is still being negotiated. It is being negotiated at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, which has been in progress since March 1968. We support any efforts towards confidence-building measures, the resolution of differences and details of the ongoing consideration of this issue which might assist in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in agreement with much of what the Government is doing in relation to chemical weapons, for example, with its participation in the negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament, which predate the present Government. We support the Government's active role in the informal `Australia Group' of 20 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations to monitor and control the export of materials that could be used to build chemical warfare facilities, or what are known as precursor chemicals that could be used as ingredients in chemical weapons production. Certainly, there seems to be a greater international realisation of the horrors of chemical weapons and of the need for a comprehensive global ban. One is aided in this realisation by a vision of what one might call the unthinkable, the confirmed use of chemical weapons by Iraq and Iran in the Gulf war. Indeed, who would forget the photographs of the 10,000 men, women and children in the Kurdish town of Halabja who were wiped out in March last year by Iraqi chemical weapons? In January this year, 149 nations in Paris affirmed their commitment not to use chemical weapons and stressed the need to conclude a chemical weapons convention. </PARA>
<PARA> One should note the activities of the Government-Industry Conference against Chemical Weapons (GICCW), which was held in Canberra from 18 to 22 September and which was designed to bring together representatives from government and from the chemical industry to discuss how best to help to bring about and implement a chemical weapons convention. Of course, this is another of those conferences that are described these days as awareness conferences. The earlier regional chemical weapons seminar which was held here was significant and useful in educating regional groups-one which the Opposition supported, although we were never really quite sure why Australia was expected to bear the cost of all participants attending that conference, even those from New Zealand. The ad hoc committee on chemical weapons will be resuming in Geneva next month, as I understand it, and the full conference on disarmament session resumes on 6 February next year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a considerable hope for the conclusion of a chemical weapons convention in two years time. Therefore, we support this motion, but we wonder about the Government's timing of it. Presumably, the Government is looking for a statement of parliamentary support, which we certainly lend our hand to, in view of some concern by the Government that the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) may be proceeding towards a bilateral agreement between them that would set back negotiations for the wider and more effective convention. Of course, the Government knows more of the subtleties of what is under way by virtue of the fact solely that it is the Government and it may well be that this is the reason why the Government is asking for this expression of parliamentary support. We want to indicate our support for it, which we do by my speaking in support of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> There certainly seems to be some uncertainty regarding the intentions of the United States Government. There have been reports that the Australian Government suspects the United States of being more interested in chemical weapons non-proliferation than it is in the conclusion of a chemical warfare convention. This would seem to be surprising as on 4 February 1983 the then Vice-President Bush announced at the Conference on Disarmament that the United States had certain requirements for a chemical weapons convention. On 18 April 1984 he presented the Conference on Disarmament with a draft convention which has since served as the basis for negotiations on the present rolling test and, of course, when he became President, he declared that a ban on chemical weapons would be his Administration's priority. </PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise that since the United States and USSR bilateral negotiations started in 1986 they have resulted in much progress in the Conference on Disarmament negotiations. For example, on 6 August 1987, the USSR finally agreed with the longstanding United States position to permit short notice, on-site challenge inspections as a necessary element of an effective chemical weapons verification regime. Since then there has been much progress on procedures regarding challenge inspections, on the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles and on the destruction of production facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent landmark in the bilateral negotiations was the signing on 23 September of a memorandum of understanding between Secretary of State Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in Wyoming. The memorandum of understanding took the bilateral negotiations further by providing for an exchange of data on stockpiles and on measures to verify that data. A couple of days ago, on Monday, 30 October, the United States and the USSR began their bilateral discussions to develop procedures on implementing the memorandum of understanding. Since the memorandum of understanding, the United States has pledged to destroy 98 per cent of its stockpile in the first eight years of the convention, with the remaining 2 per cent being destroyed in the last two years. The USSR, not to be outdone, has announced that it is prepared to destroy all of its stockpile now, even before a convention is concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> On 9 October came what has been regarded by some as a bombshell, with the report in the Washington Post that President Bush had decided that the United States would continue to manufacture what are know as binary weapons, even after a chemical weapons convention was concluded, and that binary weapons would not be included in the program of destruction of chemical weapons stock and facilities under a convention. It is not clear, therefore, what the present situation is and where we are today. Of course, we would welcome some indication from the Government as to exactly where we have got to on this issue and where it is proposed we are all going in the short to medium term in view of these American statements. It was reported in the Age newspaper on 27 October that Senator Gareth Evans wrote to Mr Baker asking for clarification. Of course, a public announcement has yet to be made by the Americans and President Bush has not commented on the matter any further. As I said before, the Government is more in tune with the subtleties of this whole procedure by virtue of the fact that it is the Government. We would appreciate at some stage some indication of just where we stand on the developments in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> Presumably, the Government would like some credit for the two conferences that it sponsored in Australia in recent times and we are happy to give this. Of course, they add to what Australia has been doing in the Conference on Disarmament and I think that should be placed on record. Unfortunately, the debate has acquired a bit of unnecessary colour by some of the political statements being made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans. Although we give credit where it is due, we think, nevertheless, he has fuelled unreal expectations, presumably in an effort to gain some domestic political standing. We really need to look through the headlines that he has generated in recent times to see just how true this is. For example, on 22 September the Australian Financial Review offered the following headline, `Evans to secure weapons deal'. In the Australian on the following date, 23 September, we find the headline, `Chemical ban in 1990 tipped'. On 23 September, the same day, the Age newspaper said, `Chemical weapons accord a coup for government'. We have not seen the final realisation of this coup as yet, but we live in hope. On 25 September the Canberra Times had as its headline, `Agreement to ban chemical weapons'. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most overstated proposition of all time was contained in the Australian of 25 September, `Evans' date with destiny'. That does seem to add unnecessary rhetorical colour. I know that the world is in a pretty bad state and I see that Senator Evans is offering himself as its saviour by being President of the General Assembly, but I do not think anyone would hold the view that the world was in such an abandoned state that it needed Senator Evans to guide its future destiny. However, we have, `Evans' date with destiny'. Just how unrealistic the Foreign Minister was during the GICCW conference last month in pushing for a chemical weapons convention next year can be seen by the fact that we do not have one as yet and we are still somewhat in the dark as to what the progress is, particularly in view of United States developments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from the conference that massive problems still remain. There is a great deal of work to be done and confidence building measures are needed before a chemical weapons convention can come about. For instance, there are some articles in the rolling text which are still in their formative stages. It seems from all this that Senator Evans's date with destiny will be put off for some time but we certainly support those steps that have been taken and that are being taken and we certainly lend our support to all right-minded and right-thinking people who are working, as are nations, through the various conferences towards the achievement of the convention that we all hope will come about. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a number of countries indicated in Canberra that they wanted the inclusion of sanctions against the use of chemical weapons. This is a difficult area because, if the convention is an effective one, there would be no need to include a clause on sanctions. Many countries, especially in the Middle East, want a linkage between chemical weapons disarmament and nuclear disarmament. Third World countries at the GICCW were not happy about the impact of a ban on their own chemical industries. Of course, they are continually concerned about development, as we saw from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting when Dr Mahathir directed some observations at those people with whom I suppose the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) would find himself in agreement. Of course these Third World countries wanted assurances that a ban would not affect technology transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> One can go on in detail, but I do not propose to do that. But it must be said that, while recognising that the recent conference was useful to get together government and industry representatives and representatives of chemical industries to state their opposition to chemical weapons and for some thinking about the national measures that would have to be taken in preparation for the implementation of a chemical weapons convention, we must keep the achievements of the conference in perspective. Certainly continuing high tensions in the Middle East and the latest question mark over binary weapons coming from the United States illustrate the problems that remain to be dealt with before the convention comes about. But we certainly support the Government on this motion. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Crimes (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill 1989 represents a further stage in this Government's strategy to deal effectively with the illicit trade in drugs. All honourable members would have been repulsed by the images of renewed violence and mayhem emanating from the cities of Colombia over the past two months. All members would agree with the messages of worldwide support that have been directed to the Colombian Government in its bid to rid its country of this insidious cancer which threatens the very existence of the oldest democracy in Latin America. However, such moral support is inadequate to deal with the international menace of drug trafficking. What is required is effective, coordinated international action. It is for this reason that the Government has over the past seven years placed the highest priority on providing and securing international cooperation in the fight against the illicit trade in drugs and organised crime which is dependent on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past seven years the Government has modernised Australia's extradition laws and negotiated and secured 28 modern extradition treaties. In this period, Australia has led the rest of the world in the development of modern arrangements for mutual assistance in criminal matters, thereby securing treaty backed obligations to assist in criminal investigations, prosecutions, the pursuit of the international criminal money trail and the confiscation of criminally obtained assets. Further, in the international arena Australian model extradition and mutual assistance treaties form the basis of model treaties being prepared by the United Nations Crime Prevention Committee for adoption by the eighth UN Crime Congress next year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the domestic legal front the Government's Cash Transaction Reports Act 1987 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 comprise one of the most comprehensive legislative packages for following the money trail in the world. Australia's achievements have been recognised in the international community, most recently by our inclusion in the Financial Action Task Force established by the Group of Seven major economic nations to advise on the prevention of money laundering. As the International Enforcement Law Reporter stated in its September edition, `Australia's participation in the taskforce is significant because it has taken a leadership role in international criminal cooperation'.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of our commitment to international law enforcement cooperation we have played a prominent role in the development of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. This new Convention embodies further measures for law enforcement and cooperation between international states. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention was concluded following calls from Latin American states through the 1984 Quito Declaration against Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, the 1985 Lima Declaration, and from Bolivia at the 36th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, for an effective international campaign against traffic in drugs. Some 79 states have signed the Convention, indicating the strong support in the international community for its intent and content. I am advised that, like ourselves, most signatory parties are proceeding to ratification of the Convention through their own constitutional procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation represents the first step in the process of Australia's ratification of the Convention. Ratification will achieve one of the aims of the National Campaign against Drug Abuse, which has the support of all governments in Australia. The States have been aware of the proposed Convention and of the Commonwealth's wish to become a party to it from the beginning of the drafting process in 1985, and their views were sought at each stage of the negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise, however, that this Convention reinforces only one strand in the international drug strategy, which, as the international community recognises, requires a multidisciplinary approach. The Declaration of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Vienna in June 1987 designated four areas for future action:</PARA>
<PARA>prevention and reduction of demand;</PARA>
<PARA>control of supply (including programs for rural development involving crop eradication and substitution);</PARA>
<PARA>suppression or illicit trafficking; and</PARA>
<PARA>treatment and rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the Convention is, of course, directed at the illicit drug trade, it also touches upon these other important aspects of the problem of drug abuse. This, too, is consistent with the approach adopted in the national campaign against drug abuse. This campaign also takes a multidisciplinary approach with a strong emphasis on education and prevention directed at vulnerable groups, and treatment and rehabilitation of regular users. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a degree of misunderstanding about the effect which ratification of the Convention will have on drugs policy. The Convention primarily addresses the question of trafficking in illicit drugs. It includes provisions relating to extradition, mutual assistance, confiscation of assets, following the money trail and questions of jurisdiction. It expressly provides that parties to the Convention will ensure that drug trafficking offences attract the strong criminal sanctions they deserve but distinguishes between possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking and for personal use. It is in respect of the latter category that the Convention has been seriously misrepresented. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to some views which have been expressed, the Convention does not preclude the re-examination of policy in relation to personal use of prohibited drugs. It is open to governments, should they so decide, within the context of this Convention, to provide that possession which would otherwise be an offence will not be subject to criminal penalties where the possession is clearly for personal use only. Thus, the Convention specifically states that parties may, as an alternative to conviction or punishment in such cases, provide measures for the treatment, education, aftercare, rehabilitation or social reintegration of the offender. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, section 17a of the Crimes Act 1914, which provides that imprisonment should be imposed as a last resort, will apply to offences created under this Bill. As a result, when the courts are considering sentences to be imposed on persons convicted of offences in relation to cultivation or production for personal use, they will be required to give preference to alternative forms of sentences which could lawfully be imposed. Such alternatives could include programs of rehabilitation, treatment and education, and the court would need to be satisfied that none of these options is appropriate before they impose a sentence of imprisonment. Thus, sentencing options already available in the case of Commonwealth offenders enable us to take full advantage of the alternatives to sentencing proposed in Article 3 of the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the obligations created under the Convention which fall within areas of Commonwealth legislative responsibility are already covered by Commonwealth legislation such as the Customs Act 1901, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Extradition Act 1988 and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Other obligations fall within areas of State responsibility, and consultations are under way with the States on action to be taken by them to ensure their laws are in accord with the terms of the Convention. The Commonwealth has been very much aware of the importance of not encroaching on areas of State jurisdiction in this field and fully supports the continuation of the cooperative approach to drug law enforcement with the State and Territory governments and their law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal area requiring legislation in the Commonwealth sphere relates to the need to create extraterritorial jurisdiction under Article 4 of the Convention. The purpose of the jurisdictional changes envisaged by Article 4 is to ensure that drug traffickers cannot escape justice by moving from one jurisdiction to another-for example, to a jurisdiction which for a valid reason is not prepared to surrender the person to the country the laws of which were infringed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now outline the ways in which this Bill will extend Australia's extraterritorial jurisdiction. The first extension relates to Australian nationals who have engaged in conduct, outside existing Australian jurisdiction, which would constitute an Article 3 offence if it had occurred in Australia. and where extradition of such persons from Australia is not sought or, if sought, is not granted for reasons outside the scope of section 45 of the Extradition Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also establishes a second area of jurisdiction where a person who is not an Australian national has engaged in drug-related conduct outside Australia which constitutes an offence against the law of the country where it occurred and also against the law in force in an Australian State or Territory and the person is subsequently present in Australia; but Australia declines to extradite that person. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Bill creates jurisdiction over persons who are outside Australia and engage in conduct with the view to the commission of a drug-related offence in Australia; for example, knowingly growing a crop for subsequent marketing in Australia. The Bill also creates offences arising out of drug-related conduct on Australian aircraft and provides for the exercise of Commonwealth jurisdiction on Australian ships in certain circumstances. Another provision creates a Federal offence which has the effect of applying, outside Australia, State and Territory offences of conspiring or attempting, aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the carrying out of drug-related conduct which is an offence against the law of a State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not anticipate that the proposals put forward in this Bill will have a significant impact on Government expenditure in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first step in the process of ratification of this most important United Nations Convention. Further action will be required by the States before ratification can take place. The Convention seeks to achieve concerted international action against those who, for their own gain and at great cost to the community, engage in illicit trafficking in drugs. The cooperative multidisciplinary approach of the national campaign against drug abuse recognises the need to address the problems of addiction with compassion and to offer treatment and rehabilitation to those suffering under all forms of drug addiction. In no way can it be argued that ratification will prevent a reasoned and complete debate on the merits of the present national approach to drug abuse. The Government welcomes such a debate but remains committed, along with our State and Territory counterparts, to the type of tough and thorough measures prescribed by the Convention in respect of illicit drug trafficking. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill represents an important measure in the Government's efforts to strengthen and, where necessary, protect the legitimate autonomy of higher education institutions. The specific purpose of the Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act to protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students and the imposition and collection of fees for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will be aware, student organisations provide a wide range of services to their members from counselling, sporting, health and careers services to the necessary social outlets for young people in higher education. It is fundamentally important that these services and amenities be maintained at a viable level. This cannot be achieved without money. The principal source of that money is services and amenities fees collected from students themselves by the governing bodies of the institutions on behalf of organisations representing the interests of students generally. At present these fees are paid in accordance with provisions made by the governing bodies of the institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that there needs to be a Bill of this kind at all. However, States have in the past interfered with these arrangements and some are threatening to do so again. We are not prepared to see this happen. This Bill provides that, as a condition of grant under the Act, a State must not interfere with the rights of the governing bodies of institutions to make decisions as to the imposition or collection of fees for organisations representing the interests of students generally. If a State breaches this condition it will be required to make up any consequential shortfall in revenue to those institutions. If necessary this will be achieved by a requirement that the State pay the Commonwealth an amount to make up the shortfall or alternatively, the Commonwealth could reduce the State's general revenue assistance. The Commonwealth will then make payments direct to the affected institutions. The Government encourages any State contemplating such interference in the autonomy of higher education institutions to think again and hopes that the provisions of this Bill will never need to be invoked. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last six years, the Federal Labor Government has reconstructed Australia's social security system. Once regarded as little more than a passive payment agency, the social security system now has strong and active links to employment, training and labour market services. Social security policy has become an integral part of the Government's economic, wages and taxation policies. The social security, wages and tax systems have been restructured to deliver fairer and more adequate incomes to all at every stage of life. Together these systems now provide a solid base of economic security for all Australians. The barriers and difficulties confronting the different groups within the social security system have been progressively identified and tackled. Today's social security system offers incentives and opportunities for those of working age to move from payments designed for short term support back into jobs. Assistance has been targeted to those most in need while administrative procedures have been constantly improved to minimise the risk of payment abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The impetus for many of these changes has been the Social Security Review which last year completed its historic `life cycle' examination of the system-the first time this has been done since World War II. The results of our reconstruction are clear. For the first time ever Australia has a guaranteed level of income support for families with children. Australia now leads the world in providing adequate, secure child support to separated parents. The increasingly strong links between Australia's social security system and labour market assistance for the unemployed and sole parents are setting the pace for reform in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. </PARA>
<PARA> These links provide opportunities to participate in the mainstream of community life for people at risk of being excluded. They ensure that the community does not bear the cost of unnecessary and counterproductive welfare dependency. This Bill would implement further fundamental reforms to the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1989-90 Budget and retirement income policy statement, the Federal Government announced a fundamental restructuring of the relationship of the public pension and tax system on the one hand and private savings and support for retired Australians on the other. This restructuring will provide a sound basis of income security for the retired and for those who will retire in the next decade and in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes, like every element of the Government's social policies, are fully funded on introduction and sustainable in the long term. They complement the Government's reform of superannuation. This Bill would reshape income support to take account of the different forms of savings available to retired people and ensure that they can live with dignity and security in their own home. Our policies will guarantee access to a fair, adequate, secure and sustainable retirement income for all Australians. The most significant reform for older Australians will be a major restructuring of the overlap between the pension income test and taxation. This Bill would implement our promise that, from 1991, the income test free area will be indexed annually. The free area will also be 100 per cent tax free. Further, from 1995 no age or service pensioner-full rate or part rate-will pay income tax. These, plus other significant reforms to date, mean that every major element of the social security system will be protected into the future by guaranteed automatic adjustment for inflation. This Bill also contains carefully crafted and coordinated measures to provide better opportunities and incentives for self-provision for the aged, the disabled, sole parents and the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would overhaul the interaction of private superannuation and the social security system. The treatment of annuities and superannuation pensions under the income test will be brought into line with their treatment in the tax system. The Bill would exempt from the income test that part of the undeducted purchase price which represents the notional return of the after tax purchase price of a superannuation pension or an immediate annuity. These changes would be complemented by exclusion of superannuation pensions from the assets test and by special rules from the treatment of immediate annuities under the assets test. This will ensure the changes have the effect of encouraging the use of private savings to provide retirement incomes, rather than becoming a vehicle for income test avoidance. Labor's better incomes policy acknowledges the wide range of needs of retired and pre-retired people. This Bill would enable people who are disabled or have become unemployed before age pension age to retain the full benefit of their superannuation for retirement. Income which accrues on compulsorily preserved superannuation will be exempted from pension and benefit income tests until the pensioner or beneficiary reaches age pension age, except when the person draws on the superannuation. In those cases, the growth will be treated as income over the 12 months following the withdrawal. Compulsorily preserved superannuation will be disregarded under the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, through our retirement income policy we will provide opportunities for all Australians to provide for their retirement. We will deliver better incomes in retirement to all Australians. When the Whitlam Government was elected the age pension was only 19 per cent of average weekly earnings. In three years Whitlam raised the level of the pension to almost 25 per cent. However, over the next seven years the conservative parties in Government allowed the pension to fall back to about 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. This Labor Government has steadily regained the ground lost under the conservatives. Through this Bill pensions would be lifted to more than 25 per cent of average weekly earnings-in fact to their highest level relative to average earnings in 40 years. From April 1990, single rate pensions and benefits for people with dependants will rise by $2 a week on top of indexation. Pensions and benefits for married people will rise by $3.30 a week on top of indexation. This means pensions for single people will rise by about $11 a week by April next year and the combined married rate pension will rise by about $18. The Bill leaves entrenched our amendments to indexation provisions made earlier in the year, which guarantee twice- yearly indexation rises in line with the consumer price index at the earliest time possible, so pensions will retain their real value. These measures represent an unprecedented commitment to the adequacy of the age pension. But we will go further. Labor, and only Labor, is committed to further increases on top of indexation over time, to deliver better incomes in retirement to all: to those without private means of support as well as to those with superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill recognises the housing needs and aspirations of retired people and others. The rent assistance measures that would be implemented by this Bill, in tandem with measures legislated following last year's Budget, fundamentally restructure the rent assistance program. Maximum rates of rent assistance for the aged will double-from $15 a week to $30 a week-between December this year and September next year. Assistance to families with children-low wage families, sole parent families, unemployed families-will more than double: up from $15 a week to $35 a week and $40 maximum payment a week for families with three or more children. The Bill also recognises the needs of older home owners who, though not having the costs of private rents, often need to find money for house repairs or alterations. Home equity conversion is a mechanism by which a home owner may convert all or part of the equity he or she has locked up in the family home into cash or a stream of income. The Act at present discourages pensioners from embarking on these schemes because the money raised may be treated as income. This Bill relaxes the income and assets tests to allow pensioners access to home equity conversion products without penalty. They will therefore be able to draw a loan of up to $40,000 on what is probably their most valuable asset to carry out home improvements or to raise their standard of living. The draw downs on a home equity conversion will be exempt from the assets test for up to 90 days. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill acknowledges the extra costs faced by pensioner couples when one of the couple is in respite care for a period of 14 days or more. The maximum single rate would be the maximum rate payable to each of the couple during any such period of respite care. These measures-overhaul of rent assistance, home equity conversion concessions and additional help during respite care-provide a coherent comprehensive basis for addressing the housing needs of the aged and low income families. The Bill would also address the income security needs of people following the death of a spouse or dependant. The bereavement package would replace the current special temporary allowance and funeral benefit with a new, more generous scheme of bereavement payments. The new scheme would preserve for 14 weeks the entitlement of the partner or child who has died in the form of a payment to the surviving partner or parent. This allows a period for readjustment for the bereaved before having to establish a new structure of income support. </PARA>
<PARA> The new payment is available to the surviving member of a married pensioner couple, a sole parent pensioner on the death of the only qualifying child and the parents of a deceased dependent child who attracted one or more of the various family payments available. When the Department becomes aware of the death, the balance of any entitlements under these new arrangements would be cashed out, as soon as practicable, to a lump sum to assist with funeral and other costs likely to arise. The legislation would make it clear that where payments continue during the 14 weeks after death to an account in the name of the deceased-whether alone or jointly with the surviving spouse-the financial institution would be entitled to pay those amounts to the spouse. This will address a major practical problem that faces many newly widowed people-continuing access to their bank accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would dramatically simplify the earnings credit to provide extra assistance to pensioners who undertake short term jobs and to provide a springboard into employment for pensioners seeking permanent jobs, especially sole parent pensioners. From April 1990, earnings credit accrual will be standardised. Pensioners will build up credit at a set rate depending on the income test free area that applies to them. This will be $40 a week for single people, $35 for each of a married couple, plus $12 for each dependent child. The maximum credit will remain at $1,000. This amendment will create a more worthwhile, understandable and efficient earnings credit scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The aged package included in this Bill, and complemented by other measures announced in the Budget, is the most comprehensive, detailed and coherent social policy development in the history of Australian Federation. It is based on the detailed work of the social security review and was crafted following extensive consultations conducted by the Government on the issue. I would like to record in particular the Government's appreciation of the efforts of the members of the task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on retirement incomes jointly convened, by Mr Speaker, Mr McLeay, and the honourable member for Phillip, Ms McHugh. Their efforts and the efforts of the thousands of retired people who spoke with them ensured that this package is a package for the long term. It is with deep regret that I record that the Opposition has still not committed itself to the long term commitments in this policy-the indexation of free areas in 1991 and the removal of all age and service pensioners from the tax system in 1995. A retirement income policy must be stable and long term. If the Opposition is serious about all Australians having adequate incomes in retirement, if it is serious about enhancing our national savings effort it will use the debate on this Bill to unequivocally commit itself for the long term to the national retirement income policy. Its failure to do so, or any qualification of its commitment, will be a clear signal to the retired and pre-retired people of Australia about the priority the Opposition gives to better incomes for all in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Many provisions of this Bill which address the needs of the aged extend to veterans and their dependants in receipt of a repatriation service pension in the same way as to social security age pension recipients. This Bill also provides for increases in the rates of payment of a number of minor benefits for severely handicapped veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last five years Labor has rebuilt the integrity of Australia's unemployment benefit system. We have fundamentally restructured the system and converted it from a passive payment system to an active system linked to labour market policies and programs designed for the broad range of people dependent on unemployment benefit. This Bill would continue with the reform of benefits entitlements that has underwritten that restructuring. The labour market and income support issues facing older unemployed people are of particular concern to the Government in terms of social justice, economic and retirement income policy objectives. There has been a disturbing long term trend of declining labour force participation by people aged 55 and over. Together with the retirement income policy, this Bill would provide more adequate assistance and better opportunities and incentives for regaining employment to the older unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the work test for beneficiaries aged 55 and over would be restructured-to enable older beneficiaries to retain or regain close attachment to the labour market. The dynamic Newstart strategy-described by the Opposition spokesman as `spectacularly successful'-introduced in February this year allows participation in Commonwealth Employment Service approved training courses and voluntary work while unemployment benefit continues. The strategy helps the long term unemployed to get back to work. This Bill would provide the basis to extend the strategy to all older unemployed beneficiaries regardless of how long they have been on benefit. Further, older beneficiaries on benefit for 12 months or more will be able to engage in training or voluntary work for even longer-for up to 26 weeks in a year. They will also be able to participate in substantial ongoing part time employment as an acceptable alternative to the requirement to seek suitable, full time work. Second, the maximum rate of benefit for people aged 60 or more would be aligned with pension rates after six months receipt of benefit. The 26-week rent assistance waiting period would be abolished for beneficiaries aged 60 or more. Third, people aged 60 and above who have been receiving unemployment or sickness benefit for at least 12 months will become eligible for a health benefit card rather than the less beneficial health care card which they currently have available to them. This new card will provide the full range of Commonwealth fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures will be complemented by a hefty boost in availability and appropriateness of labour market programs-such as Jobstart, Jobtrain, Skillshare and the new enterprise incentive scheme-for the older unemployed. Different methods of helping and encouraging older unemployed people back into work are being trialled over the next 12 months. These measures stand in sharp contrast to the Opposition's approach. The Opposition argues that all long term unemployed people should be removed from unemployment benefit and placed on special benefit-or receive nothing. Their position is also that Jobstart, Skillshare and the new enterprise incentive scheme-centrepieces of Labor's approach for the older unemployed-should be abolished. There is no doubt that this Bill-in providing for modifications to unemployment benefit to help people back to work-is inconsistent with Opposition policy. The debate on the Bill provides to the Opposition an opportunity to put down the details of how it would deal with the older unemployed. Over the last four years this Labor Government has completely restructured income support and labour market assistance for the young. The common allowance structure-under which Austudy for young people at school is paid at the same rate as job search allowance-or JSA-for unemployed young people has removed the incentive for young people to leave school for unemployment. The JSA structure has also provided an integrated basis for delivery of income support and labour market assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of Labor's approach are dramatic. The numbers dependent on social security have plummeted while the proportion staying on at school has skyrocketed. However, we recognise that some young people have missed out-and so we developed the youth social justice strategy announced in the Budget. That strategy involves an integrated comprehensive $100m program to address the barriers facing disadvantaged young people and to respond to the concerns about youth homelessness highlighted in the Burdekin report. This Bill would implement the social security aspects of that program. Young homeless allowance would be increased on 1 January 1990 by $7.50 a week, bringing the total payment for homeless young people to $95.10 week-and the payment will be indexed every year from then on so that it keeps its value. Young homeless allowance has been subject to a six-week waiting period. To avoid the hardship that this may cause and recognising that delaying payment cannot actually resolve family problems, the Government has decided to reduce this waiting period to two weeks. For those who have faced a history of domestic violence, sexual abuse or other similar serious problems, the waiting period would be abolished altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would implement an independent rate of job search allowance for young people who are exempt from the parental income test because of their independent status. The rate payable would be $95.10, an increase of over $41 a week. The new rate, which would be indexed every year, would be paid from the beginning of 1990 to young people who have not lived at home for six months, who have worked full time for at least 13 weeks since then and who do not get any financial support from their families. In addition the $25 minimum rate of job search allowance would be indexed on 1 January each year commencing in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would reinforce the Government's encouragement for young unemployed people to move back into the labour force or to continue full time studies. An employment entry payment of $50 would be available to people who take up full time employment after being on job search allowance for nine months or longer. Their spouses would be eligible for the same payment which acts as a recompense for some of the hidden costs involved in taking up a job. People who receive job search allowance or junior rate sickness benefit for nine months before starting work would no longer have to serve the normal 13-week waiting period if they need to reapply within 13 weeks of losing benefit. The Newstart work test concession which is currently available to long term beneficiaries would be extended to young people who have been on job search allowance for at least three months. This would enable them to participate for a total of eight weeks each year in Commonwealth Employment Service-approved voluntary work or short training courses. Finally, students who reapply for job search allowance or unemployment benefit within four weeks of attempting a return to study would not have to serve a second 13-week education leaver's deferment period. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this significant range of reforms for our youth, the labour market package announced in the Budget continues the promotion of a more active unemployment benefit program through several innovative measures. To encourage married beneficiaries and their partners to make the most out of labour market opportunities that come their way through part time work, the Bill would provide for them to earn a further $30 a fortnight between them above the usual $60 without losing any benefit. A sole parent beneficiary whose youngest child receives job search allowance would receive an increase in the rate of benefit to the same rate which is paid to the sole parent of a child receiving Austudy. To remove another inequity in this area, a sole parent pensioner or beneficiary whose only child attracts Austudy or a similar payment would no longer be paid the higher `with dependant' rate of benefit or mother's/guardian's allowance once that child turns 18. To provide appropriate assistance to sole parents, formal training allowance payable for part time training would not be counted as income under the pension income test-bringing it into line with the way formal training allowance for full time training is handled. Recipients of unemployment benefit and job search allowance would be automatically issued with health care cards as from June 1990 without the need to apply a separate income test. Those beneficiaries along with sole parent pensioners who have received payment for at least 12 months would be entitled to health care cards for at least six months after starting full time unemployment. This measure will remove a significant disincentive to regaining employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to providing adequate support for Aboriginal people in rural and remote areas. Family payments at present can be made only to the immediate family or sometimes to an institution. More appropriate mechanisms may be available for Aboriginal children living in remote or isolated communities. From next year, bulk payments or family allowance at the higher rate would be available to Aboriginal community organisations which provide services of benefit to the children concerned. This arrangement would apply only with the agreement of the people concerned. These measures form part of a package to lift the standard of service provided by the Department of Social Security to isolated and remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains several other measures in the area of family payments. From next year, parents with a child under 16 earning $100 or more a week would no longer be entitled to child payments for that child. The $100 would be indexed each year. Child payments for a student child would cease when the student turned 16 unless Austudy or its equivalent was not payable. Parents with children who are receiving formal training allowance would no longer be eligible to receive family payments for those children. From April 1990, invalid pension would not be granted to people over age pension age. Currently, infirm elderly people who do not meet the residency requirements for age pension can gain access to the same rate of payment through the invalid pension system which does not have the same residency requirements. The amendment would reflect the clear purpose of invalid pension as a payment related to incapacity for work for people of work force age. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 19 of the Social Security Act provides a scheme for the protection of personal information held in the social security system by making it an offence for departmental staff to record or disclose such information outside the course of their duties. Where there is a legitimate public interest reason to disclose information, those receiving it, whether officers or not, are bound by the same section 19 restrictions in passing on that information. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would close a loophole in the provisions which could allow people who have acquired personal information from officers acting in breach of the section, and who may in turn use or disclose that information, to do so without themselves committing an offence. Receiving, using or disclosing information concerning a client without lawful excuse or authority, or advertising or holding out that one has access to such information would be an offence under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would continue Labor's vigilance in guaranteeing the integrity of the social security and veterans systems. It would provide for the imposition of an interest charge of 20 per cent on amounts defrauded from either system through major frauds. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the significance of 1990 in the annals of the Anzac tradition and to the Government interest in the commemoration of this historic event which is to include a visit to Gallipoli by a number of World War I veterans. The Government is concerned to preserve the integrity of the significance of this event. Misuses of the term `Anzac' have already taken place. To prevent further misuses and abuses of this sort, this Bill introduced increased penalties for the use of the term `Anzac' without the authority of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the principal Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901, along the lines of the similarly titled Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bills introduced into this place over the last few years. In addition, this Bill proposes a series of repeals of various unproclaimed sections of early 1980s Customs and Excise Acts, following a recent review of unproclaimed Customs-related legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The main proposals contained in the Bill relate to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The termination of manufacturing in bond, announced by the Government in the context of the 1988 May economic statement (clauses 7 and 8);</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The amendments to the commercial tariff concession system (Part XVa of the Customs Act 1901) announced by the Government on 14 September 1989 (clauses 18 to 29); and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The new requirement that all potable spirits imported into Australia in bulk containers be repackaged in licensed premises prior to entry for home consumption (clause 9), and that locally produced spirit be repackaged in non-bulk containers prior to entry for home consumption (clause 37) as announced by the Government on 18 December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall refer briefly to each of those proposals now. </PARA>
<PARA>Manufacture in Bond</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Manufacture in bond arrangements permit the production of prescribed goods in a manufacturing warehouse licensed by Customs, for both domestic and export markets. The stated objective of the manufacture in bond scheme is to promote local manufacture of goods. The scheme is meant to assist local manufacturers by: allowing them to defer payment of duty on imported inputs used in production until the completed-manufactured-product is entered for home consumption; and allowing goods manufactured in bond to be entered for home consumption at the lesser amount of either the combined duty of the imported components or the duty payable on the finished article if it were imported. </PARA>
<PARA> Other inherent benefits of the scheme are that wastages of imported materials and/or components in the production process are not dutiable, duties are not payable on imported inputs used in the manufacture of goods for export and, prior to the May economic statement of 1988, manufacturers were not liable for duty on imported inputs used in the manufacture of goods sold to Commonwealth authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1987 the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) reported to the Government on export concessions, report No. 399 dated 16 January 1987, and recommended, inter alia, that manufacture in bond be abolished. The Commission found that the original objectives of the scheme have not been pursued. At the time of the inquiry the only goods being produced were blended oils (manufactured by one plant) and telecommunication equipment (manufactured by 14 licensed warehouses, which has subsequently been further reduced to only four warehouses). The manufacture in bond scheme has not promoted Australian manufacturing industry and it tends to discourage investment in, and the sourcing of, materials and components from other domestic import competing industries, because with concessional entry under the scheme, it is often cheaper to source materials and components from overseas. The scheme has also not been effective in promoting exports as only a small proportion of the goods produced in bond have been exported. The IAC noted, and the Government accepted, that there are alternative and more effective assistance schemes in existence which provide duty concessions on imported inputs, notably the commercial tariff concession system, and, from the viewpoint of export promotion, schemes such as the duty drawback and by-law for export schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepted the IAC's recommendation to abolish this scheme and announced, in May 1988 as part of the May economic statement, its intention to terminate manufacture in bond. The proposed amendment in clause 8 of this Bill will terminate the manufacture in bond facility as from 1 January 1990. The activities of blending and packaging, however, will still be permitted in licensed warehouses. </PARA>
<PARA>Commercial Tariff Concession System</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the amendments to Part xva of the Customs Act relating to the commercial tariff concession system is to overcome the narrow interpretation that has been placed on the provisions contained therein by decisions of the Federal Court such as that in Corinthian Industries (Syd) Pty Ltd v. Comptroller-General of Customs and Others, contrary to the original intent of the Government when the scheme was introduced in 1983. Notwithstanding that the Government has announced that the new Industry Commission will review the overall objectives and operation of the commercial tariff concession system, it believes immediate action is necessary to implement the proposals contained in this Bill in order to restore the original intention of the system, overcome operational problems and provide additional benefits to industry. The changes proposed will enable the system to be effectively administered in the period up to the Industry Commission report, expected in late 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of background to the proposed changes in clauses 18 to 29 of this Bill, it is opportune to recall the original purpose and intent of the legislative provisions in this part of the Customs Act. On 2 July 1982 the Industries Assistance Commission reported to the government of the day recommending that a modified commercial by-law system be introduced. The Government accepted the report and introduced the commercial tariff concession system with the clear intention that it would be broad in interpretation and predictable in administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The system provides a mechanism to allow the duty free entry of goods, where goods serving similar functions are not produced or capable of being produced in Australia in the normal course of business. Experience with the system has pointed to several changes which could be made to improve operational efficiency. In the May 1988 economic statement the Government announced that it would modify the system to align its operation more closely with the Government's industry and technology policy objectives. Subsequent to that economic statement, decisions by the Federal Court have highlighted restrictive and narrow interpretations to various definitions contained in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> To restore the Australian Customs Service's ability to administer the legislation in accordance with the Government's intentions it is necessary to make appropriate changes to the legislation and fine-tune operational aspects of the system. The amendments proposed in this Bill seek to achieve this. In particular, it is proposed to delete from the legislation the interpretation of `particular goods', `serving similar functions' and `capable of being produced/repaired in the normal course of business', and the term `particular' from the phrase `particular goods' where it is no longer relevant. I refer to clause 18. These definitions have proven to be a source of contention and have forced administrators to interpret the legislation more narrowly than the Government intended. The removal of these definitions from the legislation and their replacement by principles for the interpretation of key phrases-I refer to clause 19-will ensure that administrators, importers and local manufacturers have a clear understanding of the system's objectives and will provide the flexibility to ensure that the system can be administered as the Government originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, as the Federal Court has determined in Corinthian Industries that the existing legislation limits the scope of a concession order to the particular goods that are the subject of an application, legislative amendments are necessary to enable commercial tariff concession orders to be issued in relation to the relevant class of goods rather than the narrowly specified products sometimes described in applications. This power, contained in clause 20, is necessary because, under the current provisions, neither the applicant nor the Comptroller-General of Customs is empowered to change the wording of an application. In practical terms this means that if, for example, after approaches to local manufacturers, an applicant accepts that a concession can only be issued for a narrower range of goods than that applied for, such a concession cannot be granted unless a new application is made. This results, however, not only in a substantial loss of time but, more importantly, the loss of the original operative date of the concession. </PARA>
<PARA> Another proposed amendment concerns section 269e, relating to the national interest discretion, amongst other matters. Currently the Comptroller-General of Customs has the power to refuse to grant a concession order if he considers such a concession is not in the national interest. The Government considers that such power is more appropriately vested in a Minister, and therefore clause 22 effects the necessary amendment in this regard. Finally, amendments are proposed to sections 269n and h of the Act by clauses 27 and 24 respectively to facilitate the granting of specified period concession orders, and simplify the date of commencement of all orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, an application can be preceded by a notice of intention to make a concession order which allows the applicant 28 days to obtain and present the information required for a legal application. If the application is received within the 28-day period the date of lodgment of the notice of intention becomes the operative date when a concession order is issued. The Government proposes to abolish this practice and automatically make the date of effect for all concessions 28 days prior to the date of lodgment of the application. Such action will reduce paperwork for clients and unnecessary checking by administrators. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, under the current legislative regime concession orders cannot be granted for periods during an applications's processing time. The Government believes in principle that in such circumstances a concession should be available, an initiative widely supported by industry. It is therefore proposed to amend the legislation to allow a concession order to be granted from cessation of availability of locally produced goods or from the normal date of commencement to the day local production commenced or a local manufacturer satisfies the capability to produce criteria. I refer to clause 27. </PARA>
<PARA>Abolition of Out of Bond Bottling/Packaging</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I wish to address concerning this Bill relates to the proposed amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 in clauses 9 and 37 respectively relating to the new control regime for imported and locally produced potable spirits. The amendments propose that all potable spirits be bottled or packaged into non-bulk containers in licensed premises prior to their entry for home consumption, which is the point at which duty is assessed and collected. The amendments will have the effect of removing the facility which currently exists for such spirit to be entered into home consumption in bulk containers. Such a practice has been identified both by this Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, and by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 408 of 19 November 1987 on the customs and excise bond system, as one which increases the possibility of illicit spirit production via the mixing of duty paid spirit with illicit spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> To address the possible risk both to Commonwealth revenue and public health from this practice of bottling or packaging spirit outside of licensed premises, the Government proposes as from 1 January 1990 to effect the change outlined. The remaining provisions in this Bill propose a series of minor policy or technical drafting changes, which are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. One of the proposed amendments, however, I would like to touch on briefly here. That relates to the amendment in clause 6, which provides a head or power to permit the making of regulation to impose a fee for services to defray the costs incurred the Australian Customs Service in respect of preparing certain kinds of import entries lodged under section 36 of the Customs Act 1901. The Government appreciates the sensitivity which attaches to any cost recovery initiatives, and will proceed with such fees only after suitable consultation with relevant Government agencies and industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>

<PARA> The proposed amendments in this Bill have no direct financial implications. I commend the Bill to the House and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Act 1989, the First Home Owners Act 1983, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974. The major purpose of this Bill is to enable the residents' rights initiatives to be implemented in nursing homes and hostels. The Bill also removes the necessity for a medical certificate for nursing home admission; allows for backdating of domiciliary nursing care benefit in certain circumstances; provides for proprietors of nursing homes to be approved operators; provides for lodg- ment and processing fees for reviews of budgets of deficits of certain nursing homes; and includes certain minor amendments consequential to the implementation of new respite care arrangements in nursing homes. These measures are based on the Government's social justice policy and continue the reform strategy in the aged care program with particular emphasis on ensuring access and equity, promoting equality and providing opportunities for full participation in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes amendments to: the First Home Owners Act 1983; the definitions of `proprietor of a laboratory' and `officer' of the Health Insurance Commission; restrict entitlement to Medicare benefits of certain diplomatic representatives; the administration of the vocational register of general practitioners; and various arrangements of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The major purpose of the Bill is to introduce new provisions which give effect to the rights and responsibilities of residents of Commonwealth funded aged care facilities. The Bill provides for a `charter of residents rights and responsibilities' and an agreement between a resident and a proprietor of a facility, based on the charter. The Bill strengthens the legislative provisions for preserving those rights by improving access by authorised persons to facilities, residents and staff. The Bill also seeks to make available information about the standard and general nature of services provided by a particular nursing home or hostel to enable consumers, the elderly or their friends or relatives to make informed choices about suitable care and to encourage high quality care. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 the nursing homes and hostels review recommended a major program of aged care reforms aimed at providing better quality care and a greater range of choices for frail aged people. The first four reform stages were concerned with the rational use of resources, more effective planning, equitable distribution of funding, effective assessment and equity in care provision. The fifth stage of this reform process was heralded by the release of the report Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes and Hostels in July this year. In the minds of many people, older members of our society are seen as a group, rather than as individuals. They are often considered to be without influence and dependent on the goodwill of others. Consequently, they are devalued and may become even more vulnerable to harassment, threats and even physical violence. Older people are also commonly victims of a patronising approach which sees all people over a particular age as unable to make decisions and needing assistance with every task. Many older people have accepted this negative view of themselves and have become resigned to being isolated and lonely. We must not accept this situation as inevitable. Government have a responsibility to both enforce rights and educate and inform in relation to those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Residents' Rights in Nursing Home and Hostels was the final report of the consultant commissioned to identify the issues that concern residents of nursing homes and hostels and to examine the attitudes and approach of nursing home and hostel proprietors and staff to residents of those facilities. Four major problems were identified in the report: residents' feelings of isolation and boredom; the lack of control that residents feel they have over their own lives; the absence of information about available services; and the fear of retribution if any complaint is made. These problems are ones which should be of concern both to service providers and to the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go through the report's recommendations in detail. Instead, I will refer to the major changes flowing from the report which the Government, in the 1989-90 Budget context, has announced as priority initiatives for implementation over the next four years. The priorities in 1989-90 will be to implement: a charter of residents' rights and responsibilities and a resident/provider agreement by 1 July 1990-the standard agreement would be implemented in respect of new residents only from 1 July 1990 and a later date will be negotiated with the industry for completion of agreements with existing residents; the establishment in each State and Territory office of the Department of Community Services and Health of an effective unit to receive and follow-up complaints from residents for their representatives; Commonwealth funding for independent advocacy and mediation services in each State and Territory to take up grievance issues on behalf of residents-it is likely that most will be operational in the latter part of 1989-90; a community visitors scheme to enable residents to have greater access to their local community and to provide residents with information, support and advice-it is anticipated that the scheme will be implemented first in Queensland and Victoria from April 1990; and a comprehensive information strategy to enhance the awareness of residents, potential residents and the community generally, of care options and the key issues to be considered in choosing the right type of care. Before action is commenced to implement these initiatives there will be extensive consultation with the industry, consumers and staff groups. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to outline the provisions in the Bill to enable the residents' rights initiatives to be implemented. While the residents' rights report makes a large number of recommendations for change, it recognised that it is also critical to change the attitudes of our society towards the aged as well as those of consumers, staff and management. The proposed amendments to the Aged or Disabled Homes Act 1954 and the National Health Act 1953 contained in this Bill will provide the framework within which residents' rights issues can be addressed, and thus continue the process of positive change. The Bill provides the Minister with the power to formulate a statement or charter of the rights and responsibilities of the residents of approved nursing homes and hostels. The charter is a broad statement of principle which will emphasise rights of choice, access to services, rights to independence, participating and involvement in all aspects of daily life, and access of the residents to their own records. It will also state the responsibilities that residents, as adult members of society, should meet in their daily lives, including respecting the rights of others. </PARA>
<PARA> The residents' rights report suggested that there are a number of advantages of a charter:</PARA>
<PARA> A charter provides residents with a sound basis for any negotiations with management around particular issues . . . also, it provides a sound basis for the quality of care which management are endeavouring to provide. It is a useful tool for informing residents about what they can expect in a facility and for educating new staff members on the nature and type of facilities they have joined. </PARA>
<PARA>The charter, along with the proposed agreements, will establish the concept of residents and proprietors being equal partners. The Bill also provides for the adoption of contractual arrangements or agreements between nursing home residents and proprietors, as a condition of funding. The entering into of agreements as a condition of funding has already existed in hostels since January this year and this Bill will simply extend the arrangements to nursing homes. The implementation of a standard residents' agreement between nursing home and hostel residents and proprietors is considered essential. The residents' rights report stated that, currently, entering into formal legal arrangements between residents and management is not a common practice. This means that neither party has a clear definition of their full rights and responsibilities towards the other party and there are no clearly defined paths to protect those rights and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for situations where the resident either does not wish to enter, or is not capable of entering, into an agreement or is not able to be represented by either a guardian or person holding power of attorney. This is particularly relevant in nursing homes where a significant proportion of residents are unable to manage their own affairs as a result of dementia or similar conditions. These residents are entitled to the same consideration as others, and the Bill provides for them to be cared for in the same manner as those residents for whom there is an agreement in place between a resident and the proprietor. In situations where there is no agreement between a resident and the proprietor, the proprietor will be required to comply with conditions set down by the Minister in a notice in writing. The conditions would be consistent with matters covered in the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> While the proposed amendments provide the Minister with the broad power to determine a common or standard form of agreement to be entered into between residents and proprietors, it is envisaged that the agreement will be consistent with the charter and will cover fees and financial information; service provision; security of tenure; participation in decision making, anddispute resolution. The resident and proprietor may add to this if they so wish, so long as the intent of the standard agreement is preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes amendments to provide Commonwealth officers and other authorised persons with greater access to nursing homes in the performance of their duties. Currently, Commonwealth officers who monitor standards are authorised under section 42 of the Act to enter the premises and access only the documentation related to the operation of the premises as a nursing home. The proposed amendment will extend authorised access by Commonwealth officers to include residents and staff of the nursing home and to documents related to the provision of care. The proposed authorisation does not imply that residents or staff will be coerced into talking with officers but merely enable officers to have access to such people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also facilitates access to residents, staff and documents by those Commonwealth officers who review the degree of care required by residents and verify the level of subsidy payable. At present, access for the purposes of review of resident classifications is not guaranteed. Consequently, if a nursing home denied access, no reviews could be undertaken. This means that, potentially, a nursing home could gain excess benefit by classifying its residents into unjustifiably high categories of relative service need but the Department of Community Services and Health would not be able to challenge these classifications. As a key initiative to provide the more isolated residents of nursing homes and hostels with support, advice and links to the external community, the residents' rights report recommended the establishment of a community visitors scheme. Under this scheme, people in the community with spare time and an interest in aged care will visit an allocated nursing home and hostel at least once a month. For this, they are to be paid a special honorarium-$600 per annum based on $50 per monthly visit. The Bill makes provision for the Minister to designate people as community visitors and to describe their role, and also provides them with access to a nursing home and its staff and residents to perform their function. Community visitors will be selected and trained on the basis of the sensitive and critical function they will be required to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> Under another initiative, advocacy services are to be established in each State and Territory. Advocates will be employed by appropriate organisations to speak on behalf of residents and uphold their rights and interests in grievance situations. The Bill therefore makes provision for advocates to have access to nursing homes and their residents to perform their function. A further proposed amendment of the Bill is to give the Minister authority to publish information on specific aspects of a nursing home or hostel. The purpose of publication is to assist residents, potential residents and their representatives to select a nursing home or hostel suited to their needs or wishes. The information itself will relate to the quality of life for residents and to details about the fac- ility's location, size, fees and method of operation. The information relating to residents' quality of life will be based on compliance with standards determined by the Minister. This information will assist intending residents to become aware of the quality and level of support available, will allow the many good nursing homes and hostels to promote their facilities, and serve as an incentive for the few low standard facilities to provide a better service. The legislation provides a time period for proprietors of facilities to comment on the information prior to its being published and it requires the Minister to change the information before it is published where such comments are considered warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> The publication of information about residential aged care facilities is a major step forward in promoting the residents' right to know about the facility they live in, the public's knowledge of the care provided for the older people in their community, and the high quality of care provided by most service providers. As I have shown, the residents' rights amendments go a long way towards enabling the frail aged in nursing homes and hostels to be protected and address the major concerns identified by the residents themselves, namely, those of isolation and boredom; lack of control over their own lives; absence of information about available services; and fear of retribution if a complaint is made. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to outline various amendments to other provisions relating to the residential aged care program. The Bill also makes the provision of a medical certificate optional rather than mandatory for the purposes of considering an application for nursing home admission. Currently, medical practitioners on geriatric assessment services with the delegation to approve nursing home admissions are required to provide the medical certificate required on the application form, as well as actually approve the application. The Bill will allow these delegates to make decisions on nursing home admissions even though no medical certificate is provided, thereby simplifying procedures for nursing home admission. However, where a certificate is provided, the Bill requires that it be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also allows backdating of approval of a domiciliary nursing care benefit (DNCB) application in certain circumstances. Currently, the date of effect of an approved DNCB application cannot be a date earlier than the date on which the application was received in the Department. A number of applications, for reasons beyond the direct control of otherwise eligible applicants, have been delayed before reaching the Department. These delays have disadvantaged some applicants and have occurred for a variety of reasons. For example, completed applications have been mislaid or delayed by medical practitioners or registered nurses, or completed applications have been lost in the mail. Previously, act of grace payments were made in some of these cases. The amendments in the Bill will allow for processing in these circumstances. It is intended that, prior to any decision to backdate an application, supporting statements from the doctor and the nurse will be required, indicating that they had completed the requisite certifications and advising the date or dates on which this occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the Minister to approve a person as an approved operator of a nursing home for the purposes of receiving Commonwealth payments under the National Health Act 1953. The Bill also provides for the Minister to revoke approvals. These powers are considered necessary by the Government because of the nature and vulnerability of aged persons. In addition, under residents' rights proposals in the Bill, residents will be entering into contracts with proprietors, who must be acceptable for the purpose of operating a nursing home. Further, the amending legislation will assist in removing underlying concerns about some care providers, particularly former proprietors who, having previously treated residents poorly and failed to meet the required care standards or engaged in fraudulent practices, are now seeking to return to the industry, for example by purchasing an existing approved nursing home. Present Commonwealth approval controls do not provide adequate cover in circumstances involving sale and purchase of nursing homes. The powers provided in this Bill will ensure that Commonwealth funding approvals are granted to persons who will properly meet the responsibility for the care and accommodation of an extremely vulnerable group of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the Minister, when approving a person as an approved nursing home operator or revoking such approval, to have regard to principles. These principles, which will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, will cover such matters as the character and reputation of the person; the ability, willingness and expertise of the person to provide adequate nursing home care and meet the special care needs of nursing home residents; the ability to effectively financially manage a nursing home; and the capacity and willingness of the person to comply with conditions of approval of a nursing home for Commonwealth funding. It is provided in the Bill that a person who is dissatisfied with a decision to refuse or revoke approval may seek a review of a decision through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill provides for existing proprietors of approved nursing homes and persons who have been granted approval-in-principle to construct a new nursing home or transfer nursing home beds, to become approved operators automatically under the legislation. Such approvals are, of course, subject to the revocation of approvals provisions if a person was found to be unsuitable to be a proprietor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Nursing Homes Assistance Act and the common form of agreement authorised by that Act permit proprietors of former deficit financed nursing homes to request the Minister to review the approved budget and operating deficit of a home for a period ending before 30 June 1987. The legislation requires the request in the first instance to be investigated by a nursing homes advisory committee. These committees are established in each State to assist the Minister's investigations by providing a detailed professional and independent review of departmental decisions where proprietors are unable to reach agreement with the Minister's delegate on the levels of approved budgets and deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has become concerned at the escalation in the number of requests for review received since 1 July 1987, the date from which the Government's aged care reforms were introduced. The industry has indicated that the increase in the number of requests is largely an orchestrated form of protest against aspects of the nursing home reforms. The National Health Act was amended last year to introduce lodgment and processing fees for requests by proprietors to review nursing home fee decisions. The provisions of this Bill remove the current inconsistency between the Nursing Homes Assistance Act and the National Health Act in this regard. The process of review is a thorough one involving the gathering and analysis of complex information. The length of time for each review varies but on average consumes almost 100 hours of Public Service time. In the past, the cost of a review, estimated at about $4,000, has been met entirely by taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a statutory obligation on the Minister to consider these requests for review. However, it is difficult to distinguish between protest or vexatious appeals and those which are genuine. It is in the interests of the taxpayer and nursing home proprietors with genuine grievances to free up the nursing homes review mechanisms by ensuring that only those cases which are genuine become the subject of review and that those appeals are expeditiously handled. There is a further need to prevent the situation from worsening by avoiding future protest or vexatious appeals against fee determinations. The Government considers that the introduction of a lodgment fee of $500, and an additional processing fee of $500 for each half-day a committee meets to consider an appeal, will achieve those objectives. Administration of these arrangements will be facilitated by fees being deducted from payments due to a nursing home proprietor under the common form of agreement or under the National Health Act 1953 on authorisation by the proprietor. To safeguard the position of genuine appellants both lodgment and processing fees will be refunded in full where a request for review is wholly or substantially successful. Provision is also made for the lodgment fee to be refunded in full to a proprietor who withdraws a request within 84 days following a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides some essentially administrative amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which are consequential to the National Health (Nursing Home Respite Care) Regulations. Taken together, these amendments remove the distinction between approvals for short term respite care admission and general nursing home admission. This distinction is no longer necessary since the gazettal of these regulations has removed the need for a separate type of approval for short term respite care. The amendments will tidy up the Act and will remove the possibility of confusion. All approvals for admission to a nursing home, including for short term respite care, now will be made under the same section of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983. The Government has been concerned that whilst Australian-born citizens are ineligible for the first homes owners scheme if they have previously owned a home in Australia, migrants and also Australian citizens who have owned a home overseas are treated more favourably as any previous overseas home ownership is disregarded. For obvious reasons, it is not practicable to attempt to test for previous ownership overseas. Further, there are difficulties in applying the scheme's income test equitably as between long term residents and those acquiring a home before they have been here for a full year. Clearly, those with sufficient means or prospects to be able to embark upon home ownership soon after arrival are in an already strong position and stand less in need of assistance from the taxpayer. Accordingly, the proposed amendment requires at least one person involved in each application for assistance under the Act to have had his or her principal place of residence in Australia during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the date of home acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment to that Act provides for a child under the age of 18 at the date of home acquisition, or a child born during the period commencing on that date and ending at the expiration of the first anniversary of that date, to be treated as a dependent child of an applicant for the purposes of the Act. Additionally, the child must be in the custody, care and control of, and ordinarily residing with an applicant for assistance under the Act at any time during the outlined period. The amendment will simplify administration of the Act as the existing references to the Social Security Act are to be deleted in favour of a test administered by the Department. The last proposed amendment will overcome anomalies in the existing legislation which result in disadvantage to certain persons who purchase their homes under a terms purchase contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes amendments to the definitions of proprietor of a laboratory in section 3 (1) and officer of the Health Insurance Commission in sections 3 (1), 23dk (3) and 129aac of the Health Insurance Act 1973. In 1987, new pathology arrangements were introduced to bring into effect a greater degree of accountability of persons providing pathology services by requiring that approved pathology authorities (APA) undertake to maintain certain standards. A failure to maintain those standards results in the possible revocation of the undertaking and the loss of eligibility for Medicare benefits for the services rendered in the APA's laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become apparent that the corporate structure of some providers of pathology services makes it difficult to identify the actual operator of the services. The new definition of proprietor of a laboratory in section 3 (1) of the Health Insurance Act will mean that Medicare benefits will not be payable in respect of services rendered in an accredited pathology laboratory unless there is at least one proprietor who has effective control over the staffing, equipment and the premises of the laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Health Insurance Act confers upon officers of the Health Insurance Commission a number of powers and duties in relation to the Medicare program. Legal opinion is that the definitions as they stand could be interpreted to mean the persons actually holding office under the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, that is, the members or commissioners and the general manager. This is plainly not the intention of the original provisions. The proposed amendment to section 3 (1) of the Health Insurance Act more clearly defines officer to specifically represent members of the staff of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 23dk (3) of the Health Insurance Act requires an approved pathology practitioner to produce to an officer of the Commissioner a written confirmation concerning a pathology service. It is not intended that all officers of the Commission should have this power, as would be conferred by the proposed amendment to section 3 (1), but to confine it to the general manager. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to section 129aac is intended to give added confidence to medical providers at formal counselling sessions by limiting the applicability of the section to officers of the Commission who are either medical practitioners, dental practitioners or optometrists. This Bill will also insert a new clause which will restrict entitlement to Medicare benefits to those diplomatic representatives, their staff and families of countries whose governments have an agreement with Australia under section 7 of the Health Insurance Act which specifically entitles diplomatic and consular staff and their families access to the health care system of the host country. This amendment removes the anomaly whereby in the current Act the inclusion of `eligible overseas representatives' in the definition of `eligible person' ensures that foreign diplomatic representatives and their staff are entitled to Medicare benefits while in Australia whereas Australia's diplomatic representatives in the other country concerned may not be entitled to reciprocal health care privileges. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to section 3h of the Health Insurance Act relate to administration of the vocational register of general practitioners. The amendments will require the exercise of ministerial power under that section by regulation, not determination. The changes are in accordance with the commitment made to the Senate on 30 August, and again in the subsequent debate on 7 September, to make this change to the legislation `at the earliest possible opportunity'. (Extension of time granted) The proposal is consistent with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance and will provide for greater parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also extends the benefits of a health care card, and thus pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional rate of $2.50, to those persons in receipt of a formal training allowance. This amendment simplifies the administration of the formal training allowance scheme and gives those persons the same entitlement as those receiving either unemployment benefits or a job search allowance. This provision is to apply retrospectively so as not to disadvantage persons receiving this allowance since its commencement in July last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Two clauses in this Bill provide for the linking of the relevant secrecy provisions of the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act. These amendments will improve the administration and effectiveness of both the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and Medicare, particularly in the area of overuse and abuse. Officers of the Health Insurance Commission will of course continue to be subject to the secrecy provisions of these Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also makes a technical amendment to the provisions of the National Health Act that relates to the special patient contribution arrangements under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. There are at present only two drugs subject to this provision, which allows for the payment of an additional charge by the patient when the drug's manufacturer disputes the price determined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. Under the present arrangements, if a prescription for any quantity other than the maximum quantity, or a multiple of this quantity, is written the patient has to pay a full special patient contribution. This amendment provides a simple formula for the calculation of a pro rata special patient contribution for any quantity of the drug prescribed by the doctor and thus provides a more equitable method for calculating the special patient contribution in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will correct an anomaly in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Under the National Health Act at present, when a prescription is written for a patient who is entitled to free or concessional pharmaceutical benefits the patient must establish to the satisfaction of the pharmacist supplying the drug that he or she is entitled to that benefit by recording the card number on the prescription. This information may of course be recorded by the patient or any other person, including the pharmacist, acting as an agent for the patient. Situations arise where persons fail to establish their eligibility status at the time of supply for a variety of reasons. Sometimes this failure arises not through oversight or carelessness on the part of the person or the agent. It could be caused by an error in the pharmacy or private hospital or because the person involved was admitted in an unconscious state or was suffering from an illness which impaired his or her abilities. It is thought that in these circumstances it would be unjust not to allow for such persons to be retrospectively accorded their correct status and expenses incurred would be correspondingly reduced as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> There is currently no provision in the National Health Act for such an adjustment to be made. This proposed amendment to the Act provides for such an adjustment on the following conditions:</PARA>
<PARA> That whether such an adjustment would be allowed would be at the discretion of the Secretary to the Department; and</PARA>
<PARA> That this discretion will be exercised only in relation to cases where the claimant can provide satisfactory evidence that he or she had paid for a pharmaceutical benefit at a level above that appropriate to his or her eligibility status and that this event occurred in circumstances beyond his or her control or that of the agent and was not due to their oversight or other avoidable circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA>The arrangements for residents' rights, consequential upon amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 and the National Health Act 1953, are expected to cost an estimated $0.89m in 1989-90, $1.58m in 1990-91 and $1.75m in 1991-92. Expenditures would be incurred in relation to honoraria payable to community visitors' costs relating to the preparation of statements on standards and funding for advocacy services. Consequent upon the amendment to subsection 58e (6) of the National Health Act 1953 there may be a small additional cost estimated at $10,000 in 1989-90 and $20,000 annually thereafter arising from domiciliary nursing care benefits being payable from a date earlier than the date of receipt of the application to eligible applicants whose applications have been lost or delayed through no fault of the applicants. These payments are no more than those to which the applicants are entitled under the eligibility criteria in the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequent upon the amendment to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974, the proposed lodgment fee of $500 and an additional processing fee of $500 per half day will yield revenue estimated at $45,000 in 1989-90, with anticipated revenue of $20,000 and $5,000 in 1990-91 and 1991-92 respectively. The fees are consistent with existing provisions in the National Health Act 1953 for requests for review of nursing home fees under that legislation and will have a deterrent effect on nursing home proprietors lodging non-genuine appeals. Proprietors who have their appeal wholly or substantially upheld will have their lodgment fee refunded and no processing fee will be applied. The main Commonwealth savings will be in avoiding non-quantifiable additional costs in processing non-genuine review applications. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983 to impose a 12-month residency requirement for recent arrivals before they can qualify for assistance is expected to result in savings of $2m in 1989-90 and $3m in each of the three subsequent financial years. The remaining amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983 have no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no financial impact consequent upon other amendments to the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973 or the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Act 1989. The amendments relating to pharmaceutical benefits will not result in any financial outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House. I now present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That this Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending 15 Acts administered within the transport and communications portfolio. The most significant amendments are to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 to put in place part of the shipping industry reform package announced by the Government on 1 June 1989. Other significant amendments are made to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 to provide for customs clearance of imported vehicles and to enable the determination of testing and record keeping practices for manufacturers or importers of vehicles. The other amendments are mainly of a minor policy nature or correct deficiencies or errors in current legislation. I will now deal with the amendments in detail. </PARA>
<PARA>Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 are to put in place the legislative elements of the Government's contribution to the shipping industry reform package announced on 1 June 1989. The amendments extend the availability of the fiscal benefits under the Act to 30 June 1997 for new ships and make grants payable for modifications to existing ships completed by 30 June 1992 which enable reductions in crew levels. The extension of the fiscal benefits to 1997 will provide Australian ship- owners with a stable fiscal environment in which to invest in new tonnage. Already 25 ships with Maritime Industry Development Committee-type crews have been introduced or ordered for the Australian fleet. This represents one-third of the fleet of major trading ships. The extension of the Act will encourage other shipowners or potential shipowners to invest in more modern tonnage, crewed at levels comparable with those applying on ships of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations using national crews. </PARA>

<PARA>Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act demonstrate the continuing commitment by the Government to maintaining that a high level of safety is met by all road vehicles supplied to the Australian market for the first time. The major amendment provides for a proper link between the Act and the Customs Act to ensure that vehicles are not allowed to enter Australia unless they meet the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act. It ensures that vehicles subject to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act will not be allowed to enter Australia without the specific approval of the Minister administering the Act. In addition, the amendments provide that determinations relating to the testing of motor vehicles be disallowable instruments, thus providing for proper parliamentary scrutiny. The Bill also contains a number of minor amendments that clarify certain provisions and facilitate administration of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Air Navigation Act 1920</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There have been some doubts expressed that the regulation making power of the Air Navigation Act does not extend to aviation security. These doubts arose following the enactment of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 which provides that the Civil Aviation Authority has responsibility for aviation safety but not for aviation security. Prior to the enactment of the Civil Aviation Act, aviation security was considered to fall within the term `aviation safety'. The amendment to the Air Navigation Act will remove the doubt that regulations relating to aviation security may be made under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Broadcasting Act</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to section 125d of the Broadcasting Act provides for the introduction of charges for the investigation of interference with the reception of radio and television programs. Under current legislation, the Minister for Transport and Communications has an obligation to investigate and make arrangements to correct interference to broadcasting services. This obligation is currently discharged as a free service by officers of the Department who investigate complaints of reception difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement was initially introduced because knowledge and understanding of interference effects were seen to have an important input to the service planning process. Because of technological development, the provision of broadcasting services is now much more scientific and predictable and the planning information obtained from investigations is negligible. Also, the service industry is now better educated in ways of overcoming reception problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in recent years, there has been a growing tendency for members of the public to rely on this free service. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the reception problems have been attributed to easily detectable factors such as: deficiencies in the receiving installation-for example, an inadequate antenna or television receiver-people trying to tune to stations where they are well outside the station's service area; or unintended radio frequency emissions from the local electricity authority's reticulation system. These complaints are investigated by departmental officers whereas they could, and should, be handled by complainants themselves, television repair services and electricity authorities. Because departmental officers are not in a position to fix these reception problems, this activity represents a waste of highly skilled technical resources. This unnecessary demand is not only diverting valuable technical resources away from other important spectrum management and broadcasting planning functions, but it is also inhibiting the Department's ability to provide timely assistance to people with cases of genuine interference. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed, through appropriate consumer education, to encourage the public to make their own assessment of any interference problem before calling on the Department for assistance. To assist people to understand what is involved and to know what action is appropriate, a comprehensive information booklet and questionnaire will be sent free to each complainant. Provision will be made for the public to submit, at no charge, the questionnaire without requesting an investigation of their own receiving equipment. By this means the Department will be able to detect and deal with genuine cases of interference, such as those affecting a local community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department will also provide an improved telephone advisory service to help residents deal with general queries and any difficulties that the local repair services or electricity authority cannot resolve. A call-out charge will apply only subject to guidelines and criteria developed by the Minister for Transport and Communications. Until the criteria are developed and approved, charges will not be applied. I wish to emphasise that it is not proposed to terminate the Department's interference investigation service. On the contrary, departmental officers will continue to investigate all cases of interference to radiocommunications services, as well as genuine interference problems involving broadcasting services. This initiative is in accordance with current Government policy to encourage a more efficient and effective public service and will result in a quicker and better service to all users of the radio frequency spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA>Interstate Road Transport Act 1985</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 in three respects. Firstly, to allow State and Territory regulatory authorities to link the prescribed fees that are payable to the consumer price index. These fees are payable to State or Territory regulatory authorities where they perform a registration function on behalf of the Common- wealth. Secondly, another amendment will strengthen the prosecution provision of the Act by ensuring that corporations, and their directors, agents and employees are subject to adequate sanctions where an offence is committed under the Act. Finally, further amendment will allow on-the-spot fines for mass limit-overloading-offences as an alternative to prosecution to reduce the administrative burden placed on the court system. </PARA>
<PARA>Navigation Act</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will make several amendments to the Navigation Act 1912. Two of the amendments implement changes agreed with the States and the Northern Territory on jurisdiction over maritime matters. The first will allow a trading ship under State-Territory jurisdiction to be brought under Federal jurisdiction should its owner wish it. This will be of particular value to the owner of a ship that operates a mixture of intrastate and interstate voyages-the ship will not have to move backwards and forwards between jurisdictions according to the particular voyage it is on. The procedure already works well with offshore industry support vessels. The second will implement revised, more flexible, arrangements on jurisdiction for enforcement of collision regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Marine Council is empowered to determine that the character or conduct of a person is such that the person is unsuitable for engagement as a seafarer. Such a determination is subject to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but as the Act currently stands, the lodgment of an appeal automatically defers operation of the determination. This automatic deferral is to be removed and deferral to be left in the hands of the Tribunal according to the facts of the individual case. The current provisions relating to courts of marine inquiry are to be replaced by a more modern and flexible system of casualty investigation. The Bill will provide for the necessary power for this to be done in the regulations. Finally, the various statutory committees provided for in the Navigation Act are to be rationalised by combining the various functions, such as that carried out by the crew accommodation committee, into the Marine Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill corrects a drafting deficiency relating to the discharge of garbage from ships in the vicinity of offshore platforms and will enable Australian ratification of Annex v of the International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecommunications and Postal Legislation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes minor amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1989 and miscellaneous telecommunications and postal legislation to correct drafting errors. The most significant of these amendments will ensure that the Overseas Telecommunications Corporation is able to continue to supply basic telecommunications services between external territories and other places within Australia. This amendment does not preclude Telecom Australia from continuing to supply these same services. Another amendment will extend an existing provision preventing the sale without notice of equipment for which there is no permit to the supply of such equipment otherwise than by sale, such as by lease. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Portfolio Legislation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes minor technical amendments to the Australian Airlines (Conversion to Public Company) Act 1988 and the Navigation Amendment Act 1980. All amendments are revenue-neutral except the amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. In relation to the amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942, the estimated cost of setting up a charging scheme for the investigation of interference to the reception of radio and television programs is $100,000. The estimated net savings in the financial year 1989-90 will be approximately $350,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the amendments to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987, the extension of the grants scheme to 1997 is expected to involve a net cost to revenue of $52m. Savings in the form of increased industry efficiency of $80m will accrue to industry over the three years from 1989 and annual savings of $50m are expected thereafter. The cost to revenue of the grants for modification is expected to be about $2.4m. The savings from the amendment to prevent excessive claims is estimated at $13m. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1989 amends the taxation laws in a number of respects. It contains the measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget for a new tax collection system for companies, complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposits funds and pooled superannuation trusts, in conjunction with a move to full self-assessment. The changes also apply to trustees of unit trusts that are taxed as companies. Other Budget announcements that the Bill deals with extend income tax deductions for fees paid to professional tax advisers and for deductions incurred by life assurance companies in gaining the investment component of certain premium income. Another Budget measure recognises the nature of certain share-based financing arrangements as loans rather than as equity investments for tax purposes. The Bill also proposes amendments on the subjects of superannuation tax, approved deposits funds, the gift provisions and the prescribed payment system. Minor amendments as a consequence of earlier changes to the Social Security Act, and of the reduction in the top marginal rate of personal income tax on 1 January 1990, are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Budget, detailed consideration has been given to the most appropriate arrangements for the new payment of tax by companies and superannuation funds. In this process, the Government has considered representations from many sources, and discussions have been held with professional bodies. In the light of these further deliberations, the details of the system that I will shortly describe differ in several respects from those outlined in the Budget Paper. These differences address concerns expressed about the original proposal. I turn now to the details. </PARA>
<PARA>Collection of Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The new system will first apply to assessments in respect of income of the year of income ending on 30 June 1990. An initial payment of tax is to be due by the fifteenth day of the first month after the end of the income year-generally 15 July-equal to 85 per cent of the notional tax amount; that is, broadly, the tax payable on income of the preceding year at the current year rate, or 85 per cent of the taxpayer's estimate of the actual tax liability. Payment of the balance of tax due for the relevant year is to be made by the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the end of that year-generally 15 March. For early balancing companies and funds, payments are to be due on equivalent dates after the end of the substituted accounting period, but no initial payment will be due earlier than 15 January following the end of an accounting period. There will be no liability to make an initial payment of tax where the notional tax or estimated total tax is less than $1,000. Companies and funds in this situation will pay their total tax liability by the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the end of the income year, or substituted accounting period of early balancers. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the deliberations I referred to, the Government has decided to extend these collection arrangements to non-complying superannuation and approved deposit funds and to modify them in two significant ways. Firstly, late balancing companies and funds will be placed on the same relative footing as all other entities that are subject to the measures. Specifically, the dates for their initial and final payments of tax will now be determined on the basis of their substituted accounting period, but in all cases final payment being required not later than 15 June of the year of payment. The second major change benefits companies and funds with a notional tax in the range of $1,000 to $20,000, or that have a notional tax of $20,000 or more but estimate their actual liability to be within that range. They will be given an option either to make two payments under the arrangements announced, or to pay their total liability on the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the year of income, or substituted accounting period. The gain to revenue from the new system of collecting tax is estimated at $880m in 1989-90 and $150m in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Self-Assessment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under self-assessment of income tax returns, which has operated since 1986, taxpayers lodge a return which is not generally subject to technical scrutiny and determine their taxable income. The Commissioner of Taxation calculates the tax payable and issues an assessment. The changes announced in the Budget merely take the present arrangements one step further for companies and funds under the new collection arrangements. These entities will calculate their own tax payable and pay this amount to the Commissioner, in an instalment, if applicable, and a balancing payment with their return of income. An assessment, which will retain all existing rights of objection or appeal, will be deemed to be made on the day the return is lodged. To facilitate this change, the Bill makes provision for the self-determination of foreign tax credits, and the offset of franking deficit tax against company tax liability. These are not significant changes to the existing self-assessment system, but they do present an opportunity for other major improvements, to which I now turn. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of Assessments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In debate over self-assessment, calls have been made for a review of the concept of `full and true disclosure' which exists in the present rules for amendment of assessments. The Government accepts that this concept has reduced relevance in the context of a system of self-assessment, and has decided to remove it from the amendment rules for all taxpayers. The Bill will give effect to this decision and will alter to four years in all cases the limitation period applying generally to amendments increasing a taxpayer's liability, other than in cases of fraud or evasion or other special provisions where the right to amend at any time is retained. The Commissioner will be able to seek an extension of this new four-year statutory limit from the Federal Court of Australia, or by agreement of the taxpayer. Consistent with this change, the period in which an amendment may be made to reduce a taxpayer's liability is to be increased from three to four years. </PARA>
<PARA>Keeping of Records</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In line with the changes to the time limits for amending assessments, records relating to tax information will be required to be kept for only five years, instead of the present seven years. This period will be extended where the period for amendment is extended by the Court or under agreement with the taxpayer. The rules for the keeping of records are also being modified to require companies and funds subject to the new collection and self-assessment arrangements to retain for subsequent review documents used to calculate their taxable income and tax payable that they do not have to provide in simplified returns. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Changes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Some related matters raised by the new system are under review. Of particular importance are reviews being undertaken by the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to the information currently required to be furnished with returns generally, the tax agents' lodgment program, and the operation of present arrangements for the remission of penalties. Under existing arrangements, a taxpayer in doubt about the proper tax treatment of a particular matter may request advice from the Commissioner. The Commissioner is also reviewing the question of providing an avenue-by means of the remission of interest payable where an assessment is amended-to encourage entities subject to the new self-assessment system to lodge these requests ahead of their returns, and will release further information on this matter as soon as possible. Some other issues which have been raised in the context of self-assessment are nearing settlement. Honourable members will be aware that the professional bodies have been working closely with the Commissioner on audit guidelines and an access to accountants' audit papers. The Commissioner expects these guidelines to be released soon. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Advice</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Hand in hand with these arrangements goes the Budget proposal to allow tax deductability for the management and administration of a taxpayer's income tax affairs, which also will be given effect in this Bill. Examples of expenditure that will be an allowable deduction are fees paid to a recognised professional tax adviser for income tax advice, costs of disputing an assessment such as tribunal fees and court costs, and costs associated with an audit of a taxpayer's affairs by the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Deductions will not be allowed for capital expenditure but depreciation of items, such as a computer, used in connection with the management or administration of a taxpayer's income tax affairs will be allowable. No deduction will be allowed for expenditure incurred in relation to an offence under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory or a foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA> A related amendment will permit taxpayers to have amounts paid for professional advice concerning the impact of taxes on the acquisition or disposal of an asset included in the cost base used to calculate the taxpayer's capital gain or loss on the asset. These changes will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1989 and the cost to revenue is estimated to be $40m per annum, commencing in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Life Assurance Companies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget life assurance companies are to be allowed a taxation deduction for expenditure incurred on or after 1 January 1990 in gaining the investment component of life insurance premium income. This measure will put life assurance companies on an equal footing with other investment mediums but it does not extend to friendly societies and other registered organisations which benefit from a lower tax rate. The revenue costs of this proposal are estimated at $30m in 1991-92 and $125m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA>Share-Based Financing Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Share-based financing arrangements entered into to obtain finance are more appropriately regarded as lending arrangements than as investments of share capital. It follows that dividends paid under such arrangements ought to be treated in an equivalent manner to payments of interest on loans. Consistent with that concept, and as announced in the Budget, the dividend imputation system is to be modified so that all dividends paid in respect of shares issued under share-based financing arrangements carry no entitlement to imputation credits or the intercorporate dividend rebate. This measure will apply to dividends paid on shares issued on or after 16 August 1989 or under finance arrangements entered into on or after that date, and will prevent losses of revenue the potential size of which cannot be quantified but could have become substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Exemptions for Approved Deposit Funds</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also gives effect to a measure, announced on 26 June 1989, to enable more people to take advantage of the special tax exemption given to qualifying fixed interest approved deposit funds under the May 1988 changes to the tax arrangements for superannuation. The amount of exempt income of a qualifying approved deposit fund is calculated by reference to balances that remain from time to time of amounts that were on deposit for eligible depositors at 25 May 1988. To assist people who may have withdrawn amounts from an approved deposit fund after 25 May 1988 before the special exemption was announced, the existing law treats withdrawn amounts that were redeposited in the same approved deposit fund before 1 July 1989 as though they were on deposit on 25 May 1988. An amendment in this Bill extends the 1 July 1989 deadline for redepositing such moneys to 1 September 1989. As details of people who took advantage of this extension are unavailable it is not possible to estimate the revenue effect of this measure. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxable Contributions to Superannuation Funds</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also correct a technical deficiency in the superannuation tax provisions. The amendment, announced on 16 October 1989, will ensure that fully funded complying superannuation funds cannot avoid tax on contributions by exploiting the tax exemption intended to cover cases where an employer does not fund benefits until retirement. Under the exemption, the fund is not assessed on the contributions and the benefits paid are treated as `untaxed' benefits and subject to a higher rate of tax. This aspect of the law was drawn to the Government's attention because of concerns at the potential effect on the superannuation industry. The intention of the law in this area has always been clear, and the amendment to the Bill is therefore to apply from the commencement of the new arrangement for superannuation funds on 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to the gift provisions of the income tax law is proposed by the Bill to allow gifts of the value of $2 or more made on or after 7 April 1989 to funds that provide money for the acquisition, construction or maintenance of hostels for school students from rural areas. The proposal is part of the Government's $637m education and training strategy for rural Australia announced in April by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). The revenue cost of the proposal is estimated to be less than $500,000 in a full financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Owner Builders</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will modify the prescribed payment system provisions of the law to ensure that a householder will not be treated as an owner-builder if the actual work on a major part of a domestic construction project is actually carried out by a builder or by others on his or her part. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Mr Sharp) adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to introduce this Bill, which will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and Australia and Thailand. The Bill will also provide legislative authority for the entry into force of protocols to amend Australia's existing comprehensive double taxation agreements with France and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> The Papua New Guinea and Thailand agreements, which were signed on 24 May 1989 and 31 August 1989 respectively, deal with all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and the other two countries. The agreements substantially accord with other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. The Government believes the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and these two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the agreements is that they each provide for tax sparing credit relief to be extended by Australia for `tax forgone' by Papua New Guinea and Thailand under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. Where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives, each agreement calls for the tax credit to be allowed by Australia to include the foreign tax forgone. By this means, the development incentives will retain their attractions for Australian investors and allow them to compete on favourable terms with investors from other countries as they will not be negated by the imposition of Australian tax. I note here that the agreements were negotiated on the basis of the existing income tax laws of the respective countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that aspects of proposed changes to Australia's general foreign tax credit system, which have been foreshadowed as applying from the beginning of the 1990-91 income year, could affect the practical operation of the tax credit provisions of the agreements, including the tax sparing mechanism. For example, proposed income tax exemptions under our domestic law for certain dividend payments and branch profits derived by Australian companies from comparable tax countries are likely to provide at least as great relief from Australian tax, and would operate in relation to such income from foreign countries including those with which tax treaties have been concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> The protocols to Australia's double taxation agreements with France and Singapore will amend these agreements in a number of respects in relation to the prevention of double taxation and the removal of possible avenues of tax avoidance. The protocols will generally update those agreements in line with Australia's more recently concluded comprehensive tax treaties. The French protocol, signed on 19 June 1989, will amend the agreement to provide that government service pensions will only be taxed by the country paying the pension, except where the recipient is a citizen or national of the other country. As announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when the protocol was signed, this measure will partially restore an arrangement previously applicable under the French agreement for retirement pensions derived before 1 July 1987. It will have effect in relation to government source pensions derived from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> Other pensions will continue to be taxable only in the country of residence of the recipient. As a related measure, the protocol allows contributions to a recognised pension fund in one country to qualify for a purchase price offset against pension income that is taxed in the other country. Of other measures of some significance, one will assist each country to apply its current domestic law provisions relating to international profit shifting arrangements and another will bring the definition of royalties more into line with Australia's income tax law and modern comprehensive taxation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Singapore protocol was signed on 16 October 1989. It will operate to delete a provision of the existing agreement with Singapore under which Australia is required to provide a rebate of tax for dividends paid to a resident Australian company by a Singapore company in which the Australian company has at least a 10 per cent interest. That provision is incompatible with Australia's general income tax law now that the intercorporate dividend rebate in relation to foreign dividends derived by an Australian company has been withdrawn. The deletion of that provision will be effective in respect of dividends paid after 11 March 1988, being the date of an announcement by the Treasurer which foreshadowed this change. </PARA>
<PARA> Another measure gives tax sparing relief for income which Singapore exempts, or taxes at a reduced rate, under special incentive measures to promote economic development in Singapore. An exchange of notes which took place at the time the protocol was signed will extend to 30 June 1987 the operation of earlier tax sparing provisions in the agreement with Singapore, after which the amendments contained in the protocol will bring new tax sparing arrangements into operation in relation to certain designated development incentives currently provided by Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments to be made by the protocol will modify the existing agreement in relation to taxing rights over royalties, business profits, dealings between associated enterprises, airline and shipping profits, and income or gains from property. Each of the agreements and protocols will enter into force when all necessary constitutional processes are completed both by Australia and the other contracting countries. The enactment of this Bill will complete the processes required of Australia. The agreements and protocols will help facilitate trading relationships with the other countries but it is not possible to predict the eventual effect on the revenue. I table the explanatory memorandum on the Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>As foreshadowed in the Budget, this Bill is to establish the Industry Commission. The Bill sets out the scope of the Commission, its functions and policy guidelines, the constraints on government changes to industry assistance without a Commission report, and composition and procedures. It also proposes repeal and transition provisions with respect to the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973 and the Inter-State Commission Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> On Budget night, the Government announced that the Industries Assistance Commission is to be restructured and renamed the Industry Commission, which will become the Government's major review and inquiry body in industry matters. Since that time, the Government has attached a high priority to the introduction of legislation enabling the establishment of the Industry Commission. That priority has reflected the Government's assessment of the need to continue the process of structural reform in this nation. The Industry Commission will be central to that. Through its advice to the Government, the Industry Commission will play a key role in helping industry to become more efficient, more productive and more internationally competitive. And that is central to ensuring better growth prospects and better economic conditions in this nation over the years and decades ahead. Promoting efficiency is about promoting a better economic environment where growth and employment can be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming to office, this Government has undertaken structural reform over a wide area of industry and business activity. Too quickly, people forget the fundamental nature of the financial market deregulation-including the freeing-up of capital movements and the floating of the exchange rate-that has fully brought Australia into the international economy. As a result, Australian industry has been forced to face squarely the imperatives of doing business in an international environment-and it is only in that environment that Australia will be able to provide the basis for sustained and rising living standards. Structural reform has also been embodied in the fundamental reviews of taxation announced in 1985 and since. We have moved to a situation where Australia has a fairer and more efficient taxation system. That has been conducive to creation of a healthier business environment where firms and individuals are rewarded more for enterprise and hard work and less for their ability to secure unfair advantages through a distorted tax regime. Equally, the Government has instituted major programs of reductions in tariff and other assistance to industries. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in May 1988, tariff protection is being progressively reduced, bringing Australia more into line with the sort of competitive pressures that our trading partners face. More recently, the Government has begun a process of major reform on the waterfront. This will be, of course, a progressive process, building on the understanding already achieved, and which will continue to draw on the commitment and patience of all relevant parties. In stark contrast, our predecessors were too apt to put the problem in the too hard basket. The reforms of the waterfront and coastal shipping will provide a sound basis for achieving greater efficiencies in the movement and distribution of our goods. Employment prospects at large will be enhanced as the benefits of that greater efficiency flow through the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the Government has not shied away from the fundamental reforms required in the labour market. Together with the trade union movement and employers, the Government is working towards the development of a system that will promote greater productivity and modernisation of labour and management practices. That reform has gone hand in hand with seeking moderation in wages growth consistent with the requirements of the macro-economic situation. Substantial employment growth in the economy has already been achieved. These labour reforms offer the prospect of generating still more jobs and, through more productive and competitive industries, creating greater job security in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> All these reforms are bringing and will continue to bring real benefits to the Australian economy. They have also been part and parcel of a more sophisticated appreciation in Australia of the economic realities facing this nation. Those realities include the need to be more competitive and the need to be more hard-nosed about the use of Government resources. That debate is to be warmly welcomed-and the establishment of the Industry Commission and the transfer of the functions of the Inter-State Commission to that body will allow the Commonwealth to continue to play its major role in the development of sound industry policy in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The formation of the Industry Commission represents a new phase in the Government's ongoing strategy of structural adjustment. It is evidence of the Government's commitment to respond to the more sophisticated debate throughout the community on industry development and of the consequent greater requirements for information on policies of industry assistance and development. The Industry Commission will be better placed to participate fully in these developments and we must not waste any time in facilitating that process. </PARA>
<PARA> In that regard, the Industry Commission will further the important role that the Industries Assistance Commission has played in the structural adjustment process in Australia. It will build on the Industries Assistance Commission's earlier work which was instrumental in awakening the community to the costs of many industry assistance policies. As an institution, the Industries Assistance Commission has been an important force in economic policy in Australia, building community awareness of the need for Australian industry to be outward looking and internationally competitive. But the Industry Commission will have a broader charter and, with new guidelines attuned to the challenge ahead, will be an important stimulus for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> By providing independent and expert advice to the Government and through its public inquiry processes, the Industry Commission will facilitate the ongoing structural change that is needed in the economy. The Industry Commission will work to involve a wide range of groups in its inquiries as part of the process of building community awareness. Consistent with that broader charter, all references on transport matters will in the future be sent to the Industry Commission rather than to the Inter-State Commission. The staff and functions of the Inter-State Commission will be absorbed by the Industry Commission. This is particularly timely. We are all fully aware of the need to continue to address vigorously the transport issues confronting Australia. They go right to the heart of the question of how we in Australia can move our goods across vast distances at the lowest cost with due regard to the broader needs of safety and possible alternative uses of existing transport systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission has been at the forefront of inquiry and analysis of transport issues. It has been a dispassionate, objective and expert source of analysis in this area and has established a high quality network on transport issues which can be integrated into the Industry Commission. That expertise and experience must be fully brought to bear in the broader charter of the Industry Commission. In this enlarged body, the resources of the Inter-State Commission will have a key role in the identification and analysis of the interrelationships between all sectors of the economy and the transport sector. The ISC's expertise needs to be brought out in the wider economic perspective provided by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, sound policy development should be based on a full appreciation of the facts. For instance, we should be aware of the extent to which subsidising railways for passenger operation is a cost to the Australian community; and we should be aware of the need to build on the recent reforms in coastal shipping and the need to improve rail freight operations in order to ease the burdens on our roads. All these aspects are interlinked. And that is the essence of what the Industry Commission is about: namely, the identification of economic interrelationships and the specification of the costs and benefits involved in these relationships. It is only with this sort of information that the Commonwealth government-and, indeed, the State governments-can make sensible and considered choices as to future policy, choices that will ensure better and more sustained growth prospects for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to establish an Office of Business Regulation as an administrative unit within the Industry Commission to absorb the functions of the Business Regulation Review Unit. That Office will have a very important role. It will be dealing with matters that go to the heart of productivity in this economy. Inordinate and unnecessary regulation has a cost-just like any other barrier to efficient operation of business-and that cost is ultimately borne by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Impediments to efficient operation of business and industry through regulation require as much attention as impediments flowing from other forms of industry regulation and assistance. It is therefore fully consistent with the charter of the Industry Commission that the functions of the Business Regulation Review Unit should be absorbed into this body. It will, apart from anything else, allow the Business Regulation Review Unit to gain the benefit of the economy-wide perspective that will flow from the broader operations of the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of this, the Government sees the establishment of the Industry Commission as providing an opportunity for a renewed and reinvigorated role for the States in the consideration of industry assistance matters in this nation. The States, of course, have responsibilities in many sectors of the economy-in intrastate transport, port authorities and electricity generation-which can impact significantly on the efficiency and competitiveness of industry. The Government will therefore be looking to cooperate closely with the States in the future on structural reform of the government sector in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Government would welcome the States' positive and full participation in the Industry Commission's process of public inquiries. With that in mind, the Commonwealth will be approaching the States for their assistance in drafting the terms of reference for three inquiries that cover matters relating to State government responsibilities. As announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) earlier this month, those matters relate to railways, the operation of statutory marketing arrangements and the generation and distribution of power. We will be inviting the States' full participation in these and all other relevant inquiries. We trust that the States will grasp the opportunity in using the Industry Commission as a source of analysis and information on matters relating to the Australian economy in general-not just those matters falling within the purview of the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This then is the context. I turn now to the key features of the Bill. It should be noted that the Bill draws largely on the provisions of the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973, but also draws on appropriate provisions of the Inter-State Commission Act 1975. Except for an aspect of the repeal of the ISC Act, the Bill proposes that the commencement date of the Act would be by proclamation, or six months from royal assent, whichever is the sooner. </PARA>
<PARA> The definitions clauses include a broad definition of industry, which is intended to reflect the broadened charter for the Commission and the widest possible scope for its inquiries relating to industry. Definitions also include `subject of Commonwealth power' which follows the provisions of the Constitution. This is relevant to the scope of matters on which the Commission can require evidence and information relevant to an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal functions of the Commission are to hold inquiries and make reports on industry matters referred to it by the Minister. Bearing in mind that the Commission is to contribute to the process of structural change as described generally in policy guidelines for the Commission, the Commission's functions also allow it to do anything incidental to its functions. The Government intends that, as part of analysis and advice on micro-economic reform issues, the Commission will give advice on business regulation, and prepare occasional research and information papers that contribute to enhancing community understanding of issues relating to structural reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill sets out general policy guidelines to which the Commission must have regard in the performance of its functions. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> to encourage the development and growth of Australian industries that are efficient in their use of resources, self-reliant, enterprising, innovative and internationally competitive;</PARA>
<PARA> to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes;</PARA>
<PARA> to reduce regulation of industry, including regulation by the States and Territories, where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government; and</PARA>
<PARA> to recognise the interests of industries, consumers, and of the community likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission must also have regard to any other matters notified by the Minister. For example, as in recent inquiries sent to the IAC, the Commission may be asked to have regard to the Government's environmental objectives in relevant inquiries. Reports resulting from an inquiry process will be required to be tabled by the Minister within 25 sitting days after receipt. There is a provision for delay recommended by the Commission; for example, where the Commission is made aware of governmental trade negotiations that might be disturbed by the timing of publication of a report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains provisions similar to those in the current IAC Act which constrain a Commonwealth Minister from taking certain prescribed actions unless a report by the Commission has been received within the previous 12 months. Allowance is made for a delay in the receipt of a Commission report. Prescribed matters follow those in the IAC Act 1973 and concern changes in import duties and restrictions, and changes in financial assistance to an industry for more than two years. Financial assistance and an industry are defined. Exemptions to prescribed matters are also set out. Principally these include:</PARA>
<PARA> payments to Commonwealth corporations;</PARA>
<PARA> the imposition, increase or reduction of a tax (other than customs duty);</PARA>
<PARA> changes in customs duties that are only made to match corresponding changes in excise duties;</PARA>
<PARA> maintaining the level of customs duty previously applying where a decision by a tribunal or court on a tariff classification has had the effect of altering the duty;</PARA>
<PARA> the making of a commercial tariff concessional order or a by-law under the Customs Act 1901; and</PARA>
<PARA> action concerning international trade agreements and developing country tariff preferences. </PARA>
<PARA>The conduct of inquiries into matters referred to the Commission by the Government is intended to provide, as in the Industries Assistance Commission Act, for the fullest possible participation by all interested parties. The Commission is given wide discretion into how inquiries are to be conducted, and will not be overly bound by formal legal procedure, although there are appropriately strong protections and penalties for breaches with respect to a range of inquiry procedures. The Commission will widely publicise the existence and the nature of inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not consider it necessary to restrict the flexibility of the Commission by overly prescribing the Commission's procedures. There are therefore no standing provisions requiring draft reports to be prepared pursuant to inquiries, or for the Commission to present a range of options in making recommendations to government. These procedures may be left to the discretion of the Commission, it being understood that, as is the case with the IAC, the Commission will usually produce a draft report pursuant to an inquiry, thereby facilitating community debate, and will usually present a range of options in its recommendations to the Government. The Minister, in referring a matter to the Commission, will be able to require the publication of a draft report or the development of options in any particular case. In order to make clear the Government's intention in respect of these matters, the Government has decided it is worthwhile to bring forward an amendment to the Bill during the course of its consideration to provide explicitly for possible requirement of a draft report and options in recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will have powers to obtain relevant information and documents for the purposes of an inquiry and the power to hold hearings, which will be held in public unless confidential material is involved. The Commission will also have power to summon persons to attend hearings and to answer questions or produce documents. The Bill provides that the Commission is not to be given false or misleading evidence or information, and is not to be taken in contempt. In order to contribute to widest possible community debate and understanding of the issues of an inquiry, the Bill provides for documents, statements and submissions received in the course of an inquiry to be made public. Nonetheless, there are provisions for information to be held as confidential where a person objects and the Commission considers the evidence should be protected. The Bill maintains the protection of witnesses to an inquiry, and people making submissions to an inquiry, that are in the IAC Act. In particular, the Bill provides for penalties on persons who prejudice another person's employment because of their participation in an inquiry process. The Bill specifies that the exercise of the Commission's powers for the purposes of an inquiry, for example to obtain information and documents from any person, including a State, is limited to the extent that the subject matter relates to a subject of Commonwealth power. The definition of `subject of Commonwealth power' is given in terms of constitutional provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the IAC, the Commission will have a chairperson and from four to eight full time commissioners, these being statutory appointments by the Governor-General for up to five years. To supplement the Commission's resources and expertise from time to time, there is provision for the appointment of associate commissioners by the Minister. There is a range of procedural provisions concerning commissioners, which follow those of the IAC Act and other Acts providing for statutory appointments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a separate part dealing with repeals and transitional arrangements. The Bill provides for the IAC Act 1973 to be repealed. It also provides for the repeal at the same time of all but specified sections of the ISC Act, which remain as long as there is a holder of the office of Commissioner of the ISC. The Bill makes separate provision for the repeal by separate procla- mation of those remaining parts of the ISC Act relating to commissioners should there no longer be a holder of that office. These repeal provisions are based on advice of the Solicitor-General in order to be consistent with provisions in the Constitution relating to the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for moneys and staff of the IAC and ISC to be transferred to the Commission. Similarly, current inquiries by the IAC are to be transferred and completed by the Commission. There are provisions protecting the terms and conditions of appointment of ISC and IAC commissioners who become commissioners of the new body. Transitional provisions protecting prior records and witnesses are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, miscellaneous provisions of the Bill include a requirement that the Commission prepares an annual report which is to be tabled within 15 sitting days of its receipt. The annual report is to address the economic performance of industry and the effects of assistance and regulation on industry and on the economy generally. The Government sees this report as an important component of the Commission's role in increasing community understanding of issues concerning structural change. Indeed a key contribution to the transparency of industry policy is to be made by the publication and tabling in Parliament of annual reports of the Commission. With a broader charter, the Commission's annual report will continue and expand the benefits that have flowed from the IAC's annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier today, the IAC's annual report was tabled. That report ranges widely in its discussion of the benefits of micro-economic reform. It puts forward robust views and analysis of current industry policy issues, including a critique of strategic trade theories. It provides a stocktake of sectoral assistance measures. There have been times when sectional interests, and even governments, have been uncomfortable with the perspective the IAC has brought to structural reform. No doubt this will also be the case with the most recent annual report. It will no doubt continue to be the case with the Industry Commission's annual reports-and it will continue to be an inescapable part of promoting transparency, vigorous community debate and broader understanding of industry issues. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, the establishment of the Industry Commission represents the Government's continued commitment to that transparency and full community debate in the development of policies relating to industry. The Commission is intended to make a major contribution to further structural reform in Australia. It will be a catalyst for productivity and efficiency gains, and thereby lay the groundwork for income and employment growth and security. It will build on, and broaden, the strengths of the IAC and the ISC which it succeeds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's economy-wide perspective, its broad charter and public inquiry process will play a key role in promoting policies at both government and business levels to improve the competitiveness and dynamism of Australian industry. This Bill provides for an effective and broad ranging institution to serve the needs of parliament, the people and government. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Stage 2 Development, including new Submarine School, HMAS Stirling, Garden Island, Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>HMAS Stirling is located on Garden Island in Cockburn Sound, about 60 kilometres by road south of Perth. The original development of HMAS Stirling was largely completed in 1978 and the base currently has seven surface ships and one submarine home ported there. It is also a site of the submarine escape training facility, which is one of the most advanced facilities of its type in the world. As part of the Government's commitment to update Australia's defence capability through the establishment of the two-ocean navy concept endorsed in the 1987 defence White Paper, a staged build-up of the facilities at HMAS Stirling is necessary. Two stages of development, between 1989 and the year 2000, are proposed to enhance progressively and expand the operational and support capabilities of the base to provide eventually for about half the Royal Australian Navy's major fleet units being home ported or based at Stirling. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal now before the House is for the stage 2 works covering the base development from 1989 to 1996. The role of HMAS Stirling is to provide maintenance, supply and operational support for ships, as well as port berthing and shipside services. The proposed stage 2 facilities will enhance these services and allow the home porting of additional ships and submarines. This stage 2 proposal consists of over 30 individual projects. These range from additional accommodation and recreational facilities to new workshops' and technical service facilities and wharf facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in this proposal is a new submarine school which is required as part of the new submarine project. The school is to be built to train qualified submarine personnel to operate and maintain the fleet of new type 471 submarines. There is insufficient space in the existing Oberon class training school at Sydney's HMAS Platypus and there are operational and training advantages in having the training school near the submarine west coast home port at Stirling. The new submarine school will provide classrooms, simulators and demonstration equipment for 40 staff and from 50 to 120 students undertaking specialist training for up to six months prior to posting to a submarine. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of these proposed stage 2 works, including the new submarine school, is $135.6m at April 1989 prices, which updates to $138.4 at September 1989 prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with the proposed base expansion further housing will be required. The Defence Housing Authority currently provides 571 houses for naval personnel within the community adjacent to the Stirling base. Expansion of the base will require a further 272 houses by 1994 with another 222 being required by the year 2000. Present strategy of the Defence Housing Authority proposes to meet this need through a mixture of project home construction and spot purchase on the local market. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that Navy families be integrated to the greatest extent possible within the community at large. The Committee, in its report, has noted the concern expressed by the National Consultative Group of Service Spouses as to provision of community facilities and housing and the Committee suggests that the group be briefed on those issues as soon as possible. This is being arranged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have told the honourable member that 272 houses will be acquired close to Stirling to provide housing and facilities for people who will work at this base in future and it is for that reason that the Defence Housing Authority is in existence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The project has received clearance under the Environment Protection Act 1974. The Committee, in its report, however, has expressed the belief that, contrary to what occurred on this project, environmental clearance should be completed prior to referral of the project for examination by the Committee. On most projects submitted to the Committee by the Department, the required environmental clearance is obtained prior to referral. There can be occasions when the environmental review process becomes extended and would cause delay to a project if referral were deferred. If that should occur in the future, the matter will be discussed with the Public Works Committee prior to any referral action. I have ordered that that take place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that tenders will be called for some components of the stage 2 development immediately following parliamentary approval to proceed. The bulk of the works will be constructed in separate contract packages, with completion of the works due by 1996. Construction of the project will provide full time employment for approximately 120 construction personnel on site plus substantial opportunities for local contracts and material suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased housing that will be required for Navy families, which was just discussed at some length, will provide further economic stimulation within the adjacent suburban communities. As I said earlier, the planned stage 3 development will provide additional facilities to meet the further progressive increase in basing and operations at Stirling between 1996 and the year 2000. I thank the Public Works Committee for its support of this major defence proposal, and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to return to the position that I occupied in 1985 when I responded to the then Minister for Housing and Construction, the present Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), on various motions that came before the House. I appreciate very much the progress that the Minister has made since 1985. I remind him that, in 1985 when I spoke to these motions, I said, first of all, that the private sector should be involved in the design of these various projects. At that time the Minister said that there was no way in the world that he would ever see the private sector involved in the design of those facilities. By the end of 1985 and the early part of 1986, the Minister had come around to that. Then I said to the Minister that he really ought to consider the private sector becoming involved in the construction of those various facilities. He started out by saying that there was no way in the world that he would see the private sector involved in the construction of those works. He came around to that, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I tried to talk to the Minister about contracting out. To start with, the Minister would have nothing to do with contracting out. Recently in this House, the Minister was proudly proclaiming the progress that he had made on the contracting out of government operations. He even has his foot in the door now on privatisation, to which he and his faction are implacably opposed--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OE4">Mr BEALE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am on the point of saying that the Government, slowly but surely, is adopting the policies that the Opposition has been proposing since 1985. I am right back on the point. In fact, the Minister is now saying that there is even some chance that he would go along with some marginal degree of privatisation. He has already agreed to that inside the Cabinet. The Minister knows about Cabinet solidarity, but I am not sure that his colleague at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), has entirely got the message yet. The Minister has certainly gone along with the partial privatisation of the Australian Industry Development Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is nice to be back in this position. I hope that it is not too long before our positions at the table are reversed so that I can remind the Minister of the way in which the Opposition has brought him along and remind him of the Opposition's ability to ensure that the direction of policy in this country is dictated by the coalition--</PARA>
<PARA> Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J. D. M. Dobie) Order! I call the honourable member for Deakin to order. Perhaps he might care to get back to the matter before the House. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OE4">Mr BEALE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to respond to the motion by saying that the coalition does not oppose it. We recognise that the Australian Defence Force should have a credible capability on both sides of our continent, that is, both in the Pacific Ocean and in the Indian Ocean. The move that the Minister has foreshadowed to HMAS Stirling needs to be understood in the broader context of Australian defence policy and the chosen method of military strategy. The Opposition acknowledges also that is is an important part of the role of the Defence Force and that it will be necessary to integrate what is happening in Western Australia with what is happening with total Australian Defence Force capabilities for the defence of Australia and its security interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) unveiled the coalition's defence policy. Another reason that we support the Minister's proposal is that it is entirely consistent with the coalition's defence policy. We have some problems with what the Government is proposing on defence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I point out to you and to the Minister that the Opposition, in not opposing the motion, does so in the context of our reservations about what the Labor Government is doing about Australia's defence, in that the motion is insufficiently related to other arms of policy, particularly foreign affairs, trade and economic policy, which affect significantly our regional relationships. The Government is too complacent about the time scale within which threats could develop, and there is too much emphasis on reaction rather than deterrence. The motion fails to define Australia's role in maintaining peace and stability in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although not opposing the motion, I point out that it is inconsistent with major initiatives in the coalition's defence policy, which was launched by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar today. Firstly, it proposes a new framework for the development and implementation of a national security strategy; secondly, there is a shift in defence strategy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In talking to the motion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am saying that the motion is consistent with our policy, which includes a shift in defence strategy and force structure, to enable a more rapid and flexible response to events occurring at short notice within Australia's territorial boundaries or beyond. That is part of the rationale for having Defence Force capabilities on both sides of the continent. The motion relates, thirdly, to reform of the organisational structure and management processes of the defence organisation; fourthly, to stability in defence funding with maintenance of existing levels of funding in real terms; and, finally, to maintenance of extensive industry participation in defence supply and servicing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In closing, I say that the Minister, in referring to consultation with representatives of the defence forces and their families, has completely missed the point in terms of the complete anger and irritation that they feel towards the Government. The Government has concentrated on projects, not people; and on hardware, not the software associated with our Defence Force personnel. I believe that one factor that will lead to the defeat of the Government in the next election is its inability to relate to our Defence Force personnel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving the motion, I remind the Committee-because of the arrangement with the Opposition, I will need to be brief-that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill have been returned from the Senate. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) will address the Bills on behalf of the Opposition, in the absence of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), with whom I discussed the Bills prior to his leaving this place for other duties. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank a number of people. I remind the House that it is nearly two years to the day since the legislation was first talked about in this place. I should like to place on the record my thanks to my departmental officers, some of whom are present in the chamber, from the portfolio and from the task force, who have worked tirelessly throughout that two years to bring about this legislation, which will change the shape of administration of Aboriginal affairs in this nation. It will fit in with wishes and desires of Aboriginal and Islander people as expressed in numerous reports over many years. As I said in December 1987, we wanted to get the legislation right. My door has always been open to people who had suggestions to improve the legislation, and the Senate has done just that through a committee review and a series of amendments to which the Government will agree. </PARA>
<PARA> We will accept the amendments that have been received from the Senate, but I express publicly my disappointment with one or two amendments-in particular, the amendment in relation to the preamble. History will show that the amendment is wrong and we are making a mistake, or missing an opportunity, but, given the situation in the Senate and the ability for that chamber to frustrate this House, the Government will accept the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I wish to say that yesterday we had a debate about people who are not able to defend themselves within the system. Much to-do was made about the rights of individuals who are not able to defend themselves in the chamber when a member of parliament attacks them. The same applies in the Senate. During the debate yesterday my mind floated back over the past two years to the large number of Aboriginal and Islander people who have been attacked under privilege over and over again. When we pick on people-whether they be Aboriginal, Islander, non-Aboriginal or non-Islander-I always remember the point made yesterday when I am on the side of the people who are being attacked. Yesterday no-one spared a single thought for the outrageous and wrongful accusations that have been made against people in the past two years. I do not want to prolong the debate, because I have made the point in earlier debates but it is worth making again. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will be funded properly by the Government, and if it is funded in the future it will bring about the sorts of changes that Aboriginal people have been seeking from the Government for many years. I commend the amendments from the Senate and commend the legislation to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a few brief comments because we are really debating an issue in its last stages. Some people could say that it is the end of a saga of Australian legislative history because the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) Bill is the second most amended piece of legislation in this Parliament since Federation, and there has been extensive debate about it. In fact, it is the most amended piece of legislation by an opposition in the Parliament's history; so it is a significant piece of legislation. I do not believe that the saga of ATSIC is over by any means. It is unfortunate that we have not been able to come to an agreement as a parliament with regard to the re-organisation and administration of Aboriginal affairs. That is a great pity. It would have been great if there could have been a bipartisan approach to the administration in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to comment on the issues mentioned by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) just now. He commented that many people have been maligned in the debate over the last couple of years. The intention of the Opposition-this was very strictly the case as far as I was concerned-in its attack in the Parliament on the administration of Aboriginal Affairs was always directed to the administration by the Government and not to individual Aboriginal people. Our concern is that the moneys allocated to Aboriginal affairs should reach the people at the grassroots. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I will comment about the fact that the Minister pointed out a minute ago that the ATSIC Bill is concerned with giving management to the Aboriginal people and that it is within their desires and wishes. These were the words he used. If one looks back over this period one finds that the head of the Aboriginal Development Commission really left because of this debate over the ATSIC Bill; she disagreed with it. The head of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs for most of this period, Charlie Perkins, disagreed with this legislation. Another eminent person, Neville Bonner, also disagreed with it. There is still a large amount of controversy about it, and I believe that it would be wise for the Government not to rush into getting this legislation administratively in place prior to the next Federal election because there is a clear possibility that we will be in government. It is also clear that our intention with regard to the administration of Aboriginal affairs is markedly different from what this legislation proposes. </PARA>
<PARA> We have argued our case against this legislation long and hard, rationally, clearly and extensively. We have put forward our reasons opposing it and we have proposed a large number of amendments. The Bill has, in effect, just fallen over the line as legislation. We are entering into uncharted waters with this legislation, and it bears all the seeds of its own destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make some final remarks about the people who have assisted on our side of the Parliament. If long and hard work has been required of the Government and its officers, it has certainly been a mammoth task for the Opposition with its lack of resources compared with the Government's resources. I particularly thank the senators who have been involved in coordinating debate on the legislation, particularly when I was the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, and the other backbenchers on our side of the Parliament and their staff for their extensive work in examining this legislation and putting together the amendments. In particular, I would like to thank a member of my staff, Stephen Wade, for his extensive work on this Bill and, of course, the shadow Minister and his staff. In the Senate, Senator Peter Baume carried the burden of this legislation and the extensive number of amendments on our behalf. It has been a team effort for the Opposition in the House of Representatives and the Senate. I believe this legislation is much better because of the 91 amendments that have gone into it, largely due to the extensive work of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say one thing in relation to the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) in terms of what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) said about the use of privilege in the Senate. I remind the honourable member that yesterday, during a debate, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) made a number of statements, one of which was to accuse the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of attacking the man. He said, `He nailed the character of a citizen outside this place with no right to answer'. That is exactly the process that the Opposition parties adopted in the Senate. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that during meetings which the Opposition parties might have he address the issue of the abuse of privilege by certain senators in the other place. I will leave it at that because what has been said is on the record, including the Minister's statements. Those people have been maligned in a way which was totally unnecessary. One or two people in the other place continue to malign those people, undermine their characters and besmirch their personalities, and I do not think it is appropriate for any parliamentarian to abuse privilege in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that this Bill has been finally passed is a tribute to the dedication and commitment of the Minister. I suggest that some years hence when the history books are written they will see this piece of legislation as landmark legislation. I concur with the statements made by the Minister in relation to the preamble. We have lost an opportunity which ought not to have been lost. Unfortunately, that view was not accepted by the Opposition parties or the Australian Democrats in the Senate. This legislation is the poorer for its preamble being dropped. I suggest to honourable members in the House that they read the preamble and see what benefit it would have given the legislation had it been included. </PARA>
<PARA> I am in no doubt-speaking as a person who has worked with Aboriginal people for many years and whose electorate comprises a large number of Aboriginal people-that in relation to the comments made by the honourable member opposite in terms of the way in which the Opposition would seek to administer Aboriginal affairs if it were in government, it need not worry. While Aboriginal people have a vote they will never vote by a majority for the Opposition parties. The Opposition has made very plain indeed what it would choose to do in the area of Aboriginal affairs. Not only would it abolish, or try to get rid of, this legislation but also it would attempt to white ant the processes of Aboriginal self-determination and self-management. I commend this legislation again and pay a huge compliment to the Minister, his staff and his Department. </PARA>

The years will pass and this will be seen as the turning point when Australia moved from a position of, firstly, contempt and ridicule of Aboriginal Australians; secondly, to a position of paternalism; and now to a period in which Aboriginal Australians are entitled to self-management, self-respect and self-determination. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has seen this Bill through this House under difficult circumstances, when members of this Parliament have seen fit to denigrate him personally and also those for whom this Bill is seeking to provide a framework for self-management and future development.

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, these amendments were referred to us by the Senate. In order to assist the managers of this chamber, I wish to address only one or two points that were made in the course of the debate here. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who is representing the shadow spokesperson, again drew upon certain individuals. Without going into the names of the people he referred to, which I have resisted doing for nearly two years now, I say this: he is probably totally wrong in the comments he attributed to those persons as to the reasons they left their positions. I suggest to the honourable member that he read the 1987-88 annual report of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, in particular the comments of the then Secretary in regard to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which report was signed on 3 November 1988. I say no more than that. I ask the honourable member to look at his written word. It does him no credit at all to come in here and again make cheap points at the expense of this person in the belief that it will affect my position. I draw the attention of the honourable member to these printed comments in writing, in print, in the 1987-88 annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for these amendments are clear; they have been spelt out and they have been well and truly canvassed in the Senate. But I say to the Opposition: this has been a long and tedious debate. I thank honourable members on this side of the chamber for their comments and I again thank all those people who assisted the Government in the preparation of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill is the last of the three Bills in a package that has been debated over a two-year period. It deals with the Institute, a very important part of Aboriginal affairs. The work that it does is recognised both nationally and internationally. The Government agreed to all of the amendments that were put forward by the Institute, interested persons and the Opposition parties in the Senate. We find no difficulty with accepting those proposals. As I said at the outset in 1987, good ideas will be welcomed by the Government, and the spirit of my long-held principle of working with people and trying to achieve the best situation is being upheld here yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say one last thing, because we are on the last of the big three. The Opposition spokesman said that the Government ought perhaps to hold off, and not proceed with legislation to put the Government's plans into place. I have news for him. After all the frustrations that have been put in the way of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), it is now a fact. It will be a part of political life in this country. It will now be put into law. It will now become part of the scene in this nation. It will not be held off until some election some time in the future. It will commence. I remind honourable members on both sides to read this legislation, because to change it will require the numbers in both chambers. It is a very far-reaching piece of legislation, as I said. It will trip into place after the Governor-General stamps it and then it will be off and running. </PARA>
<PARA> The cuts to ATSIC as proposed by the Opposition in its recent economic statement are not worth the paper they are written on, because some of the funds that the Opposition plans to cut--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In conclusion, I was making the point that, from the day that ATSIC commences, certain funds will be expended. I think I am joined by the Opposition in what I am saying here. I have read the Hansard record of the Senate. Senator Peter Baume made the point that we should be striving to inform people and make sure everybody is fully aware of all the processes involved in ATSIC, and that will be done. The expenditure cuts that the Opposition is proposing would involve the funds that deal with that very point, that is, to let the people in the community know what their rights are and to set up the mechanisms to commence ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will be complying with the wishes of the Senate. I am sorry that that cuts across the Opposition, but we will comply with the wishes of the Senate and, most importantly, the wishes of the Aboriginal community. It is obvious from the comments in support of this concept from the former secretary, Lois O'Donohue, Shirley McPherson who, when she worked for the Aboriginal Development Commission, came and saw me, and all of people who have written and who have some knowledge of the area-people in every State and Territory of the nation-that ATSIC is a goer. I said that in December 1987, and now it will happen, right from today. </PARA>

It is one of those institutes in Australia which, over the years, have been very beneficial and worth while. Because we have had such an institute, we have gained a reservoir of information about Aboriginal Australians and that has been very important for this country's heritage. I hope that honourable members have realised by now that Aboriginal people have a long cultural heritage, and that heritage is being kept by the Institute. No doubt its work will be enjoyed by generations of Australians in the future. I believe that the 17 amendments made to the legislation during its passage have improved it.

We do so mainly because of the action of the Opposition in the other place which, in cahoots with the Australian Democrats, has imposed a deadline on the receipt of urgent legislation to be dealt with after 24 November. We have to have all our essential legislation in the other place by that date, if it is to be dealt with this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition regularly cries crocodile tears about the need to facilitate the business of the House, and that is the purpose of the motion that the Bills be declared urgent-to allow the smooth passage of remaining essential legislation in the Budget session. The other day the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), referred to the sitting pattern this year. He suggested that we were sitting fewer days this year than in past years. While we are planning to sit for 55 days this year-and it could be more-that is more than the number of days of sitting in both 1980 and 1982. In both those years when the tories opposite were in government, the House sat for 51 and 53 days respectively. So much for their concern about this Government's action. I am making the simple factual point that, despite the rhetoric of those opposite, it is the case that the Fraser Government regularly used the guillotine and it is nonsense for them to object to the need to proceed expeditiously with this essential legislation. I am sure that the honourable member for Hume will agree with me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more in sorrow than in anger that I indicate to the House and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that the Opposition is violently opposed to debate being limited on the 11 Bills about to be declared urgent. We will not be party to legislation being rushed through Parliament today, or on any other day, without it being properly considered. There are occasions, as the Minister has has pointed out, when the course of action being pursued by the Government this evening can be justified. In government, as the Minister had indicated, I have moved that the guillotine be applied to Bills before the House, and I have no doubt that I will do it again when we go back into government after the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the guillotine should be used only when Bills become urgent because of something occurring outside the control of government. These Bills, 11 of them, are urgent for one reason, and one reason only: the Government's mismanagement. If 10 of these 11 Bills must be passed by the House of Representatives this evening in order that the Senate will be able to deal with them before the Christmas recess, they should have been introduced weeks ago so that they could have been considered properly and debated fully by the House. Instead the Bills have been introduced late, probably because Ministers have not had the legislation drafted in time. Now the Government expects honourable members to debate 10 Bills during a period of approximately five hours. I say to the House, and particularly to the Minister at the table, that it is outrageous and strikes at the heart of parliamentary government. If it was an occasional occurrence our attitude would be different. However, this procedure has become part of a regular practice by the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Labor rule the institution of parliament in Australia is losing its real function as a meaningful representative and legislative body. Increasingly, Parliament is nothing more than a formality that exists to keep the Government in power. The Government of the day controls Parliament. Under the Hawke-Keating Government sitting times have been drastically curtailed. I repeat for the information of the Minister: sitting times have been drastically curtailed by this Government. This has reduced opportunities for checking the Government's performance adequately, for scrutinising legislation and for the airing of public concerns on issues of the day. The House of Representatives will sit for only 27 days during this Budget session as against 36 in 1986, 34 in 1987 and 33 last year-progressively reducing the number of days available for this House to debate the issues of the day and to properly consider legislation brought before it by the Government. This is despite the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Keating), on his own admission, has said that we have a serious economic situation on our hands. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has said, a very pressed period of parliamentary sittings. Whilst the Minister at the table tonight has not been sufficiently straightforward and gracious to admit this, it has been admitted by the Leader of the House. However, there is plenty of scope for the Government to allow more time for its legislation to be considered in a proper and responsible manner. </PARA>
<PARA> One might also ask why so many important Government announcements are now being made outside Parliament when Parliament is not sitting. It is because the Government prefers to see debate on many major issues confined to the Sunday morning current affairs programs on television. If so, it can only be assumed that the motive is to limit examination of what the Government is putting up rather than face more careful analysis in Parliament. It is a further extension of legislation by press statement. For instance, why was the so-called world's greatest statement on the environment not made in Parliament? Or, for that matter, why was the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on multiculturalism not made in Parliament? The latter had nothing really new to offer, but why was it not made in Parliament? Parliament is the rightful forum where debates on such matters should take place and people can see that we as parliamentarians are fulfilling the proper legislative tasks that we were elected to perform. </PARA>
<PARA> Only by allowing more time to debate and examine legislation will the Parliament regain the meaningful role that it should have. In November last year, for instance, the Government declared 28 Bills urgent. That had the effect of limiting debate on some to less than 30 minutes. Surely the Minister at the table tonight does not agree that this is the way parliamentary business should be conducted. Over the past two years, more often than not, the Government has used the guillotine to push legislation through the Parliament at the end of sitting periods. In one instance last year the Government, with the use of the guillotine, pushed 28 Bills through the House of Representatives in three days. Already this year it has used the guillotine on 32 Bills. Now 11 more are to be added to make up a disgraceful total of 43 Bills in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides allowing sufficient time to consider important legislation, the Government should also make time to answer questions raised by the Opposition, which, in the public interest, should be answered before Parliament rises at the end of the month. For example, the Australian people want to know whether the Government intends to reduce the size of the public sector. Will it adopt our spending cuts and privatisation program? Will it commit itself to the discipline of forgoing the proceeds of bracket creep? How does the Government intend to liberalise the labour market and achieve long overdue productivity improvements? Where is the Government's policy on injecting foreign competition into coastal shipping? Will we see real action to clean up the waterfront? Where are the Government's policies on contracting out? The onus is squarely on the Government to answer these and many other questions before Parliament rises. </PARA>
<PARA> The list of Bills to be debated and voted upon between now and, I emphasise, 2.30 a.m. tomorrow, covers important and complex matters. They are to be rushed through this House late at night and in the early hours of tomorrow. Let us look at the Bills. There is the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Student Assistance Amendment Bill (No. 2), the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Bill, the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill, the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Bill and the University of Canberra Bill. They are not only very important education Bills but also many of them are complex pieces of legislation. About 55 minutes has been set aside for the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill, one of the Minister's own Bills, and 1 hour and 25 minutes only for the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4); and 40 minutes for the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. The Opposition will vote against the use of the guillotine. The Government stands condemned for this act of parliamentary vandalism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to repeat what I have said in relation to the use of the guillotine tonight. However, I remind the House and every member present that we are about to deal with 10 Bills in a period of about 4 1/2 hours. Seven very important and complex education Bills will be dealt with in one hour and 30 minutes. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill will be dealt with in a period of 55 minutes. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) will be dealt with in one hour and 25 minutes. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill has been allocated no more than 40 minutes. This is disgraceful and the Opposition will again vote against the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only do I want to support my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) but also I want to draw the attention of the House to an extraordinary anomaly that exists in relation to this allotment of time for urgent Bills. According to the sheet that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has presented here tonight, the time allotted for the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill is due to expire at 2.30 a.m. tomorrow, Friday, 3 November, and the time allotted for debate on the remaining stages of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) is until 5 p.m. on Tuesday 21 November. We know that the House will resume at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 November. Therefore, the implication is that, despite the extraordinary squeezing of time that is occurring with these other Bills, the time for debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) will commence at 2.30 a.m. tomorrow and not conclude until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 21 November.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister should be asked to give some consideration to changing the schedule in order to allow more time for debate on the education Bills, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and less time for debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is preparing to respond, and I am glad that he is able to do so to a full House, because it has been obvious from events that have taken place in the last three days that the Minister is busy developing his own constituency, namely, those in the mining industry, the rural industry and the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I want to be very gentle and gracious with honourable members opposite. I see that they are in an outrage situation and I do not want to give them any excuse at all to manufacture more outrage. It will not be good for some of them, considering the sort of tired old people that they are becoming. This is really just a set piece debate. The fact of the matter is that those opposite go along with their mates in the Senate and they go along with the Australian Democrats, so we have to do this to get essential Government business through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday's performance in this House by the Opposition was very shabby indeed. Honourable members opposite should ask their colleagues the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) why they moved to suspend Standing Orders for spurious and unnecessary reasons. Part of the reason for moving this motion is that we want to get Government legislation through. Honourable members opposite show no inclination to seriously apply themselves to the business before the House, and they want to engage in spurious motions. I can only refer honourable members opposite back to the times when they were in government many years ago and the sorts of devices they used. They did exactly the same thing. Governments want to get their business through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating a package of six Bills on education. This would normally be a wide-ranging debate but because of the absurd limitation of time imposed by the Government no reasonable debate can take place. This is typical of this Government on the subject of education. It is probably not a coincidence because the overbearing approach of the Hawke Government in the education area is paralleled by its attitude here. My comments were to be devoted primarily to the subject of the funding of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education (CAE) but because of this grotesque limitation of time I will be able to say very little indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last Thursday, 26 October, I raised the issue of funding of the Gold Coast CAE, or should I say the non-funding of its previously approved capital works program, and I had hoped to pursue this matter and related matters in my speech tonight. However, I can only refer honourable members to page 1952 of the House of Representatives Hansard and to questions that I posed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and comments that I made at the time. I have questions on notice which ask the Minister whether it is a consistent requirement that amalgamations take a certain form-the form, namely, that has been put on to the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education. I alleged in my speech and I believe it to be true that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for your guidance. The manner of funding tertiary education, in particular on the Gold Coast, is a matter of concern. We have only one public tertiary institution, the one I referred to earlier this evening; that is, the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education. We also have Bond University, which attracts some overseas students, but that is not material to the Government. The question of attracting students, including Aboriginal students, to the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education is very material. I previously pointed out in a speech to the House that the line the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has been taking on the capital funding of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education is of great disadvantage to anybody who wants to attend that institution. It is a rapidly expanding one, with many future course plans. The Minister will not release the previously approved capital funding, which means it cannot proceed with expansion of its courses. This is forcing disadvantaged students, those who are not well heeled and cannot go to Brisbane, to forgo their further education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I have posed the question about the expansion of education and availability on the Gold Coast to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I have put on notice the following questions:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Has it been a consistent requirement of his that amalgamations of tertiary institutions must proceed to the stage of a Memorandum of Agreement between two institutions before Commonwealth funds for approved capital building programs are released; if not, in which cases have capital building funds been withheld from institutions which have given an undertaking to amalgamate but which have not yet signed a Memorandum of Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Given that considerable progress has been made in negotiations to establish the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education as an affiliated university college of Griffith University, what action does he propose to take with respect to the funding of Stage 2 of the College's capital building program. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have previously said, the requirement to sign a finalised memorandum of agreement before release of funds for previously approved capital building programs appears to be a requirement unique to the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education. The Minister's answer to the question on notice would therefore be of particular significance to the issue of whether coercion as to forms of amalgamation is a factor in the actual process of amalgamation. Whilst the Minister has not publicly acknowledged these questions, much less answered them, I believe that subsequent to my speech last Thursday I got an answer of sorts from him. </PARA>
<PARA> That evening, the Minister-heavily, and I believe deliberately-shouldered me as our paths happened to cross not a trivial bump but a blow sufficient to knock me almost off my feet and cause me an injury such that 24 hours later I was still suffering considerable pain from it. The Minister did not even pause, much less apologise. He simply strode on, leaving me and the person with whom I had been conversing, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), to stand and watch his retreating back in amazement. My initial reaction was shock and bewilderment. My next reaction was dismay that an education Minister, of all people, could be- have so badly. </PARA>

I have had many thoughts about this behaviour since then, not least that such extraordinary behaviour could come from a Cabinet Minister in a Government which has initiated a national program on domestic violence, a program which has had my wholehearted public support to date. It is a matter of great concern that the Minister could behave in this way. My hopes for rational answers to my questions do not appear very good. The sadness is that many students on the Gold Coast and in that area will miss out on a tertiary education because the college is now unable to proceed with its building program for 1989 and its 1990 program also appears to be in jeopardy.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is no reference in this letter, which was printed on the letters page today-and which I have no doubt was vetted by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training-to the questions I posed about discriminatory treatment.

As we know, they have been haranguing our Embassy in China to try to get our Australian Labor Party Government to allow them to come to this country to further their studies. It is very important that the House understand that these people are being deprived of gaining a good education here. When most of us went to school we associated with students who came here under the Colombo Plan which helped overseas students to visit Australia and attend school here. I am sure that has been of great benefit to us as a nation, given the goodwill involved with those people having gone back to their countries but having been fortunate enough to have had a good education here, which in most cases was probably better than they would have received in their own countries. Their education will have done a great deal of good for those nations. Of course, many of those people have stayed on in Australia and become doctors, dentists or other professionals. Many of the doctors moved into the western areas of Queensland and have done a good job serving the communities throughout that area.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is interesting to note that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is at the table tonight. I take this opportunity to support his not necessarily outspoken but sensible statements in the past couple of days on environmental issues. The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Bill is very important to the long term education of Aboriginal students throughout this huge nation of ours. Many of them are involved in the land rights situation in their schooling in the Northern Territory, Queensland and other such areas. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has been very sensible, and I support him 100 per cent. It is a pity more of his Government colleagues will not support him. It was amazing that when he spoke on the matter of public importance today only one Government member came in to support him. That was disgraceful.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I have been a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs of this House since coming to Parliament in 1980. That Committee has put out a report on education. I very much support all we can do about education. I guess we have to educate the Aboriginal people in our English ways, although we are now starting to learn a lot from them about their ways of living. A lot of Aboriginal education is taking place at the primary and lower school levels. Aborigines are being employed to take students out into the bush to teach them their bush ways, and I think that cross-movement of cultures is very important for us. We can learn a lot from them, and this legislation allows the extra funding to help them learn how we tick. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to understand that the biggest problem we have with Aboriginal education is actually getting Aboriginal children to attend school. Hamlets and small towns in electorates such as Maranoa and Wide Bay in Queensland and others in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia have reasonably large populations of Aborigines-there are not really many Aborigines in Australia, but 27 per cent of the Aboriginal population is in Queensland-and one of the problems is that the Labor Government distributes the funding not on a per capita basis but more on a political basis, and Queensland tends to miss out. Queensland does the best job of educating Aborigines in Australia. The programs and incentives within the schools are copied by the other States. It is important that we continue to--</PARA>

<PARA> We have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) here today expounding and spitting at the mouth about South Africa and the way they rant and rave at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for days on end. It is a pity he will not go to South Africa and see how well its people are educated and looked after. It is incredible just what a great job the South African nation does in looking after its indigenous people and all the people who go there from other parts of Africa-all the frontline states. It is amazing how they drift down to South Africa to get a decent education and standard of living in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the Bill. Of course, we are very keen to encourage young Aboriginal students to attend school. As I said, this is the biggest problem we have. It is very sad to see the amount of petrol sniffing that still goes on, although we have established a special program to help the children. In many communities one can see young kids wandering around when they ought to be at school. In a lot of places only 30 per cent of Aboriginal kids attend school, which is very bad for us. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been a member of the Standing Committee for nine years now and I do not pretend to have the answers about our Aboriginal problem, because the more money we pour at them, the worse they seem to get. I am a bit like the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on the environment. I think probably the best thing one can do is to offer Aborigines the best education that we have available-and that is what we are doing-and to encourage the Aborigines who are educated to go back into the education system and help educate the kids that are coming along. We are doing that more and more. There are many Aboriginal assistant teachers. More money is being spent by the Government. This Bill, in particular, encourages more funds to be taken out of Consolidated Revenue and granted to the States. I do not believe that there is a need to set up a special Federal arm of education for Aborigines. It always seems to me to be a total waste of money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to see you in the chair this evening. The Opposition supports the University of Canberra Bill 1989. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for the turmoil caused to Australia's higher education system by its use of financial blackmail, centralised control, bureaucratic administration and other heavy-handed tactics to implement its ill conceived education policies''. </PARA>
<PARA>Given that this Government is in such a state of chaos and confusion that it is unable to provide and ensure a proper time for the Parliament to debate this important Bill, I foreshadow two amendments: firstly, an amendment to the process by which persons become disqualified for membership of the council of the university; and, secondly, an amendment to enshrine in this Bill the important principle of freedom of association. There are third and fourth amendments, amendments from the Government, one of which we have initiated, to the composition of the council to increase the number of representatives nominated by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Assembly to come into effect upon the withdrawal of the Monash University and its rights to membership of that council. The second amendment from the Government is a minor, technical amendment, but one that will ensure that existing graduates of the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE) are entitled to vote for that one position on the new council. I will seek the incorporation of those amendments if, for reasons of time, the House does not go into committee to allow a consideration of these amendments in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to establish a University of Canberra under the sponsorship of Monash University to replace the Canberra College of Advanced Education. In a sense, it really follows the end of the binary system, which I think is a policy for which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) will be well remembered in tertiary education circles in this country. In 1988, in accordance with the proposals contained in the Government's ill-fated White Paper, the Government introduced legislation to effect an amalgamation of the three Canberra higher education institutions-the Australian National University (ANU), the Canberra College of Advanced Education and the Canberra Institute of the Arts (CITA). Of course, that ANU-CITA amalgamation is proceeding. The coalition and the Australian Democrats publicly indicated their intention to oppose the legislation and we have led the way in the opposition to that Government proposal. We have done so on the grounds that the Government failed dismally, when it put forward this proposal of amalgamation, by not providing any significant educational or financial benefits which would be derived from the merger. So there have been very strong objections and a strong campaign of protest from within the institutions, notably the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA> Following this opposition to the Bill and representations from the incoming Australian Capital Territory Government, the Federal Government deferred the consideration of the legislation and allowed the new Assembly to consider the implications for the Territory. Not surprisingly, the subsequent report opposed the inclusion of the CCAE in the proposed amalgamation and proposed its establishment as a separate university under ACT legislation. Of course, that separate status for the University of Canberra was its preferred position, one which had been put to one side by the Minister in his manic determination to create a united national system. So in that sense the preferred position of the CCAE people is about to be realised, but not until after a very long fight with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The CCAE has, and always has had, a very different mission from the ANU. Students have gone there specifically because it offers something unique in Canberra. I think they will continue to go to that institution for that reason. Clearly, Canberra has room for two higher education institutions, whether they are called universities or something else. Students should have an opportunity to choose between them and we are pleased to see, therefore, the legislation proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately for the CCAE, this whole amalgamation proposal has been a very timely and costly exercise. It says much of this Government's administration that after all the hullabaloo we ended up with its preferred position. The Minister ordained that to meet his arbitrary requirements for student numbers, which in turn determined the allocation of research funds, the CCAE would have to amalgamate under his plans. In typical fashion, he offered a bribe on this one as he has offered on others. In some cases it has been a straight-out threat. In this case it was an engineering school if the CCAE went ahead with the merger. He threatened the ANU with reduced funding if it continued to resist. We welcome his failure and this Bill encapsulates that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the limited time tonight, I will make one further comment-that is, this university is being established under Federal legislation. All higher education institutions in this country, except the ANU, which has a unique role-a national role-are established under State legislation. It has been suggested that the only reason the CCAE has been kept within the Federal sphere, ignoring the community which it serves, is that the Federal Minister wants to keep alive-he reckons he is down but not out-the possibility of effecting a merger between the ANU and this new university at some time in the future. If that is not the case, tonight is the opportunity for the Minister to come in here and advise the House when he plans to move this new university through to the Territory's jurisdiction. We on this side of the House believe in devolving responsibility to local communities and regions. We have a strong policy position to see the ACT Assembly take control and immediate responsibility at an early stage upon the coalition taking office at the next election. So, in respect of the new university, we on this side welcome its creation and its new status. We wish it well for the future. We believe that it has every reason to be confident about the future, given the dedication of its staff and its student body. </PARA>
<PARA> I have moved a second reading amendment just to make some general comments about the Government's policy position-in particular, the very strong, determined push it has made for amalgamations around the country. It can be seen wherever one goes. Last night I referred to the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) in Victoria. I say to the Minister that this push, this threat, against RMIT in my view is not in its best interests. I do not believe that it is reasonable for a Federal Minister to say to a great institution like RMIT, `If you do not do as you are required to do by me as the Federal Minister, then I will deny you university status and capital funds and put a ceiling on your student numbers'. The position that RMIT has adopted, if one reads its resolution, is a reasonable one. It says that it is not prepared to sacrifice the great efforts and tremendous reputation it has built up. It is prepared to cooperate but not to throw the baby out with the bath water. It does not say much for this Minister that he should call a meeting of the institutions and just lay down the law. He does not have a gun at their heads; he has a whole artillery barrage. Like the Clint Eastwood film, his line is, `Make my day'. That is no way to run tertiary education institutions in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned Victoria, but all the higher education institutions in South Australia face an uncertain future because they have not managed to agree to ludicrous proposals virtually devoid of any education or even economic rationale to amalgamate. In Western Australia, the Minister for Education, Dr Carmen Lawrence, is heavily on the Federal Minister's back railing against the centralist implications of his merger proposals. In Queensland there is continuing bitterness and division over the questions of amalgamations and the status of various instituations. I am afraid to say that, wherever one goes, our higher education institutions have suffered a very great distraction, a very great diversion of resources, as they have fought against this Minister's unfortunately successful attempts to undermine the institutional autonomy and financial independence of some of our great institutions. I fear that the ramifications of this Minister's policy position will be felt for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I will suffer from the guillotine tonight but I want to say something about the importance of the principle of voluntary student unionism. I thought it was one of the most incredible policy positions that I have ever seen from a Federal Minister when last week this Minister announced his version of a bill of rights for universities. After lighting the fire, this Minister, the arsonist, arrived at the scene of the crime to say, `Behold, I think it is time we brought in the fire truck'. The Minister talked about this a couple of years ago in a green paper but no-one was terribly keen on it. It was not an issue and no-one talked about it. Reading between the lines, the Minister virtually admitted that, as a result of his own actions, he has found the necessity to put up a political defence to the widespread criticism of the way in which this Government has operated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has achieved its objective by pulling harder and harder on the purse strings. In so doing, it has attacked the financial independence and autonomy of our institutions. The Minister fails to understand that we ought to be able to look at a university and see there a place where learning can be undertaken and where the pursuit of knowledge is encouraged free from any political intervention or interference. Instead of that, we have the Minister's proposal now lying on the table to allow and encourage compulsory student unionism with all the vices, with all the waste and with the affront that that represents to basic rights, which ought to be a feature of our campuses. Given the Government's handling of business tonight, the fact that other speakers wish to speak on this Bill and the guillotine limit on time, I conclude by saying that we welcome and support the moves for the creation of the University of Canberra. We wish it well for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) talking about a wide range of issues in relation to the University of Canberra Bill. I am pleased that he supports the Bill and supports the proposal for the University of Canberra. Unfortunately, he seems to have made a number of personal comments directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) which had very little basis in fact and which betrayed the total confusion of the Opposition on this whole issue of amalgamations. The Opposition does not know what it is doing or what it is on about when it comes to the amalgamation of tertiary institutions. This was illustrated in particular by the comments that the honourable member for Flinders made about the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and the proposed University of Technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders has been going around Victoria trying to pretend that he is a great champion of the RMIT and suggesting that the Minister has been bullying the RMIT and pushing it around. He has used a number of other terms and descriptions in relation to the plan to amalgamate the three key institutes. The Opposition does not want to see a university in the western suburbs of Melbourne. That is the fundamental point. It has never supported the creation of tertiary institutions in that part of Melbourne. Until the election of the Labor Government, the Hawke Government, we did not see any tertiary institutions spring up in the working class areas or the poor areas of Melbourne, or Sydney, for that matter. </PARA>

Let me make it perfectly clear: education is not for the privileged; education is for all Australians. The fact is that the honourable member for Flinders supported and gave succour to the narrow number of people on the RMIT council that opposed the amalgamation. It was not the academic staff of that institution-they supported the amalgamation-and was not the students of that institution, who, to their credit, although initially having some feelings of opposition about it, also supported the amalgamation when it was explained to them.

They had to do with elitism; they had to do with the refusal to recognise the people living in the western suburbs and the north-western suburbs of Melbourne as having the right to tertiary education. By rejecting this proposal we are now put in an invidious position of having to try to create the university of the west without the RMIT. But it will proceed. The attempts of the honourable member for Flinders to undermine university education in the west will not succeed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Flinders has had his go. The fact is that the honourable member is trying to defend the totally indefensible. The position of the RMIT council is totally indefensible. The Minister has been very kind to it. Look at what the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) and I have to say about the RMIT council and its behaviour. The fact is that its reasons for rejecting the amalgamation were a disgrace in a civilised society, especially since its rejection was not in accordance with the determination of the academic staff, but contrary to the academic staff's determination. So what sort of show is being run at the RMIT?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has said that the RMIT should rethink the position. Indeed, it should rethink its position and reconsider its obligations to all Australians, in particular to that disadvantaged group of people living in the western suburbs, and proceed with the amalgamation. It has been suggested that the Minister has tried to heavy them. What has the Minister done to heavy them? Nothing. The fact is that the Minister could have forced an amalgamation if he was of a mind to do so. He gave them the freedom to make a choice. What has happened? The RMIT made the wrong choice and has given the wrong reasons. I appeal to the whole body of the RMIT to reconsider its position and get back to a position where it decides to amalgamate, because the future of university education in Melbourne depends on this amalgamation succeeding. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does, and the honourable member for Flinders knows that it does. The honourable member for Flinders made certain personal comments about the Minister's role in relation to the Australian National University and the college here in Canberra. He said that the Minister tried to force an amalgamation. If his comments are based on the sort of evidence which he has tried to put forward in relation to the amalgamation involving the RMIT, they must be equally fallacious because the Minister does not force amalgamations; he gives reasons and explanations. He speaks to the various bodies, but ultimately it is up to the bodies themselves. In the case of the University of Canberra, they decided not to proceed and the Minister has proceeded in accordance with that decision to establish this Bill. He has in fact stuck to his word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders that the Minister is trying to heavy institutions into an amalgamation is completely and utterly wrong. But that is just par for the course for the honourable member for Flinders. He has got it wrong in relation to the University of Canberra and in relation to the RMIT and the University of Technology. As a result, he has put all of us in a very difficult position because he is giving support to these reactionary elements that are opposed to university education in the western suburbs of Melbourne. The honourable member for Flinders ought to be ashamed of the role he has played in this situation. The honourable member must not think that the role he has played in this matter is going to do him any good in the west and north-west of Melbourne when all this is exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also look at the honourable member's amendment that he is moving here, in which he is trying to suggest that students should not be required to be members of student union organisations. What is the position of the Government on this? The Minister has said that the Government will not put up with an attempt by State governments to interfere in this matter. We are not going to put up with State Government intervention. We have still allowed the institutions to make the determination about unionism and membership of student organisations. But we are not going to put up with State governments trying to bulldoze through legislation under which, after a determination has been made about student unionism by the university or college concerned, a government comes on top and tries to change that determination. That is the Minister's position, and it is a position which obviously should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA> We know about attempts to break the student movement in the universities in the past by reactionary governments, such as the Queensland Government. We know about that sort of behaviour. The fact is that this matter ought to be left to the students and the universities to determine and should not be determined by State governments such as the Queensland Government-a government, by the way, which has no future because it will be defeated in a few weeks time. Nevertheless, the Opposition's attempt to put this clause into the Bill is nothing more than an attempt to defend those who are trying to attack student unionism. There is no doubt that student unionism is under attack by a number of organisations and bodies. The Opposition is also trying to get behind this. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an absurd position. The Opposition is trying to attack student unionism because the unions will organise against the absurd scheme that it will bring into universities whereby people will be required to pay up-front fees of $1,200--</PARA>

That is a totally unfair and iniquitous system. The Opposition wants to support that system by preventing student organisations from being effectively organised against such a proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We reject this whole argument that members of the Opposition have put forward tonight. We reject, in particular, the comments that they have made in relation to amalgamations, especially the RMIT amalgamation. I repeat: the Minister has behaved honourably throughout this whole process. He has not tried to bulldoze anything through. He has allowed the institutions to make a decision on the basis of their own councils, et cetera. That does not mean that some of us, especially those who represent the areas concerned, are not concerned about the behaviour of the honourable member in going around and discouraging what should have been a very important amalgamation in the State of Victoria for the people of that region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in his excellent comments on this legislation. I am pleased that the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) mentioned the Economic Action Plan of the coalition. Political historians will regard that as the turning point of a lead-in to the next Federal election, which the coalition will win. One key reason we will win the next Federal election is the Economic Action Plan and its contents. Unfortunately, due to the savage guillotine applied by this arrogant, out of touch and fading Government, I will not be able to develop that point any further. I want to discuss in a constructive way the University of Canberra Bill 1989 in supporting the honourable member for Flinders and his amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I refer to the preamble in the Bill. I invite the Minister to look at the exact wording of the preamble, because two points arise. It is rare indeed to have a qualified preamble. It is even rarer still to have such extraordinary contents in a preamble. I refer to the words:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . because it is desirable to establish a new university in the Australian Capital Territory to replace the Canberra College of Advanced Education:</PARA>
<PARA> and because Monash University has agreed to sponsor the new university:</PARA>
<PARA> be it enacted by the Queen, and the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, as follows . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I research my contributions to this House, as I know the Minister does, and he should allow me the credit for doing that. Not one of those pieces of legislation has a qualified preamble. It is very rare indeed to have, in a sense, the Federal Parliament acting at the behest of Monash University. I venture to suggest that this is the sort of thing that gets right up the nostrils of the members of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I will be very interested to see what its scarlet report on this Bill has to say with regard to that qualification in the preamble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a sense, it is not in the mainstream of legislation, and I will not dwell on this, but there is a second dimension to it. This relates not only to putting in a preamble of that form but to the statement `and because Monash University has agreed to sponsor the new university . . .'. This Parliament does not enact legislation at the behest of the Monash University, the Melbourne Football Club, the Victoria Racing Club, or anything else. Legislation is enacted on the basis of the votes of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This is the most curious drafting I have ever seen in the five years that I have been a member of Federal Parliament. I have endeavoured to make some inquiries in relation to this matter, and I understand that there is some precedent for this kind of approach to the drafting of legislation. However, I will be particularly interested to see what the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has to say. I believe this could have been more carefully drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Charles Sturt University, which has emerged during the period of the original Australian National University (ANU) legislation, and now this University of Canberra Bill, is in an indirect way germane to the discussion on this Bill. By this Bill, the opportunity for the higher education facilities at Albury-Wodonga to link with the Australian National University evaporates-and the ANU might also have been amalgamated with the Canberra College of Advanced Education. I think the Minister would concede that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will happily do so. In fact, the Minister has agreed with my comments, that by this Bill that opportunity is lost. This is regrettable because we now have a second best option applying in Albury-Wodonga, with the Murray campus of Albury, which requires funding but which has been dropped from the list of Federal funding. It is linked with the Charles Sturt University, involving elements from Bath- urst, Wagga and Albury. The Charles Sturt University is a fledgling university. It is one that I wish well. It has a major challenge ahead of it. The pity is that on the other side of the border at Albury-Wodonga the higher education unit chooses not to be linked with the Charles Sturt University.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, I do not blame the Minister, but I want the House and the nation to know that this crazy situation exists in this combined city of Albury-Wodonga of about 80,000 in population. The higher education facilities on the northern side of the border will have nothing to do with-and in some instances will duplicate-activities south of the border. An attempt was made to reach some conclusion on that, but the factors became very complex. In respect of Albury-Wodonga, I regard the outcome as the second best option. Sure, we must now make the best of it, and hopefully the Charles Sturt University will power forward from the commencement of its operations and ultimately those south of the border will see reason and link up in a way which will be to the positive advantage of all involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that we often have these problems right on the border. This one relates to education; earlier in the day there was a problem in respect of the bypass route of the Hume Highway. Again, that is a border problem where project B, the Albury internal bypass, has been pushed to one side. It is a continuing battle, but I will not give up the fight, nor will my electors. Finally, in support of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), I am very pleased that it is the national Parliament that is legislating on this Bill and not the Australian Capital Territory Assembly. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(ia) `2' were omitted from paragraph (1) (c) and `3' were substituted; and''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to expand the membership of the council of the university, that is, those who are appointed on the nomination of the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), at the time that the sponsorship arrangement with Monash University ceases. We believe that at the time of the cessation of the arrangement whereby during the sponsorship period two members of the council are nominated by the Monash University, it is appropriate to extend by one the number appointed from the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> We think it is appropriate for this university to be established under Commonwealth legislation but, at the same time, we believe that it is important that this new university be quite firmly established and linked to the local community. Therefore, we have provided for some members of the council from its inception to be nominated by the Chief Minister. This provision will be extended once the sponsorship arrangements cease. </PARA>
<PARA> The important principle here is to ensure that in this university, as I believe in other universities around the country, the outside members of the council-that is, the members who are appointed either from the community or by cooption from the council itself-are in the majority in terms of the composition of the council. In other words, I do not believe that it is appropriate for the staff, the administration and the students to be in a majority on the governing council. I certainly believe that all those interests ought to be represented on the council, but I do not believe that they should be in the ascendancy at any point. Therefore, when the Monash nominees are removed from the council we should expand the membership of the outside members of the council, and this seems to be an appropriate way to do it. There will be three nominees from the Commonwealth and three nominees from the ACT Government. That will constitute, I think, a very balanced council and one that will help guide the course of this new university into what I hope will be a very exciting future. </PARA>

<PARA>This important Opposition amendment seeks to insert a new clause 40a into this legislation. In recent years we have not, to my knowledge, had an amendment to instil in legislation a basic freedom, that is, the freedom of association. It is an area where there are very great differences between the Opposition and the Government. It is our view-and it is surprising that it needs to be stated-that compelling anyone to join an organisation is anathema to the fundamental principle to the freedom of association, to the spirit of free inquiry and interaction which lies at the heart of Western democracy and which should be upheld by all our higher education institutions and politicians alike. </PARA>
<PARA> At the birth of a new institution I could not move a more important amendment to this legislation than to enshrine this basic principle. If this new university starts off with that statement of principle as its foundation, then its future will be well secured. We have had a lot of nonsense from the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) about freedom of association. He failed to recognise that the proposition that we have here leaves it in the hands not of university councils, State governments or State parliaments but of the students themselves as to whether or not they should join such an organisation. We are not opposed to students running organisations. In fact, this principle endorses their right to form organisations as people in a democracy ought to be able to do. We are opposed to this Government requiring in an underhand way, as it will in legislation it is shortly to propose in this Parliament, people to join organisations against their will. It is not just a slight matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Victorian Equal Opportunity Board considered this issue. Mr Kenmar took his case to that Board in respect of compulsory student unionism. Mr Kenmar was required to join the Monash association of students. The Board found that the Monash association of students was a political organisation and, because of his political beliefs, Mr Kenmar had been treated less favourably than other students. On a philosophical level we object strongly to compulsory student unionism and on a practical level we will ensure in government that students in higher education institutions are able to exercise their freedom of choice and decide whether to join student unions. Voluntary student unionism is an important plank of our higher education policy. In government we will take the appropriate action to ensure that it is introduced around the nation. We congratulate Mr Kenmar on the strong, principled stand that he has taken. He has given a lead to other students and to our country as a whole on this vital principle. While the Government may not accept the amendment on this occasion, it will see the principle raised again in the future when we are in government, when we have the numbers on the treasury bench to ensure that this basic freedom can be seen in practice on each and every campus in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To disappoint the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and to encourage the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who seems to be nodding off, I indicate that the Government intends to oppose the proposed new clause. The Opposition has a totally confused view on this, as on so many other issues. The Government's position is quite simply that it should be up to the governing body of an institution to provide for the provision of student facilities, student associations, and the collection fees necessary to support those facilities and associations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to impose its particular ideological obsessions upon the governing bodies of institutions. We have a very clear view that governing bodies of higher education institutions ought to be autonomous and able to make their own decisions about the way in which they run their affairs. That is why we pay particular attention to the composition of those councils to ensure that they represent not only the university community, the staff, students and administration, but also the outside community. Once an appropriate composition for the council is established, it is then up to that council or governing body to determine the rules which operate within that institution. We are not requiring institutions to impose compulsory membership of student organisations. If the governing body decides that membership of a student organisation can be voluntary, so be it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989 is umbrella legislation to set up a framework to provide for research and development corporations to replace research councils. Such research and development corporations already exist for the meat industry and for horticulture. This legislation envisages initially four such corporations-grain, dairy, coal and energy. In the very brief time allotted to me, I will be talking about the primary industry sector of the legislation, and my colleague the shadow Minister for science and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), will be talking about the coal and energy sections. The various organisations associated with primary industry, in particular the dairy and grain industries, such as the Grains Council of Australia, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, the Australian Dairy Industry Conference and the National Farmers Federation, have shown considerable interest in this legislation because it is very important to them, particularly in view of the amount of money, which will be increasing, that their grower members now provide for research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been considerable discussion on this legislation between the Opposition, the Government and the Australian Democrats, which is commendable; if we can improve this legislation by sensible amendments, we should do so. At this stage there is a positive feeling and attitude amongst all parties towards possible improvements to the legislation. There are definitely ways that this legislation can be improved. I will move a general amendment to the second reading of the Bill and I give notice that a number of amendments will be moved by the Opposition during the committee stage in the Senate. It is hoped that between now and then further discussion will take place between the parties to ensure that as many of those amendments as possible are accepted. I believe all of them should be accepted because none try to negate the legislation; they improve it in a number of technical ways. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill should include provision for representative organisations of a primary industry (as defined in the Bill) or class of primary industry to receive direct voluntary contributions from commercial companies for research and development, and for the contributions to attract a matched Commonwealth contribution on the same basis that funds raised by way of industry levy will attract a Commonwealth contribution, provided that such contributions:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) are not also eligible for the 150% tax deduction or for any additional Commonwealth research and development incentive scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) are within agreed limits such as the 0.5% of the gross value of the product stipulated by the Commonwealth for matching contributions''. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Gippsland has duly signed the amendment. The reason we move that general amendment is that we are not allowed to move a more specific one. We are moving that general amendment as we have been advised that this is the most appropriate way to go. If the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) believes that it would be more acceptable to him to have the amendment changed in the Senate to specify the dairy industry, we will be happy to do so because it is to that industry that the importance of this amendment is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The dairy industry has a significant number of dairy cooperative factories and there is an opportunity for them to provide money for research. As the cooperatives are owned by dairy farmers, it is really dairy farmer money that is provided and we believe that any such contributions by those factories should be accepted as grower contributions up to the 0.5 per cent of the gross value of the product. There is a precedent for that with the horticultural corporation arrangements. We believe the same should be available for the dairy industry and I ask the Government to seriously consider that. We will be quite happy to make that amendment more specific if that is more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, my colleague the shadow Minister for science and energy will move a significant amendment at the committee stage in relation to the coal sector. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a range of amendments that I have foreshadowed because I will have no time to go into them in detail in committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will seek leave for them to be incorporated at that stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we have some concerns about aspects of this Bill, a particular point I want to raise is that these research and development corporations should not be forced to hold annual meetings. Annual meetings should be held only when the representative organisation requires it. I believe that in the view of the Government that is accommodated in this legislation, but we want to make sure that it is quite clear because none of the other primary industry organisations want the requirement of the Meat and Livestock Corporation or the Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation to hold expensive annual meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if a particular corporation ceases to exist, the industry funds should not be transferred to Consolidated Revenue but, rather, should be held in trust for the industry. That is only fair and equitable. Industry organisations and the Opposition are also concerned to ensure a close working relationship between the corporation and its representative organisation. While we believe that this should be possible in view of the fact that the selection committees which are nominated by the respective industry will appoint six out of the nine members of the corporation, we believe that copies of research and development plans, or variations to them, should be made available to the representative organisation as well as to the Minister. The Opposition and the primary producer organisations also believe that the research and development corporations should consult with, and have regard to the views of, the representative organisations in preparing plans of operation, including the initial one. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern is that State governments may try to take advantage of the fact that research and development money in the new corporations can be used to extend the research results to producers, in other words, getting to extension which traditionally has been the role of State governments and State Departments of Agriculture. We would not want to see that happen. It has so often happened. When the Commonwealth moves in, the States back away from their own responsibilities. After giving serious consideration to an amendment to restrict that extension facility to only research which was financed by the particular research and development corporation, we decided that may be too restrictive and may prevent it from using related extension arrangements, or related research and development arrangements for extension purposes, where it was necessary to tie the two together. The corporations need to look carefully at proposals for extension projects to ensure that they are not just financing something previously financed by a State government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grains Council is also concerned that the different levels of levy for the different grains, and the varying levels for the same grain-particularly barley-in the different States, that exist in research councils are not lost to those specific commodities. It is only right and equitable that anything there should be retained for them. That is the purpose of another amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the major purpose of the Bill, because research and development is very important for the competitiveness of agriculture. One of the great things about Australian agriculture is that it is research oriented. That is one of the reasons, along with its capital intensity and the fact that it has to face international competition every day, why it is our most efficient industry, and is the one that is sustaining our export drive. </PARA>
<PARA> As an interesting example of the different attitudes of the Government to research assistance and assistance generally, this Government is giving Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd $12m or $13m a year because it earns $200m a year in export income. The dairy industry, which will be one of the research and development corporations initially established, will earn close to $700m in export income this year. The Government's contribution to it will be about $2m, on a dollar for dollar basis, for research. I would like to know how much Kodak is putting into research. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the grain industry, we see that the figure for exports is even greater and that for Government assistance is proportionately less. I can go right through all the rural industries, including the wool industry, which exported $6 billion worth of product last year and will export at least $4 billion worth this year. Total exports amounted to $48 1/2 billion and, of that, $25 billion will be lopped off in a couple of years. The point I make to the Minister and the Government is that these are sensible, pragmatic, technical amendments to improve the legislation, not to frustrate or negate it. I ask the Minister to consider these amendments seriously between now and the time that they are dealt with in the Senate. We are prepared to discuss these amendments further because I believe that they are all worthy of serious consideration. In general terms, the Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has said, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill 1989 is designed to remove some of the restrictions of the old methods of research and development in the rural industry sector. It allows joint ventures, the taking up of patents and licences by the corporations, and more scope for the corporations to attract funds. The Bill embodies a couple of research areas which are of current importance to my electorate, the Northern Territory. A natural resource research and development corporation will be created. This will include the water research and development program currently operating under the Australian Water Research Advisory Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Territory we face a massive problem of mimosa infestation in some major water systems, specifically the Alligator River system. Mimosa is a weed. Where it gets control, it excludes all other plants and animals. Initially, people in the pastoral industry were concerned about it because it prevents beasts from getting to water. Then they realised that it had the potential to severely reduce carrying capacity. People in the tourist industry now realise that mimosa has the potential to undermine their businesses. It means that access to wetlands becomes impossible. It means that wetland birds are squeezed out as mimosa allows no other animals or plants to coexist with it. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) scientists have told me that people think it is exaggerating the problem-that is, until they see the situation for themselves. They then compare it with the prickly pear infestations of the 1920s and 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, mimosa covers half of the Oenpelli flood plain and, by the end of the wet, it has the potential to cover the whole of the flood plain. In the Adelaide River area it doubled its infestation in a year. It produces masses of seeds, and seedlings can develop in huge densities. They are light and rapidly dispersed by water, which is why each wet causes a rapid expansion of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Mimosa represents a unique combination of attributes. It has a unique biology and it threatens primary production, conservation and Aboriginal land in a way that no other weed does. No other weed in Australia has the awesome biological attributes of mimosa. Even by weed standards, mimosa is a formidable plant. It grows quickly and can produce seeds when only six months old. It produces huge numbers of seeds. An isolated plant can produce 90,000 seeds per year. To make matters worse, the seeds can float, so it can spread very quickly across the flood plains that are its main home. If one kills the plants there are still 10,000 seeds that can last for years in every square metre of ground. The end result is that the area of mimosa infestation can roughly double in a year. If we did nothing, we would have eight times the area of mimosa in three years. There is no other weed in Australia with these awesome biological attributes. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike other weeds, mimosa can transform a range of ecosystems. Flood plains, swamp forests, pastures and even billabongs are all prime mimosa habitat. Mimosa converts them all to a monotonous shrubland in which no other species can persist. Other weeds are merely contaminants of ecosystems. Mimosa transforms ecosystems into something completely different. Mimosa is the greatest threat to primary production in the tropics since the prickly pear. Mimosa is low in palatability and explodes in response to overgrazing. The proposed new buffalo industry in the Top End will, in the view of some, promote the expansion of mimosa, which in turn will eventually choke out the industry. It is practically impossible to muster animals from dense thickets of this weed which, even now acts as a reservoir of stock, hindering the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign (BTEC). </PARA>
<PARA> In northern Thailand, with an economy based on agricultural production, mimosa is far and away the worst weed problem. Indeed, the Thai Government has set up a special task force to tackle it. Irrigation canals, reservoirs and agricultural land are all being choked by this weed. Mimosa is none too choosy about where it lives. Mimosa has only just begun to expand its range in Australia. It can thrive anywhere in the tropics with a rainfall of more than 700 millimetres. Clearly, it threatens the pastoral and sugar cane regions of north Queensland. It is a mammoth problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Mimosa is the most pressing threat to Kakadu National Park. Kakadu's wetlands are regarded by the park's managers as being endangered by mimosa, to the extent that four people are employed full time to patrol the park looking for this noxious weed. Mimosa threatens Aboriginal lands. Mimosa has already invaded Arnhem Land and it poses a threat to traditional methods of food gathering. No native plants and animals can exist where mimosa has taken over. We can probably control this weed cheaply, with biological control, if we act with urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO has laid solid groundwork for biological control. It has been working on the plant for a number of years, at a cost of nearly $1m, and now it has a large number of insects and fungal pathogens awaiting quarantine testing, followed by the rearing of massive numbers of them for release in the field. The funds now received by the CSIRO are not sufficient to do this as quickly as it must. In other words, a further injection of funds is required. It has been found that natural enemies have attacked leaves, stems, flowers and seeds. Some species have already been released. The more insects that are released the better the chances of fighting it. </PARA>
<PARA> The most promising herbicide for mimosa as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, said-is graslan which costs $110 per hectare. It has to be applied twice or more to kill an infestation of mimosa. With biological control, after the initial research, there are no further costs. Mimosa was the only weed mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement on the environment. It is that significant. I believe that mimosa represents a great chance to demonstrate the Federal Government's commitment to preventing further environmental degradation. It would seem to me that the councils which are being set up under this legislation provide the opportunity for an injection of funds to be made to an appropriate council to enable it to solve the problem of mimosa infestation and to contribute to and assist in the work that has already been done by the CSIRO and other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of important research which needs examination as a matter of urgency is the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign as it affects the buffalo industry. The legislation provides for a research and development council to be formed within the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. In my view, this would be an appropriate research body to fund so it can look at brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication as it pertains to the buffalo industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that buffalo are not beef cattle and that the BTEC tests are, at best, known to be extremely unreliable in relation to buffalo. There is no clear proof that tuberculosis is transmittable from buffalo to beef. While I understand that there is a 1992 deadline for BTEC for the cattle industry, there is a clear case for the buffalo industry to be treated differently and perhaps for the Australian meat and live-stock research council, or the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, to undertake the work into the buffalo industry, including the application of BTEC. The buffalo industry is a potentially burgeoning industry for northern Australia, but it has to be treated sensitively. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned these two subjects-mimosa and buffalo-because they interrelate. We have a prime opportunity to see what sensitive research can be done for not only conservation purposes but also sustainable economic development. We see a marriage of interests in these areas of research which can be undertaken profitably by the research councils which will be set up under this legislation which will assist conservation and, most importantly, the economic development of northern Australia. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Distinct from the corporatisation programs envisaged for the rural industries, the Government also intends in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill to corporatise the operations of the national energy research development and demonstration program-better known as NERDDP-which is currently overseen by the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council-better known as NERDDC. Currently NERDDC carries out research in regard to energy related matters as well as coal related research. Coal related research is funded primarily by way of a compulsory levy known as the coal production excise. This excise raises 5c per tonne of black coal produced, which gives a total income of about $7 million each year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Funds spent by NERDDC on coal research beyond the amount of the industry levy are drawn from the coal industry trust fund, which is itself the product of accumulated coal industry excise contributions. NERDDC's other energy related research is funded by way of government appropriations. In other words, the coal aspects of NERDDC are funded by way of a compulsory levy and those sections of NERDDC that deal with renewable energy, sustainable energy and conservation research are funded largely or totally by government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporatisation program contained in the legislation seeks to split NERDDC into two distinct corporate research and development corporations: the National Energy Research and Development Corporation, and the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation. The National Energy Research and Development Corporation will be funded from appropriation in line with current levels of expenditure. In other words, that body, NERDDC, will continue research into energy conservation and alternative or renewable sources of energy-solar and wind, to take two examples. However, the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation will be funded only by way of the continuation of the coal excise as well as by the transference of the Coal Research Trust Account to the Corporation as envisaged in the legislation. The Government has made allowance for a review of this funding arrangement after the close of the 1992-93 financial year. Specific funding arrangements are not dealt with in this legislation, which is of a generic umbrella type. Details will be subject to discussions which are continuing between the coal industry and government, and will be articulated in the regulations. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy, however, has confirmed repeatedly that no appropriations will be used to underwrite or contribute to the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is opposed to the current practice of conducting coal research within NERDDC by way of a compulsory levy. It wishes to see the coal excise abolished and the industry moved towards in-house research. The coal industry also contends that the proposed Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation is a redundancy. So far as the corporation is established in order to carry out industry related research, and, unlike the rural corporations, attracts no matching funding, the industry cannot see the purpose of this proposed arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that industry money alone would be supporting the proposed corporation, there is no justification for government bureaucratic intrusion into the administration and conduct of the industry's research effort. The creation of the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation adds nothing to the efficiencies of the industry. Nor does it meet the urgent need for deregulation of the coal industry. The industry is already subject to an excessive degree of Commonwealth intervention, which has undermined its capacity to boost production and to respond to market forces. The industry would prefer to conduct its own research, utilising its own recently restructured and commercially oriented Australian Coal Industry Research Laboratories, amongst other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> By calling for the abolition of the excise, the coal industry is seeking to model its research effort on the model used by the mineral sector, which carries out an ambitious research program through the Australian Mineral Industry Research Association. The research is not subject to a compulsory industry levy. The Association acts as a broker for the mining and mineral sector and has facilitated an active research and development program. The mining and mineral sector's overall research and development program attests to what the best industry sectors can do when left to their own devices. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of some of the industries' technological initiatives in recent times. Consider the smelting technologies industry has developed. The direct iron ore smelting technology, referred to as Hismelt, of CSR Ltd offers not only lower capital costs but also a vast potential in utilising a more diverse range of raw materials in the steel production process. Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd is moving, by way of a joint venture project, towards the commercialisation of this technology with the construction of a $102m pilot plant. Similarly, MIM Holdings Ltd has utilised Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation breakthroughs in treating low value raw material by adapting the Sirosmelt technology to lead and copper. The outcome has been the Isasmelt smelting process, used primarily in lead smelting operations. There has been an 8 per cent boost in lead production and the construction of a new smelting plant at a cost of $50m. The results of the introduction of these processes will be an increase in the levels of production, improvements on the environmental impact of the plants and a rise in the amount of value added product we exported. The minerals industry understands that openness to technological change, as well as shift into downstream processing, is critical to international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Keeping the example of the minerals industry in mind, the coal industry is adamant it can reach a suitably diverse and high level of research and development activity without a coercive excise. Our traditional export industries are long used to competing in overseas markets and they fully realise the necessity to embrace leading edge technology. The National Energy Research and Development Corporation will continue to underwrite energy related research of national significance, as it does through the national energy research development and demonstration program. The coalition's resources and energy policy supports the present national energy research development and demonstration program and it would therefore be consistent to support the new National Energy Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Opposition does not oppose the creation of the National Energy Research and Development Corporation. However, we do oppose the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation. We will be moving amendments to the Bill to excise references to the Corporation. One of the great fears I have about the legislation is that it sets the standard form of the research and development corporations but says nothing of substance. Everything is left to regulation. Vast powers are delegated to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). Certainly, the regulations are disallowable by Parliament. Nonetheless, the reality is that the Minister is being given a tremendous amount of delegate power. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from discussions with the Department of Primary Industries and Energy that the reason that the legislation is so generally drawn and so lacking in specifics is that it would take a very much longer time-about 18 months-to bring before the Parliament in separate pieces of legislation all proposed research and development corporations' dealings with not only the agricultural industries but also the coal industry. That is something of an indictment on somebody, perhaps even this Parliament. The fact that a department can very quickly shunt through the Parliament a massive piece of legislation covering a great many diverse fields says something about the legislative process. Again, sadly, time does not allow me to expand further on this concern. But I do note that we are being asked to take the Government on trust to a very large extent. I will have more to say about the Opposition's amendments regarding the excising of any reference to the Coal Industry Research and Development Corporation during the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Bill is to establish research and development (R&amp;) corporations and a Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC) to provide for the funding and administration of research and development into agricultural industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite clear the Australia's dependence on agricultural exports is going to continue for some time, so the nation's prosperity for the foreseeable future will remain intimately connected with its primary industries. Research and development has received much public attention in Australia in recent years. It is seen by many as a major way of developing new industries, of achieving structural change and growth in the economy and of increasing the productivity and efficiency of existing industries. By international standards the money that Australia spends on research and development is low. The private sector in Australia generally appears to give low priority to research and development spending. </PARA>
<PARA> Research carried out in Australia has made a vital contribution to the superb track record of farmers in improving the efficiency of production. For example, surveys show productivity growth of between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent a year over the past 30 years on Australian sheep farms. Overall agricultural productivity growth over the last 20 years has been 2.8 per cent per annum compared with 2 per cent for manufacturing and one per cent for the economy as a whole. Commodity-specific R&amp; spending is a major component of the total research and development effort. The rural industry research funds are financed by producer levies matched in terms of expenditure by government subsidies. In 1988-89 research expenditure by the relevant rural industry research funds is around $41m for wool, $29m for meat and $8m for wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recently altered administrative and accountability arrangements for commodity-specific R&amp; by establishing research councils or corporations to develop plans and budgets and set R&amp; priorities. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is the main organisation doing relatively long-term research for Australian rural industries, especially in developing new technologies and products and where problems or opportunities exist at a national level or across State boundaries. Its role is complementary to those of State government departments and universities with whom it collaborates. The Organisation's rural research programs, which absorb close to half its resources, are undergoing a shift in emphasis to align them more closely to the needs of farm based industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Improvements in productivity off-farm are at least as important as those on-farm. Both process and product innovations are important sources of improved productivity beyond the farm gate. A good example of product innovation is the development of a means of giving machine washability characteristics to wool. Examples of process innovations are computerised selling of livestock and improvements in the retailing and processing of food. These types of innovations, along with increased farm productivity, contribute significantly to reducing the real cost of food to consumers while also providing higher returns to farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> An important source of innovation is the farmers' own experimentation. In an environment radically different from Europe, Australian farmers developed local technology based on dry land pastures and extensive livestock and crop production. A good deal of the rural research undertaken in Australia is funded from commodity specific rural industry research funds. These funds are generally sourced from compulsory industry levies matched by government contributions on a dollar for dollar basis. </PARA>
<PARA> An increasingly difficult problem for research managers is deciding on the spread of research projects-whether to continue on a wide front spreading resources even more thinly or to contract to fewer, better resourced but more isolated lines of work. We have to take into account the need to retain key disciplinary skills that are needed to keep abreast of and to exploit advances occurring elsewhere in the world. Once lost, such skills cannot be easily replaced. Recently gene shear technology was lost to France because funds could not be found to keep development of the project in Australia. These are the sorts of things that must not be allowed to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate on investment in research is intimately connected with the question of how much the market or industry should influence the nature and direction of the research. This Bill highlights the emphasis this Government places on ensuring that all possible assistance is provided to maintain high level of research and development in the primary industry area. This Government is committed to keeping the agricultural sector of our economy at the leading edge in world markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his address at the 1988 National Agricultural Outlook Conference on behalf of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Dr Donald summarised the need for research in the following way:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our agriculture is fragile and we need a major research effort to overcome problems in our agricultural resource base if we are not to go backwards. Indeed, the enormous potential of agriculture will not be recognised without maintaining a strong base of appropriate and up-to-date research skills and a climate in which original ideas can flourish. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that summarises the need for maintaining a strong research effort in Australia, particularly in the agricultural area. Since this debate seems to have been truncated so much, I would like very quickly to look at three points in the agricultural research area. The first is the Government's poor record in supporting rural research in many specific areas. The second is the growing problem of the mismatch of funds for specific project funds to the core funding that maintains the basic research facilities and the personnel. The third is the growing desire of this Government to go into short term research and its effort to try to pick winners. </PARA>
<PARA> To support the first point, in a booklet entitled Today's Research-Australia's Future CSIRO stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the five year period from 1983/84 to 1987/88, CSIRO's agricultural research effort declined by 13.5 per cent, while that in State departments declined by only four per cent. Complete figures are not available for tertiary institutions over this period, but in the four years from 1984-85 to 1987/88 their effort in agricultural research declined by three per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in all areas there was a decline in agricultural research over that period-a period which is wholly covered by this Government's stewardship. I think that highlights at least in some areas, and in very important areas, where this Government has failed to support agricultural research. To reinforce that I refer honourable members to the CSIRO Division of Soils annual report for 1988. The Chief of the Division stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it has now experienced a cumulative reduction in government funds over the past six years of close to 30%. As a result Treasury funded staff numbers have declined from 190 to 150. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, soil scientists are being sacked at the same time as Federal and State governments are pushing the problems of soil degradation. It seems totally irreconcilable with the Government's claim that it is concerned about land degradation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point that has to be made is that we have a growing problem in the mismatch of funds. As was pointed out in a recent report of the Victorian Government from the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science, there is a growing problem where research councils of various commodities are trying to get State and other research centres to do the research but, in many cases, there are insufficient personnel and resources in what we might call the core funding area of these research centres. Accordingly, in some cases their research efforts are falling short. This was also highlighted by Professor Lloyd when he did his rural economic study in 1985. He offered one option as to how this problem might be addressed, but it is something that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) ought to be looking at seriously because it is a growing problem. As I pointed out, the other problem is the difficulty in a government trying to pick winners. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members of the words of Sir Gustav Nossal, who is one of Australia's leading research directors in the medical area. In 1982 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Who, for example, addressing the future of medical science a scant decade ago, would have predicted the stunning impact that recombinant DNA research (i.e. genetic engineering) would have on virtually every facet of biomedical investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, this highlights the problem of the Government trying to go for short term research and pick winners. The Opposition is very concerned at the Government's approach to research and the way it seems to be cutting back on funds for places like the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, although the other day it had no difficulty in providing at least $13m a year for the next 5 years for Kodak, an industry that is earning only a fraction of the amount of export income that rural industries are earning. Unfortunately, because of the short time available to me, I cannot expand on those points, but there are a couple of very serious points involved that I think the Minister ought to be addressing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond very quickly to the points made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd); and I will refer specifically to his second reading amendment and some of the amendments he has foreshadowed. I also want to make a few points about the amendments that I will be moving in the committee stage. Also, if time permits I shall address the comments made by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). First, in respect of the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, this is a broad amendment and the honourable member was at pains to point out that principally it concerns the dairy industry. I think people in the honey industry have the same sort of view on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been approached by the Australian Dairy Farmers Association and I understand what they are on about. I must say that I see some reasons why this measure makes sense. One of the chief reasons is that when the 0.5 per cent contribution level is reached, after which the Government's matching funding ceases-not that the dairy industry is anywhere near that-this will be a way of getting ongoing funds. However, I have been uttering a few words lately about consistent policy, to try to get a consistent basis to policy. We have just had a strategic planning review of research organisations and we have been giving this whole question a lot of thought. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, the reason why I finally came down on not accepting what the dairy industry was enjoining me to do was the definition of whether it is a primary or manufacturing industry. Even if we wipe out any possibility of double dipping, which the industry does not want to be part of-and the amendment makes that quite clear-there is a definitional problem of whether cereal manufacturers can therefore contribute to wheat growers' funds, whether they are manufacturers or not. There is going to be a problem that perhaps the fiscal fiends in this town will say that farmers will pull back if money can be obtained through the dairy co-operatives, or whatever. The basis of the reason why I have been able to get vastly increased funds for research is that primary industries are atomistic. There is a quarantining and scrutiny problem that goes along with the definitional problem, and there is a problem with dollars that have strings attached to particular research projects and whether some of the research projects would have strings and thereby only go back to the firm providing the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> On balance, the Government will have to reject the second reading amendment. I understand the arguments fully. As I said, it was a very split decision in my own mind once I had this approach. In terms of the amendments foreshadowed, I have indicated that the Government will accept two of those amendments. I think there were 16 originally, and I understand that the honourable member will move those in the committee stage. The reason for my accepting those two amendments is that basically what they are saying is that when the Minister has approved the annual operational plan and all the rest of it, someone lets those involved know, and I have no objection to that. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the rest of the committee stage amendments that the honourable member was going to move-and I anticipate that they will still be moved in the Senate-there is a lot of nit-picking. Many of these matters relate to line relationships in a way, and a lot reflect the views from the farming fraternity, where it appears that they still do not quite understand the whole nature of what I am trying to put in place here-namely, the development of strategic relationships. I am insisting on consultation, but I still believe that at the end of the day we have to leave it up to the boards of the various research and development corporations; otherwise, it can very rapidly come back to some mindless farmer control because they put up the funds or half the funds. I really am insistent that there be proper consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, as long as the proper strategic relationships are struck and the concept of accountability sinks in a lot further, we can achieve what the honourable member desires through his amendments. I give the honourable member the assurance that I will give his amendments further consideration. There is one other amendment that I was nearly prepared to accept, but there was a problem with it. However, we may be able to reach an accommodation in the Senate on one other. </PARA>
<PARA> My amendments allow for the transfer of outstanding moneys owed by the Commonwealth to research and development corporations, R &amp;D funds and research councils. The moneys are to be paid to R &amp;D corporations and R &amp;D funds following transfer of the relevant levies. Such outstanding payments usually arise because of the 30-day delay between the Commonwealth seeking levies and the payment by the Commonwealth taking effect. The amendments also allow for the Governor-General to consider the recommendations of industry representative organisations prior to determining that the Bill's provisions regarding annual general meetings will apply to a particular R &amp;D corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a case for direct accountability of stakeholders at annual general meetings as a principal means of accountability for a specific industry. However, I recognise that, as with other industries, accountability of executive organisations which represent stakeholders may be more appropriate. The Government will determine a particular accountability mechanism to apply to each R &amp;D corporation in agreement with the relevant industry. The Government does not intend to impose annual general meetings on industries and the amendment will ensure that this is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) raised a question about the Coal Research and Development Corporation. Quite frankly, at this stage I give him the assurance that I will take the Industry's views into account, and the views that have been expressed by the industry and the honourable member will be assessed further. The key thing in respect of coal is the fact that it is the largest export industry in the world, and its future is critical to the Australian economy, but relative to its size it is only a small funder of research and development. I am trying to put the levy which will go on to 1992 into a research corporation. That will be under industry control and industry direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, by making the industry focus on the direction of those funds rather than having a bit of bureaucracy as is the case at present, it will engage in strategic research. It will be very much a testing base for the future as to whether or not there is an ongoing role for research in this very important industry. The alternative is to have it go back to the department. The industry points out, as did the honourable member for Gippsland, that the Government will not provide any money in this area. I point out-and this bears on some of the points made by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker)-that with the science and technology statement we are upgrading research in quite a few areas, one of which will be in the National Energy Research and Development Corporation. That, with the moneys for greenhouse research, for example, which has direct relevance to the coal industry, becomes a pivotal point because all that money comes from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> So, we are trying to provide a higher profile for coal research and development. We are trying to provide greater financial flexibility and commercial powers. After 1992 the corporation and levy mechanism will be reviewed in consultation with the industry. It will place the control of R &amp;D directions for the coal industry in the hands of the coal industry through representative organisation provisions, accountability provisions and selection arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is basically a housekeeping Bill. A number of my colleagues will make detailed comments about specific provisions in this Bill. Its principal purposes are the extension from 30 June 1991 to 30 June 1993 of the 150 per cent research and development deduction scheme and to 30 June 1995 of a reduced rate of 125 per cent, and a number of other minor changes relating to the concessional taxation treatment of research and development expenditure. In addition, there are modifications to the basis for calculating franking credits, provision for exemption from income tax for the pay and allowance of Defence Force personnel while in Namibia, amendments to the treatment of capital gains tax in relation to long term leases, provisions to allow tax deductions for expenditure incurred by those who stood for election to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, provisions for the termination of the 100 per cent deduction for certain subscription moneys paid into initial shares of licensed management and investment companies, modification of requirements for employees to substantiate eligible transport payments, and a number of minor changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of my colleagues will focus their comments on specific provisions of the Bill. I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment in two parts. The first part focuses on the Government's record of taxation, and the second part is in lieu of a committee stage amendment which this deplorable process of guillotining legislation does not really allow time for. I have incorporated that as the second part of my second reading amendment. I emphasise the fact that I think this guillotine process is absolutely appalling and shows the incapacity of this Government to manage its affairs and the affairs of this House in an appropriate manner. Yesterday it squandered several hours rather than taking on issues as they were raised in the House. Generally as a long-term phenomenon the Government has an appalling record of incompetence in terms of House management. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's record on taxation is unequalled. It stands as the highest taxing government in the history of Australia, with total tax revenue in this year, 1989-90, forecast to be 25 per cent of gross domestic product, having been as high as 25.2 per cent of GDP two and three years ago. This is a pretty outstanding record for a Government that claims to be a tax reform government. It claims to have reduced the burden of tax on the average Australian. The fact is that only those who have incomes above $35,000 have gained much at all under this Government in terms of tax relief; there has been a very heavy concentration of any benefits-and they are not great benefits-at the upper end of the income scale. The maximum rate of tax today cuts in at $35,000, as it did in the early 1970s. That level is 11/4 times average weekly earnings; in the early 1970s it was five times average weekly earnings. It has deteriorated rapidly in recent years. For example, somebody who has an income of 80 per cent of average weekly earnings is today on a 39c marginal rate. When this Government came into office they were on a 30c marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA> If we listened to the rhetoric of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) we would be inclined to believe that the Government has reduced tax burdens on average Australians and that he has given back all that he has raised by way of inflation and bracket creep in the form of tax cuts. That proposition which he has put in this Parliament on a number of occasions is totally without foundation. If we do the exercise correctly and go back to the tax scales that prevailed from November 1982 onwards and we index those, we find that there is a net tax increase of $131/2 billion cumulative over the life of this Government over and above the tax cuts that it has given. That is, instead of Budget revenues being today somewhere around the low $90 billion mark, they would be around $80 billion or less, a substantial rip-off from the average Australian, a substantial increase in Government revenue and in the size of the public sector. On a number of occasions since we released our Economic Action Plan, we have asked whether the Government was prepared to match our commitment to give back bracket creep on an annual basis; that is, in each Budget we will announce an estimate for bracket creep for the previous financial year and we will announce how it will be given back. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see any such inclination on the part of the Government. Indeed, some of the answers which were given today by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) in relation to his claim for a new wage-tax package to be brought down next year implied that the Government was going to rely very heavily on bracket creep. As I said, the bottom line has been a $13.5 billion net increase in tax revenue through bracket creep alone. The Government prides itself on its having given tax cuts from 1 July this year. What bracket creep means in this financial year alone, according to estimates by Access Economics, is that roughly 50 per cent of those 1 July tax cuts will be clawed back within this financial year and within two financial years they will be more than clawed back. </PARA>
<PARA> The key point I wanted to focus on in terms of the Government's record is this tendency to do wage-tax deals. It has now emerged as a central element of taxation in Australia that taxation policy is substantially predetermined by the senior members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), in particular Bill Kelty and Simon Crean in recent days, through their role as de facto Cabinet Ministers under the Hawke-Keating Government. These wage-tax deals are supposed to provide the wherewithal for the control of inflation; they are supposed to provide the mechanism by which the Government can bring down inflation and keep it under control. I am fascinated that in the various manifestations of the accord over the last several years, the rate of inflation has basically stuck in there rock solid at its current level of 8 per cent over most of that period. It has eased a bit and then has accelerated away, depending on the nature of our economic circumstances. Basically, we do not see any prospect under this Government of that inflation rate falling much below 7 or 8 per cent. The centrepiece of that, the floor that exists under it, comes from the wage determination process, from the accord's support of the centralised wage fixing system which pays across the board wage increases that are totally unrelated to productivity. It is that particular system which the Government tries to peddle as the solution to our economic problems which is one of the fundamental reasons for the problems that Australia faces today.</PARA>
<PARA> This week we had the spectacle of the Minister for Social Security breaking ranks and foreshadowing the fact that the Government would be bringing down another wage-tax deal early next year of about the same order of magnitude as the one that was brought down this year, his figure being $5.8 billion. Today we had statements by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the Parliament and yesterday we had statements by Senator Button and Senator Walsh to the effect that no discussions have taken place, although it is not clear whether it is formal or informal discussions which have not taken place. Bill Kelty is quoted in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald as saying that these discussions have taken place; that it has been agreed that there is a wage-tax deal to take place next year; and that it seems that it is to be of about the same order of magnitude as the one this year. Today we had the spectacle of a press release from somebody else from the ACTU who seems to be of the view that a deal is in the offing. That is Errol Hodder, a good friend of the Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, who put out a press release under the heading, `AWU Says Howe Was Right'. In a key point, Mr Hodder said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Treasurer Paul Keating should support the statement by Social Security Minister Brian Howe that the Federal government was looking at repeating this year's $5.8 billion tax and family package next year. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Rather than contradicting each other, Federal Cabinet Ministers must respond positively to the challenge of the Opposition's recently announced economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more with Mr Hodder in that respect. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Since the Liberals announced their new policy, the Government has basically resorted to negative attacks. However, there are many aspects of the policy which will appeal to workers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a key point. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects of the policy which will appeal to workers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA>So, much as the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and others may seek to denigrate our Economic Action Plan, the people who stand to gain most under that plan, the average Australian workers, are out there expressing their point of view in a very blatant way and expressing substantial support for what we have done. Mr Hodder also said that workers had for many years accepted the need for wage restraint and were now looking for wage increases and interest rate relief. Of course, we know that the policies being pursued by the Hawke-Keating Government cannot deliver either in a sustainable sense. When there are wage increases, they are usually unrelated to productivity and are unsustainable. If there is any prospect of interest rate relief-we have not seen any evidence of that yet, at least through to the middle of next year, according to the Treasurer's latest prediction-it will not be sustainable relief either. Until wages are related more directly to productivity and moved more in line with productivity, the Government will not get inflation down. If it cannot get inflation down and keep it under control, it will not get interest rates down and keep them under control. </PARA>
<PARA> Our unit labour costs are roughly double those of our trading partners, which is reflected in the fact that our inflation rate is roughly double that of our trading partners, which in turn is reflected in the fact that our interest rates are roughly double the average of our trading partners, or a little more because of the increasing risk perceived to be associated with Australian dollar assets as reflected in the recent downgrading of our international credit rating by Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service. Mr Hodder went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Instead of pandering to the environment vote, the Prime Minister should be addressing the basic financial difficulties faced by ordinary Australians. The Government will only by re-elected for a fourth term if it acts positively on behalf of its natural constituency. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with that comment. It does not have a hope of being re-elected for a fourth term, but he makes a very valid point about the financial difficulties being faced by ordinary Australians. I conclude with Mr Hodder's very interesting quote:</PARA>
<PARA>If our members are to accept the new wage system-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the most direct and blatant threat we have heard for some time-</PARA>
<PARA>they have to be assured that it will provide meaningful gains for them. It would also help if the Government was seen to be acting on behalf of workers and their families. At the moment, the Government seems to be drifting towards the next election without a clear programme of relief for the very tough times being faced by most Australians. They expect more from a Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, I could not agree more with that statement. The whole of Australia expects more of its government. Australian families and workers are in very difficult economic circumstances. This Government has no effective response. If we take the perspective of Mr Hodder, he is basically saying that his membership was duped a year ago. It was locked into a deal through the ACTU processes under the accord to hold earnings to 6 1/2 per cent, in the Treasurer's expectation as it was put out at Budget time that inflation would fall to 3 or 4 per cent by the middle of 1990. In the last Budget, the Treasurer came out and admitted that inflation was locked in at around 7 1/2 per cent to 8 per cent on his most optimistic forecasts, and there is very little prospect of that being brought under control in the foreseeable future. The Government thought it had locked in a real earnings increase but it had actually locked in a real earnings decline, which is the main reason we are seeing this sort of statement from Mr Hodder today, the main reason the ACTU took so long to accept the principles of the last wage decision and the main reason we are seeing lots of examples of pressure on the wage determination process. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with one specific comment on my foreshadowed motion. I want to draw attention to a particular deficiency in one of the clauses of the Bill relating to long term leases and, in particular, to urge the Government to consider allowing a full cost factor to be taken into account when determining capital gains tax liabilities in relation to subleasing. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) deplores the Government's economic mismanagement and, in particular, its record as the highest taxing government in Australia's post-war history; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on the Government to allow a full cost factor to be taken into account in determining the capital gains tax liability of sub-leasing''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill covers a number of areas but I shall confine my remarks to one aspect tonight and that is the provision dealing with changes to the substantiation rules for travelling allowances paid under industrial awards, which have been increased since 29 October 1986. The law as it now stands provides that the income tax substantiation rules will not apply to claims by employees for fares, car expenses or other transport costs incurred in the course of their employment, so long as their claim is within the limits of an allowance paid to them under an industrial award that was in place on 29 October 1986 and providing that the allowance has not been increased since that date. If the amount of the allowance payable under the award has been increased after 29 October 1986, the employee is generally required to substantiate the whole claim, including the amount payable prior to 29 October 1986. Likewise, if the amount of the claim exceeds the amount of the allowance, then the whole claim is subject to substantiation requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments in the Bill propose to modify these requirements to enable employees to claim a deduction against travel allowance paid pursuant to an industrial award that was in place on 29 October 1989, whether or not that allowance has been increased, without being required to meet the substantiation rules. This will only apply to claims which are not in excess of the amount of the allowance that was payable under the award on 29 October 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Employees wishing to claim a deduction for expenses above the amount of the allowance payable at that date will be required to substantiate additional payments above the amount of the allowance payable under that award. It is proposed that the amendment would apply to expenses incurred on or after 1 July 1988, and the cost is estimated at less than $100,000 per annum. The amendment will remove an artificial barrier which has restricted movement in the rate of transport allowances payable under industrial awards since 1986. I am sure that will be welcomed by the trade union movement, which has had some difficulty amending those awards. The proposed new rules will not apply to reimbursements of car expenses payable on a rate per kilometre basis as these payments will continue to be dealt with under the existing laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Further amendments in the Bill deal with certain matters concerning car records required for substantiation purposes. Under amendments made by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 1988 taxpayers were required by the substantiation provisions of the income tax law to specify or nominate certain matters in their income tax returns. The matters that were required were those relating to claims for car expense deductions, including the business percentage of the claim and/or details of replacement cars, among other details. The 1988 amendments removed the need to put these details in the completed returns of income and, instead, provided that taxpayers kept that information in car records held in their possession. </PARA>
<PARA> Those amendments, though, contained two omissions which this Bill seeks to correct. First, a reference in subparagraph 82ktg (g) (iii) (a) which should have been altered to refer to car records held by the taxpayer was overlooked in the original amending legislation. This reference continued to refer to information specified in the taxpayer's return. Clauses 13 and 29 of this Bill provide a technical amendment which rectifies this matter. The rules relating to car records that were inserted by Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 1988 also omitted to require that the car records be retained by the taxpayer for a specified period. This Bill proposes to require that taxpayers keep the car records for 3 1/2 years from the date the return for that year is lodged or seven years if the car was used to earn non-salary and wages income. The period that records for a particular year must be retained is further extended if the records are relevant to a later year. </PARA>
<PARA> If the car records are lost or destroyed they will be treated in the same way as other records that are lost or destroyed; that is, a replacement document may be acceptable. Transitional arrangements apply for people who may have disposed of their records prior to the introduction of this Bill. They will be able to use a copy of those records or a substitute record, as if they were original car records. It is proposed that the amendments have effect from the same date that the original rules dealing with car records applied-that is, 1 July 1986. Provisions in the Bill prevent taxpayers being disadvantaged by the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is enhancing innovation through creating an environment conducive to investment and profitability. These measures include: taxation measures which foster investment and risk taking; promoting the formation of venture capital markets; and encouraging skill formation and an adequate supply of work force skills. Industrial research and development, and hence industry's capacity to innovate, will be enhanced if the private sector now takes up its part. The development of technology-based industries is expensive and of high risk. It is justified, however, by the potential returns and by the deleterious consequences of not participating in this development. </PARA>
<PARA> Future participation of Australian companies in wealth creation will be enhanced if the resources of the public sector are developed and used to bolster industrial capacity; Australia's many small companies are encouraged to grow; foreign companies play a more active and positive role in research and development in Australia and in the early acquisition of technology by Australian firms; and government agencies act to enhance the participation of Australian companies in global operations, including penetrating overseas markets and participation in international research and development programs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, by extending the concessions and the other amendments it makes, will allow just such steps to be taken. This Government has taken the steps to make sure we are not left behind. It is now up to Australian industry to go the next step and show some faith in Australia and the research and development now taking place in this country to help keep it here for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to touch upon a couple of specific measures in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 but, before I do, I remind the House that this Bill includes 14 separate adjustments to various Acts, including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. If honourable members prefer to break up those measures, which I have counted as one, that will affect research and development deductions for taxation purposes, there are about 21 separate measures in this Bill which is being guillotined through. This Bill was brought before the Parliament on 31 May and has only now been brought before the House for discussion under the guillotine. I do not know whether anyone need go any further to indicate the legislative incompetence of the Government in the way it brings its legislation before the House. This Bill was introduced on 31 May and here we have it for discussion, under the guillotine, towards the end of the Budget session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) might listen to this. I am not being critical of him, but I also want to refer, amongst other things, to substantiation requirements. I think what I have to say might help him in advising his constituents because, as he has rightly pointed out, one of the measures in this Bill involves changes to substantiation requirements. An exemption has hitherto applied to substantiation claims for deductable expenses against allowances in industrial awards nominated or known as transport allowances in those awards; that is, awarded allowances for travel to and from places of work did not have to be substantiated for tax deductability purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The first and most important point of interest about the administration of the principal Act in this connection is that this exemption did not apply to any other sectors of the work force. The cost of travelling to and from work generally is not deductable for tax purposes. Only the privileged few who were lucky enough to be covered by an award which designated the cost of travelling to and from work as an entitlement have had their travelling expenses deemed deductable. In political terms, that discrimination against the bulk of the taxpaying work force and in favour of a minority of unionists is a pay-off-nothing more and nothing less-to the lords and masters of this Labor Government in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). </PARA>
<PARA> However dodgy and however deplorable, that might just have been another example of this Government's abuse of power. I say `might' because public perceptions of the standards of propriety expected under Labor governments, State and Federal, have fallen in line with the very standards set by those governments. Regrettably, there is even more to it than that. The present discrimination is not written into the Act. The Government did not make an up-front decision and, with courage, state publicly and for all to see that it would treat awarded transport allowances in a way which conferred privilege on a comparative few. It did not do so, presumably, because that would have been too straightforward and honest. </PARA>
<PARA> How did it go about it? What craven device was employed to get the result the Government had to deliver at the behest of its ACTU masters? It got the Australian Commissioner of Taxation to do its dirty work once again. What else? Never mind that such allowances paid by employers to employees are included in the definition of salary and wages in section 26 (e) of the principal Act and are therefore subject to tax and tax instalment deductions. A way had to be found around that and, of course, the Commissioner obliged. The means by which the Commissioner obliged was not too difficult to find, although it is usually used to persecute taxpayers rather than provide tax relief-albeit the narrow, selective tax relief in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Surprise surprise: the Commissioner drew on his vast discretionary powers, this time those granted in section 221d. Section 221d of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 gives the Commissioner the right to vary the amounts to be deducted from the salary or wages of an employee or class of employees. To give this discretionary right a format, guidelines are issued. However, the guidelines issued by the Commissioner are issued by none other than the Commissioner himself-the relevant ones in this case being IT2487 and IT2488. Subparagraphs 4 (c) in the first and 5 (c) in the latter stipulate that variations may be granted upon a request being made by an organisation or association, or by individuals. It was as a consequence of variation requests to alter the general rules laid down in the Act that the discrimination to which I have referred arose. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill it is intended to amend the principal Act relating to award transport allowances. The favoured few will not lose an exclusive benefit, although entitlements are to be modified. Section 82kz (8a) is to be changed so that substantiation rules will no longer be a matter decided at the discretion of the Commissioner. In future, substantiation rules will not apply to claims for tax deductable expenses against an award transport allowance as that allowance stood at 29 October 1986, even if the allowance has been subsequently increased. To give an illustration, building trades awards provided a fares and travelling allowance of $7.60 a day as at 29 October 1986. It is intended that a building worker taxpayer will not be required to substantiate claims of up to $7.60 a day, even though the daily award allowance has since been increased to at least $8.70 the last time I looked, and maybe more. However, if a building worker in future claims in excess of the $7.60 daily allowance, that taxpayer will have to substantiate all deductions claimed against that allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the point I want to bring to the attention of the honourable member for Oxley because he might find that he will have a few complaints. For example, if a building worker taxpayer were to claim the present allowance of $8.70 a day as fully deductable, the same taxpayer would have to substantiate the entire $8.70 and not just $1.10 as might be expected. With the passage of this amendment an ambush will be in place for the unwary worker taxpayer who, out of ignorance, does as in the past and claims the entire award transport allowance. He or she will be bound to substantiate the lot. The chances of any worker having kept the necessary records will be very remote indeed when the not so friendly tax man confronts the affected taxpayer. The chances are that most will be required to pay tax on the full allowance at the appropriate marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, employers will presumably have to deduct pay as you earn instalments on, in the example given, the $1.10 a day difference between the October 1986 award transport allowance and the one currently being paid. That is a dog's dinner of an arrangement if ever there was one-and all in the name of what? It is in the name of favoured treatment demanded by the ACTU and cravenly accepted by this Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> Another provision in the Bill under consideration is a requirement that copies of employment declaration forms be retained by employers for a year after the details declared have ceased to have any relevance. Until now, after the end of a financial year when new forms are received for the current year, the old ones could be discarded. That is quite sensible because old forms and the information contained in them are useless and superseded in the hands of employers. To keep them for another year would involve unnecessary and wasteful administration costs. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, Australian taxation offices (ATOs) were, and are still to be, provided with the original of those forms. The ATOs already have them. Given reasonable efficiency and information retrieval systems, the ATOs could extract declared information if such was required about any employee. In future, with tax file number legislation in place and promised efficiency permeating all ATOs, such efficiency should be there for the asking-at the press of a button, so to speak. That is not to be. It is wishful thinking, I am afraid. </PARA>
<PARA> The wonderful progress we were led to believe tax file number law represented cannot even address access to information as fundamental and readily available as that given to ATOs in employment declaration forms. Not to worry, the Treasurer is not one to let his own lack of administrative excellence lead him to require the Commissioner to improve his game. As so often is the case, the solution is to foist the responsibility on to his unpaid tax collectors who are the long suffering employers. Never mind that hitherto, in pre-tax file number days, and in future, employers were and will be bound to collect and file with the ATOs declaration forms for each and every employee under pain of considerable penalty for an employer's non-compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner's operatives cannot be expected to dig up this information if the need arises. If his sleuths need it or use the new requirement in the course of an investigation of the premises of an employer to harass that employer because the need is unlikely to be known, given past practices, another obscure imposition becomes another bargaining chip in the hands of the ATO and its delegates. </PARA>
<PARA> It is reasonable to conjecture in this way. It is reasonable, if only because there is not one single word or sentence in either the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) or the explanatory memorandum which tells us why employers across the country should keep, for another year, millions upon millions of employment declaration forms in storage on their premises, presumably so some incompetent can demand that one or all of them be produced on some whim or pretext. The Government tells us clearly enough what must be done in future but not why. What is the big secret? One would think that if it is worth doing it is worth giving reasons which can be debated and discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is ever happy enough to have the wool pulled over his eyes when it comes to administration of tax Acts, for which he alone is ultimately responsible. He has in the past shown a disregard for the niceties by failing to lodge his personal return within the statutory limit and getting off scot-free-although that is another story-along with claiming an unlivable house as his principal place of residence in order to claim tax-free travel allowance even though he lives with his family in Canberra. It does show he has the ability to take advantage of his privileged position. It also demonstrates that he has the wit, but not the inclination, to see fair play in the administration of the tax collection process. The Treasurer's ready compliance with what is asked of him by the Commissioner of Taxation or his bureaucrats, without question and without giving reasons to the Parliament, can only be due to either his ignorance or his arrogance. Either way, it is not a pretty picture. It is indicative of a laxity on the part of the pre-eminent fiscal fiend in the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset in this debate, which is concerned with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), I would like to put on the record once again the fact that the whingeing we have heard from those on the Opposition side about the guillotine being applied would not have occurred had the Opposition not wasted hours and hours of the Parliament's time over the last couple of days with absolute nonsense, spurious motions and decisions to try to suspend standing orders and just waste the time of people having to come in here and vote on those sorts of issues. A number of the aspects of the taxation laws in this legislation will go to the continuing drive of this Government to clean up the tax system. It makes it fairer; it makes it more operable; it cuts out all the rorts in the taxation system; and it goes to the very heart of some of the real concerns out there in the community. Tonight I will dwell on one or two of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that the shadow spokesman on science and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), is here. I have no doubt that in his contribution he will refer to the research and development activities and the fact that in this legislation the dispensation for the 150 per cent deduction scheme will be extended to 30 June 1993 and the 125 per cent deduction scheme will operate until 30 June 1995. Clearly, one of the things that have been an impediment to this country's continued development has been the inability of Australian companies, once they have developed a level of expertise in industry, to market it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give some examples. There is a technology corporation at the University of Wollongong. It was started with an injection of funds by the Commonwealth Government under the steel regions assistance program. It is now operating successfully as an opportunity for incubator industries to develop and to get involved in research, technology and development initiatives for Australia. Recently one such program was so successful that unfortunately the university could not afford to carry it any longer. It had to seek capital from another source in the economy-in this case, the State Bank in New South Wales, which purchased a majority shareholding in that particular company. As a result of that, it has recently provided an immediate injection of further funds, not only to establish the company in a much bigger entity, with quite a number of additional staff being employed, but also for research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation they will get the taxation benefit, but what they are doing is providing state of the art technology, research and development, in electronic document transfer. That is where it is going to be in that particular area in the future. It is a very important step. So I would certainly say that, as part of the Government's science statement put out in May of this year, this particular part of the legislation, which does give the accelerated tax deductability, will be found to be an extremely important component in extending the ability of Australian companies to get involved in research and development activities. We can no longer afford to have technology developed by Australian companies within this university setting, within the research and development capabilities of companies themselves, being taken offshore simply because there is a lack of finance, a lack of forethought or a lack of ability of companies to meet commitments. I think that this accelerated tax deductability, as I have said, will go some way to looking after it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk very briefly about another couple of issues; firstly, the piece of the legislation that goes to election expenses. Of course, what we are doing is simply tidying up the system in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) as it applies to the rest of Australia. We are making available and claimable here deductions by candidates seeking election to the Legislative Assembly for the ACT. This is again extending a piece of the legislation which is extremely significant. It should apply in the Australian Capital Territory, particularly now that the ACT has moved to a system of self-government. Candidates, whether for the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party, the Party! Party! Party! Party, the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Residents Rally, or whoever it might be to stand for election in this Territory, can rightly now claim those election expenses incurred while seeking election. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally in the short time that is being made available to me tonight, I would like to go to the issue of the tax file number. What we are doing here is amending the Bill so that it will now be a requirement that a copy of an employment declaration be retained by an employer until the close of the income year after the income year during which the declaration ceases to have effect. Amendments are also being made to ensure that the tax file numbers are recorded on group certificates and tax check sheets issued for eligible termination payments where the numbers are quoted to the payer on a form provided for that purpose. There will be a negligible effect on revenue as far as the Government is concerned, so any of those nonsensical comments about highest taxing, biggest spending government in Australia's history certainly do not apply in this case. Tidying up the tax file number system, which has clearly been one of the major advances put forward by this Government, to clamp down on the abuse of the taxation system, is going again to prove to be a boon to the taxation administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say-and a thought just came to me-that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution on this legislation being put forward by this Government to tidy up the tax system, to make it fairer, to stamp out the rorts and eliminate the tax cheats in the system again put forward this catchcry of the Opposition that the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers are in some way the bully boys of the Government, going out there and forever chasing down the last dollar. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has spoken at length in this place about the numerous attempts to bludgeon the public servants of this country that are doing their jobs on behalf of a government elected by the people of this country and who will continue doing their jobs whatever government happens to be in power after the next election. I fully believe that those continual attacks on the propriety of public servants in this country, those in the Australian Taxation Office and the Tax Commissioner in particular, are to be deplored. They are nothing short of appalling. The legislation will make an appropriate continuing attack in the process of tidying up the tax system. It will make the system fairer and a much better system. The legislation certainly deserves the support of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Inter alia, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 seeks changes to the 150 per cent tax deduction scheme for company research and development. The scheme has been in place since July 1985 and the Bill before the House this morning intends to extend the scheme's life and broaden the grounds for deductability for appropriate expenditure incurred after 20 November 1987. The extension of the tax concession will have a massive financial impact in regard to revenue forgone by the Commonwealth. The extension of the deduction in the manner I have described will cost the Commonwealth $200m in each of the years 1992 to 1993 and $120m in each of the years 1994 to 1995 and 1995 to 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All up, the extension of the research and development tax concession scheme will cost $640m. The decision by the Government to extend the research and development tax concession is not a matter to be taken lightly by this Parliament. Financial commitments of this magnitude require closer scrutiny by the Parliament. If one calculates the sum of the revenue forgone over the life of the scheme from 1985 to 1995-96, it amounts to well over $1 billion. In fact, the sum of anticipated natural forgone revenue associated with the scheme over its life will be about $1.2 billion, the period 1985 to 1988 having cost $510m, while it is anticipated that the amount forgone for the period 1989 to 1995 will be $640m. </PARA>
<PARA> With a financial impact of this magnitude it is vital that the community and those supporters of the scheme in particular understand that the Opposition is duty bound to scrutinise closely the public benefit involved in the extension of the concession. While it is tempting indeed to join with the Government in accepting the legislation as it is in respect of the research and development tax scheme, the Opposition's own policy position adopts a more responsible position by far. </PARA>
<PARA> In accepting the need for the scheme to continue until at least June of 1991 we will, when in government, carry out a thorough and objective review of the concessional treatment of research and development before committing ourselves to its further extension. As this House will know, the scheme's early administration was seriously questioned by the Auditor-General as well as by the Industry Research and Development Board. The Auditor-General found that the scheme was open to abuse by those creative accountants seeking tax avoidance measures. Amongst the Auditor-General's specific concern was that syndicates buying into research and development were seeking eligibility for the concession on very spurious grounds indeed. Some of these syndicates were investing significant sums of money in areas of technological innovation which actually entail very little risk indeed but broadly met the eligibility criteria for the tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to find that recently the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) proposed amendments to the legislation governing the 150 per cent tax scheme which seek to close off avenues through which syndicated research and development can divest itself of risk taking in relation to the concessional scheme. I am curious to know how extensive the misuse of the incentive scheme was over the years between the inception of the scheme and the rulings on eligibility. Such abuses which have led to these actions having been taken have not served the Parliament's confidence in the scheme at all well. Such confidence also took a beating from the Industry Research and Development Board's own report of the operation of the scheme. In that report of last March, the Board questioned, on pages 6 and 14, the capacity of our industry within the context of its present level of infrastructure to successfully commercialise those innovations which do emerge from the industry research and development process. </PARA>
<PARA> The volume of management skills and the amounts of venture capital available within the Australian economy have served to undermine the effectiveness of the tax concession scheme. Scepticism has also been rife amongst our scientific community, which is concerned by the hard evidence regarding the scheme's track record in creating jobs and projects in their fields of research. I consider this to be fair comment by the scientific community. As the science statement of 8 May 1989 was predicated on the extension of the 150 per cent tax concession scheme, the scientists have every right to see the scheme have a significant job project return. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister capped this debate when it first broke out as a result of the concerns of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) divisional chiefs, but since then the debate has run through the pages of the science-orientated press. One such study published in June this year seriously questioned the claims by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce that the scheme had created 12,500 new and real jobs in science. The divisional chiefs of CSIRO contended that this figure was blown out by the tendency of the Government to count existing jobs which had been redefined to meet the deductability criteria for the scheme. The study, as published in the June edition of Search, contended that there was little empirical evidence that the scheme itself had been responsible for job growth in science. </PARA>
<PARA> One could contend that such expanded opportunities as there were for scientists might well have come about just as readily if the tax concession scheme had not been in place. My point is that we need to judge the effectiveness of the scheme more thoroughly before the coalition commits itself to a costly extension of the concession into the mid-1990s. The central problem facing Parliament on the matter of the extension of the scheme is the extent to which the 150 per cent tax concession is in itself actually making a dramatic change to the rates of R &amp;D being carried out by industry and whether or not the results of this R &amp;D are being commercialised to a degree which warrants the massive outlays associated with its extension. </PARA>
<PARA> These are complex issues requiring close evaluation. I remind the House of the size of the number that we are dealing with here. In the period 1985-88, private sector R &amp;D rose from $646m in 1984-85 to $1.07 billion in 1986-87. This was a net increase of $423m in investment in R &amp;D in the two years to the end of 1986-87. This was achieved at a cost to the Government of $310m. Assuming that the R &amp;D result for business over this period was a direct result of the concessional scheme, for an outlay of $310m we got $423m in increased business R &amp;D. I consider that only a slight achievement at best and one well worth examining further in order to ascertain the full effect of any possible multiplier. </PARA>
<PARA> To be sure, there have been modest increases off a small base in industry R &amp;D in recent years. We are slowly rebuilding our industry R &amp;D rates back to where they were in the 1960s, following the slump of the past 20 years, which saw our R &amp;D effort reduced by more than half. On the most recent statistics for the period 1987-88, business now carries out R &amp;D at a rate equivalent to 0.45 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). This is a continuation of the upward trend since 1984-85, when the corresponding figure was 0.34 per cent of GDP. Though moving off these shallow bases, the average real rates of increase in business R &amp;D for 1984-85 to 1986-87 was about 19 per cent. Owing to the October 1987 stock market collapse this rate collapsed in the year 1987-88 to only 5.6 per cent. The average real growth rate for private sector R &amp;D over the period 1985-88 is therefore 14.9 per cent, on Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Though we have been able to sustain some moderate growth in our business enterprise R &amp;D, it is difficult to do any more than correlate these trends with the existence of the 150 per cent tax scheme. This is especially so when we note that business enterprise R &amp;D was already on a reasonably healthy road to recovery in the period before the introduction of the scheme. In 1984-85 the annual real growth rate had reached almost 18 per cent in an unassisted environment. Even allowing for some of the anomalies in this figure, a comparatively substantial private sector R &amp;D push was in evidence before the scheme took effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, these rates of real growth might seem impressive but they are a good distance from the compounding 25 per cent annual real growth rates which the report of the Australian Science and Technology Council (AUSTEC) entitled Improving Australia's competitiveness through industrial R &amp;D claimed must be maintained into the 1990s if we were just to meet the 1987 level of comparable Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations. We needed a 25 per cent annual real growth rate. What we need then is an evaluation of the effect of the 150 per cent tax scheme which provides clear lines of casual connection. </PARA>
<PARA> Business R &amp;D was already on an upward trend in the early to mid-1980s, so it is tempting to dissociate the continuation of that trend from the possible catalytic effect of the scheme, but even more questions need to be asked of our overall approach to R &amp;D. Can our present industry infrastructure and levels of structural change sustain even the rates of R &amp;D that ASTEC claimed were essential, just to reach a point of comparable competitiveness? Why is it possible for unassisted business R &amp;D rates in 1968-69 to be higher than they are now if it were not for the changed economic climate?</PARA>
<PARA> Ought we to be grafting our R &amp;D policies to areas of the economy such as the primary sector which have the cash flow to engender a substantial and tangible R &amp;D effort? It is my understanding that European countries facing similar problems in regard to establishing a greater private sector led R &amp;D effort have pursued this approach with some success. We need to know whether targeting of this type is superior to across-the-board industry concession such as the tax concession here under consideration by the House. </PARA>
<PARA> In drawing to a conclusion, I point out that as a result of these outstanding concerns, and before throwing its lot in with the Government's plans to extend the 150 per cent research and development tax scheme out of the mid-1990s, the Opposition will seek to undertake a review of that scheme. This is especially necessary in the context of the recent admission by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce that his industry policy has failed and he does not know what to do next. </PARA>
<PARA> It might well be timely for the coalition, when in government, to reconsider innovative measures for effecting real change to the way industry responds to opportunities for research and development. Moreover, the community must be guaranteed that the huge sums of money involved in the tax concession actually return a suitable public worth, and there are no better ways of targeting the scheme at hand. As I have said, I think the very existence of the scheme is a testament to the failings of the Government's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were not a fact that Australian companies were paying higher interest rates by far than our regional competitors-20 per cent plus here compared with between 3 and 6 per cent regionally- and if it were not for the fact that industry laboured under high rates of inflation and low levels of productivity the very problems the scheme is seeking to correct would not exist. The incentive for industry to invest in its own future is not provided in the legislation before the House tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow such a determined bulldog as the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). I suggest that next time one of his staffers writes a speech he should read it before he gets in here. The honourable member for Gippsland suggested that the Opposition was very concerned about leakage of revenue through this scheme. The Government believes that a platform needs to be put under research and development. It is the launching pad for restructuring Australia's economy. This legislation is an essential arm of that. I accept the causal relationships mentioned by the honourable member in his speech but, whether or not they are the case, it is clear that this is a policy structure which is readily endorsed by those involved in research and development and it is certainly something that I would support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's approach and what will it do? The ubiquitous review. That is the Opposition's solution. If the Opposition came into government, and God forbid that it should happen, we would have the ubiquitous review. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) rabbited on about how the Government was the captive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and therefore substantiation in some areas was not applied equally across the board. Of course, he is a recipient of the advantages of substantiation as a member of this place. So is there not a small degree of hypocrisy in that cry from the honourable member? His suggestion that substantiation be removed is an indication of the fiscal discipline which the Opposition is able to apply when it comes to taxation revenue. Clearly, while he may parrot the assertion in respect of the Government and its relationship with the union movement, it would be fair for us to say that there is the possibility of significant leakage of revenue for those who are friends of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to repeat the debate about the capital gains tax. I mentioned it first in this House last week. However, it is clear that the Opposition's policy on the capital gains tax is an embarrassment to it because it has not really been well thought through. I have not heard one Opposition member defend the philosophical background of that change in this place. The Opposition says in its Economic Action Plan:</PARA>
<PARA> This should particularly help smaller business-</PARA>
<PARA>I accept that that may be the case-</PARA>
<PARA> and encourage longer term investment and savings. </PARA>
<PARA>I refute that suggestion but if it is the case I plead with the Opposition to tell me how the retrospective nature of that tax will affect that aim. Simply, it cannot. Those decisions which were made up to five years ago cannot in any way be affected in the long term by the retrospective nature with which the Opposition intends to introduce this taxation measure. That is very clear to those of us on this side of the House. I will not put it any more simply than this: many friends of the Opposition, the one per cent of taxpayers who will pay capital gains tax, will benefit from this decision. There are many, amongst them John Elliott, who will benefit from the decision who had a say in its making. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax has become part of the landscape of taxation in this country. It is an issue which is accepted by many of us in this place and by the general population. It provides equity. I am sure the honourable member for Curtin would understand one of the old adages in respect of taxation: income is income is income. Whether it is income from rent, from wages, from interest, from profits, or from dividends, it should be treated in the same way. If one makes a real profit on a capital gain over time, it is income at the time it is realised and it should be treated as such. I do not think there is any shying away from that aspect of the proposal that the Opposition has put forward. It will create inefficiencies. It will open up the possibility for the tax avoidance industry to thrive as it previously did. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other elements in the legislation which go to improving and tightening the area of revenue collection for the Government. There are proposals in respect of the tax file number and substantiation, which I believe most of us in this place would support. I notice also that there is a provision to provide an exemption from paying income tax on the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force personnel while allotted for duty in Namibia. On Sunday I will be attending the War Veterans' Home's remembrance services in my electorate. I have no doubt that many of those who live in that home in Menora will believe that this is something they would agree to. Surely those who are serving this country in Namibia deserve some consideration and extra benefits. There is provision within this legislation for exemption of taxation on income tax for pay and allowances of those who are serving in Namibia. The shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), would endorse this position. I know that he has spoken many times in this place for the veterans whom he purports to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, while the legislation represents an omnibus piece of government policy a whole number of areas are being reduced. We regret the late hour at which it is now being debated. We regret the curtailing of the debate that has become necessary. It needs to be understood by those who are listening-the galleries are not full-that yesterday in this place we had 24 divisions, taking up four minutes each. Hours of debating time was wasted on Opposition shenanigans. Those people who sit on the other side in unction and humbug and suggest that it is the Government's fault that we are here now should look at themselves and the way in which they have behaved over the last few days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) which was brought into the House last May. We are debating it under a guillotine. This is a reflection on the way in which this Government manages its business. It is a Bill which when all is said and done is fiddling around the edges of the whole taxation situation. There are a couple of important components but it does not in any way address the point which is made in the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). He drew attention to the fact that he deplored the Government's economic mismanagement and, in particular, its record as the highest taxing government in Australia's postwar history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have only to look at the figures. If we compare 1982-83, the last year of the Fraser Government, with the projected 1989-90 estimates we will find that revenue has gone up from $44.4 billion in total to $97 billion. That is a massive 123 per cent increase over that period in which the rise in the price index will be in the vicinity of 85 per cent. There has been a tremendous exploitation of Australian taxpayers under the Labor Government. It is very interesting to note the massive increase in the wholesale sales tax to which the shadow Treasurer referred, which has gone up from $3.5 billion in 1982-83 to an estimated $10.6 billion in 1989-90. That is a 200 per cent increase. Much of it has occurred since 1985 when the Treasurer sought to implement a broad-based consumption tax. That increase in the wholesale sales tax of something over 200 per cent, mainly concentrated in that period, shows the contempt of this Government for the average Australian taxpayer. If the Treasurer's broad-based consumption tax had been implemented it would have afforded some relief and compensation to those Australians worst affected. But, no! That source of revenue has been developed by stealth. The massive increase in the wholesale sales tax of some 200 per cent was concentrated mostly on goods in the 30 per cent area and is a very regressive tax. This source of revenue has increased to something like 11.5 per cent of the total revenue, whereas in 1983 it was 5 to 6 per cent of revenue. Many Australians would be concerned about additional indirect taxation of this nature; they need to realise that the Government is doing it by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer said that he deplores the Government's economic mismanagement. That shows up, as we are all aware, in the vast overseas debt that has accumulated under this Government. It has increased in gross terms to $140 billion, nearly a fivefold increase over the period of this Government. It increases relentlessly, minute by minute, hour by hour, and day by day. In August, the current account deficit, and the likely increase in debt of $2.6 billion, means an increase in debt of something like $100m every day. It is absolutely crucial that Government economic management be directed at this problem and what is basically causing it. The first cause is excessive spending, especially by the Government. In other words, we must save more and spend less. The second cause is endemically high inflation. Australia consistently has a higher inflation rate than Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, varying in recent years from a factor of four times the average of our trading partners to twice that average. As the third cause, I stress stagnant national productivity, which has a lot to do with the taxation regime of this Government and has adversely affected incentives. Indeed, stagnant national productivity over the period would be the single most important performance and policy failure under the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> To solve the problem, we must first address inflation. There can be no doubt that the Government is soft on inflation. Why? The answer is that it relates directly to the taxation matters that we are discussing tonight, because continually high inflation feeds the coffers of this rapacious Government through bracket creep. Do we get any reaction from the Government to our proposal in the Economic Action Plan to return at the end of each financial year the effects of bracket creep? The amount will be identified and will be returned to taxpayers. The Government, however, does not give any recognition to that proposal. It immediately enters into plans, as revealed by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) this week to match that largess in terms of receipts with largess in spending. There can be no doubt that the Government is very soft on inflation. There has to be a concerted policy to combat it involving very taut monetary and fiscal policies, particularly monetary policies. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear about tight monetary policy. We have had very high interest rates but to August last year a 30 per cent increase in the money supply. One can turn to the back of any issue of the Economist and look at the changes in the money supply. Australia is way in front with an increase of about 30 per cent. The United Kingdom is probably second with about 16 per cent. Germany, the United States of America and Japan have figures of 5 or 6 per cent. So our figure of 30 per cent compares with theirs of 5 or 6 per cent. Is it any wonder, with a floor from our centralised wage system and with that sort of slack in money, that we have continuing inflation? We have to concentrate on combating inflation and really mean it. We have to increase productivity and national production, including more investment in and production of export goods to replace imports. That is absolutely essential. I must stress more national saving; we must save more and spend less. We must kill inflation and increase productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Economic Action Plan is a dynamic program to achieve that. It embraces a variety of initiatives such as phasing down the centralised wage system and freeing up the labour market to foster an enterprise based industrial relations system, linking increased wages to higher productivity, combating restrictive work practices and encouraging improved practices and changed attitudes and performance by Australian management, increased productivity in the transport industries, the wharves and so on and the privatisation of publicly owned enterprises for greater efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax policy is of very great importance in all these matters and I make a passing reference to our family tax package in the Economic Action Plan. I take this opportunity to stress that our economic and tax policies represent a comprehensive and integrated package to restore the Australian economy and thereby benefit all Australians. Rather than being the country with the third largest overseas bank debt in the world after Brazil and Mexico, we will begin to stabilise that and ensure that we can again stand proud in the international community of nations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this wonderful world in which we live at the moment, what a wonderful thing an amendment to the motion for the second reading of a Bill is because it allows people such as the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), who has just spoken, to wander far and wide in the debate on a specific piece of taxation legislation. But the one thing that the Australian community will realise, for all that our good friend and colleague has said, is that, were there any possibility of a coalition government, we would see a return to the use of unemployment as an economic tool. People well remember the Fraser-Howard years when the coalition government used that very miserable of all tools to regulate the economy in its ham-fisted way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Berowra talked about a wages policy that a coalition government would somehow have in concert with its tax policy. The Australian public will also remember the coalition's record in recent national wage cases. In about 18 of the last 20 national wage cases, what has been the coalition's position? It has been for no increase. Australians will remember that simple fact when they eventually go to the polls. The coalition's record on wages is abysmal. It has sat by and tried to put the lid well and truly on wage growth, which has a great effect on people's standard of living. I was going to say something about the research and development aspects of this legislation and take business to task for its inability to react to the generous way in which this Government has allowed a host of concessions--</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Clause 8, page 7, line 29, after ``1987'', insert ``and in respect of which this section applies to the company.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments will address two matters affecting application of the research and development concession. The first concerns partners in a partnership of otherwise eligible companies in a research and development project. It is intended that a company partner be entitled to a deduction directly related to the contributions the company makes to the expenditure of the partnership, and that any different basis of distribution of profits and losses provided by any partnership agreement between the partners would not apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment will ensure that the deduction allowed to a partner company will be calculated by reference to the amount of expenditure that was incurred out of money contributed by the partner in the year of income, or contributed in a previous year but not then utilised. Where a partnership receives or becomes entitled to receive a recoupment or grant in respect of expenditure, each partner's share of the amount is to be calculated by reference to the proportion which the partner's contribution to the partnership funds bears to the total contributed to those funds by all of the partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment also makes clear that it is the partners, and not the partnership, which are to be taken to have incurred expenditure or to have received or become entitled to receive a grant or recoupment. One effect of this amendment will be that a partner company will be required to meet the expenditure thresholds provided by the research and development provisions. The second matter concerns all companies to which the research and development provisions apply. The amendment now proposed will correct a provision in the Bill which could arguably negate the intended operation of the present research and development provision, section 73b, from its commencement in 1986 to 20 November 1987.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1989 purports to give effect to the so-called historic agreement outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 7 September this year. The Prime Minister's statement dealt only with those amendments necessary to provide the Aboriginal community with living areas on pastoral properties. On the whole, that agreement was hailed by most as an agreement for commonsense. It had long been a contentious issue that required some compromise by all involved: the Aboriginal people who had been displaced from the land of their ancestors; the white pastoralists whose hardy pioneering ancestors had also had claim to the land; the powerful Northern Territory land councils which laid claim to all stock routes and reserves in the Northern Territory; and the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments which had become enmeshed in a legal wrangle. The tragic bottom line is that, for as long as compromise was delayed, the Aboriginal communities living either on pastoral properties or on stock routes and reserves-some 5,000 to 6,000-were denied the infrastructure and services required to lift them out of their Third World living conditions. Without title to land, neither the Northern Territory Government nor the Commonwealth could provide services such as housing and water to these communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This issue has a long history; it goes back to 1982 when the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), as a Minister, was trying to achieve this for the Aboriginal people. Of course, this Government has been in power for seven years now and, in that time, it has made no progress on this matter. Some progress was thought to have been made as far back as 1984 when an agreement was struck between the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who is now the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding), the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Territory cattlemen. They agreed to cooperate in the provision of Aboriginal community living areas on pastoral properties under Northern Territory title so long as traditional land claims to stock routes and stock reserves were dropped. In announcing the amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill in 1986, Mr Holding said:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposal in section 50 to remove from claims stock routes and stock reserves would remove a significant concern of the Northern Territory Government and the pastoral industry. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In many cases, to grant such a claim would result in the splitting of a pastoral lease, since stock routes often traversed pastoral properties. </PARA>
<PARA>Until now nothing has happened. The current Minister did not honour the Commonwealth's undertaking. He did not proclaim the agreed amendments to section 50 of the above Act. The result is that, since the initiation of the excisions program commenced, progress in providing community living areas has been abysmally slow. Only 21 titles have been issued for Aboriginal living areas under Northern Territory title. Seventeen offers of territory title have been made and a further 12 offers of living areas are now ready to be made which are subject to the proclamation of the amendment to section 50 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The failure of the Minister to proclaim section 50 of the Act allowed land councils to claim all stock routes and stock reserves and demand Commonwealth title for excisions on pastoral properties. </PARA>
<PARA> This-the land councils' blanket claim on all stock routes and reserves-has always been the stumbling block. It was the main reason the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association (NTCA) suspended negotiations with the Federal Government and the land councils in 1986. Land councils, in effect, denied Aboriginal groups the opportunity to accept freehold titles which were immediately available because they were to be under Territory title, not Commonwealth title. The provision of basic services to these communities was impaired. </PARA>
<PARA> International attention was focused on this issue on 4 August this year when the Arrente people moved onto the Yambah pastoral lease featured in a Four Corners program of July. The issue was finally brought to a head on 21 August this year when the Chief Minister drew the Prime Minister into the fray by outlining his concerns in a letter to him. When the Prime Minister failed to answer the Chief Minister's concerns, Mr Perron threatened a snap election. A flurry of activity followed, as that election-phobic government rediscovered consultation. After consultation the agreement was signed. The heart of that agreement provided that a small portion of stock routes and reserves would be scheduled where no agreement had been possible on pastoral excisions and that pastoral excisions would happen under freehold territory title on the basis of need. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments announced in the Bill we are debating this morning go beyond the grant of excisions from pastoral properties for Aboriginal living areas. They amend the Act in various other ways, mostly in respect of mining arrangements which are apparently non-contentious and which do not directly affect the excisions matter. The Bill is the result of the September agreement which envisaged complementary legislation by the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory. Essentially, the grant of title to excised areas was to be Territory legislation and by means of Territory title, while the grant of claims over stock routes and reserves was to be under the Commonwealth Act. The Northern Territory has passed legislation-the Miscellaneous Acts Amendment (Aboriginal Community Living Areas) Act 1989. The Bill before us gives effect to the undertaking by the Commonwealth in the memorandum of 7 September which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1975, as a matter of priority, to provide for the grant, by way of inclusion in a Schedule to the Act, of certain parts of existing stock routes and reserve claims. The actual areas to be included in the new parts 2 and 3 of schedule 1 are alleged by the Minister to have been discussed by the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Territory Government disputes that. Its position was formally put to the Prime Minister by the Chief Minister on 25 September and Territory officers continued to provide information to the Commonwealth on the areas being considered and to respond to Commonwealth requests. On 25 October, Commonwealth officers advised that they were unable to provide the information sought. To my knowledge, the Territory still has not received any information on these undertakings except to read the references in the Minister's second reading speech which my colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith) faxed to the Northern Territory immediately after that reading. Nor has the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association been adequately consulted. All that it has seen is a list of properties which might or might not be scheduled. All requests for detailed and definite information have been brushed aside. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 October the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association faxed a letter to the Prime Minister pointing out that it had not been consulted about the areas to be scheduled. The answer was the Minister's decision to push the Bill through all stages in the House of Representatives this week. That is why the consultation could not take place. It is an old saga. We hear it all the time. The consultation has failed in this area of administration under this Government. This is the typical manner in which this Minister undertakes consultation. Throughout this process the Minister has endeavoured to stretch the principles of the memorandum to the limit-to piggy-back other issues onto an agreement which had been made between Marshall Perron and the Prime Minister. It has taken the personal intervention of the Prime Minister on several occasions to keep the process on the rails. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech the Minister does not mention these proposed amendments that he has dropped from the Amendment Bill. He had endeavoured, in a totally underhand fashion, to piggy-back some controversial amendments, mostly related to the mining provisions of the Act. These would have affected mining and exploration activity in the Territory and further entrenched the position and power of the land councils. At the formal request of the Northern Territory Chief Minister, these amendments have been dropped for the time being. While the coalition supports this legislation there are some technical concerns-now subject to legal analysis-which may require amendment in the Senate. There are other concerns. The first relates to the total area to be granted. The 7 September memorandum said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth undertook that, in providing Aboriginals with living areas on stock routes and stock reserves, the following principles will apply:</PARA>
<PARA> it will schedule only a small proportion of the land subject to existing claims . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The total area to be granted is 2,312 square kilometres or 26 per cent of the land claimed. Considering that the claims were ambit ones to start with, the land councils have done quite well. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point relates to undertakings by Aboriginal claimants. According to the Minister, the grant of certain of these areas is subject to undertakings by Aboriginal claimants, designed presumably to remove or reduce the detriment that pastoralists or others might otherwise suffer. What are these undertakings? Will the Minister provide documented evidence of the particular undertakings that have been made? Will the Minister provide documented evidence of the way in which these undertakings were made known to lessees of pastoral properties in the area of the claim? Already the shadow Minister's office has had representations from solicitors who claim that their clients will be adversely affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point concerns areas to be granted by scheduling. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the selection of the areas has been determined after consultation with the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>It should be noted, however, that the final decision does rest with the Commonwealth. As I have already mentioned, the Northern Territory Government is still trying to find out what is in the schedules and the NTCA has not been consulted at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point concerns the descriptions of areas to be scheduled. Clause 16-proposed section 77C-allows the Minister to make regulations to `modify' the descriptions of the areas to be inserted in parts: parts 2 and 3 of schedule 1. Such modification could result in the areas being enlarged or, indeed, reduced from those originally approved by the Parliament. We will be watching this matter carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point concerns future claims over stock routes. There is nothing in the present amendments which guarantees the proclamation of the 1987 amendment to section 50 of the Act, which would prevent any further Aboriginal claims over stock routes and reserves. When the present amendments have been passed and assented to, subsection 50 (2d) and paragraph 50 (2e) (a) will continue to have no effect unless and until they have been proclaimed. Only the words in the 7 September memorandum provide a modicum of assurance. The memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA> Upon enactment of the scheduling legislation, the Commonwealth will then proclaim the June 1987 amendments . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government thus continues the present uncertainty which we have had for the entire period of this Parliament. This thing could have been settled back in 1987 but it had not been proclaimed even though the legislation went through Parliament. It leaves it to ministerial discretion to determine when and, as a matter of law, whether the original repeal will take effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth point relates to access to Aboriginal land. This appears to be unusual in that a person-that is, any member of the public, whether Aboriginal or not-will be required to negotiate with the land council access to Aboriginal land across non-Aboriginal land. Generally, if one wants to go across someone's land one negotiates with the owner, not the owner of the place one wants to get to. However, it is recognised that Aboriginal owners do need to be able to travel to and from that land. Why this is included in the Commonwealth Act is uncertain. The Northern Territory Lands Acquisition Act requires the Minister to acquire the relevant land, including, where necessary, an easement for reasonable access to the land. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there are three amendments to be moved to this legislation. I again point out to this Parliament that having had the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill go through this place-it was amended 92 times-a new piece of legislation is now coming into the House, but it is still not complete. At five o'clock this afternoon I got an amendment and at five to 12 I got another one; there was another change. This is not the way to bring legislation into this Parliament. It would not be so bad if we had not had so many amendments in the last piece of legislation relating to Aboriginal affairs. This Minister brings half-baked legislation into this House; the work has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time we got the administration of Aboriginal affairs on the rails so that when legislation comes in here it is complete. The coalition does not oppose the passage of this legislation, but over the next few weeks we will seek to consult with the parties who want to express a view on the Bill and we will address any proposed amendments in the Senate. We want these people to have the opportunity of title to these parts of lands. They are a group of people who for years and years have not been able to get infrastructure into their communities. There is a great need for that. It is a great tragedy that for seven years this Government has failed to address that problem effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That has to be one of the most patronising, gratuitous contributions I have heard since I have been a member of this Parliament. This person, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who masquerades as a spokesman for Aboriginal affairs on behalf of the shadow Minister, has come into this place and trotted out a speech which has no doubt been written by someone in the Northern Territory Government. In my view, it has demonstrated a complete lack of understanding or appreciation of the concerns of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. He is someone who wanted to be a Minister. It just so happens that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill has been close to my heart for some time. Prior to coming to this place I worked for the Central Land Council, and I am proud to say that. In 1986 these proposals were put forward but they were not accepted by the Northern Territory Government or by the pastoralists. Why were they not accepted? Because they were not prepared to compromise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Braddon has the hide to walk into this place and make accusations about Aboriginal people and their ability to put it over the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government. He said that this agreement is regarded as one of commonsense. If it is regarded as one of commonsense now, why was it not regarded as one of commonsense in 1986? Why? Because his friends in the Northern Territory Government, who refused to recognise the concerns of Aboriginal people, were not prepared to see the commonsense in these proposals which have been put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not enough time available to allow me to go through the scope of this legislation. I wanted to explain to the House the situation in which some Aboriginal people live-those whom no doubt the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) would try to oppress; those whom no doubt the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Braddon would like to deny rights to. In 1971 the Gibb Committee, formed under a conservative government, made recommendations on the matter of excisions. Six thousand Aboriginal people remained landless, despite the Aboriginal Land Rights Act passed in this House in 1976. They now have an opportunity to get somewhere secure to live. These are people who have attracted the focus of the international community because of their atrocious Third World living conditions. They are conditions which could have been rectified by the Northern Territory Government since the day it got powers of self-government in 1978. It has refused to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the honourable member for Braddon say about that? The Northern Territory Government has had it within its power to pass community living areas legislation since that time and has not done so. What is the excuse of the honourable member for Braddon? There is not one. He is someone who masquerades as having knowledge, but he has none. I would invite the honourable member for Braddon and the honourable member for Parkes, as I already have done this evening, to come to the Northern Territory. I will escort them around, and let us talk to some of the people who are going to be disadvantaged by this situation. The stock routes and reserves are the remnants of a bygone era when droving was the go. They are not part of pasture leases, as some people would have us believe, although many pastoralists talk as if they are. They continue to use them. They are vacant Crown land and, as such, claimable under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement which has been reached between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory is indeed historic. I must pay some compliments to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I also compliment the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory for having the gumption to come down and at least settle this situation. We will wait to see what legislation passes through the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and how it will be used within the Northern Territory. The honourable member for Braddon was keen to say that 26 per cent of the stock routes and reserves are going to be transferred to Aboriginal people. What he omitted to say was that the remainder will be available for being absorbed into pastoral leases. So pastoralists stand to gain approximately 6,580 square metres. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by giving a couple of examples of people who will be advantaged by this process. The people of Yambah: in August 1984 the Lynch, Turner and Palmer families, amongst others, decided to leave the grog and other problems of the Alice Springs fringe camps and take their families back to their traditional land at Yambah. They set up camp at McGrath's dam stock reserve: tents at first and later some tin shacks. But they still had no basic services. Ever since they have moved home they have been carting water from Alice Springs. For the first few years it was in recycled 44-gallon drums on the back of a truck. Since 1987 they have been able to hire the use of a water truck from one of the Aboriginal organisations in town. Their water is still stored in recycled fuel drums-no doubt something that the honourable member for Parkes is proud of. The families organised a chucking system with people chucking in a part of their pension cheques each week to buy water-something which indeed the honourable member for Parkes would promote. At one time they were paying 275 times what Alice Springs residents paid for water. Today it is approximately 30 times the cost of town water. Some camps still have to store water in 44-gallon drums. With secure title, a proper water supply can be found. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the sort of people who will be advantaged by this legislation. That is something that could have happened as far back as 1978, should have happened in 1986 and is at last happening. As I say, it is indeed a compliment to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who is at the table, and this Government that this has now happened. As I said previously, I pay some compliment to the Northern Territory Government for at last having the fortitude to accept the challenge and reach an agreement with the Commonwealth. But we will wait and see what happens and make sure that they live up to their agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to spend a lot more time on this debate because there are a lot of issues that need canvassing and a lot of history that needs to be read into the Hansard in relation to this matter. But I will say that the efforts of the land councils on behalf of their clients, the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory, have deserved great credit. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the derogatory comments which have been made by the Opposition members in previous debates in this place and again tonight about the role of land councils in looking after the interests of Aboriginal people, the councils have shown by their dedication, their professionalism and by example that they have acted as Aboriginal people have expected. As a former employee of a land council I can say that there was not one occasion when the Central Land Council, for which I worked, operated without the direct instructions of the Aboriginal people who were its clients and its bosses. On not one occasion did the Council go to government without the direct instructions of its clients and without acting for the benefit of its clients. I commend this legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a ridiculously early hour of the morning, and it is disappointing that we have had to put up with the sour delivery of the previous speaker, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). We are here at this early hour to debate the amending of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The main thrust of the legislation, as the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has said, is to put in place the 6 and 7 September agreements between the Northern Territory Chief Minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) relating to the grant of excisions of land from pastoral properties for Aboriginal living areas. That will amount in total to 2,312 square kilometres, which is 0.17 per cent of the Northern Territory. I understand that it takes in about 27 areas, including 6 per cent of stock routes. If enacted, it will give security of title to Aboriginal people who wish to live in these areas and because the security will be there money will be spent with confidence on building up an infrastructure for them so that they will have better living conditions than they have had to put up with in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to say that this is a free country and people are entitled to live anywhere they so wish. But I do not enthusiastically endorse setting up excision areas for Aborigines to live on carte blanche because there is a high cost involved in setting them up and even with the high cost they still have fairly frugal facilities. If they are in isolated areas the children often grow up with little prospect of getting jobs. In some instances I believe that it leads to perpetuating unemployment. I think the future for Aboriginal people, particularly the children, lies in giving them a good education and prospects for jobs at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has some detrimental aspects. It is absolutely vital to the Northern Territory people. It has been debated there for many years, particularly over the last couple of decades. Now it is to be rushed through the House after 35 minutes of debate at this hour of the morning. I think that is regrettable. As the honourable member for Braddon said, it has been done with little consultation with the Northern Territory Government. The consultation which did take place was usually instigated by the Northern Territory Government. There has been no effective consultation at all with the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association. To some extent, it affects the cattlemen's livelihood. It reminds me of the recent Kakadu decision with Coronation Hill. Just before the decision was made the Prime Minister spoke for 90 minutes to Phillip Toyne of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Sir Arvi Parbo rang up and he did not even get a hearing even though he had a guarantee in writing that the project would go ahead and had spent $12m as a result. I believe that this sort of cynical expediency will only lead to certain defeat at the polls. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting aspect of the legislation is that Commonwealth title will be granted, as I understand it from my reading of the legislation, for stock routes and stock reserves, but Territory title, which is a special freehold title, will be used for the pastoral excisions. I cannot see why that would not have sufficed for all the land that is to be encompassed in this Bill. It contains a host of inadequacies and deficiencies. When it is debated in the Senate, no doubt a number of amendments will be moved by the Opposition to improve the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 77c states that the Minister will be given the power to make regulations to modify the size of the areas granted. It seems strange to me that, if that is taken to its logical extension, these areas could be enlarged to a considerable extent without the matter coming back before Parliament. I believe that this needs to be tightened up. I was disappointed to see an article in Vanguard, the Communist Party of Australia's newsletter that is sent around to all members. The article in the 9 August edition could almost have been written by the previous speaker opposite. It talks about:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the mining and pastoral monopolies carrying on the tradition of gross oppression and exploitation of this continent's original inhabitants, a tradition founded by British colonialism's invasion of Australia and attempted genocide of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The cattlemen's association represents the most reactionary, extremist, racist wing of the pastoral monopolies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The paper also refers to:</PARA>
<PARA>`the greed of the pastoralists' and to the `pigheadedness of the Northern Territory Government'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is sad when language such as that is used in this country. In conclusion-as time is running out-I say that this legislation is flawed, as is so much of the legislation brought into Parliament that relates to Aboriginal affairs. Hopefully, when the Bill is finally agreed to by this House and the Senate it will have been amended into a better form, for the benefit of both pastoralists and the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take up only a few minutes. I want to respond to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I refer to what was said some 120 years ago by the Australian Catholic bishops, who wrote to the Australian Catholic Church about the ill-treatment of Aborigines. In part, the letter stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have dispossessed the Aboriginals of the soil . . . In natural justice then we are held to compensation. It is shocking to think of what has in fact been done. With very little, with short lived exception, injustice, neglect, cruelty . . . have branded the annals of white man. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, that is what this legislation is all about. It is a small attempt-but a valuable contribution-to make the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 more effective in meeting the needs of Aboriginal people in the Territory, especially those living on stock routes and pastoral properties. The issue of Aboriginal communities living on stock routes and on pastoral properties is one which demands more time than is available to me tonight. I appreciate that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), wishes to add a few words before the debate is concluded. So, with those very few words, I will resume my seat. </PARA>

It now has a difficulty with the amendment and I immediately agreed this evening to withdraw it. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the honourable member's speech I do not know whether he intends to oppose or support the amendments. It is an extraordinary situation. We received an approach from the Northern Territory Government to address this issue. My officers and Northern Territory Government officers worked on this proposal and it was included in the amendments. We now find that the Northern Territory Government still has a problem with it and, in the spirit of the agreement between the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), I have immediately withdrawn it because it now becomes controversial. I do not believe one can play the game any more fairly than that. To get the scheduled items up in these areas of land that we all want to see passed across to the Aboriginal people, they must be attached to some amendments, and that is why we are moving them. The rest of the amendments are non-controversial. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member raised a number of points and referred to a letter from Senator Tambling, and that will be addressed. I say to the honourable member and to the Opposition that I find it extraordinary that the shadow Minister has telephoned me to say that the shadow Ministry has met and that it supports this proposal, yet the honourable member comes in here and makes the accusations and comments that he has made. I think that is an astounding way to perform. If honourable members opposite had not held up the business of this place yesterday we would have had more time to discuss this matter. It was put in tonight because of the commitment the Prime Minister and I made to Marshal Perron that we would introduce this measure in October, pass it as quickly as possible in this place and get it across to the Senate.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) The cost of running the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa (CFMSA) meeting in August this year was $113,703; (b) The Australian Government did not provide any travel assistance to persons attending the Canberra CFMSA meeting. Ministers however are eligible to claim the cost of their airfares from the CFMSA budget administered by the Commonwealth Secretariat and to which Australia has pledged an amount of up to $200,000 over two years for meetings and related special studies. The South African `witnesses' attending the meeting also had their airfares and a per diem allowance paid from the Commonwealth Secretariat's CFMSA budget.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Committee of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers on Southern Africa was established in 1987 at the CHOGM in Vancouver to provide high level guidance on Commonwealth initiatives to bring about the eradication of apartheid in South Africa by peaceful means. The Committee consists of the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Canada, Guyana, India, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, Mr Joe Clark, is Chairman of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The Canberra CFMSA meeting in August was the fourth meeting of the Committee and, as with the three preceding meetings, was attended by the eight Foreign Ministers on the Committee and accompanying officials. In addition, the Foreign Minister of Malaysia, Dato' Abu Hassan, was invited by the Canadian Chairman to attend the meeting in recognition of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to follow shortly after in Kuala Lumpur. At his request, New Zealand Foreign Minister Russell Marshall was also invited by the Canadian Chairman to address the Committee on arrangements for the Commonwealth Games to be held in Auckland next year.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Those invited from South Africa to provide expert testimony at the CFMSA meeting were selected by the Canadian Chairman of the Committee. The selection of a church leader, a union representative and a member of the human rights movement in South Africa, as well as a representative of each of the African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, ensured that Ministers were exposed to a wide-ranging, representative group of those opposed to apartheid within South Africa. It would have been an even more representative group had the South African Government at the last minute not decided to deny a passport to Mr Azhar Cachalia, Treasurer of the United Democratic Front, who had also been invited to appear as a witness at the Canberra meeting.</PARA>
