<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death, on 2 December 1988, of Lloyd Frederic Rees, AC, CMG, artist, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service to Australian art and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker, I wish to pay tribute to a great Australian, Lloyd Rees, who died in Tasmania on Friday, 2 December 1988. As we know, it is only in exceptional circumstances that motions of condolence are moved for distinguished Australians who have not sat in this Parliament. It is indeed an indication of our esteem and affection for Lloyd Rees that we take this action today. </PARA>
<PARA> Lloyd Frederic Rees was born at Yeronga, Brisbane, on 17 March 1895. He left school at an early age, taking jobs while attending night classes at the art school of the Brisbane Technical College. He had already encountered coloured reproductions of Turner, Corot and Constable, pen drawings of Italy by Joseph Pennell and photographs of great buildings of Paris, all important for the types of landscape he was to create and to interpret for more than 70 years. In 1914, unable to enlist because of ill health, he became junior artist at the Government Printing Office. In 1915 he made pen drawings of Brisbane buildings and some of these drawings were brought to the attention of Sydney Ure Smith, the Director of the commercial arts studio Smith and Julius. Lloyd joined this firm as a commercial artist and he moved to Sydney in 1916. He began painting in oils and in 1923-24 he visited England, France and Italy. It was with his move to Sydney that he developed a fascination with the mood, the colours and the light of Sydney Harbour. That fascination would last to the end of his life and would provide us with many of his most loved paintings. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1926 he married Dulcie Metcalfe, who died the following year in childbirth. He married Marjorie Pollard in 1931, the year in which he held his first exhibition with the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney. In 1934 the couple built a home at Northwood and in the same year their son, Alan, was born. In the years that followed he held numerous exhibitions-one man and group shows-and exhibited especially with the Society of Artists, of which he was President from 1961 to 1965. In 1946 he began lecturing at the School of Architecture, Sydney University. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout his long career, Lloyd Rees's brilliance was readily acknowledged, bringing acclaim from his peers and critics alike. He was awarded a number of major international and national prizes. In 1970 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters at the University of Sydney. In 1984 he was awarded a doctorate by the University of Tasmania. In 1977 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and in 1985 a Companion of the Order of Australia. Lloyd Rees's contribution to Australian art has been immense, his work displaying a deep love for landscape, both here in Australia and in France and Italy, where he also painted significant works. Architecture was another love. He described it as `father of the visual arts'. Although Sydney and its environs were often the focus of his attention, many regions and aspects of the continent were portrayed with his fine draughtsmanship and his characteristic use of light. His art has delighted and inspired generations of Australians over an astonishing seven decades of exhibitions of his work. </PARA>
<PARA> While much of his life was devoted to his artistic pursuits, Lloyd Rees took a vital interest in the society around him. He saw many changes in his long life and was able not only to absorb those changes but also to look continually for further change and further improvement in the quality of life for Australians. In his later years he became well known as an activist to preserve the environment. He was indeed a compassionate man with a spirit as large as his immense talent. Lloyd Rees exemplified the diversity of this nation's capabilities and talents. All Australians are indeed fortunate that the memory of this truly remarkable man lives on in his paintings. I count myself one of his longstanding fans. It was, for me, a great honour to have presented Lloyd with the inaugural medal of the Painters and Sculptors Association of Australia in 1986 in recognition of his contribution to Australian art. I was similarly thrilled to open his Tasmanian Suite Exhibition in Hobart in October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is well known that Lloyd Rees was a Labor supporter, the respect and admiration for his work know no political boundary. They are bipartisan in this Parliament. Indeed, I have received from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) a letter supporting a suggestion by the Lane Cove Municipal Council that Lloyd Rees's home in Northwood be acquired to establish an art gallery in his memory. I certainly commend the intentions of this suggestion. Whether it is feasible, including financially feasible, is a question that the Government will examine. </PARA>
<PARA> The last time that I saw Lloyd Rees was here in Parliament House at the bicentennial function last year when Lloyd was honoured as one of the 200 great Australians who have made the most significant contribution to Australian history. Indeed, it was absolutely typical of the modesty and the charm of this man that he was puzzled-truly puzzled-as to why he was being so honoured, believing others to have a greater claim. Madam Speaker, I certainly count it as one of the privileges of my life to have known Lloyd Rees. He is survived by his son, Alan, daughter-in-law, Jan, and four grandchildren. On behalf of the Government and all Australians I extend to his family our condolences in their bereavement. I pay tribute, on his passing, to this very great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, only rarely that this House honours in this fashion men and women who have not served as members of the Australian Parliament. I believe, along with the Prime Minister, that honouring Lloyd Rees is an entirely appropriate use of that very rare occurrence. Lloyd Rees was an outstanding artist over decades of a very outstanding and compassionate life. The Prime Minister spoke of the particular affinity of Lloyd Rees with the City of Sydney and with Sydney Harbour. Lloyd Rees recorded his experience in 1916, when he first came to Sydney, in the following words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I saw a glorious colour picture of opal blue water, a band of golden sand, a band of olive undergrowth, then a band of pearly pink roof tiles shimmering on the skyline . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The whole opal Sydney Harbour spread out under a delicate blue sky, the light catching the sculptured foreshores with their wonderful imagery. It was a revealing moment of extraordinary beauty, and it never left me. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words of Lloyd Rees, written in 1916, were as beautiful and as descriptive as so many of his paintings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has very fully catalogued the awards, for achievements, the honours and the recognition that were very properly bestowed upon this very distinguished Australian. I had the privilege of being Lloyd Rees's local member for most of the time that I have been the member for Bennelong. I think it is fair to say that there would have been, as the Prime Minister suggested, a number of political issues on which Lloyd Rees and I may not have seen eye to eye. But I would have to say that I cannot think of a more distinguished Australian that I have had the privilege of representing in my electorate. He was well liked in the locality of Northwood, where he lived for something like 50 or 60 years. His connection with the artistic community in and around Lane Cove, Northwood and Longueville was very widely known, supported and respected. I appreciate the Prime Minister's acknowledgment, with all of the caveats that he properly mentioned, of the approach that I have made on behalf of the Lane Cove Council. Lloyd Rees was very much a local treasure to the people of the Lane Cove municipality, as he was a national treasure to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> He demonstrated to the world the inherent artistic capacities of the Australian people. He brought to his painting, to his life, to his values and to his commitments a very true love of some of the intrinsic things that we hold dear as Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the members of the parliamentary Liberal Party, I associate myself fully with the remarks of the Prime Minister. I too, on their behalf, extend my condolences to his son and to the other members of his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the National Party of Australia, I share in the tribute being paid to Lloyd Rees by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). It is an unusual event in this place to pass such a tribute for a person who is not a member of the Parliament. In this instance it is done, as I see it, because of the nature and character of the man and his achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I first met Lloyd Rees many years ago when he was a lecturer in the history of art and a teacher of painting and drawing at the University of Sydney in the faculty of architecture. He was a person of rare personal distinction and one whom those of us from other faculties used occasionally to sneak in and listen to, simply because of his reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason for my supporting the motion is his unique achievement. He was one who began from very humble origins. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, he has been described as a painter of light. He was a man who did interpret nature in a remarkable way and as a technician achieved a very rare distinction for Australian artists. As Alan McCulloch, in the Encyclopaedia of Australian Art, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Throughout his long career Lloyd Rees's work was widely accepted by all the factions because of its underlying sincerity and unpretentiousness. </PARA>
<PARA>The third reason that I support the motion is that, while there are many of the views and attitudes of Lloyd Rees with which I would find it difficult to agree, he was a lover of nature. I do not think there is any greater attribute for a painter or an interpreter of our Australian scene than the ability to see our environment as it is and the rare gift of being able to interpret it so that others can enjoy it. While in some of the approaches that he adopted towards environmental issues I found him perhaps a little too prejudiced on some occasions, there is no doubt that his unique achievement was, through his interpretative ability, to preserve for future generations in impressionist form the quality of the environment as he saw it. </PARA>
<PARA> To his son, Alan, and to his family the National Party extends condolences on his death. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) in paying tribute to Lloyd Frederic Rees. His life was a unique contribution to Australia's historical development. I knew Lloyd Rees for 20 years but we became much closer over his later years. Our friendship grew out of a mutual attitude to life. In the softest terms he was to the left of politics, as a secure, committed, progressive human being. Lloyd was proud of being a socialist. One of his regrets was that he did not see a socialist Australia in his time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE4">Mr UREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am expressing the views of Lloyd Rees. Maybe those arrogant members opposite could consider his personal views. Lloyd was proud of being a socialist. He was a citizen of the world; he was an extraordinary man. He had a great warmth for Australian Labor Party leaders Whitlam and Wran, and I know that his friendship with Hawke grew and grew.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A few years back Lloyd had to attend a function, which the Prime Minister has already mentioned, at the National Trust Gallery in Sydney. Of course, Bob Hawke was to be the main speaker. Lloyd was not uncritical of our Federal Labor Government, even though he was a strong Labor supporter. Lloyd knew that he would be sitting near Bob that night. He was a bit apprehensive about it and said to me, `Tom, what will I talk to the Prime Minister about?'. I said, `I suggest you start with cricket'. It was a remarkable evening. I know that Bob was captivated by Lloyd, as was everyone who had the privilege of meeting him. It was a privilege to listen to the Leader of the Opposition's sensitivity, and even that of Ian Sinclair. Soon after Lloyd's passing, Ian Sinclair spoke to me of the enormous treasures Lloyd has left us. That is what we must think about in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Lloyd always spoke of hope, even though he endured periods of deep depression, and in the last few years his partner, wife and inspiration, Marjorie, was very ill. He was honoured with some great moments in those last years. Lloyd's visit to Canberra for the opening of the new Parliament House was a highlight which he cherished very much. After the main ceremony, I tried to seek him out but, unfortunately, could not locate him. I discovered him later that afternoon and said to him, `Lloyd, where have you been?'. He said, with a twinkle in his eye, `I have had lunch with the Queen'. Of course, Lloyd was an old republican. I understand it was a very interesting discussion because on that occasion he reminded the Queen of his experience in 1901, when he was only six years of age, of seeing her grandfather. I understand the description of that experience was particularly graphic. </PARA>
<PARA> That evening I escorted Lloyd, his son, Alan, and Alan's wife, Jan, to the Great Hall. I found Lloyd a chair in the corner and asked him whether he would like to meet people on that occasion. He liked to talk to people. He sparkled that night. I introduced him to Cabinet Ministers, an ex-Governor-General-in order to avoid confusion about it, it was Paul Hasluck-State Governors, captains of industry, media giants and young artists. People kept flowing all night. He was keen to meet them and they to meet him. The following day he attended the House of Representatives during Question Time. You may recall, Madam Speaker, that one of your family was kind enough to give up a seat so that Lloyd could join the gallery on that occasion and attend the House. You recorded Lloyd's presence when, from the chair, you said that a `very distinguished Australian, a living Australian treasure' was in the visitors gallery. He was indeed very touched by your comments. </PARA>
<PARA> May I just mention another sentimental moment for him. As you, Madam Speaker, know and as the Prime Minister said, he was one of the 200 Australians that made our nation great. He was very moved when he was seated between Sir Ninian Stephen and Bob Hawke at the dinner in the Great Hall that evening. It meant a great deal to him. He felt very humble indeed that he was invited on such an occasion. Even though Lloyd held strong personal views on issues, he expressed those views publicly only in the latter years of his life. He had great faith in young people, their idealism and their commitment for change in society in a progressive direction. On Australia Day 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I build my faith on the young people . . . they seem instilled with a spirit of protest . . . they know they have the power to change things. </PARA>
<PARA> If they can overcome their elders resistance to change, Australia will be a truly great nation, a place where people won't have to look at images of malnourished children, where there will no longer be poverty in one street and wealth in the other. </PARA>
<PARA>He assisted young artists whenever he could and advocated their importance as critical observers of society. As the years flowed he publicly committed himself to the struggle against uranium mining in this country and he was strongly anti-nuclear. He was excited about the advances being made towards nuclear disarmament by the United States and the Soviet Union. He saw great hope for the people of the Soviet Union and, indeed, the world with the rise of people such as Gorbachev and the enlightened people around them. </PARA>
<PARA> As he saw the destruction of beautiful things that he loved so dearly, Lloyd showed his enormous courage and commitment when in June of last year-in the middle of the Tasmanian winter; he was 93 years of age-he addressed a protest rally against the destruction of Tasmania's forests by profit motivated woodchippers. The destruction of the natural environment which he captured on canvas so magnificently was an obscenity to Lloyd. Likewise, he fought to protect the man made environment of beautiful architecture in old cities that he admired and loved. After all, Lloyd had been a teacher at the School of Architecture at the University of Sydney for over 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the last works that Lloyd did was a lithograph for the the Wilderness Society so that it could raise funds for campaigns to protect the National Estate. The light and sheer beauty of Lloyd's work are in themselves a statement of the need to preserve and protect our planet by someone who loved it. In his work, Lloyd's vision will live forever. </PARA>
<PARA> He has left us many treasures. He will be deeply missed personally, but his impact in evoking our awareness of our surroundings and ourselves is a permanent legacy. I send my love and sympathy to Alan and Jan, who are present in the gallery, and to their family. I extend my sympathy also to that very large extended family of Lloyd's throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the House, but it would be inappropriate for the Minister for the arts not to pay a measure of personal tribute on an occasion when a great Australian artist has passed away. I have known Lloyd Rees for many years but the last several occasions on which I met him say something about the nature and personality of this great Australian. During the Australian Labor Party Conference in Hobart I received a message that his health was failing. At the behest of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), I called upon Lloyd with the shadow Minister for the arts in Tasmania. It was true that here was a man of advanced years who was physically failing. But within a matter of minutes of greeting us he was telling us how he had taken himself out of hospital because he could not stand the architecture. He then moved very quickly to ask where the conference was located and I said that it was at the casino. He said that he had given that place a hard time because he was bitterly opposed to gambling. However, he went on to say that the designers had got the architecture right. He was getting back into his painting; there was a kind of permanent apology on record. Then he said some interesting things about this House, the architecture of which he did not approve. Why? `Because', he said, `the problem with Australian politicians is that they are not men of philosophy. They are a bit ashamed of expressing themselves emotionally. He almost stood up and said, `Can you imagine the French building a building that big without a big statement across the front about liberty, equality and fraternity?'. He said, `All you fellows did was to get Italian architects, stick four aluminium poles in the air, and stick a flag on the top, and you thought that was enough. Let me tell you, young man, it was not enough'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not for me to praise Lloyd Rees's art because his art will continue to speak out to all Australians and, indeed, to the world audience. He will give new generations a new perception of the landscape of this country, and he will give them a new perception of himself. He was a great Australian. He was a turbulent spirit. He loved Australia and he loved Australians. Having said that, there is not much more one can say except to express one's personal condolences to Alan and Jan and his grandchildren. He has made a contribution to this nation which is, I think, being fittingly recognised by this Parliament at this moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very few Australians other than Parliamentarians have received tributes in this place. The names of Sir John Monash, Dame Nellie Melba, Sir Edgeworth David, Sir Macfarlane Burnet and Sir Robert Helpmann are the only ones that come to mind. Dr Lloyd Rees deserves our recognition and our gratitude. He was the longest lived and the most diverse in style of all Australia's major painters, one of the most productive and probably the most self-critical. Few artists destroyed so high a proportion of total output.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was a comparatively late developer, beginning as a careful draughtsman with a keen interest in architecture, and his drawings of landscapes and buildings, first exhibited in 1932, show his great virtuosity. He then became one of our most important lithographers. In later years, after his long experience in England and Europe, his style was increasingly reminiscent of the great J. M. W. Turner, not derivative but evolving in parallel. Another great influence was Bellini, especially his studies of Venice. Like so many great artists, he was fascinated by light-indeed, obsessed by it. His work became increasingly visionary and his personal style is immediately recognisable. He greatly admired Titian. He said in his interview with Janet Hawley, published in the Good Weekend in October 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>Titian was still painting when he died at 99, and I'm about as old as he was. Titian said he wanted 30 more years, then he'd know how to paint. I feel the same way, but if you think too much you will never learn. </PARA>
<PARA>Lloyd Rees showed great fortitude through his long life, overcoming periods of illness and later periods of black depression. Towards the end he seemed staggered by his emergence as a national monument. For a long period he earned his living as a teacher. He said, `I had to wait until I was an old man before I made any money from art'. He was a great man. Many of us who knew him cherished him, and his light illuminated us all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hobart became Lloyd Rees's home in his last years. `If you look for light you can find it', he said. He found light in the Derwent, in Tasmania's peaks and forests, and in the strong Tasmanian coastline. His eyesight failing, he painted to the rhythm of an inner light, blind as Beethoven was deaf, transcending failing senses. As Barry Pearce said of Rees, `In his eighties he has broken through to a Turner like simplicity, dissolving earthly forms into an ecstatic vision of the spiritual possibilities of the Australian landscape'. He became a symbol of hope and life over cynicism and materialism, speaking out for democratic socialism and for our environment. That he found light in the darkness is a mark of his courage, for certainly he knew depression and tragedy. He was frail in health from the age of 16 when he nearly died of a kidney infection. His mother died locked away a leper. His brother died in Europe in World War I. His first wife and his first child both died at child birth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We therefore pay tribute to Lloyd Rees not merely for his art but for his example in life, his determination, notwithstanding his personal tragedies, to overcome adversity and to build a better world-in short, his courage in his engagement with the issues of our day. I remember how profoundly it affected me to see him speaking out in the meeting that my colleague beside me, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), has referred to-the meeting against the rape of our environment in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the last words should be his, because they speak of his enduring modesty and his optimism even in death. They have already been referred to by the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) in this debate. He said that he needed more time, another 30 years, and he would have learnt to paint. But his record lives with us now and it is a record that we all pay tribute to. To his family and to all Australians who have been touched by him, I join in expressing my last respects. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the face of the collapse of Australia's export income the Government has sought to distribute the burden of adjustment fairly. By keeping employment growing strongly and by boosting payments for low income groups, we have gone a long way towards shielding the disadvantaged from the worst effects of these external shocks. We have created more than one and a quarter million new jobs and, by the time that we have achieved the benchmarks that we have set for family payments, we will be spending nearly $1.5 billion per annum through the family allowance supplement. We have increased pensions in our period in office by 7.7 per cent in real terms. That increase of 7.7 per cent in pensions in real terms under my Government contrasts with the 4.1 per cent cut during the period of the Treasurership of the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true, as was contained in the honourable member's question, that there was a drop in national income resulting from the terms of trade collapse, and the disposable incomes of many families were reduced as a result.

<PARA> So that there will be no doubt what the position of those opposite is, let me quote from the document called Future Directions which I have already recommended to my colleagues. It is a goldmine full of nuggets. We will see what these people say should be done about protecting people. They have tried to put a figure on the reduction in standards and they have cried that this is a terrible thing that is attributable to this Government. What do we find on page 53 of `Futile Diversions'? This is their considered view:</PARA>
<PARA>Between 1963 and 1988 Australia declined from 8th to 23rd place in international ranking as an exporter . . .</PARA>
<PARA>They go on to explain what that means and continue:</PARA>
<PARA>This has been aggravated by Labor policies which have attempted to shield certain groups in the community from the effects of a reduced national income.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they say that as a result of what has been happening externally there has been a drop in national income, and what has this awful Labor Government been doing? It has been trying to protect people against that drop in income. That is their exposition. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless these policies are reversed, the current account deficit of the balance of payments, already at an unacceptably high level, will continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has destroyed for all time in its own document the proposition that there has been some fall in living standards attributable to this Government, and it criticises this Government for doing what it has in fact done to protect the most vulnerable in the community from that fall in national income.</PARA>
<PARA> The position is quite clear. We make no apology at all for what we have done substantially to protect those who are most vulnerable. The contrast between this side of the House and the other is absolutely stark. We promise to continue that commitment to protect the most vulnerable in the community. It is quite clear from the stated policy of those opposite that they will not only stop that but that it is appropriate to cease the protection of the most vulnerable in the community. It is a clear choice and the people will make the choice decisively when the time comes.</PARA>

Let me remind the House of what this Government did to repair the damage and the lack of concern that had been exhibited by those who had come before us. I have already given the figures in regard to the family allowance supplement. By the next addition to the family allowance supplement this year we will be spending some $1.5 billion on the supplement, which will mean that those in the lowest income stratum will be receiving increases in their income which will be more than the wage equivalent of $100 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, in the area of homelessness, which has been brought to the attention of the public with the release of the Burdekin report, I remind this House of what we have done in the period that we have been in office. We have increased spending on refuges from the figure of $14m that we inherited from the Opposition by more than 500 per cent to $85m and, with my Minister, last October I announced also a further offer of $40m to the States to expand programs for the homeless and for people in crisis. So I do not in any sense retract the commitment that I gave in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of what this Government has done and will continue to do, we will produce the situation where by 1990 there will be no financial need for any child to live in poverty. That will come about because we will be spending a sum of $1.5 billion. The tragedy is that during the coalition's period of office-for the greatest part of the postwar history in this country it had responsibility for establishing standards-the poor and the poverty stricken were never within its purview. The coalition was not concerned with them. We are, to the tune of spending an additional $1.5 billion. I do not walk away from the pledge: it will be delivered upon.</PARA>

The Government is very much involved in cooperative efforts with State and local government and industry to encourage a more flexible, innovative and cost effective regulatory environment for housing.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed. Efforts have been made to encourage the adoption of a more cost effective residential land development practice, through what we used to call the joint venture for more affordable housing and which we refer to now as the green street project. This has demonstrated cost savings of between $5,000 and $12,000 per house and land package where the cost of services, trenching and laying down pipes and telephone cables and so on can be shared. Secondly, there has been a commitment to achieve more uniform and cost effective building regulations through the Australian Uniform Building Regulations Coordination Council and, in 1988, the publication of the new building code of Australia-something which was initiated by the Commonwealth and, after some initial resistance, accepted by the States and local government. It was a genuine Commonwealth innovation. A model code of practice has been developed for residential subdivision standards to provide an improved technical basis for residential development control. Finally, promotional opportunities have been provided to improve the efficiency of residential development and approval processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Green street demonstration estates have been constructed in virtually every capital in Australia. They are notably successful. I will tell the House of perhaps the most successful of the developments-the one at Vermont near Melbourne. When this development was originally proposed the City of Nunawading was so antagonistic towards it that it threatened injunctions. It wanted to take action because, it said, a higher population density would diminish the quality and amenity of life in the area. In December 1988, the Mayor of Nunawading, in her mayoral robes, was at the official opening of the development. There had been a major change of attitude. She said that the City of Nunawading realised that the development meant a considerable increase in the amenities of the area. The development covers 2.45 hectares. Originally, under the normal carving up of blocks into equal sizes and allowing one cottage per block, one could have fitted in 26 houses. In this case, 34 houses were built. Remember the advantages offered by these houses. They all have Torrens title; there is a greater amount of open space; they have complete security for children; the occupants are able to have their own pets; and so on. It is a very sensible use of a scarce commodity. Another possible choice has been fed in.</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment young people are facing the problem that, if they want to move to an inner city area where they have access to all the facilities that they want, they have to pay an enormous price. On the other hand, if they want to move to the outskirts of the metropolitan areas where land prices are cheaper they have to face the downside of being remote from schools, public transport and a number of community facilities and they will have a long way to travel to see friends and associates.</PARA>
<PARA> We think this development has been remarkably successful. I congratulate local government organisations such as the City of Brisbane which did not want to be associated with the development originally but now see it as a great community asset and want to be involved.</PARA>

They should come clean and tell them where they stand on monetary policy. Would they deregulate the housing market? Would they take off the 13.5 per cent limit in respect of about 40 per cent of loans, because that is what Professor Hewson advocated?

<PARA>The Federal Opposition says the Prime Minister was responsible for fuelling speculation on the Australian dollar by his comments on the state of the national economy. The Opposition Treasury spokesman Andrew Peacock claimed today Mr Hawke either did not comprehend the implications of his comment that the state of the economy was a tragedy or it was a deliberate attempt to influence the market. Mr Hawke's office said today that contrary to media reports the Prime Minister had made no comment yesterday on the value of the dollar. Confusion on financial markets following the report pushed the Australian dollar down this morning to 78.6c before it bounced back to 79.3c.</PARA>
<PARA>The ABC news item this morning-</PARA>

<PARA>was based on reports from money market dealers in New York about what they believed the Prime Minister had said. The ABC has since found that these reports were wrong. The Prime Minister did not say anything about the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member was trying hopelessly to flounder back to his life raft by talking about a tragedy. He was wrong about that. I did not say that. If he looks at the transcript of my interview with Jana Wendt, he will see that I did not say that the Australian economy was a tragedy. That is what he is trying to say that I said. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of two items to which you referred, yes, that was a tragedy.</PARA>

But I ask him: Does he regard it as a tragedy that the latest statistics on employment show that we have created more than one and a quarter million new jobs? Is that a tragedy? Of course it is not.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat that he has got it wrong by saying that I talked about the dollar. I did not. At least the ABC acknowledges that. I did not say that the Australian economy was a tragedy. I referred to two particular elements of it.</PARA>

While maintaining its monopoly control over exports, it will compete strongly with private traders on the domestic market, being able to offer for the first time cash for wheat. In other words, it will not be in the disadvantaged situation in which it has been under the present plan. The Government will strongly back the Wheat Board.

<PARA> On the other hand, members of the Liberal Party of Australia are quite prepared to say publicly that they support the Government's initiative.

Never before in the tortured history of the Liberal-National Party coalition has there been a more contentious point of disagreement. Senator McGauran is threatening to leave the coalition. From the Liberals' and Victoria's points of view that is probably not a bad idea. But what should be of greater concern, of course, is the tacit approval of his actions by the Leader of the National Party in this place. The Leader of the National Party and his deputy are walking a tightrope between those who have treasured mediocrity for 50 years and the other half of Australia's wheat farmers who have already identified the benefits that will flow from freeing up the domestic wheat market. The problem for the Nationals is that the tightrope is being held at one end by the honourable member for O'Connor and at the other by the honourable member for Wannon-and they would love to let it go.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McGauran says that the Nationals are behind him on this issue-if I may quote him-`to a man'. I guess that leaves out Senator Bjelke-Petersen! But, more importantly, Senator McGauran's ravings have not been silenced by any National Party members of shadow Cabinet-those who so fondly hang on to a disposition to accept the Government's proposals. If the National Party has its way on this issue, all the talk of coalition unity espoused by the Opposition Leader will be seen for what it is-hollow hogwash. If the Liberals collapse to their country cousins in the National Party, they will have flunked their first test of standing on the principles they are supposed to believe in.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us look at the actual level of activity. From what the right honourable gentleman is saying one would believe that there is a slump and that houses are not being built. In 1988 there were 160,000 starts. In the last year in which the coalition had responsibility for this area of activity in Australia-1982-there were 105,000 starts. We have got the housing industry operating at close to its maximum level of activity. We obviously are conscious of the fact that rising house prices, particularly in the Sydney area but not exclusively there, are causing very considerable hardship. We have done more than any other government in this area in terms of providing access. In this country some 310,000 young people have got their start in housing under the first home owners scheme as a result of our initiative. Honourable members opposite were in government for all those years and they could not think of anything like that; we brought it in. It is described by the housing industry as the most effective and imaginative housing scheme that has been brought in by any government. That is what we did. Over 300,000 Australians now have homes because of this scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We recognise that the problem at this time is on the supply side; that there are constraints there. Therefore, we have constructively called the Premiers together later this week. I hope that at that particular conference in a spirit of constructive cooperation we will together be able to make decisions which will add to the supply of housing blocks. We will be making some 27,000-odd additional blocks available. We hope that the States will also take action. If we can get cooperation from local governments for a relaxation of their zoning approach so that there can be choice in the type of housing that is constructed, these are the sorts of things that will address the issue. There is no point in talking about the increase in interest rates causing problems. Of course it does. I have explained why that is necessary. But on the central issue of what governments can do to help alleviate the housing crisis we are taking action cooperatively with the States. I believe that out of that conference will emerge a situation in which the people of Australia who are looking for homes will not be faced with such high prices, which I concede are causing additional difficulties for many. If at any time the right honourable gentleman would like to have a debate in this place about his Party's housing record and ours he is welcome to it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has had a particular concern with the specific health problems of women. Indeed, as part of the national agenda for women we have developed a national women's health policy which I hope will be supported by all health Ministers at the conference next month. In the meantime, significant initiatives have been taken in the area of breast and cervical cancer, which cause something like 2,500 deaths a year in this country. We announced in the 1987-88 Budget that $5.1m would be allocated over three years for the joint Commonwealth-State evaluation of pilot screening projects for breast and cervical cancer. There are now 21 on the ground screening programs established across Australia, and I was pleased today to approve another $880,000 for another 11 new projects. This money is to be spent over the next two years on new breast cancer screening evaluation projects in South Australia and New South Wales and cervical cancer projects in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory, Victoria and Queensland. These funds are in addition to the $2.9m in grants which we announced in May last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of some media criticism to the effect that Australia may be moving too slowly in relation to breast cancer screening. I totally reject such a suggestion. Overseas and Australian experts have advised that the approach we are taking-that is, the pilot approach-is the best way to proceed; that it is pointless to introduce preventive programs which are not proven in three essential areas: their quality, their acceptability by women, and their accessibility to women. There are very important hazards, and I am sure that the honourable member for Lowe, when he allows his expertise and not his partisanship to influence his decisions, will recognise that we need to avoid a haphazard and possibly even a counterproductive program.

These are matters that require very careful evaluation. I believe that we are moving in the right direction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjection refers to the 7.7 per cent. It is correct that on the figures for the December quarter, the annualised rate is 7.7 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We get this hysterical, heehaw reaction. I repeat: it is no substitute, and will be seen by the electorate as no substitute, for a considered discussion about this matter. As I have pointed out, the way in which that has been calculated assumes that each Australian household buys a new house each quarter. That assumption is obviously absurd. The Statistician has undertaken to have a review of the methodological techniques that are involved. If we extract that element in respect of which there is now going to be this study the figure is 6.8 per cent, not 7.7 per cent. We believe that when one takes this into account it is appropriate to point to an underlying decline in the rate of inflation. We believe that that is the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of inflation again comes as remarkable from those opposite. If we want to talk about movements in the rate of inflation, the question is: what was the rate of inflation that we inherited from the Opposition when in government? It was 11.2 per cent. Under all the vicissitudes with which we have been faced in terms of the external accounts, at no point under this Government has inflation reached the figure of 11.2 per cent which the Opposition bequeathed to this country. That is simply because this Government has an infinitely greater capacity for responsible and effective economic management than the Opposition was ever capable of. That is because we have received the cooperation of the trade union movement. Those opposite have not learnt. They should read their stupid document again. What is their proposition in regard to wages? They have not learned from what they did in 1981. They are advocating exactly the same policy-a return to free bargaining-which would mean we would have exactly the same sort of wages explosions now that we had then. Under those opposite, wages exploded in the order of 20 per cent, because that was their policy.</PARA>
<PARA> I was not at the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1981. I pleaded, as the then Prime Minister will affirm, for a different approach to the whole question of economic management within which there could be cooperation on the element of wages, but the philosophy of those opposite in government was `free for all'. They said, `Let the market determine it'. Obviously, the trade union movement did that, under their encouragement. In 1981, the Prime Minister walked away from a conference, went to London and said, `Let wages blow'-and they did. In the result, we had 11.2 per cent inflation. Under this Government, before the collapse in the terms of trade, we brought it down to under 5 per cent; we more than halved the rate of inflation that we incurred from those opposite. But even then, with a dramatic decline in the terms of trade and the increase in the price of imports that was associated with it, inflation in this country never got anywhere near their 11.2 per cent. So if Opposition members want to talk about movements in the inflation rate, again we are prepared to discuss that with them at any stage, because under this Government we have never reached the heights of inflation that we did under the previous Government. That is no accident. It is because the Opposition had no concept of economic management. Its own document shows that it has not learnt. If anything was to happen whereby the Opposition got back into government again, it would restore the same sort of situation. Wages and inflation would explode and, as happened in its last year in office, once again another 300,000 Australians would be put onto the unemployment scrapheap.</PARA>

<PARA> That this House censures the Prime Minister for his persistent misleading of the Australian people about the true state of the economy, as exemplified by:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) his statement regarding taxation, interest rates, wages and prices during the Oxley by-election; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) his claim made before the Western Australian election that interest rates would not rise before they fell. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the first day of the new parliamentary sitting and, as the Government has not provided the Parliament with the vehicle whereby it may debate the dramatic deterioration in the Australian economy which has taken place since the Parliament last met, it is therefore appropriate that the Opposition should bring this motion of censure against the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say at the outset of this censure motion that since this Parliament last met in December there has been a dramatic change not only in the perception of the Australian economy but also in the real state of the Australian economy's standing on the international scene. Since this Parliament last met, two very important economic statistics have driven home to the Government, have driven home to many commentators in the media who previously would not believe it, or did not want to believe it, and have certainly driven home to us on this side of the House what millions of average Australians have known for the last two or three years, and that is that this Government has been a failure as an economic manager of the economic affairs of this country. What the disgracefully bad inflation figure for the December quarter illustrated, what the disastrous, unexpected and, indeed, unprecedented balance of trade figure for January demonstrated, is that the economic respectability and economic achievement that surrounded the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-they must go down in history as the great snake-oil salesmen of Australian economic management because both of them have gone round the country month after month and year after year saying that all will be well and all is in order; if anything goes wrong it is the fault of the foreigners, the former Government, the weather or some unexpected circumstances-are a myth and a facade. Do honourable members remember the explanation give by the Prime Minister two years ago when our balance of payments were in banana republic crisis? Astonishingly, the explanation of the Prime Minister then was not that we were sucking in too many imports; it was not then that the glass was effervescent. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer two years ago spoke of the funnel-web spiders. They were not parading effervescence and import suction in 1986. No, it was the collapse in our terms of trade. Remember the Prime Minister, resplendent with Faiman training, going on television and saying that $9 billion had been wiped off our national income? Those rotten foreigners-it was all their fault. The Treasurer would come into the Parliament and say, `It is 20 bucks off coal, 40 bucks off wheat, 60 bucks off wool, a hundred bucks off copper. It is not our fault; it is the fault of the rest of the world'. `It is those foreigners. They have dealt us some mean hands', said the Prime Minister. And he would know a few things about that. </PARA>
<PARA> `They have dealt us some mean hands', said the Prime Minister, but now, two years later, is it not remarkable, as many of my friends on this side of the House who know something about the great rural industries of Australia realise, that thanks to the bounty of the weather and the fluctuations of international markets we are enjoying some of the best rural seasons that our woolgrowers and many of our primary producers have enjoyed for years, and we get nary a bleat out of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer now about the collapse in our terms of trade?</PARA>
<PARA> It is not the fault of the foreigners now but, `Thank God for them. They are buying our wheat and our wool in enormous quantities. Think of the pickle the Australian economy would be in now otherwise. If we think heading towards a $14 or $15 billion current account deficit for the year is a problem, just imagine what it would be like if those wicked foreigners were still dealing us a mean hand.' The fact is that that argument is not available, and once again the deceit, the dissembling and the sheer nonsense economics of the Prime Minister which he has peddled for years have been exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> My fundamental complaint is the absolute unwillingness of the Prime Minister to talk with integrity and honesty to the Australian people about our economic crisis. I ask why he does not have the honesty to come into this Parliament-and if he were a true statesman he would do it-and say, `We have got some things wrong. We do realise that the productivity of this nation is lower than that of the rest of the industrialised world; we do realise that our inflation rate is three times that of our major trading partners. We admit that Australian families' living standards have fallen by an average of $58 a week over the last five years; we admit that we owe foreigners $7,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. We acknowledge that we have to make some policy changes. We would like the cooperation of the Australian nation to bring those policy changes about'. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Prime Minister had the integrity and the fortitude to adopt that approach, he would win the respect and the admiration of the Australian people. But no. What does the Prime Minister do? Whenever he feels a by-election coming on he starts talking about the good times. There are many faces to the Prime Minister. There is the `good times' Prime Minister and there is the `bad times' Prime Minister. Whenever there is a by-election on, you can bet your bottom dollar that he will be talking up expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> He talks about former governments talking up expectations. Any self-respecting leader would have blushed if he had read what the Prime Minister told the people of Oxley, no doubt after he got the last batch of Rod Cameron's research saying, `You are bad news with your traditional blue collar voters'. The Prime Minister said, `Living standards are going to go up, tax is going to come down, wages are going to go up'. And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the bobby-dazzler of them all is the remark that the Prime Minister made in answer to a question towards the end of Question Time, when he started talking about the consumer price index (CPI). What the Prime Minister said then was, `We have got a lousy CPI'. He did not say, `We will change policy so the causes of that lousy CPI are taken out'. What did he say? He said, `We will shoot the messenger'. It is as simple as that. The Government does not like the CPI result even though it is under a regimen that it approved and encouraged. Even though the CPI regimen in Australia is similar to that of most Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and even though it is established by an independent statistician who is given that statutory independence by a Labor Government, because the news that the Statistician churns out is not satisfactory, the Prime Minister says, `We are going to have to change the regimen; we are going to have to alter it'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is remarkable that during the Oxley by-election, far from the Prime Minister taking the impact of housing, including housing interest rate increases, out of the CPI adjustment and therefore saying to the Australian workers, `You cannot get any wage compensation for interest rate increases', he was saying the exact opposite. Because he wanted to stem the anti-Labor swing in Oxley, he was saying on that occasion, `We are actually going to compensate Australian workers for increases in interest rates'. In the space of two days in that Oxley by-election, the Prime Minister promised a wage increase and a tax cut, and he promised the workers of Australia that they would have compensation for interest rate increases. Yet now, because the rate of inflation is utterly and completely out of control, what is the Prime Minister saying? He is saying that there is something wrong with the measurement. He is saying to the Australian people that inflation is not really running at 7.7 per cent, that it is not really three times that of our major trading partners, that it is not almost double what the Treasurer promised it would be when he brought down the last Budget. He is really saying that it is somewhat less than that, that it is all the fault of the Statistician and that, if only those confounded bureaucrats would serve the political interests of his Government, all would be well. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the measure of the deceit of this man who trades on his integrity as the leader of this country. He goes around saying, `They will trust me'. I do not think that people ought to trust him any more than I think they ought to trust the Treasurer-the other snake oil salesman-with the economy, nor ought they trust this Government's economic management of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice with some interest that the Government is worried about what is called in the trade the gender gap. It is worried about the fact that women voters are drifting away from the Australian Labor Party. Some people think it has something to do with language used in the Parliament. I will pass over that. We have seen but have not heard from the new Treasurer today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the real explanation as to why that gender gap is opening up-and this is very relevant to the political and economic problem that the Prime Minister has at present-is that the women of Australia are very well aware of the deterioration in Australia's living standards over the last five years. More than anything else, that is the reason for the political gender gap. Australian women will not wear for a moment the absurd proposition from this Prime Minister that they should not take any notice of the fall in living standards, that they should not take any notice of the rise in inflation, and that interest rates are going to come down although, of course, they will go up a lot before they do so. The Government is saying that if it finds it is going to get an adverse economic figure it will shoot the messenger; it will tell the messenger that he has it all wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at the commencement of the debate on this censure motion, since the Parliament last met there has been an enormous change in the economic debate and the economic climate. I would say that millions of Australian families know more about the reality of economic life in Australia than do members of the Government and the Government's advisers. They know about this Government's housing policies. The Prime Minister says that he is happy to debate interest rates and happy to debate housing. Is he happy to debate the fact that, while five years ago one needed 35 per cent of average male earnings to pay off a house in Sydney, one now needs 70 per cent? That statistic is not only an economic disgrace; it is a social and family disgrace. Does the Prime Minister really want to debate the fact that there has been a 90 per cent increase in the taxation bite for single income families on average earnings? Does he really want to debate the fact that our foreign debt has quadrupled over the last five years? Does he really want to debate the fact that home ownership is now getting steadily beyond the reach of all but the relatively affluent people who are entering the home market for the first time?</PARA>
<PARA> Does the Prime Minister really want to debate the fact that last August his Treasurer said that our inflation rate was going to be 4 1/2 per cent and it is now heading towards 8 per cent? Does he want to debate the fact that in October last year he said, `In a month or two our balance of payments figures are going to get better', when in fact they are heading back to being as bad as they were when the Treasurer made his banana republic call in 1986? As I have already remarked, on this occasion the Prime Minister does not have the foreigners to beat about the head because if it were not for the fact that foreigners were paying record prices we would be in an even deeper pickle. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that this Government has been revealed by the developments of the last two months to have been a failure in economic management. No longer can it strut the country saying that it has it right, that anything that goes wrong is the fault of the rest of the world. What has happened to the proud rhetoric of the Government immediately after the 1987 election? Do honourable members know what the Government was going to do in the third Hawke term? It was going to complete the reform agenda. It was going to free the labour market; it was going to privatise the great Australian utilities--</PARA>

Anybody who knows anything about the scandal of Sydney Airport and the disgraceful political featherbedding of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) must regard this as one of the most shameful exercises in political cynicism at the expense of the interests of a great Australian city that this country has seen.

It was going to be able to say at the end of its third term, `Here we are-we have picked up the rest of the reform agenda'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the Prime Minister, as I did yesterday, that if he cared about the national interest he would have spent the weekend talking about solutions to problems and not squabbling about the date of the next election. This Government will face, when its third term comes to an end, as it inevitably will, an utterly empty and an utterly unfulfilled playing out of the agenda that it set itself in July 1987. What will the Government be able to look back on? It will be able to look back on the fact that after six to seven years it has given this country the worst, or second worst, current account deficit in the OECD. It will be able to tell the Australian people that when it came to office it took 26 1/2c in the dollar of export income to service our overseas debt. Under the Hawke-Keating Government, that has climbed to 64c in the export dollar. The Government will be able to tell the Australian people that it so loves the Australian dream of home ownership that it has put it beyond the reach of ordinary Australians. It will be able to say that it has presided over the greatest tax grab on the middle income earners of Australia that this country has ever seen. It will be able to say that it is ordinary and commonplace in this country to pay 40c in the dollar once one's income is more than $19,500. It will have a great record of achievement to talk about. It will be able to say how it had the courage to do something about the waterfront, and all of these great economic reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Last December, when I launched the Future Directions document on behalf of the Liberal Party and the National Party, the initial response of the Prime Minister was to sneer and guffaw. He used to say, `Here they go, dripping with sincerity, wringing their hands with concern, parading their values'. I have news for the Prime Minister and for the Government members who sit behind him: millions upon millions of Australians want the values of the `future directions' government. They want those values because they have seen them, one by one, slip away and disappear during the six years of the Hawke-Keating Government. I invite the Prime Minister to go on sneering at the values of Future Directions. He can do so every time he speaks, because every time he does it he falls further behind politically and he falls further in the esteem of the Australian people. This Prime Minister deserves to be censured. He is a failure as an economic manager, his Government has been guilty of failed economic management, and he deserves the censure of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this motion by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) for a number of reasons. Before I proceed to demolish his very pedestrian effort, let me say that I regard it as a little amusing to be told by this man who is so admired and respected by the Australian people what I need to do to gain their respect and admiration. He does not even have the respect of his own Party. The only reason that he remains in that position, able to move this motion today, is that there is no-one else to whom those opposite are ready to turn, to whom they think they can turn. The Leader of the Opposition does not have the respect of those behind him. If there were anyone else whom they thought they could possibly move to, they would have moved. The Leader of the Opposition does not have the respect of his own Party, let alone the respect and admiration of the Australian people. Do not tell me what I have to do to gain the respect and admiration of the people of Australia. What a joke!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us clear up at the outset some of the more ridiculous of the things that have been said by the Leader of the Opposition. As is usual, he is incapable of stating the truth. He said that in the period 1985-86 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and I blamed, as he put it, the wicked foreigners for the problems in this country. There was no suggestion by me or by the Treasurer that the wicked foreigners were to blame for our problems. We made a simple statement of historical fact, that is, that it has been true during the whole of our history, being substantially a commodity producer and exporter, that we are irretrievably and irreversibly reliant upon what happens in international markets. That is not blaming foreigners; that is not saying that they are wicked; it is simply stating a fact of economic life. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985-86, in those international markets, there was a very substantial fall in the prices that we received for our coal, iron ore, meat, and wool-all of those things that we sell-which took about $10 billion out of the Australian national income. Keating and Hawke did not say, `Wicked foreigners'. That shows the depth of the inadequacy of this Leader of the Opposition. He says that we said, `Wicked foreigners are to blame'. All we said was that, in the operation of the international market as it has operated throughout the history of this country, if one is basically dependent on the export of those commodities and the price of commodities falls, one will be adversely affected. The Leader of the Opposition stated in his own document, which I quoted during Question Time, that the living standards of Australians had to fall because of what was happening. But he went further than that. Not only did he say that it was inevitable that the living standards of Australians had to fall: he had the temerity to criticise this Government for taking action in the face of those external economic factors. He had the temerity to attack us for taking action to protect the standards of those in the Australian community who are most vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition cannot get it right. He started his motion deceitfully, by saying that we blamed wicked foreigners. We did nothing of the sort. His initial deceit was then compounded by the hypocrisy of his own document-the document that he wants us to talk about this year. Let there be no mistake: we will be talking about Future Directions throughout this year. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that we will be referring in substance to that page of his document which stated that it was inevitable that in this period living standards had to fall. I will be referring to that passage and reminding everyone that not only did he say that it was inevitable that living standards had to fall but also that he criticised this Government for taking action to protect the most vulnerable in the community. Have no worry about our talking about Future Directions. We will be into it every day, because it is a veritable goldmine of disclosure of the economic ineptitude, the moral hopelessness and the absolute irrelevancy of Liberal and National Party philosophy. We will be into it every day. By the end of this year the Leader of the Opposition will be sick and tired of Future Directions. </PARA>
<PARA> Having demolished at the outset the very basis of the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition-that we were blaming wicked foreigners-let us now get down to some assessment of what the true state of the Australian economy is, which is what he was talking about. In particular, I wish to refer to the end of his speech when he asked what we will be able to look back to at the end of our three terms of government. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition finished his speech on this motion of censure on that note. Nothing will suit me more, because not only can I start to tell him what this Government can look back on after six years in government, but I can also tell him now that by the time of the next election we will have had about seven years in government and that those seven years will be able to be compared to and contrasted with his seven years in government. I can tell the Leader of the Opposition now: `Start getting your research people working, because you will need to look very closely at your achievements in that period. My colleagues and I will be looking at my achievements and we will compare and contrast the achievements of this Government with those of your seven years in government'.</PARA>
<PARA> I will give him a fore-sample of what he will have to deal with. For a start, let us look at a question which is of rather significant importance to the people of this country. I suggest to the people of this country that there is nothing more important than the question of whether they can find a secure job and what will be the prospects of their children getting a job. The Leader of the Opposition has asked me what we will be able to look back on. He should start to put this into his consideration, and compare and contrast what we will be able to look back on with his performance. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to employment the facts are that under my Government, in less than six years, we have created 1 1/4 million new jobs. That is what I will be able to look back on. The figure will be higher by the end of this term of government. Not only will I be able to say proudly to the Australian people that, as a result of the policies of my Government and with the cooperation of the trade union movement, we have been able to create 1 1/4 million new jobs, but at the next election I will also be able to ask them to compare that performance with that of the Leader of the Opposition. I will be able to tell the Australian people that during that period of six years in which we created 1 1/4 million new jobs there was an average annual employment growth rate of 3.2 per cent. I will say, `That is what I can look back on. What can the Australian electorate look back on in the seven years during which John Howard was a member of the conservative Government?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we know what the answer will be? Compared to my record of 3.2 per cent, the Opposition's miserable performance was 0.7 per cent. The honourable member has said, `What will you be able to look back on?'. On that critical point, I will say to the people of Australia that under my Government the rate of employment growth has been four times as fast as it was under Fraser and Howard. That is what I will be able to look back on with pride. </PARA>
<PARA> How will the Opposition explain the fact that we were four times better than it was in the critically important area of the creation of jobs? I will look back on that period and not only will I be able to say, as I can now, that we were four times better than the Opposition on this critically important question of employment, but also I will be able to say with pride that we have created jobs more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. The Opposition asks me what we will look back on, and on that critically important point that is what I will look back on with pride, and I will say that it has not been something that happened by accident. The people of Australia know why it has happened. It is not only because I have been blessed with Ministers of very considerable competence, who are capable of  forming--</PARA>

This record that I will be able to look back on, of a rate of employment growth four times faster than the Opposition's, has not happened by accident. It has happened because, first, we have had the competence, the wit, the intelligence and the integrity to work out relevant policies and, secondly and importantly, we have had the capacity to work with the great Australian trade union movement. As distinct from the ingrained, inherited philosophy of the tories of this country that workers and their organisations are things to be despised, we regard the ordinary working men and women of this country as people to be admired, because it is those workers, together with their employers, who have created the wealth of this country. One does not despise workers if one wants to maximise output in this country, as the Opposition did, as was part of and reflected in the essential tory philosophy. We have said that it is a much better world if we sit down with the workers and their organisations and the employers and start to bring their talents together. How do we reflect that? As I have said, we reflect it in employment, with four times the Opposition's rate of performance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have fudged the figures! I thought just a moment ago we were told that we were not allowed to question the statistics, that we had to take them as they were. I am taking the statistics as they were and as they are, and I am telling the Opposition that under my Government there has been more than a 50 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputes. That is the indisputable fact and that is part of the reason that has led to this massive increase in employment. So when the Leader of the Opposition says to me, `What will you look back on?', that is the sort of thing I will look back on: an economy which is now infinitely less divided than it was under the Opposition's confrontationist policies, a country now, at the end of the 1980s compared with the beginning of the 1980s, which is infinitely less divided and which has the capacity within the trade unions and the employers' ranks to sit down with one another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the honourable member think that, under his divisive confrontationist philosophy that marked his period of government, he could have had what is occurring now? It is historically the most remarkable transformation in the industrial relations and award system in this country, a fact which is alluded to by the metal trades employers, intrinsically the most central area of our manufacturing sector. Metal trades employers are sitting down with the trade unions, and what are they doing?</PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government-this is what I will look back on and be proud of-we have a situation where, instead of having a metal trades award with 360 ossified, historical and irrelevant classifications, we will have a metal trades award of nine classifications, an award which will be relevant to the modern processes of production, which will mean that there will be a career structure for men and women in the work force, which will mean an award structure relevant to the processes of training and retraining and which will enhance the possibility of competition and productivity in the Australian economy. That could happen only under a Labor government. It has happened only under a Labor Government. It was not possible to conceive of that sort of cooperation under the confrontationist policies of the tories in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has asked me what other areas I will be able to look back on. I come finally to education. I will be able to look back to a situation where, after the Opposition's seven years in office, we had one of the worst school retention rates in the civilised world-36 per cent. If we look back to see the rate under my Government, we see 58 per cent of our kids staying on in school. These are the things that I will be able to look back on and these are the reasons why Labor will return for its term of office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We heard from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) shades of the 1970s. There was no vision for the future, just some alleged invitation to look back. Did it not sound like the 1970s? All we got were some references to industrial disputation and employment. The reality of employment is that so much of it is part time, and at what cost? The other reality is that unemployment in this country is the highest since the Second World War, apart from the drought year of 1982-83, and the Government has had six years of world wide growth. What we have had in this country is in fact Australia's debt led recovery. That is what it amounts to. The Prime Minister should not talk to me about looking back with any pride.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that the first point Australian Labor Party supporters throughout this country will make about this Government is that they will never remember it with pride. No Labor Party member will recall with pride any achievements of this Government. The great majority of the Australian people have so much reason to suffer under the depressed living standards that the Government has dumped on them. All the Government is interested in at this juncture is the short term political framework; no medium or long term health of the economy is to be addressed. The fact is that at root the Government has oversold the economy, and tragically in the last few days the Government has decided to go out on another selling mission with no change in policy. It is a case of steady as she goes-it ought to be steady as she goes under-and the Government will stick to its blunt instrument of monetary policy and make no other adjustments. It will not pull any other levers, as the Prime Minister puts it; it is going to go out and sell. </PARA>
<PARA> What is required is a change in economic direction and not some second rate selling exercise. I tell him that outside this building it just will not work. He is increasingly being seen as flying blind. Do not tell me there was any other factor in the Prime Minister's mind when he agreed, and actually used the words, that the economic downturn was a tragedy. Does this man not know what the consequence of terminology such as that would be? Of course it would have the effect of talking down the dollar, and the market said so through various spokespersons. It was obvious that, whether it was talking down the dollar, describing the downturn in the economy as a mess or injecting into the debate in the last couple of days talk about an early election, the Prime Minister has been at the root of it all. He tries to settle an economy, yet he talks about an early election. There can be nothing more disruptive, to say nothing of the disgraceful interventions with which this Prime Minister has provided the nation in terms of his speculation on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, behind all this, there is a Budget strategy that is not working. Indeed, there is a Budget strategy that is in tatters. I ask honourable members to remember that this was the Budget that was described in two ways. It was euphemistically described to members of the press gallery as a magic pudding: some description and some ingredients! Alternatively, we heard that it was the Budget that would bring home the bacon. There is no doubt that it was referring to some other part of a pig's anatomy because the reality is now before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the fundamentals put down in the Budget. We were to have an inflation rate through this year of 4.5 per cent, but it is nearly 8 per cent. What is the response from the Government? We are told that there is another special factor. If we listen to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) we find that, every time there is a bad figure, he always says that there is a special factor. The special factor this time is the cost of housing. Everyone on this side of the House knows that, when people gather together in a community, at root there are three fundamental things that they want beyond education and other things: they and their families want to be clothed, to be fed and to have shelter. They want a roof over their heads. A roof is about all they can afford today. But Government members say that it is all too expensive to take into consideration the roof over their heads, or the shelter, and they are going to take it out of the consumer price index calculations-ignoring the reality, firstly, that they, correctly, put that element in the CPI calculation in the first place; secondly, that they are primarily responsible for the take-off in housing prices with their high inflationary programs, their high interest rates and their capital gains tax, which is the incentive for people to throw more and more money into real estate; and, finally, that they did U-turns on negative gearing. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the other fundamentals put down in that Budget? The balance of payments was supposed to improve. Inflation was to be 4.5 per cent, but it is nearly 8 per cent. The balance of payments was supposed to improve, but in fact it has deteriorated. We have achieved the annual forecast in just over seven months. It takes a touch of exquisite genius to bring about that sort of result and then dump responsibility for it on to others. Behind it all was the projection that interest rates would fall, yet, crippingly for the majority of Australians, they have gone up. </PARA>
<PARA> Behind these appalling miscalculations are depressed living standards. Day after day members on this side of the House receive with sympathy in their electorate offices person after person unable to cope with the economic conditions that this Government has brought down. The Government has been unable to sweep aside the figure that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and I produced for many months now. That figure was $56 a week; it is now $58 a week. That figure represents what the Government would have to give back to a person on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children if it were to give that person the same disposable income he had in March of 1983. It is a massive sum. We could not come into government and just throw that amount to them. But it gives the setting and shows just how much this Government has extracted from people through the effects of bracket creep in the income tax scales-to say nothing of the other tragedies that are occurring under this Government's mismanagement of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragic report produced last week is symptomatic of this Government's lack of control. It is a government for the few-and the very few. Government members come in here and talk about employment. I am able to point out to them how high in comparative terms their unemployment rate is and how searingly yet succinctly this is addressed in the report Our Homeless Children, which goes to the root of homelessness in this country. That inquiry found that homelessness and unemployment are inextricably linked and the report talks about the hopelessness of people in this situation. Government members can bring in their statistics and talk about figures, but they do not stand up in human terms. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will point out a little bit of rhetoric. The first question asked of the Prime Minister today was from the Leader of the Opposition, who asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On whose advice did the Prime Minister rely when he told the Australian people on 27 January 1989 that interest rates would not rise before they fell?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's answer was, `No particular person'. Advised, unadvised or ill-advised, no responsible Prime Minister would have done what he did. Government members know it was wrong. They know it was delinquent and they also know it was cruel to so many in the community. It was a totally misleading statement. If those opposite want to talk about rhetoric, I can give them many more examples than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, we will tell Government members what ought to be done. We will not just point out the faults and the ills. We have told them what ought to be done. It is contained in so many of our statements and wrapped up in the document that the Prime Minister will fail in seeking to destroy. That document does a brick by brick demolition of this Government. It points the way to the future and calls forth the aspirations of the Australian people in a manner that those opposite could not even comprehend. </PARA>
<PARA> We have told the Government that it ought to be embarking on a coordinated economic program. We have told it that we would do just that. We have told it that we would recognise that all are spending too much and that it is incumbent on governments, State and Federal, to get their economic houses in order and to have responsible fiscal policy. Government members should look at the 200 projects that Senator Walsh says that he could wipe out. But he said that the Government would not have the political nerve to do it. The Government has given up on fiscal policy-so that is out of the way. It will not act on that, but we will. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to wages policy. The Government will ratchet inflation up again into the wages system. We have said that we will increase wages on the basis of increased productivity. With those two things behind us, we would have the background and the setting for steadier monetary policy-not the stuff that the Treasurer has been on about, relying, in his words, on the blunt instrument of monetary policy. He denied he was squeezing it last year and now admits it. In a way there is a ground for a charge of misleading this House in the way that he now affirmed that he has been giving advice to the Reserve Bank of Australia to tighten monetary policy despite his having consistently denied it. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that, there is the need to push on with micro-economic reform-that element that was to be the hallmark of this Government's third term in office and on which it has failed so miserably. Whether in the fields of transport, communications, coastal shipping or the waterfront, the Government has stymied action. There have been more inquiries and more reports, but no movement forward in a policy direction. The Government cannot further deregulate and it will not privatise. We have a whole schedule of government bodies that could be privatised. We should bear in mind that this nation has one of the greatest number of government owned business enterprises of any member country of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. We have put out a schedule of bodies that should be privatised in order to deliver their services more effectively and efficiently. The Government cannot even get it through a conference of its own political party, let alone set out to change things for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members cannot tell us that there are no programs. There are coordinated programs and the Government would do the nation a service if it followed what we have suggested. Furthermore, we have said that we will address that innate bias the Government has created in the tax system-a bias against savings and investment. By giving tax cuts paid for primarily by cuts in government expenditure, we will be able to ensure that the reduction in public demand, which comes about by those cuts in government expenditure, offsets any rise in private demand. The Government cannot do that. It has moved away from fiscal policy and is hoist with its own petard. Its method is to utilise the surplus, which will fuel demand. In addition, we have said that we will look at-we are indeed doing it-this bias in the tax system against savings and investment and cost the concept of exempting part of interest being taxed. There is a need to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is out of control again. The Treasurer produced a typically Treasury worked, well-argued paper, he thought, to his backbenchers and the Ministers on this very question. </PARA>

The reality is that this Government is to blame not only for the depressed living standards in the nation but also for the imbalance in the fundamentals of the economy.

The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are prisoners of labour and capital in this country; they are not the leaders and they cannot come in here and give a vision of how we, in this nation, ought to be striving forward. En route they have lost all credibility as economic managers with rising inflation; with rising interest rates; with home ownership beyond the reach of many; with record taxation; and with no incentive in the nation to save. Terry McCrann, a respected columnist, summed it up on Four Corners last night when he said:</PARA>

From that I can only assume that he means that fiscal policy should be tougher. He said I was relying too much on monetary policy. I can only assume that he means we should not provide tax cuts. If those assumptions are wrong, he should tell us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know of his remarks. In terms of the principles in fiscal policy, he has no position. The shadow spokesman for finance, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has a particular responsibility but he has given no definition of the Opposition fiscal stance either. In a debate which is dominated by the question of public savings, the size of the savings pool and the spillover on to the current account, it is unbelievable that the Opposition in this country has no stance on fiscal policy. We do not know whether it believes that the public sector borrowing requirement should be bigger in surplus or smaller in surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite do not say where they stand on wages policy. We have these crocodile tears about interest rates for home buyers. Yet the Opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, has opposed every national wage case increase since 1983. Average weekly earnings would be 34 per cent lower had those objections been sustained. In other words, wages would be 34 per cent lower-the capacity of wage and salary earners would be 34 per cent lower-had those objections been sustained. Yet they have the temerity to bounce up when there is a two percentage points increase in housing rates. </PARA>
<PARA> They come in on monetary policy and cry about interest rates for housing although the shadow finance spokesman urged increases in interest rates right through 1988 and still urges them. In other words, on the one hand he says-because he wants to speak to these financial markets with, he thinks, some shred of credibility-that monetary policy should be tighter and on the other he and his colleagues come into the Parliament and in a duplicitous way argue that interest rates for housing should be left. </PARA>
<PARA> On every structural policy members of the Opposition endorse everything the Government is doing. They now believe in lower protection but, as a government, they did not believe in it. They believe in deregulation of the financial sectors of this country and economy generally, but they did not do it as a government. They believe there should be deregulation of Australia's ports and coastal shipping business. They believe in public sector efficiency. What they have said here today simply amounts to an endorsement of this Labor Government's policy. All that we have heard is not a censure framed in the context of an alternative policy strategy but a censure simply about some word that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in some election or by-election campaign. They have tried to make a mockery of some phrase or word he has used. There is nothing of substance. </PARA>
<PARA> Never are they exposed or will they be exposed, particularly the honourable member for Kooyong, to a press conference. I line up at these press conferences of 150 or a couple of hundred journalists every two weeks or every week. It must be 15 months-I cannot remember-since the Deputy Leader of the Opposition turned up at a press conference to talk about the alternative. That is because there is no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> We had again the Leader of the Opposition with a carping, pedestrian speech without any structure. He has had the Christmas break to think about where he would like to take economic policy. Given the fact that for seven years he did not know where to take it, one would not believe that Christmas would be long enough for him to get his ideas together. But he came back with a cheap political speech. He is crying crocodile tears about housing. This year the Government has presided over 160,000 homes being built. Since 1983, 810,000 homes-the better part of one million homes-have been built. In this period we have housed more Australians than any government in our history. There was not one remark from the Opposition about that; there was not one recognition of that. There was only carping criticism. He talked about Sydney home prices and then had the temerity not to mention the policies of the State Government in terms of land supply and density, et cetera. It was a totally disingenuous response to the public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to our strategy. Our strategy has been to stimulate business investment, which has been the biggest failure of economic policy of the last 40 years. We have the largest investment phase across all sectors that we have had since we have been keeping data; that is, since 1948. It is unbelievably strong, and we have it. At the same time we have a contemporary recovery with the terms of trade. So we are wrestling with what was a loss in national income of 15 per cent in 1985-86 and the terms of trade, now with a recovery rate of 20 per cent. It is a huge change in our international income. They are both good things. Strong investment is unambiguously a good thing across all sectors. A pick-up in our national wealth coming from our commodity prices is a good thing. But both things have stimulated extra activity in the economy, which has meant more imports and more inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course those indicators imply that there are problems, that the economy is so strong that we have problems in containing and supplying that level of demand. That is the basic problem. Demand is outstripping the supply side of this economy. It is outstripping the capacity of the Australian economy to supply the goods and services the community of Australia demands. The reason for that is 30 years of Liberal policy indolence in running these industries into the ground. But, of course, now that we cannot supply, some of that demand spills into imports. Of course it is a problem, but the problem is caused by inordinate strength. Yet we have this crazy debate, stimulated in here by the Opposition and by some parts of the media, who suggest that somehow the economy is in a mess. The economic strength that we have at the moment, which we have not seen before in our history in terms of the sheer size and power of our economy, is written off as a mess, and the success in restimulating investment and getting all this going is referred to by some people as a tragedy and as a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we on this side doing about it? We are keeping fiscal policy tight. We have run the public sector borrowing requirement down by seven points of gross domestic product. At the end of next year we will have the public sector of the Commonwealth of Australia the same size as it was before the Whitlam Government took office in 1972. No Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country will have changed the level of public demand and hence public savings in this way. As the Prime Minister said, we are about to preside over a wage-tax trade-off again with the trade union movement, people we admire. </PARA>
<PARA> We will break the dismal cycle of 1981 and 1974 when the honourable member for Bennelong sat powerless when wages exploded. What is worse is that he was warned by the Australian Council of Trade Unions that they would explode if his Government abandoned the system. We saw Prime Minister Fraser dash off quickly to the wedding of the Prince of Wales. He had to be at the social scene and not on the job making sure that his economy's wage system did not blow out into double digit inflation. This time we have the mechanism to break that dismal cycle. Is it any wonder that Mr Bert Evans from the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia was on AM this morning saying that our factories are booming? The union members are saying, `We do not want to go back to a scorched earth policy. We do not want to go back to factories shutting as they did under Mr Howard and Mr Fraser. We want to keep the activity going'. The fact is that the way to keep it going is through this wage-tax trade-off. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a surge of national wealth, but it is not evenly divided. Some have got more and some have got less than they should. The people who have got less are the wage and salary earners who have restrained their income demands so that we have a wage outcome of about 6 1/2 per cent this year. That is why these tax cuts will be directed at those people, the lower and middle income people who have restrained their demands, not like some of the greedy people in the professions and business who have hogged the profits and put them in their pockets and given themselves big salaries. The people in the trade union movement who have copped 6 1/2 per cent have done the right thing. They are the people we will be helping with our wages-tax trade-off. That is a sustainable wage rise. The restructuring which comes with it will give us for the first time a totally new wages system offering massive increases in productivity. That is what this Government is doing about the strength. We are maintaining a strong economy. We reject the scorched earth policy. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition uses the buzz words, the code words, `policy shifting' it means no tax cuts and no wage rises. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said the Opposition would give increases in labour productivity only. If there is strong employment growth, the labour productivity measures down, obviously, so there is no wage increase. That is what that means. It would cut essential spending and push interest rates higher, a la Dr Hewson. That is the scorched earth policy-maintain low growth, smash business activity and see unemployment rising. The people at the coalface such as Mr Evans from the Metal Trades Industry Association and those hundreds of metal trades companies that the present Opposition destroyed in the 1970s and early 1980s know what the code words mean. That is why they will not have the Opposition back. The Opposition might think we are discomfited by a few months of bad figures. Fine, but if it thinks it will save its bacon at the election it can think again because this debate today is about what it has as an alternative policy strategy. Those opposite have made a couple of cheap speeches such as one would expect at a political rally. That is what they have put up here on the first day of the sittings in what has been a change in the economic setting. If they think that is enough I think the public will reject them again. If they think they will skate home as cheats with no policy they are mistaken. That is why the censure motion needs to be rejected. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, I seek your indulgence to make a very short statement on the matter that you have just referred to. In the first place, I would invite the Government to make any statement that it wishes to on this particular matter at this stage. I see the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) shaking his head, so I assume that the sullen silence is going to continue. Secondly, this matter has raised a matter of general principle which really cannot be allowed to go by without any comment or action within this House. Therefore, I felt that I should inform you-I am not moving or attempting to move a motion now-that I am giving notice today of an intention to move a motion for the appointment of a joint select committee of the House and the Senate to inquire into and report on the principles, if any, that should govern the nature and tenure of office of quasi-judicial and other appointees to Commonwealth tribunals. It is the belief of the Opposition that it is not necessary to canvass the merits at this stage, but simply to inform the House that it is intended to move a motion for the appointment of a joint select committee so that this matter of principle can be examined. I am grateful for the opportunity to make that short statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

That claim is based on a repeatedly false database used by the Government which takes mid-1982 as the start point. In fact, if one takes mid-1983, which is a more honest start point, the variation is only 5 per cent. It is a frequently quoted figure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not going to oppose the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill which the Government has brought forward and which really contains amendments to four different Acts of parliament. The first of those amendments is to the Public Works Committee Act 1969. The second is to the Australian Protective Service Act 1987. The third is to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973. The fourth is to the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted that during Question Time the Government circulated some amendments to this legislation, and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Opposition was not informed that the Government proposed to move any amendments to this legislation. We have not been given the opportunity to become fully aware of the details of those amendments. They seem, therefore, to have been last minute thoughts that occurred to either the Department or the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West)-my suspicion is that they probably occurred to the Department rather than the Minister-and I hope that in future this side of the House could be informed of amendments that the Government proposes before the debate on the Bill starts so that we have some time to consider those amendments. If the Parliament is going to be taken seriously, then the Parliament should know and have full opportunity to consider amendments as well as legislation that are put before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, the first of these measures in the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill is a series of amendments to the Public Works Committee Act 1969. One thing that these amendments do is recognise that the Public Works Committee, which is a very effective and important committee of this House, works under a fairly heavy burden of work. Although that Committee is successfully coping with that burden, as I understand it, it would have considerable difficulties if that burden were to be increased substantially, and these amendments recognise that fact. The first of them ensures that works carried out under the deferred payment arrangement come within the purview of the Public Works Committee. That includes things like instalment purchase buildings that the Government has entered into with developers. This actual amendment will increase the work of the Public Works Committee but not substantially, and it is important that the Public Works Committee can properly examine those sorts of projects. The amendment is just clarifying what was really an anomaly in the previous legislation, an anomaly brought about by the instigation of instalment purchase buildings on the part of the Government. I have no problems with the concept of instalment purchase arrangements in the case of public buildings. I note, however, that a whole range of buildings of this kind are excluded from the consideration of the Public Works Committee. They are buildings which are being built or are owned by government trading enterprises such as Telecom Australia, Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Aust), Aussat Pty Ltd, Australian Airlines and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment addresses the definition of the term `work' to reflect the types of activities that have traditionally been referred to the Public Works Committee and seeks to exclude certain intangible things from that definition. This is a measure which will, at least potentially, ease the burden of work on the Public Works Committee. For example, intangible things that are now to be excluded include the national mapping program-I think we would all agree that is not really a building-movable works, such as tanks for the Department of Defence, and engineering equipment, which are not integral components of the work. As I have said, I think that amendment makes perfectly good sense, and certainly from my discussions with members of the Public Works Committee on this side of the House I know of no objection to that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The third of the amendments brings the works of the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) within the purview of the Public Works Committee, with the exception of works within the parliamentary zone and works of a territorial or municipal nature. As I understand it, the NCDC has actually been abolished in the context of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory, so this amendment, whilst on the face of it perfectly sensible, is not entirely consistent with other pieces of legislation that the Government has been pushing through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the amendment that has been circulated addresses that problem. I am not sure whether it does or not, but if I had had the amendment a little earlier I would have had the opportunity of finding out. Clearly, if the National Capital Development Commission has been abolished then bringing works of the National Capital Development Commission within the purview of the Public Works Committee does not make an awful lot of sense. I hope that the amendments will address that or that the Government will come up with some explanation of how that apparent inconsistency is to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Public Works Committee has to do the whole time is make some sort of assessment of the costs to the taxpayer of public works, in particular in the area of construction of new buildings. The Commonwealth Government spends, as is well known, an enormous amount of money every year on constructing new buildings and on other forms of public works, and that has been the case for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House are very sensitive to the whole issue of the expenditure of taxpayers' money. I myself for a little while was the chairman of the Opposition's Waste Watch Committee, and that Committee, I am glad to say, after going through a period of abeyance, has been re-established under the leadership of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). That reflects, as I have already said, the very real concern we have on this side of the House about the expenditure of other people's money, of taxpayers' money. We are also concerned that, when it comes to public works, and particularly the construction of buildings, the Commonwealth Government is pursuing practices which are actually leading to the expenditure of more money than might otherwise be the case, because the Government is leading the way in encouraging the continuation of Australia's longstanding restrictive work practices in the construction sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, for example, has in many cases in public works rejected the whole notion of using subcontractors as, for example, happens in the home construction industry and, by rejecting the use of subcontractors, the Government is adding to the cost of the construction of public buildings. It is very hard to estimate by how much it is adding to that cost, but people in the housing industry estimate that the addition to the cost-to taxpayers, remember-is in the vicinity of 20 to 25 per cent. Those costs can be attributed, as I have said, to the whole range of restrictive work practices and other inefficiencies which exist in the construction industry in Australia, where the Government, which is involved in many of those projects, sets the pace. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the best ways to look at what has been happening in that industry is to refer to the report Improving Work Practices in the Australian Building Industry produced by Professor Vernon Ireland of the University of Technology in Sydney. That report reveals very dramatically that when taxpayers' money is involved in construction projects it can and is being so easily wasted because of the failure over the years of the Government to address the sorts of inefficiencies I have referred to and, indeed, its tendency to encourage such practices in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to some of the uneconomic work practices in Australia which Professor Ireland referred to and which are very much alive and well in the public sector when it comes to construction. First of all, the Ireland report, which compares the performance of Australia with the United States and with Britain, says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . industrial disputation is the largest single source of inefficiency on major building projects in Australia. Since the U.S.A. and the U.K. building industries can work with virtually no loss of time due to industrial disputes it is assumed that it is possible to avoid much lost time in the Australian building industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The comparative figures are extremely revealing. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA> The average time lost for the projects which were sampled, due to industrial disputes, is 16.9% of days worked . . . However, in the central business district of one of the major cities the average time lost is in excess of 40% of days worked . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have major industrial relations problems in Australia in the construction industry, which includes the public sector construction industry and, sadly, nothing is being done about it. The option of turning to the subcontracting system, which has been so fantastically successful in the home construction industry, is one that, at the public sector level, the Government has simply not contemplated. Really, if the Government is serious about being responsible with taxpayers' money, that is something that it ought to consider in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the other practices that take place in the construction industry are quite remarkable. Let me just run through a couple of those:</PARA>
<PARA>The average time lost through what is described as inclement weather-</PARA>
<PARA>and we have great weather in Australia, so it is rather curious that we compare so badly on this scale-</PARA>
<PARA>was 10.6% of days worked on the sampled projects. Much of this loss of time does not occur in the U.S.A. and in the U.K., as the average time lost in these countries was 2.1% of days worked. </PARA>
<PARA>That is funny, because everybody in this House and everybody in Australia knows that the United Kingdom, if it is known for anything, is known for its bad weather. I am not sure what the comparative statistics are, but we all know Britain has much worse weather than Australia, many more inclement days than Australia. How is it that the average time lost on construction sites in Australia because of inclement weather is five times as high as it is in the United Kingdom, in a country in which, let me repeat, the weather is irrefutably less clement than is the case in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Even though we have better weather, we have some pretty stupid practices. Professor Ireland gives the example of a refusal to walk on a wet earth surface in order to get to a dry area of work. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There was then a refusal to put planks down on the wet earth, in order to make it a safe area on which to walk, because men would have to walk on the wet earth in order to put the planks down and this is dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA>This is just not the real world. This is simply a way to try to minimise the amount of work people do and is a major historical problem. Professor Ireland goes on-this is not my view; this is Professor Ireland's view-to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Some sites reported workers playing football in their lunch hour in the rain after refusing to work. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, I would have thought that playing football in the rain was more dangerous than just walking across wet earth to get to a dry area in order to go ahead with construction. I find some of those sorts of practices quite extraordinary. Professor Ireland goes on and on with such examples. I will not take up the time of the House by going through too many of them, but I find those practices extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me is that those practices are occurring on public sector sites. In many respects the public sector has been the trailblazer in promoting these sorts of restrictive work practices. The Hawke Government has had six years in office to do something about these things. As far as I know, it has done absolutely nothing. The Minister for Administrative Services, who is sitting at the table, has taken not one single initiative to try to save taxpayers' money by improving the efficiency of the construction industry, particularly in the public sector. That is a great indictment of this Government's attitude to taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more important for the Government to give its mates in the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) what they want than it is to give taxpayers a fair deal for their money. That is a very sad indictment of this Government. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr West" NAMEID="XJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that I know very little about the BLF. I am from South Australia and I can tell him that the BLF is alive and well in that State. It is one of the States in which it is still alive and well. The Minister, who comes from Wollongong and who claims to have a long background in the union movement and in Labor politics-he obviously does-must know about the building unions. He has done nothing about the restrictive work practices. I am afraid that he has done nothing about a great deal. That is a pretty sad indictment of the record of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to move on very briefly to the other areas covered by this legislation. In addition to dealing with the amendments to the Public Works Committee Act, the legislation also covers amendments to the Australian Protective Service Act 1987 to extend the list of specified offences for which Protective Service officers have the power to arrest without warrant. These offences-namely, escaping from lawful custody, aiding a person to escape from lawful custody, or rescuing a person by force from lawful custody-were recently created by amendments to the Crimes Act 1914. These amendments are essentially consequential to the Crimes Act amendments and the Opposition has no difficulty with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect of the legislation is the amendments to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 to provide the option of appointing a part time chairman to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. As the House will know, the current chairman is Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, who I understand is to retire in the course of this year. I also understand that it was Justice Else-Mitchell who recommended this initiative and amendment to the Minister-I would have been surprised if the Minister had come up with an initiative himself-so as to provide greater flexibility in the appointment of a new chairman when he retired from the Commission. Apparently the number of people who can do the job is pretty limited, and the feeling is that a wider field of appointees could be attracted if there were a choice as to whether the position would be part time or full time. It is also important to make the point that if the next chairman is appointed on a part time basis more members might have to be appointed to the Commission. At the moment there are two other members, other than the Chairman, on the Commission. They are Mr Ron Lane, a former Dean of Economics at the University of Queensland, and the very well known Russell Mathews from the Australian National University. The Opposition has no difficulties at all with that commonsense amendment to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the legislation amends the Parliament House Construction Authority Act 1979 to reduce the number of members of the board of the Parliament House Construction Authority from six to three. That amendment obviously recognises the fact that the new Parliament House is finished or is largely finished and the services of people such as interior decorators are no longer required on the board. Hence, naturally enough, the numbers on the board are to be reduced. One of the three members to be removed from the board will be the NCDC Commissioner. I have mentioned already that the NCDC has been abolished. I hope that the Minister will realise this when we deal with his amendments to this legislation later in the afternoon. The names of the two others to be removed from the board of the Authority have not yet been revealed. I do not know whether the Minister has made a decision on that, but we would be interested to know whom he has chosen. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, except for the anomaly of bringing the works of the abolished National Capital Development Commission within the purview of the Public Works Committee, the Opposition has no real difficulties with this legislation. I hope that that very small technical anomaly will be rectified. </PARA>

As the honourable member for Mayo was gracious enough to say, it is an effective and important Committee, and I thank him for his comments. The Public Works Committee (PWC) is indeed hard working. It is made up of members of both Houses and from all sides of politics. I must say that in the four years in which I have been a member of that Committee I know of no issue on which there has been a division on party lines. There is very rarely a division in the Committee and any division there might have been has never been on party lines. I also pay tribute to the very capable and hard working staff of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members would be aware, the Public Works Committee Act 1969 established the Public Works Committee to scrutinise the Executive's expenditure on public works. Since the inception of the Committee, departments and, to an extent, the Committee itself have regarded `works' as being limited to those of a permanent architectural or engineering nature carried out for or by the Government. Movable works, such as the construction of a ship, have long been regarded as being of the nature of specialised procurements which ought not be subject to the Act. However, in recent years, legal advice to the effect that movable works may in certain circumstances be works within the terms of the Public Works Committee Act has called this view into question. To remove the ambiguity as to what comes within the definition of a `work' for the purpose of the Act, the amendments introduced by this Bill provide that `work' means an architectural or engineering work and specifically excludes intangible things, movable works and engineering equipment not being integral components of the work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Works Committee welcomes the major thrust of this legislation as it affects the Committee. As pointed out by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) in his second reading speech on 12 October 1988, one of the major provisions relating to the Public Works Committee is to ensure that works carried out under deferred payment or similar arrangements come within the purview of PWC. This is an important aspect because over the last couple of years, as governments have been looking at different ways to finance their public works, more and more works have come under the deferred payments system. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also defines the term `work' to reflect the types of activity that have traditionally been referred to the Public Works Committee. As I said before, the amended definition provides that `work' means an architectural or engineering work and specifically excludes intangible things, movable works and engineering equipment not being integral components of a work. I have only one small reservation about this, which I brought to the attention of the Minister earlier. I am concerned whether the nature of a particular piece of equipment will have an impact on the construction of the building in which it will be housed. I have discussed this matter with the Minister and, indeed, with my Committee. We sometimes feel that, if one is going to erect a building worth, say, $10m or $12m that will house equipment worth, say, $80m or $90m, perhaps the very nature of the building will be dependent on the equipment that is installed in it. Nevertheless, that is going to be excluded from the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. On a personal level, I regret that slightly; nevertheless, that is the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also allows proposals to be referred to the Public Works Committee at the most appropriate stage of the planned development. This will provide for works to be referred where, because of their nature, only limited design work can be completed before Committee consideration is necessary. Again, this is very important because the Public Works Committee knows that in many cases it is unrealistic and would impose an unnecessary delay on a work if every minute detail-every door, every nut and every bolt-were provided on a plan for us. The honourable member for Mayo talked about costs. We are all anxious to contain costs. It is important that we do contain costs and that the Committee does not delay the work in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Committee believes that the proposed amendments are workable and will allow a greater degree of flexibility in the operation of the Committee. Most importantly, they clarify the present uncertainty regarding the definition of a work. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are, in another capacity, the Deputy Chairman of the Committee, so I am delighted that you are now occupying the chair. However, there are two matters which I believe are worthy of further consideration. The first is the proposed amendment to section 40 of the Public Works Committee Act, which provides that the Governor-General may take into consideration any recommendations made by the Committee before making regulations in relation to public work. For example, matters can be declared to be, or not to be, works. While it is pleasing to note that the role of the Committee is recognised in the amendment, I seek the Minister's assurance that the purpose of the amendment is for types of works to be so declared, and not individual works. My concern is that individual works could be excluded from Public Works Committee scrutiny without reference to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I ask the Minister to consider one other matter in relation to the Public Works Committee Act. Section 6a (3) gives the Governor-General power to make regulations excluding authorities of the Commonwealth from the Public Works Committee Act. Australia Post and Telecom Australia have recently been excluded in this way. What I am suggesting is that the Minister consider amending section 6a (3) to bring it into line with the proposed amendment to section 40, with the effect that the Governor-General, before making regulations relating to the exclusion of authorities of the Commonwealth, will take into consideration the views of the Committee. They are the only two reservations I have about this legislation. The Public Works Committee as a whole welcomes these amendments. We think that they tighten up the legislation and make it much more workable. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn very briefly to a couple of comments that the honourable member for Mayo made about cost to the taxpayer. I invite the honourable member for Mayo to examine all the evidence that has been put before the Public Works Committee to see just how carefully members of that Committee scrutinise these works and how we, as a committee, are very much concerned with cost, especially with overruns. It is very easy to be critical. I am often fairly critical, and I am very critical of overruns, but each project is different. It is very easy to put everything in the one basket and give the Builders Labourers Federation and other people a serve. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that Committee members, who are from all sides of politics, look very carefully at the evidence and examine the witnesses that come before us. We are concerned about the cost of buildings. In fact, we have been so concerned over recent years that we have singled out a couple of buildings for special attention. We have said to the people giving evidence before the Committee, `Okay, you have told us what your projected out-turn cost is going to be. We are going to watch this project and we will require reports from you every couple of months'. We do that, and we get these reports. It is not true to say that the Government has sat back and not taken any account of these matters. Most certainly all members of the Public Works Committee-not only Government members-are scrupulous in their scrutiny of the projects that come before the Public Works Committee. More than most people because of the number of references that come before us, we are concerned that the Australian taxpayer gets the best possible value for his dollar. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I treat this matter very seriously, I treat the incidents of last week very seriously, and I treat the legislation that is before the House very seriously. That is why I think it desir- able that the House and the nation know which Minister is in the House at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to focus on two areas covered by the Bill: the amendments relating to the Public Works Committee Act and the amendments relating to the Parliament House Construction Authority Act. I remind the House that the Public Works Committee does a lot of good work. In the last 12 months it has conducted hearings in many places, including Mulwala, where it recommended in favour of the key decentralisation project known as the REFA project-the rationalisation of explosives factories in Australia-which is decentralising key facilities of the Department of Defence from Melbourne to Mulwala. That construction phase is now in full swing. It was a very worthwhile hearing. Likewise, last week, you, Mr Deputy Speaker, accompanied by other members of the Committee, conducted very constructive hearings at Albury-Wodonga in relation to the $68m Latchford Barracks upgrading. Again, the Committee worked at its best on a bipartisan basis. It searched out information from officials present in relation to matters of security and the potential for flooding of the project. This caused the officials to make doubly sure of the information that they made available to the Committee. Ultimately, at the end of the day, hopefully this will save considerable amounts of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context I highlight the fact that governments must listen to the Public Works Committee's recommendations and reports if it is to be a truly successful and integral part of parliamentary activity. Of course, it was the Public Works Committee which so properly recommended several years ago in regard to the new Brisbane Airport, only to find a massive deafness on the part of certain people in government at that time. We have not heard the end of that matter in terms of the way in which the main runway at Brisbane Airport was constructed contrary to the recommendations of the Public Works Committee. Because of this, we are already seeing aircraft diverted in cross-wind component situations because that main runway is in the wrong location. Everyone, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker, an experienced pilot of great effort-and I know that I cannot dwell on these matters-has said quite clearly that that runway is in the wrong place and that there are many other things wrong with Brisbane Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to make another suggestion. The Public Works Committee had the courage to bite the bullet. Let it seek from the Minister a further recommendation to do a 28-day hearing and recommendation on the stubway or runway at Mascot Airport because there is only one answer that I am sure it would come back with-I mention this only in passing-and that is that it would be in favour of such a third runway, as every other inquiry of substance has been, to solve that particular problem. I hope the Government will see reason on that matter, by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) overruling Messrs Punch and Richardson before too much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the question of the amendments to the Parliament House Construction Authority Act, I have to say that this Bill stops short of a sunset clause in relation to that Authority but does prepare for the winding down phase of what has been a very hard-working and successful authority in many ways. Of course, we are the recipients of that success. I make the point, however, that this building ultimately will be judged only on its performance for the Australian people-I believe that jury is still out-as we get used to this building and as members of Parliament gradually get on top of the building instead of the building being on top of the them, as surely was the case for the first six months or so. </PARA>
<PARA> Today again, we had the minor irritation of hot air being blown in from the air-conditioning system in this section of the building, rather than cool air. As the Opposition successfully turned up the temperature of the debate, this exacerbated the situation. I am advised that the shutters in the chamber are computer controlled on a four-year cycle. I repeatedly raised the matter last year and I have raised it again this year because I am concerned about skin cancer; it has affected me. That four-year cycle must be out of kilter because I got zapped twice again today. I understand that that also is being looked at. But those are minor points. This building will be judged on its performance for the people. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one key point I wish to make in relation to the Parliament House Construction Authority, and that is to commend its work and hope that the fine tuning of the building is completed satisfactorily. But I also hope that those who are in positions of control and leadership will consider ways of making the building operate more constructively. I am delighted to learn that a new precedent will be set this Friday when for once the House of Representatives chamber will not be invaded by a series of State Ministers and Premiers for yet another summit. That summit will be quite properly conducted in committee room No. 1, that grand inquisition room, where I hope all future Premiers Conferences will also be conducted. It is the main committee room just beyond the central function halls and it is tailor-made for the purpose. I make a plea in the context of this debate and hope that both the House of Representatives chamber and the Senate chamber will be used very carefully for any purpose other than the sittings of both the House and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to reiterate a point that I made last year: arrangements ought to be further investigated to see whether it is possible for members of this magnificent Parliament House to be able to walk into a gallery on the ground floor of the Senate chamber to observe proceedings in the Senate, and vice versa for senators to be able to walk into a cordoned off portion on the ground floor of the House of Representatives chamber. If we are to improve the governance of this country, if we are to improve the parliamentary legislative activity of this country, it does require maximum liaison and coordination between both chambers of the Parliament. Yet we have come to a stage where we have almost locked doors and impossible barriers if we want to carry out the simple exercise of going across to see honourable senators or catching up with what is happening in the Senate chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposed to the Bill. It is concerned about some of the work practices so adequately referred to by my colleague, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). I wish the Public Works Committee well in its deliberations. I know that the honourable member for Mayo will make our points even clearer when he speaks in the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Obviously there is not a great deal to respond to after hearing what has been said on behalf of the Opposition on the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill. This is an omnibus Bill which addresses four different Acts. It addresses the Public Works Committee Act, and it clarifies the type of works which fall within the parameters of the scrutiny of the Standing Committee on Public Works. As has been pointed out, it defines public `work' to mean work of a fixed architectural or engineering nature. Intangible things, movable works and engineering equipment are specifically excluded. The definition of a `work' is in addition amended to ensure that works financed under the deferred payment system, that is the instalment payment system, or similar arrangements, are referred to the Committee. There has been some doubt about that in the past and of course we have made certain that they do fall within the ambit of the Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been said, this Bill also amends the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act and allows for the appointment of a part time Chairman, in line with existing options for appointing part time members. This does not mean that we have any preconceptions about whether chairmen ought to be full time or part time. The Government will now simply have that option. The Bill also provides for amendments to the Protective Service Act. As has been discussed, the amendments to the Parliament House Construction Authority Act restructure the membership downwards to provide for a smaller membership-six to three-and set a quorum of members for meetings of the Authority. This Authority is intended to be wound up by approximately June 1991. The reason it is operating for so long, even in a reduced form, is that there would be about 500-odd contracts over that period remaining to be finalised. There are some areas of disputation and it all takes time. We would expect that the Authority would be finally phased out in about June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address some of the comments that were made by the Opposition regarding the alleged lack of initiatives of the Government's building industry policy in the last few years and to refute these remarks. It was the former Government, the current Opposition, which basically let the housing and construction industry and, in this particular instance, the non-residential construction industry degenerate over time. It was at a very low level of activity when we took over in 1983. One of the reasons for that was not only the then economic situation, as was discussed today, but also the fact that over a long period there was no successful action against disruptive elements in the industry, namely the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF), by the former Government. It was this Government that successfully deregistered the BLF in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, thus opening up a period of relative peace in the non-residential construction industry. It was this Government that introduced a code of conduct. It was this Government which convinced large construction companies and their peak representative groups, such as the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors and the Master Builders Association, to support that code of conduct. It was aimed at lessening the impact that the BLF would have on the industry as a result of support of BLF demands by renegade road building and construction companies. It was this Government that received the support of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the other major union in the building industry, the Building Workers Industrial Union (BWIU), for what we set out to achieve. Of course the unions affiliated with the ACTU-not the BLF-the companies in the industry and the community generally were supportive of the action we took. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is not true for the Opposition spokesman to say that this Government has been inactive in the industry over the last few years. In stark contrast to the situation when the Opposition was in power, we did all this at a time of high level activity in the non-residential construction industry. That situation still obtains. There are 500,000-plus people employed in housing and construction, the majority in non-residential construction. All that has occurred in a relatively benign industrial relations situation. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of this was the way in which this very building, the new Parliament House, was completed by the Parliament House Construction Authority (PHCA), which is the subject of a component of this Bill. An example of what I am talking about is the way in which the PHCA was able to complete this building on time for its opening in May last year and its occupation in August last year, without any real attempt by the unions involved-in particular the BWIU-to exploit the deadset deadline for the opening and occupation of the building. I made it quite clear to the unions in 1987, after the last election, when I took responsibility for the PHCA, that we expected cooperation and that we did not expect them to try to use that situation industrially. To their credit, they did cooperate. So the Opposition cannot say that nothing of a beneficial nature has occurred in this industry over the last five to six years; it has. </PARA>
<PARA> Another positive element in the Government's policy with regard to the non-residential construction industry has been the way in which we have been able to cooperate with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the main unions in the industry to support the restructuring of awards. This was discussed in the debate this afternoon. There is no question but that the main union in non-residential construction today is the BWIU. There is no doubt about that union's support for restructuring. Of course, it is a militant union; but, in my view, it is a responsible union-much more so than the BLF, which operated previously in the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and New South Wales. The BWIU is definitely on side so far as restructuring is concerned. Tom McDonald, the Federal Secretary of the union, is one of the main exponents of the benefits of restructuring as a means of improving the career paths and skills of its members and the way that the industry operates and as a means of delivering controlled wage increases in line with the wages-tax trade-off which we expect to occur later this year. As I have said, it is wrong of Opposition members to say that nothing of a beneficial nature has happened in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I point out that the Australian Construction Services, which is the public works division of the old Department of Housing and Construction now in a number of separate divisions within the Department of Administrative Services under a new name, is, following Cabinet considerations and decisions which I announced in the middle of last year, in a period of considerable reform and reconstruction. Cost recovery is being implemented. There will be full commercialisation in that the private sector will be allowed to compete for jobs within the public sector. This will commence full stream in June 1991. The ACS is now preparing for that. That is something that the previous Government never did. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members talk about commercialisation and the rights of the private sector to compete for government work and so on, but they never did anything about it when in government. What we have done is to open up the Federal public works function for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> The public works function has been present in a number of forms virtually since Federation. It has been within the Department of Works, the Department of Transport and Works, the Department of Housing and Construction, et cetera. All through those years the departments had developed the mentality of being a public works authority and of being the only ones who knew what to do and were capable of working for the Federal government, with its instrumentalities, government business enterprises and other departments. All that will change. It will be a big change. That whole mentality has to change and the new body will have to accept that it has to become competitive, as it is in many cases now, with the private sector. Otherwise, it will not get work from, say, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Defence, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and so on. The clients-that is, the Federal departments and instrumentalities-will have the choice of whether they want to deal with the ACS. That is a big change. It is not correct for the Opposition to say that, under my Ministry, nothing has happened. Things have happened. This is a big change, and I have the utmost confidence in the ability of the ACS to perform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo says, `Next to nothing'. I am saying that this is the biggest thing that has happened in the history of the Federal public works, and it has happened in the last 12 months. The whole system of servicing Federal public works is changing. Under the previous Government there was the simple process-this obtained also for a while under our Government-under which departments put forward their concepts, a wish list if you like. Some of them were considered under new policy as initial design and budget approval. It was always a bit of a shemozzle. One never knew until the end of the day what would succeed and get budget approval to become an approved civil work. There was no real capacity to project ahead for a period of three to five years what the total financial commitment or outlays would be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is now a whole new pruning process on the way into the Public Works Committee, and coming out of the Public Works Committee, which allows for a much better Government and Cabinet overview of what is happening. The process will be controlled so that we will be able to see what the outlays will be year by year, three to five years into the future. It is a much better process than the previous Government was ever able to implement in its period in office. I did not intend to mention those matters; I did not bring in notes from which to draw. But I certainly know what happened in this portfolio. One has no difficulty whatsoever in refuting the silly statements made by the Opposition today on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the suggestions that have been made by the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), and his request for further amendments, the best thing to do is to suggest that we will take those matters into consideration and examine what he has said. </PARA>

I will simply speak to these three amendments and then suggest to the Committee how the fourth amendment fits into the whole package so that I will not have to repeat the procedure when I move amendment (4) to omit clause 5. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments result from the drafting difficulties associated with the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) self-government legislation. The Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill was drafted at the same time as the legislation to implement self-government for the Australian Capital Territory. With the enactment of the ACT self-government legislation, there is a need for some minor amendments to the proposed amendments to the Public Works Committee (PWC) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the enactment of the ACT self-government legislation, section 5 (d) of the PWC Act provided that a work carried out by or on behalf of the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) for the Commonwealth or on behalf of a Commonwealth authority was exempt from scrutiny by the Public Works Committee. The amendments in the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill-that is the law we are talking about here today-sought to give effect to the Government's desire for NCDC works of a national nature to be subject to the scrutiny of the PWC. The legislation to implement ACT self-government repealed sections 5 (d) and 6b of the PWC Act. Section 6b provided that NCDC works could be referred to the PWC by regulation. The repeal of sections 5 (d) and 6b negated the need for the amendments proposed in the portfolio Bill today. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect, therefore, of the ACT self-government legislation, our amendments and this Bill is to allow for PWC scrutiny of works carried out by or on behalf of the Commonwealth within the ACT, with the exception of works within the parliamentary zone which of course are subject to discussion by the Parliament itself. Works to be carried out by or on behalf of the new ACT government-that is, works of a territorial or municipal nature-will not be subject to Public Works Committee scrutiny. I hope that clarifies the situation. Later I will move for the omission of clause 5. </PARA>

He made the point that is repeatedly made by the Government, that is, that it deregistered the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). It did; there is no question of that. But let me remind the Government that the Fraser Government moved to deregister the BLF. Those deregistration proceedings were under way at the time of the 1983 election. The Labor Party always opposed the Fraser Government's proceedings and when it came to power it terminated those proceedings. If it had not terminated the proceedings in 1983, it would have saved the taxpayers a lot of money on public construction and it would have saved the community resources as well. Why the Government left it so long, I will never know. It must be put on the record that the Fraser Government took the initiative and that initiative was cancelled by the Hawke Government. It took the Hawke Government years and years to realise its mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister boasts that the Government has improved the efficiency of the construction industry. The Ireland report, Improved Working Practices in the Australian Building Industry, from which I quoted, was published in 1988-last year. The examples that I read from the Ireland report were very telling about how little has been done in six years. For heaven's sake, one would expect something to have been done over six years. What is sad is that so little has been done over that period. For example, if one looks at the Government's industrial relations record-I will make one final comparison-one will see that in the last year of the Fraser Government there was a 53 per cent decline in industrial disputation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the House refers to the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, which is investigating the vast wad of corporate Bills that were introduced here last year. It is the largest piece of legislation ever to be introduced into the Australian Parliament and, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) once said, the most important. Let us recall some of the history of this infamous legislation. It was introduced on almost the last sitting day of the autumn session last year. The original legislation was over 3,000 pages long. The legislation was debated just four months later. On the day of the debate the Attorney introduced 280 amendments, of which I was given a copy just before 6 p.m. the day before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was necessary to establish a special committee to sort out the mess. Over 40 substantial submissions, containing many hundreds of pages of evidence, were received. The pile of submissions was about two feet high. The Committee has been given a very short period in which to hear evidence around Australia. It is no wonder it is seeking an extension of time in view of what it has collected. The collection of oral and written evidence has created a substantial amount of interest. The Committee has received masses of vital information. For the first time the debate has raged in a healthy fashion with all business interests represented. This is the first time that the whole of the legislation has been canvassed around the capital cities of Australia. As I have said before, there is never a need to rush company law. It is not a matter on which people have to make instant decisions and it is not a matter of taxation, but it is a matter on which the corporate sector of Australia has to be taken along in a cooperative sense. It must be involved, it must understand the changes and it must know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation to which 280 amendments were passed in the last session before it went to the Senate has not been reproduced. Why? The Attorney says that it will cost $40,000. It did not seem to worry the Attorney-General that the Government spent $40m on a referendum that went well and truly down the drain, but we did not even reproduce the amended legislation so that the corporate sector could take an informed view on an important matter of company law. If one did not read CCH Australia Ltd publications or the other well known publications for which Professor Austin writes, one would not be in the position to know what is proposed in the legislation. I am glad that the Committee has had the opportunity to go around Australia giving the business community and the corporate sector the chance to put their views. </PARA>
<PARA> I will name a few of the items which were discussed on the tour de force around Australia. The proposal to dump the pre-vetting of prospectuses has created a very lively debate in the community. It is particularly evident that a large number of people are not of the view, as put forward originally by the Attorney-General and which was not canvassed widely, that pre-vetting should be dumped. Now it is back on the agenda. Also discussed was the expansion of the civil liability of those involved in preparing prospectuses. This was proposed originally but, because of the 36 faceless men who were involved and because their position in relation to the liability was on the line, it was watered down. We did not hear from the Attorney on that one. That went through to the keeper. The Committee has brought that back into focus, which is a very good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased powers of the Attorney-General's Department and the reduced powers of the proposed Australian Securities Commission were also discussed. This very important point was raised by many people. Many of the amendments brought forward in the legislation mean that the current power of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) will be reduced in its proposed new form. In essence, it is the one telephone fix syndrome. The Government has had great success with Western Australia Inc. and in New South Wales in the past. This legislation is about the one phone call fix. I am pleased that the Committee has had an opportunity to focus on that and to hear from more of the real practitioners around Australia and not just the faceless men. The requirement for interim reports to be made on investigations is another important point. It has certainly been brought to the fore in recent times in relation to a number of prominent companies, especially some Western Australian associations. </PARA>
<PARA> Also discussed was the attachment of transcripts to investigation reports. That is enormously important. Another item discussed was the attachment of privilege to documents involved in an investigation, rendering them unable to be used in subsequent prosecutions. The transfer of declarations of unacceptable conduct from the NCSC to a new Corporations and Securities Panel was another item. I indicated in the previous debate on this matter that this represented a very significant downgrading of what I call a quick response. It is very important in the securities market that the market get a decision promptly so that the market itself can be dealt in on an informed basis. The old axiom that security in the law is all important in commerce applies here more than ever. Under the proposal for the new Corporations and Securities Panel, the Securities Commission cannot declare a particular deal as unacceptable. It can only refer it to the Panel, which then must meet to make the decision. Delays are inevitable. While the principle of judge and jury might be applicable, the greater corporate good would be achieved by leaving the power where it lies at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The serious hidden agenda allegations made by the NCSC must be addressed by the Committee. The Commission has made the substantial allegation that this whole proposition was based on a secret agenda. That is a very powerful argument, and one that I raised in the debate here. It was vigorously denied by the Attorney, yet it has been named by the head of the Commission as one of the items to be considered. It is a point which the Committee, chaired by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), must address. Credibility is on the line. The Executive Director of the NCSC voiced concern on behalf of the Commission. Mr Schoer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we feel there is a continuation of lack of information getting to the Minister as to what is going on, because we would say that the Minister's Department is fully informed . . . his officers pick up the phone frequently and ask questions and always get answers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those honourable members who have been in the chamber during the debate will recall the many occasions on which I said to the Attorney-General, `Ring them up. You have to know'. He vigorously denied to the House any knowledge whatsoever. He said he could not get any information. I said that that was wrong because I had been in his position, that I could get the information and he could get it. The office of the Executive Director of the Commission has advised that the Attorney-General's office was thoroughly informed on every aspect of Rothwells Ltd-and the Attorney denied it. It means that either the Attorney misled the House or he is incompetent. If he is not incompetent, his communications with the Department are appalling and unacceptable. If the Attorney-General's Department is informed by the National Companies and Securities Commission, as has been said by its Executive Director, and it is not informing the Minister, the Secretary to the Department ought to be fired. If, on the other hand, as the Attorney said in the House, he was not informed and he did not know how to obtain the information, at the very least he is incompetent and he has come very close to misleading the House on the whole matter of Rothwells, as proven in this case. It is the most serious allegation in relation to the dealings of a Minister with his department that I have heard in my time both as a Minister and as a shadow Minister. Not once have I heard anybody raise the question in this Parliament. What occurred on that occasion is absolutely scandalous. I will continue to quote Schoer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have had an unfortunate couple of years trying to keep the Attorney briefed on particular matters. I am sure you will recall times in Parliament he has said, ``I cannot tell you because I have not been informed''. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Attorney said, as quoted by Schoer to the Committee. It is in the transcript. It is an absolute scandal that the Attorney-General's Department has either deliberately misled the Minister, or the Minister is too incompetent to obtain the facts. It has come to earth as a consequence of this Committee's hearings. I hope that will be addressed, because I will be continuing to press the matter. Mr Schoer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission is very deeply concerned that there should be any suggestion that the Parliament should not be informed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not bad. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA>We know we tell the Department. The Minister said he does not know . . . So somebody is stuffing it up. </PARA>
<PARA>That is completely correct, but why was he not informed? It gives credence to the hidden agenda syndrome, the grab for power by the Attorney-General's Department which I alluded to in September-October last year. It is an appalling performance, an attempt to change company law in Australia which is the greatest grab for centralised power to take place in Australia since Federation. The Department is covering up advice from the Securities Commission, not informing the Attorney-General, and he does not have the nous to follow through the matter and question the Secretary to the Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he did not want to know, then he was covering up for the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia. So we can take our pick. On all counts the Attorney-General stands condemned in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wish to refer to the appalling way in which the consultation process was carried out. If the Attorney-General had carried out a proper course of consultation in the first place, this waste of time and money could have been avoided. We should have had proper consultation around Australia. When we set up the cooperative scheme in Australia it took three years. Thirty-six faceless mates-all except one, Bill Beerworth, who ditched the boat in the last day-came up with this proposal. People were not consulted. It was not until the Government's committee got on the road that it had a chance. We know what is being said around Australia about it-how popular it is with everybody around the place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill that has come before the House is in an absolute shambles. Even the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Ronald Edwards, has voiced some concern at the apparent favouritism shown by the Attorney-General's Department towards certain big business interests to the detriment of the wider business community. In a transcript he is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am puzzled by the great disparity that developed between the legislation which arose from the consultative process and the submissions that were put before us. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a bad admission of how he bungled things. The Chairman of the Committee says that he does not know how the discrepancy occurred between the big business interests and the submissions before him. No wonder there was a shambles here last year when I addressed this matter. For 18 hours we could not get the Attorney-General to answer questions. He did not know the answers. He was not briefed. He had briefing officers sitting in the House for 18 hours over two days. He did not have to use the telephone to find out then what was going on in the Securities Commission. He only had to walk up there to find out what was going on around the place. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to conclude because it is getting too exciting! The draftsmen in the Attorney-General's Department have much to answer for after the last effort of 280 amendments. If that occurs again the business community will lose complete faith in the professionalism of the Department. Business will certainly cringe at the thought of that Department running the Australian Securities Commission-an absolutely absurd thought at the present moment. It is inevitable that many hundreds of amendments will be required to correct the badly flawed legislation so that the business community can carry on with business as usual. After the new amendments are introduced as a consequence of the Edwards Committee, the Opposition will insist upon a further consultation period in which to study the unintended consequences and errors of these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has raised a number of issues. What I ought to be at pains to say in my remarks is that I am not pre-empting the deliberations of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation as to content about the Committee. I think it is appropriate to respond as to why the Committee is seeking an extension of time, but I would not want to canvass the matter that the Committee has to deliberate on. Clearly there is a great deal of material there to deal with. However, I think it is important in the context of the remarks made by the honourable member for Ryan to set the picture straight in terms of the way I would see the consultation process and the exercise we have gone through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ryan referred to the consultation in the steering group and the consultative group that took place prior to our Committee commencing procedures. This Committee has gone to great trouble to try to hear as many people and as many submissions in as many locations as possible. I acknowledge the support of my colleagues on the Committee who have given of their time. If I were to make one observation it would be that the people who have appeared before us have said that they have been impressed by the intelligent searching and interrogation by members of the Committee. I think I ought to acknowledge that now. Obviously, I will do that later but I will also do it now. It is fair to say that the community at large felt there needed to be more consultation. It was appropriate that this submission process gave them that chance. By and large that has happened; the consultation process that was necessary has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that has to be said-and it is true of all changes, particularly in relation to something as far reaching as corporations law-is that when we bring about changes there will be a process of reaction and, to an extent, rejection. We have encountered that; there is no doubt about that. Right around Australia there has been a lack of knowledge about the issue and, because of that, people have been willing to say they do not want the changes. We have to filter out the rejection which is simply a rejection of change from the substantive rejection, which amounts to rejection of content. We are doing that. It is important to say to the House that that is why we sought an extension of time. It would be a nonsense for us to say that we have heard all the submissions, that we have taken account of a lot of detailed material and that, as a result, we can make snap judgments. We cannot do that. I would have thought that, to be fair to the people who have given evidence, we need that extra time to consider the volume of material that has been put before us. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a series of agendas running. There has been the general process of bringing in a legislative change which in itself is very far-reaching. That is acknowledged on both sides of the House. At the same time it is change which, given the nature of corporate life in this country, is probably necessary. The second agenda that is running is that there are people out there who have their own interests. These interests are being influenced in some respects. Again, we are going to get reaction and rejection to some extent. I suspect that that is also understandable. The third issue that is running is that there is really a greater interest in the wider Australian community as to what is happening in corporate life. We now have much more analysis of and focus on the business pages of the newspapers and the electronic media. That has meant that there is much more drama. Drama in itself means that the players in corporate life have a lot at stake financially and, to some extent, in their own esteem. The fourth agenda that is running is that the legislation in general tends to focus on issues such as liability. The honourable member for Ryan mentioned that. </PARA>
<PARA> The great difficulty the Committee has had is that we have accepted-because of the terms of reference-that we needed to look at the legislation and how it would work, areas of deficiency and where we needed to make changes. If we are talking about a general deregulated environment-which is what we are talking about, because that is the thrust of the legislation in some sense-the difficulty has been to get anyone to accept responsibility for their actions. The thing that has troubled the Committee members is that we have been between the issues of investor protection and efficiency of the capital market and in all that we are seeking someone out there-I suspect there is not anyone-who will say, `I am responsible for my actions, for this prospectus and for these sorts of activities'. To date, there has not been a lot of willingness for people to accept that responsibility. The reason is obvious-there is a lot at stake, in terms of both professional standing and legal liability. Nevertheless, that is something we have driven towards. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that to be fair to the House I should also say that the amount of material that we have come up with-and the honourable member for Ryan referred to those matters-is considerable. There is no doubt that many people, relatively expert in their areas, have given detailed submissions. The members of the Committee have said that we need to make sure we are doing this properly. That explains why the motion is before the House to extend time. It is quite appropriate from that point of view that we do that. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a couple of matters that were raised that I would like to comment upon. One relates to the Rothwells matter and the knowledge before the House. The Attorney is obviously able to speak for himself, so I do not propose to speak for him. But if I was to put a view about the matters that were debated, it is my recollection that the specific responses of Mr Schoer were not questions about Rothwells per se but about relationships between the Attorney-General's Department, the NCSC and what was to become the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) and the question of accountability. We were pressing pretty hard on that-it is all in the transcript-and the honourable member for Ryan has referred to that. It is up to the Attorney then to put his own position as to how he related to those questions that were before the House. To be fair, we were deliberately pressing upon the issue as to what extent is the proposed ASC going to be accountable to an individual Minister and, to that extent, what is the process of accountability, what can we expect out of that and what is the capacity of the Minister to direct investigations. It is a two-way street. The extent to which one is accountable can also be the extent to which one can direct particular investigations. So we did canvass the question of the collegiate role of the NCSC. Mr Bosch put to us that he felt that the collegiate role of the NCSC had one great advantage, which was that no one individual could be lobbied. Might I say that I thought that he gave us interesting evidence, but my understanding of the specific debate was that we were talking about the relationship between individual parliaments, and in this case we are talking about the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I also say, in the context of that debate, that the difficulty that the Attorney-General was referring to when questions were asked here was in fact that the Ministerial Council arrangement does not give any Attorney-General direct accountability. The cooperative scheme does not give any Attorney-General direct accountability; it gives accountability to a group of people. Again, I do not want to canvass any detail--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no specific accountability. That is the big vexed question, which is why the States came to us with questions about the split scheme, the Sumner-McCutcheon proposal and so on. It is fair to say that that is one of the issues that the Committee is wrestling with. We had very sincere proposals put to us across the spectrum. If it helps the House, the spectrum basically consists of those who want the existing cooperative scheme to stay as it is-and we have heard from those States-and those who have advanced a split scheme which advances a number of issues that would fall within the specific jurisdiction of the Commonwealth where the Federal Attorney-General would be the permanent chair of the Ministerial Council and would therefore be able, if you like, to control that arrangement. At the other end there is a move towards an ASC, in which the Federal Parliament would be directly related to the role of the ASC. So that is the spectrum we are dealing with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable for Ryan has also raised questions-and here I will not go into a lot of other things because it does not start to talk about the content and, as I have said, I do not want to pre-empt the Committee-relating to the process of consultation, the content we are dealing with. Since there are honourable members in the House who are interested in this debate-two members currently in the chamber are actually on the Committee-the thing that we need to come up with now is an agreed set of proposals, and what the Committee intends to do is use the extra time to come up with an agreed set of proposals which will, as far as the financial community is concerned, in a way provide that sort of response that we think they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some debate about the submission time people were allowed and the detail involved. I conclude by saying that we were speaking to a specific clientele who were by and large very well informed. The honourable member for Ryan spoke about this and raised a question about the general consultation process. Because we were dealing with a specific well-informed clientele, the much more extensive process of advertising and so on was not necessary because the audience we were dealing with was already tuned into the debate. It is important to note that. As a consequence, the quality of the submissions reflected that. As Chairman, it was interesting to see how quickly my colleagues tuned into the intensity of the debate and it is appropriate to say that they have done such a good job in getting so much material before the Committee that we need some extra time to consider it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before calling the honourable member for Curtin I say to the House that there is something of a mild challenge in this particular debate because the motion, as the House is aware, seeks the concurrence of the House to an extension of time for the presentation of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. That invites and, indeed, requires reasons why there should be an extension. In presenting reasons, it would be proper to identify the areas, but having identified them in sufficient detail it should not permit an expansion of debate on those very topics which properly remain, in this context, the property of the Committee. So I would invite members speaking to the question to be sensitive to that requirement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I think I can comply with your outline of the rules of debate. I very much respect what the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) had to say and acknowledge his qualification that he could not in his remarks do anything which might be seen to be anticipating the report of his Committee, the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. It is important to remember, in considering this motion to agree to extend the period for the Committee to sit, what took place in the initial instance, because that goes to the very heart of the motion that is now before the House. Of course, it was only during the winter break last year that members of this House or, indeed, of the Parliament had an opportunity to look at the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons that the Committee's period will have to be extended is that the sheer volume of the legislation is such that no reasonable person in the private sector or no reasonable industry organisation could possibly consider the implications and efficacy contained in the 3,000 pages of that legislation in terms of what it might hope to achieve, whether or not one agrees with what the Government is doing. That period proved to be insufficient for the law councils and their equivalents around the country as well as for industry organisations who were vitally affected to prepare anything like the information that would have been needed to debate the original legislation. To compound the problem, if I remember correctly, during the first week of our return we were confronted with 280 amendments. As everyone in the chamber would know, but not many others perhaps, those amendments had to be deliberated upon in the committee stage. So after the second reading debate, which was a very poorly attended debate both in terms of speakers and people in the chamber, we were dealing with the legislation as it had been drafted. When we went into the committee stage, we were then simply confronted with the task of considering how those 280 amendments would affect the clauses in the original legislation. The Committee was never at any stage, therefore, able to consider the original clauses. That is why the Senate, quite properly and thankfully, decided upon the creation of this Committee. All that it did wrong, it seems, was to underestimate the time required to engage in the necessary consultative process, which did not take place in any real sense prior to the legislation coming before the House. It was, as the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has stated, tantamount to a massive grab for power or, as I think I said at the time, a grab for massive power by the Attorney-General's Department, aided and abetted by the Attorney-General, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen). So it was that we saw this outrageous approach to the legislative processes in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the House that that is the reason we are now considering this motion. It is what happened then and the total disregard for the legislative processes and duties of this chamber that have led to this motion before the House. Might I say also that the criticism levelled at the time by the honourable member for Ryan and me has been thoroughly vindicated both by the work so far of the Committee and by this motion before the House. We still have this enormous problem, to which the honourable member for Stirling alluded, about what he calls a deregulated environment. I take issue with him on that and again acknowledge that he might have been constrained in some of the remarks he made because his Committee is still sitting and deliberating on the issue. But how he could, in all good conscience, refer to the Committee and the Government seeking a deregulated environment and ignore the creation of the Australian Securities Commission itself, the establishment of a Corporations and Securities Panel and, on top of that, a Companies and Securities Advisory Committee I do not know. To say that that represents a move towards deregulation or-I think he was more absolute than that-deregulates the environment for companies legislation in this country is drawing a very long bow indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The cooperative arrangements which are in place now are working. They have defects and if, as part of the extension of time for the work of the Committee, we were to include considering as an alternative some modification of the present cooperative arrangements, that might be a very useful contribution indeed. I heard no hint of it from the honourable member for Stirling. I do not know what his fellow members on his Committee might think along those lines, but some amendments, some alteration, to the arrangements of the present cooperative scheme as an alternative to voluminous legislation, which is undoubtedly an attempt to grab massive power for the Commonwealth Government of the day in general, and the Attorney-General's Department in particular, might be a preferable way to go, and I hope that the consultative process with which the Committee is to continue will consider that. </PARA>
<PARA> We can be thankful for the Senate and the role it plays in the legislative process, a role which is so often denied to this chamber because governments seem to want to get their legislation through quickly. I might remind the Attorney-General, who is in the chamber, that, as part of that process of what I would call undue haste with what was, and is, very far-reaching legislation with great implications for the conduct of commerce in this country, he came into this chamber at the first session in the committee stage and acknowledged that he had not been briefed on the clauses in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that sort of approach to what happens in this chamber which led to the creation of this Committee by virtue of action taken in the Senate and which now leads us to be considering an extension of time for the Committee to continue and to complete its work. I would like to think that this will be one of the last examples that we see in this chamber of that approach to legislation. Hopefully, in an election year, the Government, firstly, will not want to introduce too much controversial legislation and, secondly, will not want to be seen to be trampling on the rights, obligations and duties of members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the motion. I reiterate that I hope that the Committee will not confine its extra deliberations to mere consideration of the legislation but also to the alternatives. The first of those alternatives would be to consider some development of the present cooperative arrangements, which have worked quite adequately, but with some deficiencies which we have all acknowledged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is not very long, it should be. It should be just as long as the Committee needs, because, I stress again, if the Government has to legislate in this area-and I have doubts about that-and if it is to legislate effectively, the consultative process has to be exhaustive. The Committee is the vehicle whereby that can be done. It is a matter of regret that it was not done even a little bit more thoroughly before the legislation was drafted. I think part of the reason for that was that, by leaving the legislation lie on the table, as it were, over the winter break last year, the Attorney-General and his Department might have expected to get some criticism in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was a herculean task beyond the resources of any organisation or individual, as I have said. We cannot expect people who are in business, for example, and have to spend most of their time keeping their businesses viable, to spend enormous amounts of time considering over a couple of months of the last winter break, as it would have been, complex legislation of this kind, with all its consequences, intended and unintended.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to delay the House. However, I would like to speak very briefly in support of the motion that is before us in relation to an extension of time for the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, as recommended by the other place. As a member of the Committee I just say that we have had an impossible role to fulfil, given the time that has been made available to us to look at this very complex and large package of legislation. The House would be aware that this legislation came before it in the last session and that in the vicinity of 300 amendments were moved to it. This indicates that it was a flawed package. I believe that the work of this Committee will be very beneficial in ensuring that the corporate law of this country over the decades to come will be much better because of the Committee's activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say very briefly that there is no doubt that changes are needed to our corporate law. It is a dynamic process, but in light of some of the major recommendations that are contained in this legislative package, which include basically the abandonment of the pre-vetting process and, of course, the major issue of the centralisation of power in Canberra rather than with a ministerial council, the need for an assessment of this legislation is absolutely essential. The development of the cooperative scheme some years ago was a major advance. I believe that the evidence that has been taken by the Committee to date has not necessarily indicated that such arrangements produce the lowest common denominator effect, as has been suggested by some members of the Government and some people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all accept as well that the work of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) has been highly regarded and any deficiencies that there may be in this area mainly revolve around the fact that the NCSC has found it difficult to find the resources that are necessary. Of course, this Parliament, through the Government, has a role to play in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge also the responsible role of and leadership given to our Committee by the Chairman, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). I have no doubt that this motion will be accepted by the Government. I have no doubt that this extension of the Committee's time will result in improved legislation. I believe that the legislation could have been improved much further by this Committee if the terms of reference had not been so limited. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to support the motion. I rise in this debate only to answer some of the criticisms made of me prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner. It is fair enough to make such criticisms but I want the chance to reply, on my own behalf and also on behalf of my Department, which does not have any chance to reply. Reference was made to evidence given to the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. I do not want to canvass the merits of the evidence but only to refer to the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Evidence was given by Mr Schoer of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). To paraphrase it, he said that the Attorney-General's Department had been kept fully informed and, therefore, by implication, there was no need for me to suggest that I might not have had information. However, as a result of that evidence being given to the Committee and being publicised, Mr Rose, the Acting Secretary of my Department, wrote to Mr Bosch on 8 February saying that the Department wished to refer to the evidence. Part of that letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms at the number of assertions made by yourself-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Bosch-</PARA>
<PARA>and Mr Schoer. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department talks about the first assertion relating to a hidden agenda and I need not waste the time of the House talking about that. But the second matter concerns issues which were raised here today. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The second concerns Mr Schoer's assertion that your Commission has kept this Department `fully informed' of its operations, and the clear implication to be drawn from his evidence that the Department has deliberately withheld such information from the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard that assertion as arrant nonsense, and the implication cannot be substantiated by fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the Commission has not withheld information when requested to provide it, and that it has itself volunteered information on some occasions. However, to say that the Commission has kept the Department `fully informed' of its operations is simply not consistent with the facts. On numerous occasions the first that we or the Attorney-General have known of important Commission activities has been gained from the media, on the basis of which we have then sought information from you. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, Mr Schoer is simply not in a position of knowledge from which he could validly comment upon the extent to which the Department has briefed the Attorney-General . . . </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to `setting up some sort of a PPQ system', which Mr Schoer says the Commission is currently doing, I note that I wrote to the Commission in this regard on 8 September 1987. So far as we are aware, the Commission has itself provided only one PPQ brief to the Attorney-General since that time. Mr Skehill again raised the matter with Mr Schoer on 7 December 1988, and Mr Starr wrote in that regard on the same date. I understand from Mr Schoer's evidence that you still do not have a system in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the comments made with Mr Schoer and yourself, as referred to above, are unwarranted, incorrect and regrettable. I do not believe that they are conducive to the appropriate and effective relationship which the Department seeks with the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>As I say, that letter was sent to Mr Bosch. Mr Bosch effectively replied on 10 February, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Rose,</PARA>
<PARA> Your letter of 8 February raises important issues. Let me be quite clear why I believe there is a hidden agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the first issue, which I will not go into because it has been set out in detail. The other point that I thought relevant to the criticism of me and my Department was dealt with in the letter as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of informing the Department or the Minister's office about the Commission's actions, you will understand that there are many complex developments occurring every day. It is very hard to know which will become public and which will prove to be of public interest. I submit regular reports and write to Ministers when I think that a significant development has occurred, as I did several times on the Rothwells matters. There is little feedback that would help to establish what information should be sent, but if you have any good ideas as to improvements in the method of communication, I would be glad to learn of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Following that invitation my Department again replied to Mr Bosch on 15 February. I will not read the letter in detail but I will quote part of it, which is very relevant to the point I am making. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I note that your letter does not repeat Mr Schoer's claim that your Commission has kept this Department fully informed of its activities; indeed it quite clearly supports my assertion that it has not done so. Nor does it repeat the assertion that the Department has withheld information from the Attorney-General. I repeat that that assertion is arrant nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I note your request that the Department provide you with suggestions to enable the Commission to improve its methods of communication with the Attorney-General and the Department. I suggest that this should be a matter to be included in the discussions which Mr Skehill-</PARA>
<PARA>a member of the Department-</PARA>
<PARA>suggested in his letter to you on 10 February . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that Mr Skehill will be having discussions with representatives of the NCSC in the coming week. I think that is a matter which should be placed on record because it puts forward the Department's position in respect of the evidence. Might I say-and this point has apparently not been made in the Parliament-that that correspondence and my Department's position has been given to the Committee as well. The Committee now has that evidence. I say for the record that it is unfair to suggest that my Department has been somewhat negligent and that I am in a position of not knowing or misleading. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to answer a couple of other questions that have been raised. Let me put it on record that the question arose as to whether some accountability to the Parliament was heeded. A Senate Committee on which all members of the major parties were represented-I do not know whether the Australian Democrats were represented-unanimously decided that there ought to be national legislation. The Senate committee made that decision, having taken evidence from members of the business community and others. It is not as though we are trying to do something that was thought of in this place. The proposal came from the Senate itself on the basis that that chamber properly thought, as most do, that if there is to be a parliamentary process there ought to be an opportunity for members to talk about the legislation in front of them and to amend it. That is one of the defects in this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that what I have said shows the position with which we are faced in terms of the legislation. It is cumbersome and difficult legislation. It is innovative legislation because it deals with a number of new concepts. The legislation was introduced in this House last May and allowed to lie on the table until September so that people could make comments about it. There were a number of amendments, which has been the subject of criticism because they were so numerous. There were over 260 amendments, but 95 per cent of them were to correct typographical errors or punctuation errors. The amendments were to remove a comma, put in a full stop or alter a typographical error. Not one amendment was moved by the Opposition; nor did it need to, as it opposed the legislation. But it is wrong to suggest that there was some ambush. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in the process of that time gap between May and September the draftsmen had an opportunity again to tidy up the legislation. I was put in the position of having to move every amendment because the honourable gentlemen opposite felt that that was the way that it ought to be done. It took 18 hours, but the 18 hours were spent in correcting drafting errors, not the policy position. I put that on record because a fair amount of incorrect information has been given again today on the basis that this is legislation by stealth. It is now about nine months since we introduced the legislation. I quite happily saw it go to a Senate committee because the Australian Democrats apparently were not represented on the first committee. The Democrats felt that they wanted a role to play in that situation. When Senator Macklin saw me about the matter and said, `We have had no part in this matter', I said that I was quite happy to see the situation develop in that way. There has been no suggestion that we have tried to push something through. </PARA>
<PARA> I will attend another ministerial meeting this Thursday. Again, we will be getting further information. It is very clear that most of the State Ministers do not favour the scheme. The question is whether the business community wants the scheme and whether the Parliament understands what it would mean to the business community. I think it would be to its advantage. It does not help the debate to make assertions that there is something wrong with my Department. I am here to defend it. It is a first-class department. The officers are not anxious to put any power in Canberra. The idea is that the body would be located in one of the major capital cities. That would be in accordance with normal trade and commerce requirements. A lot of suggestions have been made that my Department wants this piece of legislation. I make it clear that the concept came about as a result of a Senate committee unanimously suggesting that legislation be introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988 was introduced into the House of Representatives in October last year. It covers the repeal of the Sugar Agreement Act 1985 and the livestock slaughter legislation. It amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 and the Wool Marketing Act 1987. The first and most important aspect of the legislation is the repeal of the Sugar Agreement Act 1985. That will come into force, once this legislation is passed, from 1 July this year. That will be quite an historic event in that it will allow sugar to be imported into Australia; in other words, it will remove the sugar embargo from that date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once the revised arrangements for the sugar industry are accepted by Parliament and once the customs tariff Bill is also accepted, that embargo will be replaced by a tariff schedule. The tariffs Bill, as it stands at the moment, recommends a tariff of 35 per cent for raw sugar and 25 per cent for refined sugar from 1 July. Those tariffs will be phased down to 15 per cent from July 1992, with a 10 per cent figure for developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The current domestic pricing arrangements will also terminate on 30 June this year, which is the expiry date of the Commonwealth-Queensland Sugar Agreement. The two governments have had successive sugar agreements since 1923. These agreements have allowed the Queensland Government to acquire all raw sugar manufactured from sugar cane in Queensland and, in turn, for refined sugar to be made available in places such as Hobart and Darwin at reasonable prices. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) believes that after 1 July the domestic price will be import parity plus the level of the tariff. However, the industry believes that the predictable maximum selling price for refined sugar, which is currently $629.19 a tonne, will be replaced by a selling price which will reflect the corrupt world price. The industry also believes that growers and mill owners will suffer from the termination of the Sugar Agreement through increased volatility of prices and incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The initial tariff rates are set to provide a similar level of support as the current import embargo and domestic pricing arrangements when the world price is about US10c per pound. The sugar industry and the Queensland Government strongly oppose the Bill because they believe it is too great a leap into the unknown-a leap not required of any manufacturing or service industry in this country or, for that matter, of very few primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has the following complaints and concerns about what the removal of those arrangements will mean. The Government has given away, rather than traded, the embargo on sugar. While we in Australia are removing the embargo, the United States still operates a highly restrictive quota system on sugar and a domestic price which is two to three times the world price. The United States, Japan and the European Community (EC) negotiate concessions when they are removing restrictions. Australia has simply given away, rather than negotiated away, our sugar embargo. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the embargo and the three-year reduction to 15 per cent, or 10 per cent for developing countries, is too abrupt to allow adequate adjustment by the industry, necessary to meet international trade liberalisation requirements. For example, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, by the most optimistic projections, will be starting seriously to address agricultural tariff reductions only by July 1992. That will be when these other countries will negotiate some of their restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> The ad valorem tariff of 15 per cent and 10 per cent is too low, the industry believes, to provide reasonable protection against a corrupt and volatile world sugar trade. This form of tariff provides protection at high world prices when it is not needed and virtually no protection below US12c per pound. Currently, the price, I believe, is under US12c per pound, but has been firming. The industry wants a specific duty rate which will provide lower protection in dollar terms when the world price is high, but better protection when there are corrupt influences and very dramatically low prices at other times. The industry is requesting a $200 a tonne duty on raw sugar and a $150 a tonne duty on refined sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry fears that raw sugar may be imported from a number of nearby sources, including Thailand, the Philippines and Fiji, while refined sugar could come from a number of places in Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia and possibly Korea. It may even come from the EC, with its restitution system. The Government has promised the industry that Fiji will not gain duty free access to Australian markets, but it will be extremely difficult for the cross-subsidisation of the countries I have mentioned to be policed. The industry wants assurances on this cross-subsidisation because 50 per cent of the 30 million tonnes of sugar entering world trade is sold under special arrangements. The most significant of these is the Lome Convention arrangement by developing countries related to the EC countries, which allows access for a tonnage at above world prices. This makes it extremely difficult to prove any anti-dumping case. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry argues that developing country tariff preferences which give this additional 5 per cent discount on tariffs should not apply to sugar, because while many of these countries which export sugar are underdeveloped, or are developing countries, their sugar industries are very highly developed. Anti-dumping provisions are of little value because of the delay in determination, the material injury requirement of about 20 per cent, or up to 20 per cent, of the domestic market lost to imports before action is taken, and the export subsidy practices of the EC and some other exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Sugar ranks with wheat, cheese and citrus concentrate as the most subsidised corrupt international trade item. Anyone who is not in agriculture, agricultural exports or international trade in agriculture has no understanding of the degree of corrupt practices that take place within international agricultural trade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not just the case with sugar. The honourable member would know that himself. It is also the case with some of the other commodities, grain in particular. Studies have shown that sugar prices are the most volatile of commodity prices traded internationally. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has acknowledged this and spoken of the need for shadow pricing to determine the true world price and possibly to introduce special anti-dumping provisions, as are in place for European cheese, to prevent this corrupt action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Parliament and the sugar industry would be very interested to know if the Minister has developed this concept to any form of policy. We certainly have not heard of it so far. Unfortunately this is another example of the Government's double standard, of rapid and brutal adjustment for agricultural products to be exposed to the world even though, as I said earlier, agricultural trade is the most corrupt and subsidised while secondary and tertiary industries, which on most occasions cannot compete internationally, are treated more generously. This problem is compounded by the added cost burden these less efficient non-export and non-agricultural domestic industries place on the cost structure of the agricultural export industries. For example, the high cost of the waterfront and, to a lesser extent, of coastal shipping will almost certainly mean the loss of the Darwin and Perth markets and possibly other State markets to imported sugar rather than Australian sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> The monopoly sugar refiner CSR Ltd has been treated more kindly than the grain growers of Queensland and northern New South Wales, and is now in a dominant position to play off local producers against each other and against raw sugar imports. The cost of shipping and unloading raw sugar is far cheaper than for refined sugar, and CSR could use this in relation to importing raw sugar in certain States. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of these concerns and complexities, which the industry has raised repeatedly with the Government, the Government has continued its arrogant policy of not consulting with industry, and that goes for all agricultural industries, until after the decision has been made and the legislation drafted. Thus we have the Bill now being debated. The original coalition response to this legislation, which was introduced last October, was for a Senate inquiry to allow the industry to express its concern before allowing the final passage of that legislation based on whatever the Senate determined as a result of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> To add to this unfair and cynical action by the Federal Labor Government against one of Australia's great primary and export industries, this same Government then attempted to pass through the Senate the customs tariff Bill, which would set the type and level of tariff to replace the embargo ahead of the actual embargo termination legislation. Through all this there was no complaint from Queensland Labor members or senators against this deceitful action of their Government against this greatest of industries of coastal Queensland. However, the coalition parties in the Senate successfully put in place an inquiry to investigate the complaints of the industry and to report well ahead of the proposed termination date of the embargo, that is, 1 July, before considering the customs tariff Bill and also the sugar sections of this Bill. I shall now quote the following terms of reference of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. They are to inquire into:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the present state of the sugar industry and the effect on it of the Sugar Agreement Act 1985;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the likely effects of the sugar industry of the proposed customs tariff changes as contained in amendments Nos 68, 69, 70 and 71 of Scheduled 3 of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the economic and marketing consequences for the sugar industry of the repeal of the Sugar Agreement Act 1985;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the level of custom tariff that should be set for sugar to provide the maximum benefits to the Australian economy in general and the sugar industry in particular; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) what other measures, if any, should be considered in order to promote the sugar industry and maintain its contribution to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee is required to report to the Senate by the first sitting day after 30 April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition and, I hope, all members and senators are very anxious to have the report of the Senate inquiry which is looking at what will happen to the industry once the embargo is removed. While the Minister is talking of tariffs of 25 and 35 per cent at the moment, it is important that we see the work of this Committee before any final decisions are made. A wrong tariff figure or type of tariff could see the industry sent to the wall and whole townships and the regional coastal area of Queensland in trouble. The industry believes the tariff needs to be of the right type to provide protection when the world section of the industry is in this volatile and corrupt period, while at the same time believing that when protection is not required it should not be loaded onto the industry. This country is already suffering from too few exports. We cannot afford to let this Government sell another internationally efficient primary industry down the drain because of the corrupt support price and export subsidies of other sugar producing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The second section of the Bill repeals four separate livestock export inspection charge pieces of legislation. The meat industry moved to a fee for service system for Commonwealth meat inspection services from 1 July 1988 instead of the old $2.50 a head which had previously been deducted from producer returns. When this fee for service was introduced it was hoped abattoirs would take advantage of this new payment method to streamline their operations and put real savings into the meat industry. While this has happened in some cases, there are abattoirs in Queensland and parts of New South Wales which are still charging the $2.50 a head inspection fee, which is actually a double charge on top of the fee for service charge. I was advised as recently as yesterday that this most unfair practice is still occurring. The repealing of this legislation will take away the right to charge this $2.50. I hope it is then a clear sign to those abattoir operators that this practice will no longer be tolerated. I hope that farmer organisations will monitor the situation and take action where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The next section concerns changes to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act. These amendments will permit the implementation of agreements which have been negotiated between the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) and shipping companies and remove an inconsistency in the Act which resulted from amendments made in 1987, particularly in relation to notices of motion for the annual conference. The annual conference of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation is not an efficient way of the industry being made accountable or having debates that are current because of time lags for motions, et cetera. I believe this Government, together with the industry, should be looking very closely at a more accountable and efficient way of having the required communication and accountability between the various sectors of the industry. </PARA>

<PARA> This Bill also contains changes to the Wool Marketing Act. The amendments to that Act are aimed at maintaining the confidence of wool buyers by ensuring the integrity of wool testing and sampling procedures. Nearly all wool sold at auction is tested for key characteristics which form the basis for a commercial assessment by buyers. The need for these amendments arises from the fraudulent use of wool samples in the wool saleroom. An example has been given of a wool broker being found guilty of using wool samples purchased after the sale to represent a further lot. This has led to a re-examination of the security surrounding samples of wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also made for the payment of fees in relation to registration and inspection costs. Part of this procedure for maintaining the integrity of the wool industry brings me to the absurd situation we have in this country of the unwarranted tariff on lightweight woollen fabrics, commonly known as cool wool. We have the most efficient wool industry in the world. It is our major exporter, earning $6 billion. But in this home of superfine wool, and supposedly the home of cool wool, from 1 January last year the tariff on this fabric was increased from 2 per cent to 40 per cent. It is now 35 per cent following the May economic statement. While the tariff on cool wool increased to that figure, similar types of lightweight cotton and synthetic fabrics are tariff free. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no rational basis for the Government retaining this discriminatory tariff against one of our world-beating natural fibres. Not only is the Australian consumer denied access to products made from Australian wool; the increasing number of tourists coming to Australia will not take home products made from cool wool because it is cheaper to buy in their own country one of the great products of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the world has cool wool is that Australian woolgrowers, together with the Federal Government, have been providing close to $200m a year not only for the research and promotion of cool wool but, obviously, for the better marketing and development of wool as a fibre. We have the absurd situation of a high tariff on one of the great products of Australia. Australian woolgrowers and the Australian Government make sure that wool is internationally competitive. Tourists coming to Australia should be encouraged to buy this product here because it is one of the few quality products of this country. But, because of this absurd tariff, they are not buying if here because it is dearer to buy here than in their own country. I understand the Government is carrying out a review of the tariff at present. I hope that the tariff will be removed so that cool wool is placed in exactly the same position as the lightweight synthetics and cottons-that is, with no tariff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has suggested that the longstanding and obviously remarkably successful way in which wool research is managed and administered in this country is now under threat. I refer to the very successful way in which the Australian Wool Corporation in particular, and to a lesser extent the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and others, have managed this great research and development program. Yet, in spite of the efficiency of the administration and the overall continuity and coordination provided, he wants to set up a separate research council. I hope that he does not proceed with that. The industry is against it. Commonsense is against it. Why tinker with something which is succeeding so well?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not oppose this Bill in this House because of the positive aspects of the legislation as it relates to livestock slaughter, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act and the Wool Marketing Act. The long term retention of the sugar embargo is not sustainable, particularly if there are genuine developments in liberalising world trade in agriculture-and there are hopeful signs of that. But I repeat the criticism of the repeal at this time, ahead of worthwhile negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or bilaterally, and also of repealing the embargo ahead of the findings of the Senate inquiry into the adequacy of the proposed tariff regime after 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties in the Senate have already taken action to ensure that the customs tariff Bill will not be considered until after that Committee reports, and I presume it will be taking the same action-that was the original proposal that we had before us as at one stage this Bill was ahead of the other Bill-and that this part of the Bill will not be finalised in the Senate until that Committee has reported. Then we will all have the benefit of the information from the Committee, and the industry will have had the opportunity to express its criticisms of the Government's action, which opportunity the Government is not prepared to provide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) covers several primary industries, I will concentrate tonight on sugar. In controlled economies, farmers are told how much crop they are allowed to grow, and they are told where on their land they can grow the crops. Indeed, there are inspectors to see that this is enforced. Usually a government board will give permission in such an economy before any expansion can occur. At the same time, no matter how productive, a farmer is given a uniform price. Honourable members might suggest that there is no way they would want such a system for Australia. Yet this is precisely the situation we have today in the Queensland sugar industry-and it is costing us millions in lost export earnings and lost job opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sugar industry, despite the fact that it suffocates itself in overregulation, is still quite competitive on world markets. This Bill will help to improve its competitiveness. The Queensland sugar industry has the most extensive set of regulations of any agricultural industry in Australia. It is the most socialised industry we have. Farm peaks regulate how much cane growers have. This guarantees prices and delivery and thereby influences production. Assignments mean that growers are told where on their own land they can grow cane. Sugar mills have to employ inspectors to enforce this. This effectively limits total production. Production does not respond to market changes. For instance, there was no significant change in the area of cane harvested between 1981-82 and 1987-88 despite large price savings during that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) suggests that 50 per cent more sugar could be produced in Queensland under a more appropriate regulatory environment. At current world prices, this would total almost $500m extra income for Australia, and possibly thousands of extra jobs for Queensland. In effect, the Queensland Government's socialistic policies are retarding Queensland's economic growth, particularly in regional Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The only expansion in the sugar industry occurs after an inquiry by the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board, which is headed by a Supreme Court judge. Historically, expansion has occurred at times of high world prices but, by the time the regulatory system allowed for the expansion and the cane was planted, grown and harvested, the world prices had fallen and growers faced severe cash flow, income and debt problems. Expansion has been implemented by constant percentage increases across all growers regardless of land quality. This results in some cane being grown in unsuitable locations. The industry loses about $50m simply by the way it harvests its crop. The harvesting regulations are still basically those designed for hand cutting. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABARE estimates that $50m could be saved if changes could be achieved in harvesting practices. The uniform pricing formula costs the industry around $130m a year. The pricing formula applies to the share of mills and growers in total returns. The rigidity of the formula results in little incentive and even disincentives. The Queensland Sugar Board acquires all the sugar crop but disposes of virtually all of it through CSR Ltd. CSR has a virtual monopoly and sells at administered prices domestically and is the sole marketing agent internationally. Consequentially, the Sugar Board is not a fully fledged statutory marketing authority. It appears to be a place to park a few National Party branch members with a taxpayer-funded expense account. CSR's marketing contract provides no incentives for performance other than its accountability to the Sugar Board. An implicit incentive exists in that CSR owns about 30 per cent of the milling capacity and under the cane pricing formula receives about 11 per cent of the benefits of its international marketing efforts. The returns and infrastructure costs are pooled across growers. This results in a pattern of cross-subsidies impinging on the most efficient pattern of production. It is difficult to understand the reasoning for all these regulations. Much of it dates from the wartime circumstances of 1915. Much of it has little or no relevance to the Australian industry as it squarely faces the last decade of the century. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to deny the changes that have occurred in recent years. Roaming was introduced in 1986 to allow growers to harvest a higher proportion of their assigned area. Farmers can now grow 15 per cent of their crop where they like on their own land. This has resulted in a 6 per cent increase in the harvested area in 1988-89 with a further small increase expected next year. In late 1988, a Central Prices Board inquiry determined a production increase of 300,000 tonnes of sugar-around 8 per cent. At the same time, CSR has adjusted its domestic marketing behaviour to meet the competition from alternative sweeteners, particularly glucose. This means that major breweries are now charged less than the maximum domestic price. </PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the embargo will breath competition into this overregulated industry. The embargo will be replaced by tariffs, initially set at 35 per cent on raw sugar and 25 per cent on refined sugar, phasing down to 15 per cent in 1992. World price movements will be directly translated into domestic prices. On average, between 1971 and 1988 the embargo actually cost the industry an average of $22.5m per annum in this year's dollar terms-in other words, $405m over that last 15 years. Bundaberg and Childers, which are in my electorate, grow roughly 12 per cent of the Australian crop. So growers in my electorate have been out of pocket to the tune of $49m as a direct result of the sugar embargo. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UF4">Mr COURTICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond to what the honourable member for Calare has said by saying that the amount that has been lost would build two Burdekin dams and would finish the Bundaberg-Isis irrigation scheme 10 times over. The general reductions in tariffs across the entire farm sector will advantage the rural sector by roughly $350m per annum. This could mean a boost to the sugar industry of up to $20m. The National Farmers Federation calculated the gains at roughly $2,400 per farm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All sorts of claims have been made about the effects of the embargo. I would like to quote from one particular speech relating to embargoes:</PARA>
<PARA>In our world problems, we must either shut our eyes . . . crush utterly by embargo and harassing legislation our foreign trade . . . or, we must open our eyes and see that modern civilisation has become so complex and the lives of civilised man so interwoven with the lives of other men in other countries as to make it impossible to be in this world and not of it. </PARA>
<PARA>This speech was not made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). It was made in 1920 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt's words are just as relevant today. Around the same time we were introducing a sugar embargo on the sugar industry. While Roosevelt's claims about embargoes have proven to be true, we have had more loony claims in support of them. The looniest, of course, belongs to Senator Boswell, who claims the removal of the embargo would cost the industry $300m per annum. This is virtually the total domestic market. In effect, he is saying the sugar industry will lose its entire domestic market and will dump the sugar produced for it. This is why I disagree with some of the Minister's complaints about the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into the sugar industry. Apart from the obvious fact that the inquiry gives the industry little time to look to the future, it will give Senator Boswell the chance to actually see sugarcane. The inquiry is going to Bundaberg, which will give honourable senators the chance to see a fully integrated sugar industry. While in Bundaberg, Senator Boswell can explain to the Bundaberg Rum company, on behalf of the National Party of Australia, the advantages of a trade sanction such as an embargo at a time when Bundaberg Rum is breaking into the European trade markets. It will give him the chance to tell the management and staff at Electra Breweries in Bundaberg why they should pay the high export price for sugar at a time when they are successfully exporting millions of dollars worth of soft drinks to New Zealand. The inquiry will enable honourable senators to visit Austoft Industries Pty Ltd-a company derided by the Liberal Opposition's spokesman because it needed trade insurance protection to export sugar harvesting machinery to Cuba and South America. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the sugar inquiry will be at least an educational insight for the Queensland National Party. Apart from the competitive advantage the removal of the embargo will give to our value-added sugar industries, it will open up new opportunities for refineries. Bundaberg Sugar Company refines about 7 per cent of the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> The embargo's removal will encourage the production of what is known as mill white or direct consumption raw sugar. This is high quality raw sugar produced by mills and used directly by consumers without refining. The product is common in sugar markets overseas but not as common in Australia. Without indicating to Bundaberg Sugar how it should improve its operations, there are opportunities for increased refining opportunities in Bundaberg with the embargo's removal. If Bundaberg Sugar takes advantage of this, there can be increased job opportunities for the people of Bundaberg. I believe that this reform needs to be accompanied by other reforms within the industry itself. I hope the Goss Labor government to be elected at the end of the year will implement a number of these. </PARA>
<PARA> There is need for a retention of the Sugar Acquisition Act. It provides the necessary monopoly for the Sugar Board to price up to full duty paid import parity prices for sugar on the domestic market. There is an urgent need to reform the Sugar Board. It needs to be provided with maximum commercial capacity and flexibility. What the Minister outlined in 1986 in a White Paper on reform of Commonwealth statutory marketing authorities could well be used as a blueprint for the States to administer commodity boards. The Sugar Board must be able to market directly and more freely choose marketing agents. I understand the Queensland Government has indicated a move in this direction, and I praise it for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to page 56 of a policy document entitled New Directions, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National Parties support the current general reduction in protection and will continue this process beyond 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>The ink on the document was hardly dry when we had Senator Boswell lumbering around Queensland denouncing the removal of the sugar embargo. As an Opposition spokesman, he should toe the policy line on reduced protection. I say to the Liberal Party that if it supports its policy in New Directions, it can support this Bill. It should not let the National Party's tail wag the coalition dog. It should pull Senator Boswell and the Queensland National Party into line and breathe a bit of economic freedom into the overregulated sugar industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to the comments of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) with a certain amount of fascination. In particular, I was absolutely fascinated to hear a member of the Australian Labor Party accuse the Queensland Government of being socialist. If ever there was a case of the pot calling the kettle black, that would have to be it. Given his outbursts about the sugar industry, I remind him that the Australian Labor Party was in power in Queensland for a long time and most of the Acts that govern the sugar industry go back a long way before Labor was in power. If he feels so strongly, the question obviously arises: Why, when Labor was in power in Queensland, did it not do something about it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also note that he disagrees with his own Government on the question of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry into the sugar industry. I wonder how he will square that off with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). The honourable member for Hinkler made a comment about Commonwealth statutory marketing authorities and the Government's White Paper on them. I warn him about being too general on that. It is very easy to say, `Here is a blueprint', but it does not necessarily apply to every industry in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), in his views on the importance of the Senate inquiry into the sugar industry and the likely effects of removing the embargo. There is a strong case for delaying at least the part of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) on the sugar industry until the Senate inquiry has in fact reported because it would seem to be rather inconsistent not to do so. I emphasise the fact that the Government is very quick to force the sugar industry to face increased competition by reducing its protection but at the same time is very tardy in its moves to reduce the costs, particularly the cost of coastal shipping. If the Government really wants to claim some credibility it ought to be acting on a consistent basis. It should be trying to do something in all areas rather than just picking out what it probably sees as a soft target. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) I would like to concentrate mainly on the second part of the Bill, dealing with the changes to the livestock slaughter export inspection charge legislation. I refer to the fee for service charge and the change to the Export Control Act 1982. An interesting example has arisen in my electorate to which I would like to draw the attention of honourable members regarding the problems concerning the livestock slaughter inspection charge and the way it has been administered by the Commonwealth and, more importantly, the way the Commonwealth has not done what it ought to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I am talking about the dispute that has been running now since late November in the meatworks at Portland which is operated by Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Ltd. This illustrates some of the problems that can arise when the Commonwealth does not fully undertake the obligations that it has to supply export inspection. In fact, I would have to say that the Commonwealth's performance over this whole dispute, which is still going on today, has been nothing short of lamentable. In fact, it is an utter disgrace. I will go into the details of this dispute. Clearly, since the dispute arose the Government's only approach has been to try delay the settlement of the dispute and to create further division in the community. It has undermined an effort not only to get the export works operating again but to resolve a dispute that has been running since November. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give honourable members the background to this dispute. In January 1988 the Borthwicks meatworks was sold to Australian Meat Holdings. In April 1988 the plant was closed. In August, because of a dispute with the Trade Practices Commission, Australian Meat Holdings promised that it would break any close ties with Borthwicks in Portland because clearly the case that was before the Commission was not related in any way to the Portland works. On 30 September last year all those workers who were still on the books of Borthwicks but who, of course, were not working because the works had closed, were paid off. In November Borthwicks, under the new ownership, cancelled a Victorian meatworks industrial agreement which had been agreed to in 1982 and offered to open up again under the Federal meatworks award part 3. An invitation was issued to all former employees to sign up and to get the works going. On 28 November last year a picket line was commenced. That picket line is still outside the works today, yet the works was offering employment under the terms of a Federal award, an award that is approved under the guidelines of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In December-this is the point I was coming to in relation to the Bill before the House-the meat inspectors refused to cross the picket line. There has been much reference to this in the Senate. It began on Friday, 16 December, when a question was directed by Senator Chaney to the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook), representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Senator Cook showed quite clearly that the Government was beginning to look for any excuse to try to avoid resolving the dispute about whether Borthwicks would open under the Federal award. The question was raised as to why the Commonwealth would not order meat inspectors to cross the picket line when under the orders relating to meat inspectors the Government has an obligation to provide meat inspectors where a works requests them. The Government started the first of many devious little schemes to try to avoid resolving the problem. It obtained a legal opinion from the Attorney-General's Department which indicated that the Government may not have that obligation where it could see that delaying the provisions of meat inspectors might be a means of resolving a dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cook went on in his response on 16 December to say that not only did he believe that he was not obligated under orders 100a through to 100d but also that he believed that the works was not in a position to reopen. Under the criteria that the Minister was offering, namely that certain members of other unions were not prepared to cross the picket line, the works would not have reopened and would still not be open. Obviously it has reopened even though the picket line is still there, but if we look at the Senate Hansard of four days later we will see another question directed to the Minister, who again ducked and weaved. This time the question came from Senator Parer. Senator Cook pointed out that he believed that if there were a chance the dispute would be settled he had a case for not providing the meat inspectors. He obviously thought that his excuse would work. Two months later we still have the picket line and those inspectors have been provided. I will come to this in a little more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the Minister was ducking and weaving and looking for any excuse. In his answer he went on to say that he questioned whether there was a sufficient supply of slaughtermen there to get the works going. He found another excuse, saying that he had wanted to call a meeting between the company, the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia and the various unions involved. The management of the works had apparently said they would not appear at that meeting. Senator Cook used that as another excuse for not providing meat inspectors. He seemed to think that because they were not prepared to come to the meeting it removed his obligation to provide meat inspectors. The following day when he was questioned again in the Senate he pointed out that in the morning a Deputy President of the Arbitration Commission had heard submissions from both the employers and the union involved and that both had agreed that there was no dispute, yet he still could not provide meat inspectors. It was not until over a week later, on 28 December, that he finally got around to providing meat inspectors. All this time there were employees there prepared to work, yet the Federal Government under its obligations had found one excuse after another not to provide meat inspectors and not to allow that works to get going. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the Government failed dismally in its first test in trying to allow an export works to get going. Unfortunately, that is not the end of the saga. It goes on, from one problem to the next. It was not long after that the whole issue was referred back to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. But prior to that the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) faced the difficult decision of whether it should offer jobs to those on its books as unemployed skilled meat- workers, saying there was work available at these works under the Federal award, an award that was recognised by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The CES finally did that in January, but then the Department of Social Security decided that it did not have to act on that notice-in other words, that those who were eligible for unemployment benefit would continue to be eligible. Interestingly, some members of the trade union involved in this dispute were openly suggesting to those on the picket line that they had little to worry about concerning the withdrawal of the unemployment benefit because someone in Canberra had indicated that they would continue to be provided with the benefit for some time. As I understand it the benefit is still available. </PARA>
<PARA> The case was then taken back to arbitration, again before a Deputy President, Mr Justice Riordan. The union was seeking to have the Victorian meatworks agreement reinstated together with an additional log of claims. On 30 January Justice Riordan reserved his decision. He was then asked to report to the Full Bench. I understand that that report was delivered to the Full Bench a couple of weeks ago. Yet the Full Bench has still not heard it. It is now listed for hearing tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, we have seen the way in which the Federal Government has refused to provide meat inspectors when it was obligated to do so and has twisted and turned. Secondly, we have seen some strange business going on with the continuing provision of unemployment benefits. But the thing that has really kept this dispute going is the extraordinary delays of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-or, as it will be known tomorrow, the Industrial Relations Commission-in refusing to face up to delivering its services when clearly its job is to settle a dispute which as now been running since the end of November. We still have picket lines. We still have people crossing those picket lines. The meatworks is operating. Yet that dispute is still continuing. It is continuing at a considerable cost to the people in the community at Portland. There is very serious division now, even within families. We are seeing increasing violence. We are seeing bricks going through windows and windscreens of cars being smashed. The division in the community is reaching a very serious point. It would seem that the Arbitration Commission is in no hurry to do anything about it and that the Federal Government is in little hurry to tell the Arbitration Commission to do anything. The Federal Government has been alerted to this on a number of occasions and seems to have been remarkably silent in its response to the fact that this dispute ought to be resolved and yet to date has not been. </PARA>
<PARA> Very clearly there is a case here that the Federal Government has a lot to answer for. The community in Portland is going to be seriously divided for a long time hence when the matter is resolved. In the meantime one would have to ask seriously why the Industrial Relations Commission, as it will be tomorrow, has not got on with the job of resolving a dispute which is supposedly within its charter. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to one other section of the Bill, namely, the amendments to the Wool Marketing Act. I support the moves to maintain the confidence of wool buyers by maintaining the integrity of the wool testing and sampling procedures. I think that is extremely important. I remind honourable members that the wool industry is Australia's No. 1 exporter. It is interesting to note that after 200 years, despite all the efforts of the present Government to start its so-called sunrise industries, it is still the wool industry that is leading the way. If we look for real sunrise industries-the ones that are really increasing export income-we would be hard pressed to find any that would get within cooee of the performance of some of the primary industries in the last year, particularly the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to re-emphasise the points that were drawn to the House's attention by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, namely, the fact that on 1 January 1988 the Government increased the tariff on cool wool from 2 per cent to 40 per cent. While that has now been reduced to 35 per cent, it does seem extraordinary that, despite this having been drawn to the Government's attention last year, to date very little has happened and we are still waiting on yet another inquiry to see what is going to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on the question of the Wool Marketing Act, I too would like to express my concern at the threats by the Government to try to split wool research from the functions of the Australian Wool Corporation. Clearly, when we have something going well we ought to think twice before we disrupt it. The performance of the Australian Wool Corporation and the way it has been funded to a very large extent by wool growers is a model of which a lot of industries are very envious. For the Government to start tampering with a very successful industry and its organisation is very foolhardy. I urge the Government to think twice and to have another look at this issue before it makes any changes. I frankly think it may well undo all the good work that has been done over many years to restore wool from an industry that was in quite a lot of trouble in 1969-70 to an industry that is now leading the way because it has pulled itself up by the bootstraps. Not only has it done that, but it intends to continue to do that, and is doing it very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the views that have been put forward by the Deputy Leader of the National Party on these issues. I believe that the problems in Portland concerning Borthwicks meatworks to a very large extent have been exacerbated by the tardiness of the Federal Government, by the twisting and turning of the Minister in refusing to provide meat inspectors when first asked, and by the inordinate delays by the Arbitration Commission in hearing the dispute. The fact is that we have a community which is bitterly divided. It will take years to overcome the problems. Yet the Federal Government seems to be totally washing its hands of the problem. I suggest to the Minister involved that he ought to come to Portland and see for himself the damage that has occurred because of this delay in resolving a very serious dispute. </PARA>

As the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) correctly pointed out in his contribution a few moments ago, 200 years down the track, despite changes in technology and despite some new industries in Australia, we still see wool as either the No. 1 or No. 2 export industry in Australia year after year. It certainly is true that this makes a very significant contribution to our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular amendment that is before the House tonight relates to samples taken from sale lots. The people involved in this debate would be aware that nearly all wool that is sold at auction is on the basis of samples taken from those sale lots. One sample is sent to test houses which test for specific characteristics, and these are made available to potential buyers before sale. Another sample is displayed on the show floor for a visual appraisal by buyers. It is important, as most people have acknowledged during the course of this debate, that there be a confidence in the system and that there be registration and inspection of sampling sites-test houses-in areas where samples are displayed. So section 127 of the Wool Marketing Act 1987 provides for regulations that will be made in relation to the registration and inspection of wool sampling sites and the registration of wool test houses. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment to provide for the inspection of wool test houses is in fact the point of the current debate. There are no provisions to allow for registration and inspection of display area and sample security areas. So I think it goes without saying that the amendment that has been made to the principal Act is an eminently sensible one and is an indication that there is no great divergence of opinion in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) and the honourable member for Wannon touched on the question of wool research and development, and in particular one option is a consideration of the Wool Research and Development Council being translated into a corporation. The Government does believe that it is important that a strong research and development effort is maintained in an industry that is obviously very important in Australia. We are taking steps to ensure that the administrative arrangements for research and development are placed on the most effective statutory basis possible. This is certainly in line with the whole thinking of the Government in relation to the reform of statutory marketing authorities, which has been one of the hallmarks of the success of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). </PARA>
<PARA> I did mention that one option being considered is the upgrading of the Wool Research and Development Council to a corporation. This would strengthen the research and development capability of the wool industry while leaving the Australian Wool Corporation free to concentrate on its marketing efforts. Claims that the changes under consideration would weaken the linkage of research and development with wool production, marketing and promotion are just typical of the fairly ill-informed and quite misleading comments that we hear from National Party people, particularly as they go around the countryside. But I would stress that the whole question at this stage is under consideration. The Government has made no particular decision in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that both speakers from the Opposition alluded to in their contributions tonight related to the question of tariff duty for lightweight wool fabrics and the concern that this has caused in the industry. I know that the industry has made representations to government. It has certainly made those representations to me as the chairman of the primary industry and resources committee of the Government, and I know that those representations have been made to other members who represent important wool growing areas of Australia. I understand that tomorrow the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will announce the Government's decision to provide a duty free entry for lightweight wool fabrics under the lightweight fabric policy by-law as from tomorrow. I think that is a decision that will be warmly applauded by both sides of this House. The particular decision obviously follows some very extensive consultation with a wide selection of people including the obvious wool growing interests, the Australian Wool Corporation, naturally, representatives of the Australian textile and clothing industries and, in particular, some of the Commonwealth Government departments. I would cite specifically the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, which was the authority set up to monitor and oversee the new textile, clothing and footwear industry plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Lightweight wool fabrics have been accorded by-law treatment under the previous textile, clothing and footwear plan, but duties have been increased to a level of 35 per cent as a result of the rationalisation of tariff duties and import by-laws under the new textile, clothing and footwear plan. This rationalisation was necessary in order to simplify the barrier arrangements when fabrics are imported into Australia and to treat like and competitive goods at comparable rates of duty. Policy by-laws with minimal usage were programmed to terminate unless there were compelling reasons for their retention. In the case of the lightweight wool by-law, that had minimal trade during 1985. However, in subsequent studies, it has been shown that the 1985 figure was a very unusually low figure when comparisons were made with other years. In the light of greater usage, and in particular the Australian Wool Corporation's quite successful `cool wool' campaign, obviously further studies have suggested that lightweight wool fabrics can be substituted for lightweight synthetic cotton and silk fabrics which, as has been pointed out by the previous speakers, can enter duty free for apparel end users. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to provide duty free by-law for lightweight wool fabrics recognises that the original decision was anomalous as well as addressing the need to treat like and competitive goods at comparable rates of duty. I would welcome that particular statement. I believe it is an indication of the good faith of this Government. With all good intentions of seemingly making the right decisions, when anomalies are found within the system the Government has the good sense to modify a particular by-law treatment. The significance of these fabrics in Australia is growing, and a return to duty free treatment will allow downstream producers, for example in the apparel section, the opportunity to benefit from the increasing market for lightweight and woollen fashion merchandise. I know that many people here would share the view that there is obviously a niche in the market that can be capitalised on in this particular instance. Restoring duty free entry under the synthetic policy by-law recognises the desirability of treating lightweight wool fabrics on the same basis as synthetic, cotton and silk fabrics. As I said a few moments ago in connection with the Australian Wool Corporation's promotion of `cool wool', it will obviously give that a further kick start. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important though, in the context of this particular decision, that the Australian industry should not see this decision as a reopening for debate of the post-1988 textile, clothing and footwear plan. The Government is clearly committed to the maintenance of the basic and fundamental elements of the textile, clothing and footwear plan, and this decision should not be seen as some sort of precedent for further changes in assistance for local production of other wool fabrics. Rather the amendment will restore what is obviously an anomalous situation that is of concern to a wide range of interests in the wool sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there has been a great deal of cooperation emerging in recent times between textile manufacturers and local wool growing interests. This is in the interests of everyone. People have given lip-service to the question of value added production. But surely in a country that does have an excellent reputation for growing wool what this Government, or indeed anybody, should be doing is taking steps to ensure, where we have a very important primary industry such as our wool industry, particularly in the context of the very successful textile, clothing and footwear plan, that there is downstream use of this product, particularly given the difficult balance of payments situation that this country faces. If we can add to the level of exports of manufactured goods from local wool production, that is something that would be supported by everyone in this House. It is essential for the future well-being of Australia that the industry and all associated with it in the downstream use of its product add value to our wool. The wool clip makes a very important contribution to our balance of payments. If we can do something with a manufactured product, obviously it will be of great benefit to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased, as I think all members would be, given some of the remarks that have been made here tonight in the House by the Opposition members. It is true that some concern has been expressed by Government members that this decision has been taken by the Government. I certainly commend Senator Button and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for recognising this quite anomalous situation. I believe it is a decision that will be welcomed by the industry in general and, given the impetus that we have seen from the Australian Wool Corporation's quite successful marketing campaign for cool wool it will be very good news for the Australian wool industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure tonight to speak to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill, which covers a broad range of matters. The Government seems to be putting everything concerning primary industry together in one Bill. I really wonder what sugar has to do with woolgrowing, but that is the way it is. These measures are part of a package announced, I think, in the May economic statement last year. There is to be a variation to arrangements concerning the sugar industry, the livestock cattle industry and the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the three industries are very important and are playing a very vital role in the well-being of our nation and our standard of living. They continue to do an enormous amount of good for our balance of payments. Wool is our biggest number when it comes to exports. Australia is the biggest wool exporting nation in the world. We grow some of the best fine wool in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt most people would have heard of the record price paid only last week in Tasmania for a bale of superfine wool to be used to make very good cloth for women's and men's apparel. Purchasers pay these huge prices for wool to publicise the fact that they are in business. I just forget now the price of this single bale. I think it was something like $300,000, which was quite unbelievable. There is no doubt that that is better than getting the sort of money we got some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool has been very much in the doldrums for the past 20-odd years. It is only because there has been a revival in wearing and using natural fibres and because the industry has established an international secretariat and levies itself for promoting its product around the world that circumstances have changed. The Woolmark symbol has been one of the most successful symbols. I guess one could correlate it with the shell that the Shell company uses to promote its petroleum products. </PARA>
<PARA> Although no sugar is grown in Maranoa, I must say that most Queenslanders, and certainly the Queensland Government and the sugar producers, are not happy at all with the Government's proposal to lift the ban on imports on sugar and to allow sugar producing countries around the world to start dumping their product here, although there has been a suggestion of tariffs of 35 per cent for raw sugar and 25 per cent for refined sugar, phasing down to 15 per cent in 1992. For some strange reason there was great haste the other day when there was a strike at the sugar refinery in Melbourne, and overnight the Government lifted the embargo to allow sugar in. I do not know why it thought we were going to run out of raw sugar, but it panicked a bit. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal of the Sugar Agreement Act 1985 takes effect from 1 July 1989. The Act prohibits the importation of sugar and sugar products as described in the 1984 Commonwealth-Queensland Sugar Agreement. The tariff rates are being set, as I said, with a phase-down. Unfortunately sugar growers in north Queensland and on the northern coast of New South Wales have had a very tough time of it for the last four or five years. Personally, I do not see why it is necessary for us to lift the embargo, because the sugar industry is a highly efficient industry. It has been geared up for protection. An industry protected for so long gears up to that protection and finds it very difficult to survive when the protection is lifted. No doubt Fiji and some of the other islands, and South East Asia, where some sugar is grown, will be looking to put product into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem is the high cost of waterfront handling and coastal shipping. This means that the producers on the east coast of Australia, including Queensland, miss out on the markets in Darwin and Perth. I see the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) getting a bit anxious. I guess he is to speak, or maybe has spoken, tonight. We have tried to establish a sugar industry in the Ord and, of course, it has not been successful. </PARA>
<PARA> It is going to be a whole lot cheaper to bring raw sugar from Bangladesh into Darwin and places on the west coast of Australia. Because of the prohibitive costs of shipping this product right across Australia by road, train or whatever, we just cannot compete. The cost of our coastal shipping operation, on which the unions have an absolute stranglehold, is a disgrace. We are one of the biggest island continents, and yet we have one of the worst shipping records and the most inefficient shipping industry in the world. We cannot ship anything anywhere without some enormous cost. Most people in business will tell us that it costs more to ship a product from Brisbane to Sydney or Melbourne than it does to ship it from New York to Sydney. They are the sorts of costs that we face in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I know the Government is trying to do something with the shipping industry and trying to deregulate it. I would suggest that before it attacks the sugar industry it should attack the shipping industry. But its mates in the unions do not like that sort of thing. Our friend Simon Crean, apparently, is going to come here and show us how to run the country. It will be interesting to see what he is prepared to do to the shipping industry when he finally wins the seat that he has been appointed to. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem the Government sees is the livestock slaughter legislation. On 1 July 1988 a fee for service charging regime was introduced under the Export Control Act 1982 for slaughter floor meat inspection by the Commonwealth. This inspection charge has been forced upon the Australian producer by countries such as America that are now buying at least 50 per cent of our beef. About 50 per cent of beef produced in Australia is exported; the other 50 per cent is consumed locally. The Americans have foisted a regime of health inspection on us. It is more or less a form of import barrier, because our health inspection fees and the standard of our health inspection are probably among the best in the world. It is a means that the American Government has used to restrict the amount of meat we can send into America. </PARA>
<PARA> But worse than that, as a beef producer, I have always been totally incensed by the fact that producers should have to pay this health charge. That is what it is: it is a health levy. The product is not even owned by the producer. Once the hammer falls at auction the beast is no longer owned by the producer. It goes to the abattoirs, is slaughtered and is inspected by overpaid and over-bloated inspectors. All sorts of rorts and ramps go on in the Commonwealth inspection service. We are now spending something like $100m for this service. The producer is levied and pays roughly half of that amount. A whole string of inspectors are employed and paid but do not even work in the abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have some uniformity in the system, which is better than it used to be. We had a dual system under which State and Commonwealth officers inspected the same carcasses and the producer had to pay for both inspections. But we still are faced with this cost. I hope it is still our policy to abolish the health inspection charge and have the general taxpayers pay for it. There is no earthly reason why producers should have to pay this charge but still it remains. The system of payment is being changed and moved around. I know that the industry has had discussions with the Government about this matter, but this fee for service concept, as it is now, discriminates against the smaller and seasonal abattoirs. It is difficult to allocate the cost of inspection in a service slaughtering situation, but I guess the new system helps the abattoirs and the cattle industry generally to collect the levy. But still the producer, unnecessarily in my mind, has to pay this levy because all local meat is inspected and sold under regulation. The consumer, not the producer, pays for any other health inspection service that operates around the country. It is high time that this sort of charge was removed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though primary producers do not have enough costs. Interest rates are going through the roof today. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stood up in this place and tried to tell us how well he is running the economy. Australia is in an absolute mess. Of course, without primary producers we would be in a bigger mess. All of the banks impose an interest rate surcharge of one per cent on primary producers, which is a disgrace. That is the sort of penalty we have to pay for producing an export product and maintaining the standard of living in Australia. The private banks and development banks are now looking at interest rates of 18 1/2 per cent. We heard a whole lot today about housing. Everybody worries about housing interest rates at 15 1/2 per cent. However, as of today business and farm interest rates are 18 3/4 per cent and wool firms, whose rates are always one per cent above the bank rate, are charging 19 3/4 per cent. The Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) shakes his head. He probably gets his loans a bit more cheaply than that; or maybe he does not need a loan. But most primary producers need to borrow some money at some time or another. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Labor Government in real terms money is about the dearest it has ever been. There is no doubt that we are heading down the track of a recession if the management of the monetary system by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister continues. We have got ourselves into a very sad situation. I do not wish on anybody the position primary producers are in. I just plead with the Government to get its act together, bring down interest rates and stimulate the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the nonsense about the economy being overheated. I have never heard such trash in all my life. I would like the Treasurer to come out to the electorate of Maranoa and show me where the economy is overheated. I can assure him that the people of my electorate are suffering as a result of drought. Although prices are better than they used to be, in real terms we are still looking at the prices for wool, wheat and beef that we got back in the early 1970s. Whatever comparison we use, primary producers still need to produce a whole lot more than they used to to buy a pair of boots or a motor car. So, in real terms, prices are not as good as they have been, although they are certainly better than the depression prices that we had some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in a situation where money is too dear to borrow. The Treasurer wonders why there is no capital investment. It is not hard to work out why no-one wants to invest in any business operation, be it farming or otherwise. It is just horrific when one has to pay 20 per cent interest. Nobody can stay in business for very long with those sorts of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that has been happening in the meat and livestock area concerns the inability of delegates at Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) meetings to amend motions because they have to be either approved or rejected. This is a really strange set-up. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) altered the AMLC arrangements concerning annual meetings. We had the absurdity of not being able to move an amendment to a motion. An amendment had to be worded something like six weeks before the conference took place. I am sure that the Australian Labor Party does not run its conferences the same way as the Minister expected the cattle producers of Australia to run their conferences. This was an absolute farce. There is no way that the unions would put up with the sort of nonsense that cattle producers were faced with. But at long last the Minister has seen a bit of daylight. The Minister for Employment and Education Services may laugh, but I have been to AMLC conferences. One cannot move an amendment. One can put up a motion but no-one can amend it. That is against the rules and regulations of the incorporated company that the Minister set up. I do not know where the Minister has gone-he was in the chamber for a while. This situation was an absolute farce. At least the amendment to the meeting arrangements will streamline the way in which meetings are conducted. The AMLC will be forced to have annual meetings. I wonder what good they do, but this requirement is to be written into the legislation. The Minister is mad on annual meetings. The arrangements for primary industry bodies have been revamped and for some strange reason they all have to have annual meetings. The Minister is meeting happy. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke at some length earlier about wool. This commodity earned us $5.8 billion last year. Wool is certainly back on top. Australia is now riding again on the sheep's back, as it always has in the past. The industry has had its ups and downs of late. However, it employs a lot of people across this nation. When the wool industry does well, the nation is usually fairly healthy. Unfortunately at the moment wool is pretty good but most other things are not. That is very sad for us. The Government gives large amounts of money to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and General Motors-Holden's gets about $200m. Even the banks got a subsidy of $200m three or four years ago to keep down housing interest rates. But that did not last very long. The Government has funded wool promotion on a dollar for dollar basis with the grower, but last year there was a cut of $10m. Just when the industry needs to continue to promote itself, the Government cuts down on the amount of money it is prepared to put in. That is the sort of penny pinching regressive sort of economics that the Government is about. It is prepared to spend money in non-productive areas but it is not prepared to put money into productive areas that need promotion. Although the Government still spends some money, it is not allocating as much as it used to. The amount used to be $30m but it is now down to $20m. The Government has knocked $10m off. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are being made in respect of core testing. When wool comes into store, cores are taken and tested. Most laws are introduced because some individual does the wrong thing. Apparently a buyer took samples out of good wool, gave them to an overseas buyer and said, `This is the wool that I have bought', when in effect it was not. The best wool was taken from the floor but the stuff that was actually being offered for sale was of very poor quality. So now legislation has been introduced to make it compulsory for samples to be guaranteed. Of course, once this happens fees will have to be paid and, again, the industry will be levied. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to congratulate Angus Liveston of Bullawrie, whose champion ram won the Charleville 150 years celebration of Elders last week. Angus is a very good stud breeder. The wool industry generally depends on the ram breeders throughout Australia to continue their good work. I was reading an article today that said that Haddon Rig stud was going into an enormous artificial insemination (AI) program. Producers are able quickly to increase the quality of their rams for sale and increase the quality of the wool clip by the extensive use of ovum transplants. The Haddon Rig stud has just established a large AI operation. It is one of the better studs and is regarded as one of the parent studs in Australia. The head of Elders-IXL Ltd, John Elliott, went to Charleville to help Elders celebrate its 150th anniversary. I guess that shows how long some of the wool brokerage firms have been around to help the industry during good and bad times. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate Elders for making the effort to run the show at Charleville. I congratulate all the exhibitors, particularly Angus Liveston and his wife, because it is very much a family partnership which runs the stud. I think it is great to see one of the local producers winning the grand champion award at Charleville. That is all I have to say in regard to this interesting legislation. I am happy to support the legislation and look forward to making further speeches in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron), I think that omnibus Bills are a great idea because they give us a chance to range fairly widely during the discussions. I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for introducing commercial radio into the House. I thought that the commercials he made tonight were of interest, and I hope that they contribute to his election funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said on many occasions that ideologues of any nature frighten me. Ideologues, whether of the right or the left, are dangerous. It has been my view in the past that ideologues of the right are perhaps more dangerous than ideologues of the left because they tend to be more plausible. I am afraid that tonight that argument has been shot to pieces. I do not think I have heard such unmitigated rubbish from the Opposition for quite some time. By the way, the Opposition is not opposing the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1988. The honourable member for Maranoa asked a few questions which I think deserve to be answered. For instance, he asked where the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) was. Since the cattlemen's union wants John Kerin to be Prime Minister of Australia, he is probably away making the necessary arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with some of the matters that were raised. I represent an electorate which is capable of growing sugar. I do not think it would be in Australia's national interest to encourage sugar production in that area to be sold in markets which are already supplied by the eastern States, principally by Queensland. I want it known, and known very clearly, that I see absolutely no obligation on the part of Western Australia to refrain from sugar production if it can find new markets. We will find new markets. We are already receiving signs of interest from overseas countries-from the Middle East and from India, areas in which we do not presently sell sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that the Ord will eventually produce sugar. When the Ord does get into sugar production, it will produce sugar far more efficiently and far cheaper than Queensland. It will do so for a couple of reasons: firstly, it will have the economies of scale which the highly regulated system in Queensland has denied the industry over many years; and, secondly, it has the ideal climate. In fact, there is probably no better place in the world to grow sugar than the Ord River region-not even Cuba. Inevitably, we will see a drift of sugar production from the east to the north-west of Australia. That will happen over time. As I say, I will certainly not encourage any production-in fact, it is the Party's policy not to encourage production-that would be sold in Australia's existing markets. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) gave a masterful exposition of the problems of the sugar industry. The honourable member should know, as he is a practical farmer. He understands the problems of the industry. I will not say anything more about sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> Shipping has been mentioned tonight. It was suggested by one honourable member opposite-I will not embarrass him on this occasion by naming him, but he comes from Maranoa-that high shipping costs would make it cheaper to bring sugar from Bangladesh to Darwin and down to Perth. This is patently nonsense. If one were to move sugar from east to west, one would not use ships; one would use rail, which is very competitive and very cheap. Australian National and Westrail are both very efficient railways-the most efficient in Australia. The cost of freight handled by those instrumentalities has dropped in real terms during the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very simplistic for the Opposition to keep talking about the costs of shipping. There is obviously a problem, but it is also true that the union is addressing this matter. The union recognises that, given the leadership shown by this Government, if we are to get into overseas markets-and I think we should, because we are, as the honourable member for Maranoa pointed out, a very big island nation-we must have our own shipping resources. We must have them because, firstly, we cannot afford to rely on other people and, secondly, they are a very large source of foreign earnings or current account savings. The union is endeavouring to be more efficient. It is nonsense to suggest that the problems are just the fault of the seamen. Too little capital has been put into Australian ships. When Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd builds a ship that is designed for minimum crewing, that has the most efficient design, the union has responded, and it is working quite competitively. Clearly, there is trouble on the waterfront. I suggest that the trouble lies much more across the wharves than with the seamen's union. I get a little tired of the constant ill-informed attacks on the seamen's union. If there are problems there, I think the union is prepared to negotiate. If it can see a future, it will be even more prepared to negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another sacred cow which I would like to slaughter tonight is the idea that world agriculture is corrupt and that we really cannot do much about it. Of course, world agriculture is corrupt. We have been living in a world of corrupt agricultural production for many years, and we have survived. We have survived because of our extraordinary efficiency. But this needs to be kept under constant surveillance. Rather than lamenting the fact that the markets are corrupt, one needs to go into those markets and sell the case. The heartland of agricultural protection, of course, is France and Germany. I cannot say much about Germany, but I have just spent a month in France, a country for which I have a great fondness. In Paris many people are now talking about cheaper food. People in Paris are talking about how advisable it would be to look at agricultural marketing. In some of the other large provincial cities one finds the same thing-people looking for exotics, for new foods, and prepared to look at the tariff structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that, if the National Farmers Federation is serious about this, it should engage in a very large advertising campaign. There is no doubt that Britain would be the most fruitful area for this because Australia is held in high regard in Britain and it feels a great affinity with us. If the National Farmers Federation were to dig into its little slush fund and use some of the money which it stores to try to destabilise Labor governments at election time on advertising campaigns in Europe, we could see some very useful inroads made. I do not refer only to traditional products. There is a host of new products that we could export to Europe if we show enough marketing skill and initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also dangers. With the Common Market, it is possible that we will see the great and fertile plains of Spain and Portugal turned over to broad acre wheat. If this happens, I suggest, Australia will have a real problem. Right now, despite the corrupt nature of the market, Australia has a very high quality, high protein hard wheat that has gained niches in the market which cannot be replaced by European wheat. Spain has the capacity to grow that same wheat. It has the fertility to grow it in great abundance. I hope very much that our trade people are keeping a very close eye on that because the potential is enormous. If Spain goes that way, I believe we will have some real problems in our marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to draw attention to what the Government is doing through this Bill to ensure the quality of wool. This is of paramount importance. We have to get to the situation where Australian wool tests have the same authenticity and are regarded with the same high esteem as the Perth Mint is in respect of gold refining. People have to be able to trust them. I believe the broker who was mentioned briefly is in fact a traitor and has the potential to do this country enormous harm. The qualities we look for in wool-length, strength, micron content and yield-can be tested very accurately. Buyers have to know that those qualities are as stated. Anything that this legislation can do to improve that situation is certainly to be recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard about cool wool. I have been saying for many years that we ought to be looking to expand the markets for wool. I believe our wool blend shirts are extremely comfortable and have the look of good quality. It is no good saying that if we did not have a tariff on wool, people would buy wool when they came to Australia. It is simply not true, because the wool is imported anyway and it is bound to be cheaper in the country where it comes from than it is here. It will have add on costs of freight, margins, et cetera. But we can use that wool in distinctive styles. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to run a little commercial for a girl called Claire Thirkettle. Claire is a young lady who has a flair for design and style. She has expressed to me the view that although she is very good at women's fashions, it is men's fashions that we should really be looking at. She has come up with a proposal that there is a market for tailor-made shirts. She said that the shirts we buy off the rack really are not as good as they could be. Features like those in the action back pleated shirt, which is an Australian innovation, could be incorporated into business shirts. Shirts could have longer tails like they used to so that they stay in our pants better. If we are corpulent, as my wife describes me, we can also let our shirts hang out a bit to disguise that fact. Claire says there is a lot we can do with shirts and she believes that there are wool materials available that make excellent shirts, whether they are pure wool, wool polyesters or wool and silk. I have been saying for many years that we should be looking to joint ventures with China, a very large producer of silk, for a wool-silk material to go into shirts to expand the market for wool. I am not seeking to contract the market for wool but to find new uses for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, a very good member, I think admirably suited to his electorate. He talked of the fact that we rode on the sheep's back for 200 years and that sunrise industries have not worked. I do not think that is true, and it is certainly very negative. But there is a lot more we can do to add value to wool. I was recently in a rather depressed part of Australia, in the north-west of New South Wales. I would say that wool production around Walgett is enough to make wool scouring viable there. I understand that there is technology available in Belgium which makes wool scouring far less polluting than it used to be. It seems to me that that industry could be very viable in that area, and that area could certainly use the employment. That would be value adding to wool in a considerable way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there are quite a lot of other things we could do to make sure that we remain supreme in this area. I think we are going to have to look at the addition of goats, where sheep are run on a pastoral basis, because all the evidence shows that we could add up to 20 per cent of goats without putting additional pressure on the pastures. That is also making industry more efficient. We have to look at those things. </PARA>
<PARA> I was rather intrigued when the honourable member told us how tough things were out there. He said that things are not always easy. It is wrong to talk about some fellow in Tasmania who is getting over $1,000 a kilo for his wool and then to talk about not getting more than we were in 1970. I think the prices were wrong. The wool industry today is in good shape. But it will not remain in good shape unless we maintain that eternal vigilance. Today we have the necessary regulation in the industry. I think this is a message for a lot of those mad deregulators-and believe me, we have them on our side of the House as well--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not have the Treasurer in mind. The wool industry is doing well because it is regulated and it will maintain its position providing regulation is well managed. I think that is something that has to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to touch on sunrise industries because they are very important to Australia. The reason why Australia does not get many sunrise industries relates to the ethos of Australia. When we get superannuation funds such as the AMP Society thinking in time scales of three months, because they have to get this quarter's maximum return for their shareholders, there is no possible way that Australia can develop industry. Industry needs a three-year to five-year lead time. There are possibly half a dozen companies in the whole of the United States of America with what I call the 30-year horizon. IBM is certainly one, and McDonnell Douglas may be another. I cannot name them all. But there are dozens of companies in Japan with this 30-year horizon. Companies in Japan are prepared to invest their money and to wait. They are prepared to be in there for the long haul. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest we would not find one company in Australia that is prepared to operate under those terms. Magnificent new technologies are being developed in Australia every day, and every day we see them wither on the vine for lack of the seed capital required. The Australian Industry Development Corporation seems more intent on funding shopping centres than on doing what it is supposed to do, funding Australian industry-taking the risk. I do not particularly mind if capital is lost in these ventures because it is true that if nothing is ventured, nothing is gained. Governments have to be prepared to bear the loss. Unfortunately, in the political system we have, the minute there is a loss or failure, the members of the Opposition, like vultures, are ready to dismember any organisation. I am not particularly criticising the Opposition for that because I know the sad fact is that we would do exactly the same if we were in that position. But until Australian companies get that perspective and are prepared to invest in the long haul, we will not get the new industries in this country. If we do, they are going to be industries which are owned by overseas interests, because there are many overseas countries prepared to put their money in for the long haul. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have a lot more to say on this Bill. I think the fact that the Opposition, despite all its rhetoric, is supporting it speaks for itself. It is a constructive Bill. But I want to make just one other point which I had overlooked in respect of Fiji and sugar. Nothing exists in a vacuum; nothing exists on its own. Foreign affairs has a part to play. I think we have to be very conscious of the stake in the Fijian economy. It is in Australia's interest to make sure that Fiji remains a stable country. To be a stable country, it has to be profitable. It has to be returned to the middle income status it had. Australia should be doing everything to make sure that that happens-not necessarily because it is nice for the Fijians but because it is in our national interest to do so. Fiji is strategically situated. It has been a long time ally of Australia. It is in our interest to see Fiji is not forced into the position of having to dump its sugar on world markets simply to get foreign currency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) covers three areas, namely, sugar, beef and wool. I will confine myself to the latter two. In many respects this legislation highlights the schizoid approach the Government has to trade. On the one hand in this Bill the Government professes an interest in a quality assurance program through pre-export inspections. On the other hand its general economic policy has worked steadfastly against the interests of exporters. In fact, Labor's economic policy has cost the nation billions of dollars in lost export sales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the registration and inspection of wool display areas and sample security sites. This is to help to ensure the integrity of the description of wool and the wool auction system and is aimed at preventing wool brokers or others from fraudulently using wool samples in the wool salesroom. If Australia is to maintain and improve its position as the world's major supplier of quality wool, it is important that our buyers can be assured of the accuracy of the description and the quality of the wool they are buying. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to beef exports, the Bill completes the transfer from the old per carcass export inspection charge on the slaughter of livestock to the inspection fee for service which was introduced on 1 July 1988. When this change was introduced the Government decided to raise the level of cost recovery for beef export inspection from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. In this financial year the Labor Government decision, along with other changes, will result in an increase of 33 per cent in the fees collected for export meat inspection compared with the previous year. That is yet another example of this Government's rapacious tax appetite. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the meat export inspection service and the establishment of the wool sampling system relate to safeguards which have been put in place to protect two of our most important exports-beef and wool. In an export world where the quality of our wool and meat plays an increasingly vital role in maintaining our competitiveness on international markets, the importance of meat inspection and proper description of our wool fibre cannot be ignored. However, it is not enough to help to ensure the quality of our meat and wool for export. If these exports are to maintain their contribution to the wealth of our nation, what we really need is a quality assurance program on the policies of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) prior to their being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Until recently, the projections for the contribution of these two exports-beef and wool-to our balance of trade figures were particularly encouraging. In December the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics projected that for 1988-89 beef exports would generate $1.9 billion of revenue and wool $6.3 billion. Unfortunately, those assumptions were based on projections which were on the basis of the general assumptions that were set forth by the Government when it handed down the August Budget. Over the last six months the performance of the Australian economy, as we all know, has fallen far short of those assumptions. Each month the news seems to get worse. For example, the Budget projection for inflation was an average of 5.5 per cent for this financial year, slowing, the Treasurer said, to 4.25 per cent by the end of the year. As we know, at the end of 1988 the annual rate of inflation was already 7.7 per cent-around double the rate of our international competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of interest rates, in the Budget the Treasurer suggested that changes to the banking industry and the public sector's reduced demand would exert downward pressure on interest rates. Oh that it were true! Of course, the actual performance has been that bank bills, now at 17 per cent, are around 6 per cent higher than a year ago, and housing interest rates have surged 2 per cent since last June. </PARA>
<PARA> Most crucially, because this Bill deals with wool and meat exports, the Budget estimate for the balance of payments was for a $9.5 billion deficit for the 12 months to June next year. As members of this House and the public know, the current account deficit has already exceeded the annual estimated figure. The deficit to date is $9.6 billion. The Treasurer said that we would have a $9.5 billion deficit for the whole year. January alone produced a record current account deficit of $1.537 billion. The enormous credibility gap between the Treasurer's forecasts and the actual gives the clearest guide to the fact that the Treasurer has lost control. The Treasurer's high interest rate policy is sucking in overseas investment funds, thereby pushing up the value of the Australian dollar. Until recently the Treasurer had purposely and determinedly fostered an artificially high Australian dollar. The value of the dollar rose by almost 18c against the United States dollar from January last year to January this year. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NI4">Mr PORTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point I am making is that the artificially high exchange rate fostered by this Government has done much to erode the international competitiveness of our primary products. Already it has slashed billions of dollars off the value of these exports. The Government-inspired artificially high value of the dollar is one of the greatest threats to the future profitability of Australia's export-dependent farmers. I would have thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, that representing a rural electorate, you would be well aware of that. I am sure you know that the annual assessment of global beef trade by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade showed that Australia was knocked from its position as No. 1 beef exporter in the world-in part because of increased disposals of subsidised European beef onto world markets, but largely as a result of the overvalued Australian dollar. Most export sales of beef are tied to access agreements with the importing countries. Most of our deals, for example with the United States of America, Japan and the Middle East, are traded on a United States dollar basis. The rising Australian dollar impacts directly on the prices Australian farmers receive for their cattle in the saleyard. Lower returns internationally flow through to lower saleyard prices. As a result, farmers' returns for cattle have been declining over recent months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation has acknowledged that the fluctuating Australian currency is looming as the woolgrowers' biggest threat. The rise of the Australian dollar over the last few months has been the largest contributing factor to the dramatic plunge of the wool market indicator over the same period. The vagaries of the Australian dollar are almost totally to blame for the recent fall-off in the demand for Australian wool. Thanks to the monetary policies of this Government, the wool industry now expects growers' returns for 1988-89 to drop by between $500m and $750m. According to the Grains Council of Australia, during 1988 the rising exchange rate wiped in excess of $1 billion off the value of Australia's grain exports. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of weeks the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have been talking the Australian dollar down, with the consequence that it has fallen under US80c this morning. But by itself the tactic of talking the dollar down just will not do. There will be a genuine lift in export sales only if the exchange rate is sustained at this level rather than being artificially pumped up as a result of the Government's monetary policy. Australian exporters are unlikely to benefit from the drop in the Australian dollar if that is seen to be a panic reaction to Government jawboning rather than a realistic market price reflecting the true economic position of the nation. While the Treasurer continues to hold interest rates much higher than world interest rates, inevitably there will be upward pressure on the Australian dollar and all the talk in the world from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or any other Government Minister will not convince the international money markets otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The task ahead for this Government is clear: it must scrap its total reliance on high interest rates as the sole `lever'-to use the Treasurer's term-of economic control. It has not worked, and it is killing our export trade. Not only have farm returns suffered but Labor's policies are threatening the continued viability of many meatworks and other export processors. In my electorate of Barker, meatworks operators have clearly indicated that jobs are on the line as a direct result of Mr Keating's high exchange rate policies. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to claim to have created jobs. Let me make it clear that the only jobs he has created are in his expanded Public Service, and they have been created at great cost to the taxpayer. With more appropriate economic management the private sector would have created a great many more jobs than this Government supposedly has created, especially if the private sector had not been hit by Labor's massive tax increases. Nevertheless, the fact is that right now jobs are on the line unless the recent fall in the value of the Australian dollar is sustained. Under this and related legislation beef producers this year will pay $80m to have their products pass export inspection; but what good is having the best meat export inspection system in the world if no-one in the world wants to buy the product because it is uncompetitive?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's strategy of relying solely on tight monetary policy as a means of reducing domestic demand has failed. A better alternative to reduce domestic demand is for the Government to reduce its demand. When discussing this option the Treasurer always says that there is no scope for cuts. He says that there is no fat left. But examination of the Budget documents indicates that much of the reduction in Government outlays that he has supposedly undertaken comes from the sale of assets and from moving Government entities and agencies off Budget. That does not reduce overall demand. It merely moves the demand from the Government, in some instances, to statutory authorities or to the private sector. There is no net reduction in demand. This Government has to embark on a course of real public expenditure cuts, and one place to start is in the area of the Government's capital works program. The Treasurer claims that the building industry is overheated and his remedy is to throttle the industry and price young home buyers out of the market by pushing up interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In concluding, Mr Deputy Speaker, I reiterate the point that I made earlier. The concern that I and the exporters of beef and wool have is that this Government has undertaken a course of economic management which has involved pushing up the value of the Australian dollar and that has undermined their export opportunities. It is all very well for the Government to say in this Bill that it wants to ensure that the only products exported from this country are high quality products. All growers agree with that. That is no problem. But if the Government is to be consistent it has to look to its basic economic policy to ensure that the export inspection is not wasted. It will be wasted if we cannot compete on international markets. We will be able to compete on international markets only if we have a dollar that is at a realistic level that reflects market values rather than one that is pumped up to a high value as a result of this Government's economic policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The way in which the Government ought to be approaching the need to increase exports from this country is to adopt a multi-lever approach rather than a single lever approach; that is, to cut its own expenditure, for example, on public works. I call on the Treasurer to announce immediately a substantial curtailment of new government office building contracts as an indication of his commitment to cutting Commonwealth expenditure, to reducing interest rates and to bringing to an end his policy of maintaining an artificially high Australian dollar exchange rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) this evening. Notwithstanding that it covers a number of primary industries including the sugar, beef and wool industries, I will deliberately restrict my comments to the ramifications of the legislation in relation to the sugar industry. The Bill in effect provides for the repeal of the Sugar Agreement Act 1985 to take effect from 1 July this year. The effect of the Act was formerly to prohibit the importation of sugar and sugar products as described in the 1984 Commonwealth-Queensland sugar agreement, which expires on 30 June this year. Notwithstanding the expiry of that agreement, the legislation provides that the import prohibition extends beyond that date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The genesis for this Bill arose from the Government's May economic statement last year. In that statement it was announced that the prohibition on the importation of sugar and sugar products was to be replaced by ad valorem tariffs of 35 per cent and 25 per cent on raw and refined sugar respectively. The tariff is to be phased down to 15 per cent in 1992. It is important to understand that the initial tariff rates are set to provide a form of support with the lifting of the import embargo and the domestic price arrangement. Discussions have over time proceeded between the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and industry officials. Whilst agreement has not been reached the Minister has responded in a positive way by announcing that an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry will be held in 1991 on the long term tariff levels to apply from 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry's concern on tariff levels and the form of the tariffs will be addressed in that inquiry with the benefit of two years experience of the industry's changed circumstances. The Minister also has announced that payment of a duty will be required on any sugar imported from Fiji. As you come from a sugar producing area, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would no doubt know of the relevance of this, but the previous speaker, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), obviously did not. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have previously indicated, it was in the May economic statement last year that the Government announced a number of very significant policy changes that affected the whole Australian economy. As part of this process the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy presented a report to Parliament outlining the Government's policies for growth in primary industries and resources. With the experience of the international economic circumstances that we had faced over the preceding five years, it was common knowledge that primary industries, including the sugar industry, were the first to experience that slump. To handle any future slumps without another massive recession the Australian economy had to be restructured. As a nation we had to take advantage of all available productive opportunities to overcome the balance of payments and foreign debt problems. Importantly, this does not mean favouring one sector at the expense of another-something that I believe has been sadly overlooked in the past by the sugar industry. It is trite to say that equal treatment will in the long run help all competitive activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Given proper market signals, producers themselves are quite prepared to make the necessary adjustments. The Government does not want-nor should it-to direct this process but we do need to support it. It is necessary for us to take away as many impediments as possible from national productivity. The Government has a fine record of alleviating a number of those impediments. In short, we have, generally speaking, freed up financial markets, and we have floated the dollar so that it can find its proper level in relation to other currencies. Major industries have undergone wholesale restructuring, including, importantly, the reduction of tariffs. Importantly for agriculture we have reformed and continue to reform marketing structures. Whilst there is some dissent and disagreement in the parties opposite, we have taken measures to reduce farm costs as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry is not apart from other primary industries or manufacturing industries, which also must be involved in their own restructuring. Agriculture as a whole, including sugar, will benefit from the May economic statement of last year by at least $350m. I emphasise that no agricultural industry could have expected to be exempted. The sugar industry will now be able to negotiate its own prices on the domestic market, which will be influenced by the landed cost of potential imports, including tariffs. Anti-dumping arrangements have recently been upgraded to ensure that import prices are not depressed by export subsidies overseas. The domestic price will always be well above returns from the 80 per cent of production exported. As other major agricultural industries such as sheep, beef and wheat receive only export prices, the sugar industry will remain in a privileged position. This will help the industry compared with the period 1971 to 1986 when the embargo actually cost the industry money. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry itself will virtually determine the level of imports because imports will occur only if the prices charged are high enough to make importing economic. The sugar industry can decide whether it prefers to save the transport costs to centres such as Darwin, Perth and Hobart, or whether it wants to compete in those markets. One adverse effect of the embargo was dramatically highlighted by the shortage created by the pre-Christmas strike in the Melbourne refinery of CSR Ltd. In any other industry imports would have automatically met this shortage, but the embargo resulted in hundreds of stand-downs in sugar using industries. The Minister, by exercising his legal responsibilities and allowing emergency imports into Melbourne and Tasmania, prevented thousands of additional stand-downs and further damage to the competitiveness of sugar-based products against both imports and artificial sweeteners. The reimposition of the embargo after the dispute was resolved shows that the temporary suspension had nothing to do with its removal in July. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a duty-and I believe the Minister accepts that duty-of closely monitoring the effects of the removal of the embargo. The Government will monitor any imports. No doubt the industry will be aware of price and quantity implications. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy will consult the industry and advise the Minister of economic and policy implications. It is important that the Government act if, for example, the present anti-dumping arrangements prove to be inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> All this discussion relates basically to domestic sugar prices. Job opportunities, however, are not determined by domestic prices alone; they are determined by the volume of sugar produced, which is virtually unaffected by price changes because of the extensive regulations governing sugar production. In fact, the over-regulation of sugar growing has substantially reduced the level of industry output. Hence employment is below what might otherwise have been the case. It is important that the industry come to terms with its export orientation. It should look at the regulatory framework it has inherited from the different circumstances of the past and the false assumptions on which it is based. Removing some of the shackles would increase returns to growers, provide more jobs for mill and other workers, and increase the industry's overall contribution to the Australian economy and particularly the Queensland economy. It is understandable why the industry has the regulatory structure that it does. It wanted to control access and obligation to the domestic market and long term contracts to equalise the relative bargaining position of growers and millers and to provide equitable access to collectively provided infrastructure facilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the House's attention to the fiasco of the Barwon River bridge which is proposed to connect the electorates of Corangamite and Corio. This is a classic example of the industrial relations malaise that faces Australia. This particular bridge is the second biggest bridge in Victoria after the West Gate Bridge. The background of its construction is that it is now one-third completed in 1989, when originally the bridge was proposed to be finished by September 1988, the bicentennial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This bridge attracts bicentennial funding-$14m of Federal funds and $14m of State funds to build up the approaches to the bridge. At this stage the Federal Government has paid the money to the Victorian Government through the Road Construction Authority (RCA). Lewis Constructions are the builders who are setting about to build this bridge. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole project has been surrounded by rumour, secrecy and no action. A dispute arose when the bridge was about one-quarter constructed. The bridge had been in the priority line for 10 years and was projected to be finished in 1988. Originally the Federal funds were diverted to the West Gate Bridge. I made representations on behalf of the South Barwon city that the funds return to this particular project. It originally got off the ground at a late stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The industrial dispute started with a minor dispute over the sacking of one rigger. Now we have a Mexican standoff, with Lewis Constructions and the Australian Workers Union and other unions saying that they will not talk and will have no dialogue. This bridge remains at a standstill. The Victorian Government will take no action. The RCA is restrained from taking any legal action against either the Government or the unions because of the terms of its contract. There are a number of unions involved in a minor way. The construction company will not take action in these sorts of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed in recent days that the Road Construction Authority is now spending the $14m that has been allocated to it on the approaches to the bridge. But we are not sure where the Federal funds are-whether the Victorian Government has taken the money and is using it for another project. I have sent to the Federal Minister a letter requesting that he investigate the whereabouts of the $14m. There is no action on the bridge. The money presumably has been paid to the Victorian Government. The people of Corangamite and Corio want to know where their money is and why the bridge has not yet been constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage the bridge remains uncompleted, standing there on the skyline with the run-ups connected and a couple of major pylons in the river and nothing going on. It is a symbol of the archaic industrial relations system we have in Australia under a Labor government in Victoria which will take no action against the unions involved, will take no action against the construction company, and does not have the courage to do anything about it whatsoever. Nobody will do anything. The people of Geelong are asking their Federal members and their local representatives why the State Government and the Federal Government will not bring about some action to make sure that this very important project is completed in the bicentennial year, which has now moved through to February 1989. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to make a few comments about productivity. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) in the chamber. I would be pleased if he had something to say in reply. This morning the honourable member for Wentworth was on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program AM. He stated that Australian workers did not deserve a wage-tax trade-off of $30 a week wage increase and up to $20 a week in tax cuts. He stated that he believed workers should receive only wage increases based on productivity. He has been talking a lot lately about productivity. Being the learned economics professor that he is and a former director of the Macquarie Bank, I am sure he knows a lot more about economics than I do. My economics training is limited to what I learnt in R. J. Brown's Student Economics, written by a great author who is now a Minister in this Government. When I was studying R. J. Brown's Student Economics very closely we were taught what productivity is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My interest in the question of productivity was heightened by comments made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who I believe is supposed to be the Opposition spokesman in this area. He was interviewed on Brian White's program on 2UE in Sydney over the Christmas break. His answers to questions from Brian White about how the Opposition proposed to measure productivity to determine how much workers should get in wage increases demonstrated that the honourable member for Flinders knew nothing about productivity. Perhaps the honourable member for Wentworth could conduct a few private coaching lessons for that honourable member to ensure that he knows what productivity is next time he appears on the Brian White program. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote to the House some comments on this subject by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald of 18 February. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Productivity concerns the efficiency with which resources are used. You measure it by comparing the output of the production process with the inputs to the process. So it's output per unit of input. </PARA>
<PARA> When it's all boiled down, the thing which raises productivity over the years is technological progress. Productivity is vitally important because it's a major determinant of our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Often, when people speak of ``productivity'', what they're actually referring to is the productivity of labour-output per unit of labour . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But, though it's rarely mentioned, you can also measure the productivity of capital-output per unit of capital. </PARA>
<PARA> The productivity of labour rises if workers are given more capital (better machines) to work with. The productivity of capital rises if extra workers are used. </PARA>
<PARA> So changes in the ratio of capital to labour (machines to men) cause changes in labour productivity and capital productivity. When one goes up, the other goes down. </PARA>
<PARA>Basically what that is saying is that, if a particular company invests a lot of money to provide up to date and modern capital equipment, then perhaps the productivity of labour will go down even though the company is working better and has put in the most modern machinery possible and uses fewer workers. In an example like that we have achieved a great deal because, with modern machinery, that company can possibly compete on the world market. Yet the Opposition is saying that something like that, which results in a reduction in the statistical measure of labour productivity, should result in those workers having a cut in their wages. There are other examples cited where perhaps the productivity of labour on farms would go down during bad seasons and droughts. The Opposition is saying that the wages paid to people who work in the agricultural sector should go down if the output from the agricultural sector goes down. Of course they should not. The Opposition is simply seeking to hide the fact that it is opposed to any wage increases for the Australian population. It is seeking to cover its tracks by claiming that it would increase wages by some mysterious factor which, it claims, will be measured by some term called productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has opposed every wage increase which workers have sought since the early 1980s. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said in this House today, there has been an increase in commodity prices, there has been an increase in Australia's level of national income, and this Government will make sure that ordinary wage and salary earners get their fair share of the increase in our national income. I believe this Government can be proud of the genuine improvements in productivity of Australia's manufacturing sector which have resulted from the accord. We were the ones who negotiated the second tier agreement which got rid of massive numbers of poor work practices. We are the ones who are now negotiating for award restructuring to improve the economy while the Opposition, living in the past, says that workers, despite accepting all these reforms, deserve not an extra cent as a wage increase. I am sure the workers of Australia will make their judgment of the Opposition. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apparently, as somebody says, he does not understand it. The second part of the saga relates to local airport ownership. Mackay Airport has been looking at local ownership ever since it was encouraged to do so by past Ministers in 1984 and 1985. Perhaps what I should do is just go back to frame the history of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 23 October 1984 the then Minister for Aviation, the present Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley), said that the aerodrome local ownership plan (ALOP) was to continue. Thus there was an encouragement within the press release of that date for people to pursue that end. On 14 August 1985 the then Minister for Aviation, the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris), announced that there were moves to speed up the ALOP transfers. In the press release of that date he attached a list of the aerodromes eligible for transfer to local ownership. There were 11 from Queensland at that time, and Mackay was one of them. At that stage both the Mackay and Pioneer local councils looked at it on the basis of a feasibility study conducted between the two of them, recognising that they were only two of about six local councils that the airport serviced. They came back from the feasibility study after about 12 months saying that it was not within the capacity of those councils to carry the cost of local ownership. A substantial payment was required in order to bring it up to an appropriate level. </PARA>
<PARA> They then transferred this matter to the Mackay Port Authority, which was logical. The success story that it followed was that of Cairns where the port authority took over the airport and successfully negotiated the changes to the extent where it is now of international standard and one of the busiest airports in Queensland and perhaps in Australia. That was done under a local ownership plan, I might add with the very favourable consideration of the Fraser Government and its Ministers at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, Rockhampton, which was also named as one of the 11 airports that could go to local ownership, took advantage of the plan, and that was opened last weekend at a cost to the Commonwealth of $9m or $10m. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I bring this up tonight is that when the Mackay Port Authority looked at it there were hesitant negotiations to start with. I say `hesitant' because I understand that the public servant within the Department designated to look at it and made available for that purpose deferred the matter for about 12 months due to an illness that he eventually succumbed to. He was taken off the job. So negotiations did not really start until 12 months after that time. Since then the negotiations have been undertaken in good faith by the Port Authority and also by the Department. So it was absolutely a shot out of the blue when it was indicated in the May statement that Mackay, along with the 11 others that have been mentioned, would be transferred to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). </PARA>
<PARA> Could I now go back to the time of the May statement. On 24-25 April 1988 there was a listing in the minutes of the Airport Subcommittee of the Mackay Port Authority indicating that the Minister had given authority to the Department to proceed with negotiations on the basis of $9.3m transfer works, including item 4, runway end turning nodes for occasional wide-bodied charters allowed for on the basis of a 10-year design period. That was apparently the understanding that was transmitted by the Minister to the Department in Queensland and then to the Harbour Board. What we have is a crisis situation. Right at the peak of those negotiations the Government has indicated that the airport ownership is to go to the FAC. The local authority, in this case the Mackay Harbour Board, has the full support of all the local authorities in the area, the commercial bodies and the tourist bodies. In all fairness, it is believed that the local ownership plan should proceed on the basis of an interview with Mr Morris last November by the Mayor of Mackay and also the Harbour Board chairman. But nothing has been indicated and no reply has been given. I commend to the Government that it lift its act and see what it can do in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that members of the House will allow me to take a couple of minutes to mention the passing away at the weekend of a very dear personal friend and stalwart of the Labor movement, Mr Kelvin Shields of Bacchus Marsh. Kelvin Shields gave a lifetime of support to the Labor movement and always insisted that the voice of ordinary people be heard. His service in time of war and later as a councillor and shire president is a tribute to him as a man committed to his country, his family and the community in which he lived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a very special moment last year at the Australian Labor Party (ALP) State conference in Victoria, Kelvin joined the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, on the stage to be presented with his medallion for 40 years of service to the ALP, a tribute which he valued as much as, if not more greatly than, the similar tribute of recognition paid to him by the Returned Services League of Australia. He was a man who worked tirelessly for the things in which he believed, and he never expected thanks or public appreciation, and it is fitting that he is remembered in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that his wife Hazel and members of the family accept my deepest condolences at this very sad moment and that our appreciation of the positive role that Kel played in the lives of all those who knew him is conveyed to all members of the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today more than 5,000 of South Australia's elderly braved century heat to march from Adelaide's Victoria Square to Elder Park in protest at the dire financial plight they find themselves in under the Hawke Labor Government. One and a half million Australian old age pensioners have never been so badly off. Costs, and in particular government taxes and charges, continue to rise while their meagre entitlements limp along six months behind, and to add insult to injury, their every effort to protect their savings is constantly frustrated by the most tax-hungry Treasurer of all time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a man who thinks he has a mortgage on every dollar of every transaction in the national economy unless it can be proved otherwise. This is a man who has never earned the average wage. The single pensioner's weekly entitlement of $124 is what the Treasurer gets in travelling allowance for one day. The Hawke Labor Government has completely lost touch with the ordinary people of Australia; so much so that the elderly, the pensioner groups that have always been divided, have finally come together on a stinking hot day in my electorate in Adelaide to demand a better deal. </PARA>
<PARA> These people come in the door of my electorate office every day. One old lady in her 80s comes in regularly with her pension problems. She is one of the lucky ones because at least she owns her own home and has $4,000 in the bank, but that is all she has in the world. If her roof needs repair, her gutters leak or her fridge conks out, there is only one source of finance that will solve her problems, and that is her savings; and four grand does not go very far in 1989. I ask honourable members opposite to tell us how many daily necessities combined with the cost of living they could buy on $124 per week. If that is the best we can manage for our elderly, then we stand as a national disgrace in the global community. </PARA>
<PARA> At today's Seniors Rally in Adelaide the Australian Democrats, ever keen to cash in on any opportunity, handed out a pamphlet. This sad little document detailed everything that the Democrats had done for pensioners to date. It is the shortest list in the world. But, more importantly what the Democrats neglected to tell us was what they have done to make the pensioners' lot worse. The Democrats supported the Hawke Government's tax on superannuation, creating one of the greatest disincentives to be self-sufficient in retirement. The Democrats support Labor's assets test which, far from stopping the fat cats and the idle rich from arranging their affairs so they can still cash in on the pension, has hit the honest hard workers who have spent their lives pulling their weight and providing themselves with what they thought would be a comfortable retirement. The Democrats supported the means test on the over-70s pension. Those who have missed out are again the marginal cases, those who have had their nest eggs ravaged by inflation. The Democrats supported the Hawke Government's capital gains tax, again specifically hitting those who spent their working lives investing in a secure old age, unravelling their plans like a cheap sweater as the winter sets in. The Australian Democrats have a shameful record where the elderly are concerned, instanced not least by Senator Haines's recent labelling of the Seniors Lobby as `geriatric fascists'. If the Democrats are crook, I guess Labor is worse. I am sure we remember the market linked investments fiasco that came back and bit Labor on the arm. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia's Bannon Government has a record which has seen a massive increase in crimes of violence against the elderly. The figures show a dramatic upswing in crime, coupled with a downturn in the value of penalties for those crimes, almost from the day the Bannon Government took office. The Bannon Government is so worried about the dramatic turn of events that has seen the Seniors Lobby unite the protest that it is going out of its way to discredit its every move. If you cannot make them go away, then assassinate their credibility; that is typical socialist thinking. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia's Labor movement last week engineered a talkfest on the elderly in my electorate. I recently attended a workshop organised by the Australian Council of Social Service to discuss a national retirement income policy. None of that was mentioned. It received minimal publicity. Not one of the leaders of the three main seniors groups in Adelaide-Greypower, the Senior Citizens of Australia and the Seniors Action Committee-was invited. </PARA>
<PARA> Premier Bannon's address was characterised by his warning that the Seniors Lobby would be hijacked by political parties. How right he was. The irony is that it is Bannon and South Australia's Labor movement that are trying desperately to hijack the credibility of these groups, who have a legitimate gripe, so legitimate that 5,000 of them turned out in the heat to stand up and be counted, the second such mass rally in a month in Adelaide. I close with a quote from those 5,000 marchers who raised their voices in song today with their own retirement anthem:</PARA>
<PARA>We still have hope yet. We still have fight left. We'll leave our mark at the polls on the day. To protest in a way that our voices echo what we say. We'll leave our mark at the polls on the day. </PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly a salient quote from the pensioners of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to respond to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt). If he intends sending a copy of his speech to any of the pensioners in his electorate, I would challenge him to send also a copy of the remarks I am about to make. The honourable member for Adelaide started off his contribution tonight by saying he was concerned about the pensioner who lives on the base rate pension and nothing but the pension, and he rightly said that that is only $124 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He, I hope genuinely, said he was concerned about the pensioner with only $4,000 in the bank who finds it hard to make ends meet. I accept that and, as a member of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes, I have also had many pensioners explain to me how difficult it is, if they are living alone, to maintain the guttering or the plumbing. If they have electricity faults in their house, it is very difficult for them to have tradesmen come to their home and repair those faults, especially when they live on nothing but the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> We should remember that 60 per cent of pensioners get the base pension. They are the real battlers who are finding it very hard to make ends meet. The problem that the honourable member has overlooked is that every time we give a dollar to people who are better off that is one dollar less we have for that lady he mentioned who is living on only $124 a week, with $4,000 in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member seemed to be arguing that we should not have an assets test on pensioners, that we should not have a means test on over-70s and that the Government should give back money to those who earn capital gains and those who benefit very greatly from getting lump sum superannuation payments. But if we sacrifice that money and we give pensions to people who have substantial assets and substantial interest earnings and investment earnings, does that not mean that the Australian Government, whether it is Labor or Liberal, has less money to help that lady with only $4,000 in the bank and getting only $124 a week? Surely honourable members opposite must accept that the days of saying that we can abolish assets tests and means tests and give a pension to everyone are long gone. The Opposition spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), has been trying to push the Opposition in that direction, and I pay tribute to him for trying to make the Opposition face the reality of the situation. I understand that the Opposition now accepts the assets test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow Minister for finance now says, it has been announced, and I am pleased to see that the Opposition has finally accepted the assets test. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) was not in the House to hear many of the speeches of the former member for Denison, Mr Hodgman, and his claims that the assets test meant that the gold in pensioners' teeth would have to be assessed. That is one of the more outrageous scare tactics used by the Opposition during the assets test fight. I commend the Opposition for saying now that it was wrong on the assets test and that the Australian Government, whether Labor or Liberal, these days has to accept that we cannot afford to pay pensions to people who can afford to look after themselves in their retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The assets test limits are pretty generous, and the means test system tries to make sure that people have enough in non-pension income to look after themselves; but we really have to remember that every time we give a dollar to the Robert Clarkes, Jim Killens or William McMahons of the world that is one dollar less for that woman in the Adelaide electorate who lives on the base pension of $124 and has great difficulty in making ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought there would have been support from both sides of this House had the honourable member come in here tonight and said, `We have to try to help that person on the base rate pension; we have to make sure there is more money for that person'. Instead, what are the issues on his agenda? They are no tax on people getting big lump sums, no assets test and abolition of capital gains tax. I would not have thought that pensioner on $124 a week was too worried about those three issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No formal restrictions are imposed upon the Australian Ambassador in travelling to open cities in the USSR. All other Australian diplomatic representatives are required to seek permission 48 hours in advance of travelling to those cities open to visits by foreigners. The list of open cities is changed regularly. In Vietnam permission is required for Australian diplomatic representatives to travel outside Hanoi, with the exception of travel to the nearby Noi Bai International Airport. In principle this permission needs to be sought seven days in advance for travel to the south and three days in advance for travel elsewhere, but in practice this rule is seldom enforced. Permission is rarely, if ever, refused. In Laos, Australian diplomatic representatives need to seek permission one week in advance to travel beyond checkpoints approximately seven kilometres from the centre of Vientiane.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No restrictions are placed on travel within Australia by Vietnamese and Laotian diplomatic representatives or on the Ambassador of the USSR. No restriction is placed on the Soviet Consul-General in Sydney for travel between Sydney and Canberra. In all other cases, diplomatic representatives of the USSR are required to provide the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with 24 or 48 hours notification of any intention to travel within Australia depending on rank, mode of transport and destination.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr Barry Jones</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Under the proposed terms of the joint venture arrangements established for this project a minimum of 45% of contracts will be awarded to Australian companies. It is anticipated that Australian industry participation will in fact be substantially higher than this.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. I am advised that the engineering design and management of the project will be undertaken by a joint venture between Japan Gasoline Company and Clough Engineering Group of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I understand that the contract has effectively been awarded to the Japan Gasoline Company however a central element of this contract is the joint venture involving Clough Engineering Group.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A number of Government policies encourage Australian firms to develop project management capabilities skills and technologies which will enable them to be better placed to compete for major projects on both the domestic and overseas markets. The thrust of Government industry policies is to encourage the development of internationally competitive industries with reduced reliance on import protection and regulation. In this regard the joint venture arrangements to be adopted in this case are consistent with these Government policies.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) At the outset I remind Honourable Members that the contract was arranged by the Petro Chemical Industries Limited. That company has given undertakings to do its utmost to maximise local content. I understand agreement has already been reached between the companies involved, this State Government, the Confederation of Western Australian Industry, the Trades and Labor Council of Western Australia, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and the Association of Consulting Engineers of Australia to establish a committee which will ensure communications between the company and local industry on how they can be best involved in the project.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I do not believe that it is necessary at this stage to speak to the Western Australian Minister who has already made public the reasons which he believes affect the level of local participation in the design of the petrochemical plant. I understand that the Western Australian Minister will chair a tripartite forum which will enable local content concerns to be aired and resolved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australian banks' outstanding loans to developing economies (as defined by the International Monetary Fund) totalled $US9.8 billion at the end of December 1987 of which $US1.9 billion represented loans to rescheduling countries. This exposure to rescheduling countries, however, has since been reduced through the writing-off of some loans and by some banks selling loans in the secondary market. Most of the outstanding loans were undertaken by the major trading banks. Details of individual banks' outstanding loans to developing countries are supplied to the authorities on a confidential basis.</PARA>
<PARA>The following information on exposures to debt-rescheduling countries has been provided by the major trading banks in their latest statements of annual results.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) ANZ Bank</PARA>
<PARA> At 30 September 1988 the Group's exposure to borrowers in rescheduling countries subject to provisions was $1,380.3 million.</PARA>
<PARA> This amount represented 1.9 per cent of total Group assets (compared with 2.3 per cent in 1987). Over 90 per cent of ANZ's total exposure to debt rescheduling countries relates to lending to governments, banks and government entities.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Westpac Banking Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> At 30 September 1988 the Group's exposure to countries rescheduling external debt was approximately $300 million. This was around 0.4 per cent of total assets, and represented a reduction of around $112 million on the level at end-September 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) National Australia Bank</PARA>
<PARA> At 30 September 1988 the Group had sold all of its rescheduled debts.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Commonwealth Bank</PARA>
<PARA> At 30 June 1988 the Commonwealth Bank and its subsidiaries had a total loan exposure of approximately $30 million to countries experiencing debt servicing problems.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australian banks establish provisions against doubtful debts through charges against income. These include both specific provisions to cover against identified doubtful debts and general provisions to cover against possible (but unidentifiable) future losses.</PARA>
<PARA> There are no restrictions on the amounts that banks can set aside as provisions. The amounts are decided by banks' boards and are reviewed by their external auditors. Details of banks' provisions for bad and doubtful debts, including information on provisions relating to debt-rescheduling countries, are included in their published financial statements. The general provisions made by Australian banks relating to their exposures to debt-rescheduling countries are at least comparable with those of other major international banks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The operative paragraphs of the draft resolution read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Condemns the continuing intensification of repression by the South African racist regime such as the arbitrary mass arrest and detention, torture in detention and murder of the leaders and activists of mass organisations, including children, the near total muzzling of the press, the maintenance and expansion of the state of emergency and, in particular, the restriction of seventeen mass organisations and eighteen individuals committed to peaceful forms of struggle;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Declares that racist South Africa's intransigent refusal to comply with the relevant decisions of the Security Council and the resolutions of the General Assembly constitute a direct challenge to the authority of the United Nations and a violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Determines that the policies and practices of apartheid pursued by the Pretoria Racist regime, which are the root cause of the grave and deteriorating situation in South Africa and in southern Africa as a whole, constitute a serious threat to international peace and security;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Decides, under Chapter VII of the Charter and in conformity with its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, to impose the following mandatory sanctions against South Africa, in accordance with Article 41:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Cessation of further investment in, and financial loans to, South Africa;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Ban on the importation of iron and steel;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) An end to all promotion of and support for trade with South Africa;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Prohibition of the sale of kruggerands and all other coins minted in South Africa;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Cessation of all forms of military, police or intelligence co-operation with the authorities of South Africa, in particular the sale of computer equipment;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Cessation of the export and sale of oil to South Africa;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Calls upon all Member States, in conformity with Article 25 of the Charter, to implement the present resolution;</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Requests the specialised agencies to ensure the effective implementation of the present resolution;</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Urges States not members of the United Nations to act in accordance with the provisions of the present resolution;</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Decides to establish, in accordance with rule 28 of its provisional rules of procedure, a Committee of the Security Council to monitor the implementation of the present resolution;</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Calls upon all States to report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on measures taken to implement the present resolution;</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Decides that these measures shall, in the first instance, remain in force for a period of twelve months, after which the Security Council shall meet again to determine whether the South African regime has fully met the following requirements;</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Abolished apartheid;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Rescinded the ban on all political parties and other mass democratic movements;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Released all political prisoners;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Allowed the return of all exiles, without fear of arrest;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Commenced meaningful dialogue with the genuine leaders of the majority of the South African people;</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Further decides that should the Security Council determine that the South African regime has not fulfilled the above requirements it shall renew or increase, as it deems necessary, the measures specified in paragraph 4 above;</PARA>
<PARA> 12. Invites the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on the progress of the implementation of the present resolution and to submit his first report not later than 7 March 1989</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The result of the vote on the draft resolution was:</PARA>
<PARA>in favour: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Nepal, Senegal, USSR, Yugoslavia, Zambia (10)</PARA>
<PARA>against: UK, US (2)</PARA>
<PARA>abstentions: Federal Republic of Germany, France, Japan (3)</PARA>
<PARA>The draft resolution was not adopted owing to the negative votes of two permanent members of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Australia has taken action on all the measures specified in operative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution. In most cases, this has been done by Customs regulations or by executive action.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to Op. 1 on investments, new investment in South Africa by the Government and publicauthorities, except where necessary for the maintenance of Australian diplomatic and consular representation in Southern Africa, has been suspended. The Government has requested Australian banks and other financial institutions to suspend new loans to borrowers in South Africa and has called on Australian investors to refrain from new investment, or reinvestment, in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>(4) National sanctions against South Africa are applied by the US, Japan, Britain and other European Economic Community countries. The sanctions vary significantly in their application and scope and national definitions do not necessarily coincide with those set out in the draft resolution. My Department does not have the resources to conduct a detailed examination necessary to provide the information requested by the honourable Member. He might perhaps draw on the resources of the Parliamentary Library.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) The Department engaged Crosstech Pty Ltd of which Ms V. Read was a principal.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Crosstech's terms of reference were:</PARA>
<PARA>``The Consultant is to provide advice to the Department of Transport and Communications (the Department) on the working relationships between the Department, its air traffic control (ATC) staff and the Civil Air Operations Officers' Association of Australia (the Association) with particular emphasis on the development of options for improvement to a level where a positive and constructive mutual relationship exists.</PARA>
<PARA>The Consultant's program of work is to be divided into two phases:</PARA>
<PARA>PHASE 1</PARA>
<PARA>The Consultant is to provide the Department with an assessment of the working relationship between the Department, ATC staff and the Association.</PARA>
<PARA>In preparing this assessment, the Consultant is to hold discussions with the management of the Department, with Executive members of the Association and with operational field staff and both Regional Office and Central Office ATC management staff.</PARA>
<PARA>The Consultant is to make an oral presentation of the assessment to the Secretary of the Department no later than four weeks after the commencement date of this Agreement. After consultation with the Secretary, and if so requested by the Secretary, the Consultant shall submit a written report on that assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>PHASE 2</PARA>
<PARA>Within five (5) weeks of the commencement date of this Agreement or within such other time as is mutually agreed between the parties, the Consultant is to make an oral presentation to the Secretary to the Department, identifying options available for resolving any problems which exist.</PARA>
<PARA>These options, in addition to resolving short-term problems, should lead to a lasting improvement in long-term relationships.</PARA>
<PARA>After consultation with the Secretary of the Department and if so requested by the Secretary, the Consultant shall submit a written report on those options.''</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Crosstech was paid $13,421 for the work.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Ms Read met with Associate Secretary Freeland on two separate occasions in December 1987 and on one occasion in January 1988 for detailed discussions and she also met with senior managers on two further occasions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At these meetings Ms Read reported on the results of her discussions with approximately 150 people, on her analysis of the current attitudes of both staff and management that were contributing to difficult relationships, on overseas trends in terms of personnel management and on her specific recommendations to improve working relationships between the Department, its Air Traffic Control staff and the Civil Air Operations Officers' Association of Australia (CAOOAA). Ms Read's conclusions included:</PARA>
<PARA> Operational aspects are not given enough weight in decision making.</PARA>
<PARA> An imbalance of expertise of operationally qualified people in the management structure.</PARA>
<PARA> Reference to Air Traffic Controllers' concern regarding future careers in management or other areas of the Department and lack of supervisory and management training for them.</PARA>
<PARA> Problems with devolution of management responsibility from Central Office to Regions.</PARA>
<PARA> Lack of good formal and informal consultative arrangements with staff and the CAOOAA at both Central and Regional level.</PARA>
<PARA> Reference to deficiencies in ``marketing'' of new ideas and concepts to field staff.</PARA>
<PARA> Change in methods of approach to staff relationships that are occurring in similar areas overseas and could be applied in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Some of Ms Read's specific recommendations that have already been implemented include:</PARA>
<PARA> Establishment of a separate aviation consultative group between senior management and aviation unions (commenced operation on 4 February 1988);</PARA>
<PARA> Introduction of regular meetings between Air Traffic Control, management and CAOOAA representatives in all Regions (commenced in March 1988);</PARA>
<PARA> Addressing structural and organisational problems in the identification of a new management structure for the Civil Aviation Authority;</PARA>
<PARA> Special efforts to inform staff of programs and large projects and the effect of these on their working situation.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Other aspects of Ms Read's conclusions are still being considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Mrs Von Blottnitz handed over a number of documents to an officer of the Australian Mission to the EC in Strasbourg on 9 March. These documents included 13 items of correspondence between the German companies Nukem, RWE and transnuklear and the Euratom Supply Agency and Safeguards Directorate dealing with arrangements for an internal exchange of safeguards obligations involving Australian obligated nuclear material. The correspondence was thoroughly examined by the Government. It demonstrates that the application for the exchange went through the appropriate EC regulatory procedures. The Government has determined that the approval for the exchange was consistent with the terms of the Australia/Euratom Safeguards Agreement (see the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy's statement to Parliament of 20 April). Also included in the documents was a copy of a letter Mrs Von Blottnitz had sent to the Prime Minister on 23 February, seeking information on the Government's position on flag swaps.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. Mrs von Blottnitz drew attention to her letter to the Prime Minister but said in regard to the other papers only that they might ``interest'' the Australian Government. The Embassy subsequently informed Mrs von Blottnitz, in accordance with instructions from my Department, that her letter to the Prime Minister was receiving attention and that she could expect a response in due course. She was sent an interim reply from the Office of the Prime Minister on 21 April 1988 and a final reply from my Department on 29 April.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Mrs von Blottnitz's letter to the Prime Minister had been received in Canberra on 29 February and some of the items of leaked correspondence had already been obtained by my Department from ``Der Spiegel''. The documents from Mrs von Blottnitz were assessed in the Embassy following the officer's return to Brussels from Strasbourg on Friday 11 March. The text of Mrs von Blottnitz's letter to Mr Hawke was cabled to Canberra on Monday 14 March and the items of correspondence not already held in Canberra were sent on 15 March and received the following day.</PARA>
<PARA> Other related papers from Mrs von Blottnitz and other sources were also sent at the same time. These were a press release in German dated 10.3.88 and a general statement by and seven questions from Mrs von Blottnitz. Subsequently the Embassy sent to Canberra more papers received from Mrs von Blottnitz. These were a series of questions asked to the European Commission by the European Parliament's Committee of Enquiry into the Handling and Transport of Nuclear Material; Commission replies to a questionnaire from the Committee of Enquiry; and a schedule of meetings for the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The majority of the documents provided by Mrs von Blottnitz are in German. Some are in French and English.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Most of the documents in question have been widely distributed by Mrs von Blottnitz, ``Der Spiegel'', the Rainbow Group and others. The leaked correspondence for example was included in a set of documents distributed to Members and Senators on 18 April by Mr Milton, Member for La Trobe. I shall make available to the Honourable Member a copy of all the documents provided by Mrs von Blottnitz, as well as her letter to the Prime Minister and the two replies.</PARA>

<PARA> The USSR Embassy rents 11 flats and houses from the ACT Housing Trust. The arrangements under which the premises are rented go back many years to when the Commonwealth Government was a principal provider of residential accommodation in the ACT. They reciprocate those made with the Soviet Government for the provision of rental accommodation for staff of the Australian Embassy in Moscow. With the introduction of eligibility criteria for public housing in the ACT, requests by the USSR Embassy for additional leases have been declined. For security reasons, it is not normal practice to make public the addresses of the various premises occupied by staff of the USSR Embassy. Further, I am informed by the ACT Housing Trust that, for reasons of client confidentiality, it could not make the information available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) While specific figures are not readily available, it is possible to make an estimate based on information provided in the Director General's Program of Work and Budget for 1988-89 and the financial outcome which were agreed at the 24th Conference. The Budget approved by the Conference was $US492.36m.</PARA>

<PARA> 1 (b) Again, an exact figure is not available but on the basis that approximately 50% of FAO expenditure is expressed in Italian lire we assess that about $US245m is spent in Italy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia's assessed contribution to the FAO Budget for each of the bienniums since 1978 is set out below.</PARA>

<PARA>1986-87...3 762 000</PARA>
<PARA>* $US pro rata per annum for each biennium</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia's rate of assessment for contributions to FAO is 1.99%. Australia's contribution for the 1988-89 biennium will be approximately $US9,564,000, or $US4,782,000 p.a.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Since 1984 the Australian Government has been working towards the objectives of zero real growth in budgets for the United Nations Organisation and its specialised agencies. Some significant progress has already been achieved in the United Nations and in the agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> In pursuing its objectives in the UN system generally, Australian representatives have been active participants of the Geneva Group (comprising Western countries individually contributing 1% or more to UN budgets). This Group has concentrated on reform, particularly the development of improved and more transparent budget and administrative processes.</PARA>
<PARA> In the FAO these objectives are also pursed by a smaller body-the Camberley Group-of which Australia was a founding member.</PARA>
<PARA> The Camberley Group was instrumental in securing agreement for a major review of the FAO which is currently in progress. The review is examining the role, priorities, strategies and the field programs of the organisation. Australia is represented on the review team by Dr David Smith, a former official in the Victorian Department of Agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's mission to the FAO has been closely associated with the review process and has sought to develop a constructive dialogue between all the parties involved in the review process, including members of the Camberley Group, developing countries and the Secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The FAO operates 18 vehicles in and around Rome. The Director-General and the Directors of the World Food Program and the World Food Council each have a vehicle. There are 12 pool vehicles, 2 shuttle buses and a tow truck.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3) and (4) At the meeting I indicated my willingness to consider, under SkillShare, options for on-the-job training for people with disabilities, provided that appropriate guidelines could be developed.</PARA>
<PARA> Also at the meeting, and in my letter of 1 August 1988 to the Executive Director of the National Association for Training the Disabled in Office Work (NADOW) Training Program, I expressed my concern that extended periods of unpaid on-the-job training should not result in trainees being exploited, or in an undercutting of the general workforce.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that NADOW arranges unpaid on-the-job training of up to 26 weeks for trainees. SkillShare guidelines limit unpaid work experience to 10% of the length of the training program. NADOW therefore, has been encouraged to consider complementing formal training with JOBSTART-the Commonwealth Government's wage subsidy scheme. Under JOBSTART, private sector employers may receive a wage subsidy if they are prepared to provide on-the-job training to improve the employment prospects of disadvantaged job seekers, including people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In 1989, a limited number of SkillShare projects that provide specialist services for people with disabilities will receive funding on the condition that they limit unpaid work experience for trainees with disabilities to a maximum of five weeks. Beyond this time it will be necessary to negotiate links with JOBSTART.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) was established in December 1987 to increase the resources available through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for lending on highly concessional terms to low-income countries facing protracted balance of payments difficulties. It became operational in April 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Eligible countries for loans from the ESAF are those eligible for International Development Assistance funds (ie, the very poor countries, the majority of which are in sub-Saharan Africa). ESAF loans are at the highly concessional rate of  1/2 of one per cent per annum on the outstanding balance, payable semi-annually; repayments are made in ten equal semi-annual instalments, commencing 5 1/2 years and ending 10 years after the date of disbursement.</PARA>
<PARA> The capital contributions by IMF member countries to support ESAF (about SDR6 billion) have been channelled to a trust loan account administered by the IMF. As ESAF loans are at a  1/2 percentage point interest rate and much of the capital has been provided at commercial interest rates, it has also been necessary for contributions to make up this difference. An interest subsidy trust account has been established for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia has not contributed funds to ESAF. Given the dictates of current fiscal policy, and the practice of determining Australia's ODA annually as a global amount, any contribution to ESAF would almost certainly be at the expense of other parts of the aid program. While Australia shares the concerns of other countries about the very difficult conditions facing African countries (which are the predominant beneficiaries of ESAF assistance)-and is increasing its funding to Southern Africa to $A100 million over a three year period-it is not prepared to further increase assistance to those countries at the expense of other countries, including countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is the IMF's policy not to release information on individual contributions to ESAF, except where requested by the contributing member.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) To end-November 1988, three-year arrangements under the ESAF have been approved for five countries, Bolivia, Malawi, Ghana, Senegal and The Gambia. On 15 July 1988 the IMF approved an arrangement for Malawi, equivalent to SDR 55.8 million. Bolivia's arrangement, equivalent to SDR 136.05 million, was approved on 27 July 1988. On 10 November 1988 the IMF approved an arrangement for Ghana, equivalent to SDR 368.1 million. On 22 November 1988 an arrangement, equivalent to SDR 144.67 million was approved for Senegal and The Gambia's arrangement, equivalent to SDR 20.52 million, was approved on 23 November 1988.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) A licensee is required to give an undertaking to the Tribunal that it will provide an adequate and comprehensive service pursuant to the licence, having regard, among other things to the nature and diversity of interests of the community in the service area. A fresh undertaking is required with each licence renewal application.</PARA>
<PARA> At the last renewal inquiries for the Sydney and Melbourne licences, the Tribunal reiterated the need for licensees to conduct proper ascertainment research about the community, to provide programming for substantial minority and special interest groups and to encourage diversity in programming. The Tribunal particularly emphasised the need for licensees to distinguish between their role as network program suppliers and their licence obligations to provide a service within a particular area.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Television stations in Sydney and Melbourne are the main suppliers of programs to the networks and to regional stations. This means that programs produced in say, Melbourne can be shown in Sydney and elsewhere throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Advertising material is produced by agencies in many centres in Australia and placed with stations, either locally or nationally, according to the needs of the client. Therefore, it is not unusual for a station to transmit an advertisement for a nationally or regionally available product or service, which was produced elsewhere than in the city in which the station is located.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal does not regulate the production of advertisements, other than to require that they be produced in Australia or New Zealand by Australian or New Zealand residents, or in a foreign location by Australian residents who travelled there for the purpose of producing the advertisement(s).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Tribunal has no knowledge that NSW community service announcements are being shown in Melbourne-no complaints have been received on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) At licence renewal inquiries the public is invited by the Tribunal to make submissions about the performance of the licensees. Renewal inquiries for the Melbourne and Sydney television licences are about to commence. Notices advertising the commencement of the inquiries and inviting submissions from members of the public were published in early November. Clearly, the matter of networking versus local programming will be a major issue to be considered by the Tribunal in the context of those inquiries.</PARA>

<PARA> (6) Since 1980 the following embassies and high commissions have been closed:</PARA>
<PARA> Addis Ababa (December 1987), Accra (March 1985), Dar Es Salaam (November 1987).</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to close these missions was taken with great reluctance and was solely for budgetary reasons. It was necessitated by the extraordinary constraints dictated by the economic situation and reflected the Government's commitment to cutting expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> The Honourable Member might also be interested to know that as part of the continuous review of the Department's financial and staffing resources it was decided to close the Australian Consulate in Capetown. The Consulate closed in May 1984 and its consular responsibilities have been transferred to the Australian Embassy in Pretoria.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Since 1980 the Australian Government has opened an embassy in Addis Ababa (December 1984) and high commissions in Harare (April 1980), Lusaka (August 1980) and Port Louis (March 1984).</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to open the high commission in Harare and Lusaka reflected the Government's close, continuing interest in the political stability and economic development of southern Africa. Australia's commitment to assist in the future progress of the region had been attested to by its active involvement in the Lusaka Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting and by the subsequent distance with implementation of the Lancaster House agreements on Zimbabwe, particularly in regard to monitoring of the ceasefire and observance of the election. The establishment of the missions enabled Australia to strengthen and deepen its relations with the southern Africa region generally, as well as enhancing bilateral relations with two fellow Commonwealth countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian High Commission in Port Louis was established because of the importance Australia attaches to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Indian Ocean region, and in that context, the central location of Mauritius, both politically and strategically.</PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for opening the Australian Embassy in Addis Ababa derived from the Joint Committee's report on Australia's representation in Africa (of December 1983) which recommended that Australia open a resident mission there. The Government then decided that it would be in keeping with Australia's interests in this region, and with our intention to focus Australia's foreign policy role towards the Indian Ocean and East Africa, to establish a small resident mission in Addis Ababa to:</PARA>
<PARA> provide Australia with a direct channel of communication with the Ethiopian Government and our first resident diplomatic presence in the Horn of Africa;</PARA>
<PARA> manage Australia's large scale emergency food aid program to Ethiopia;</PARA>
<PARA> serve as a point of contact with the Organisation of African Unity and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, both of which have their headquarters in Addis Ababa.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) There are no plans to reopen the Embassy in Addis Ababa. The Chancery at Addis Ababa was leased and the lease was relinquished when the post was closed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Food imported into Australia must comply with relevant customs and quarantine requirements and domestic food legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Testing to ensure that such foods comply with the limits set out in the Commonwealth Gazette No. P19 of 15 July 1988 is primarily the responsibility of the State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Gazette being referred to contains the first set of amendments to the National Health and Medical Research Council's ``Food Standards Code'' which is the basis of the individual State and Territory food legislation. The amendments in the Gazette become effective on 1 February 1989 and will be adopted into State and Territory food legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The export of food from Australia is controlled by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The honourable member's question relating to testing of food exports should be referred to my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Food grown in Australia for domestic consumption must comply with relevant State or Territory food regulations. Each individual State and Territory Government is responsible for testing to check compliance with those regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> (d), (e), (f) and (g) As the responsibility for such testing belongs to State and Territory Governments and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, there is no readily available compilation of the numbers of samples analysed for such residues over the periods indicated in the honourable member's question.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council, which set the limits in the Gazette referred to, monitors and assesses the levels of the residues being found through the work of its specialist committees and the Market Basket (Noxious Substances) Surveys. These have indicated that the levels of residues found in foods are generally well within specified limits.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="131" SPEAKER="Staples The Hon P.R." NAMEID="KJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="RICHMOND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr Staples</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The Commonwealth does not set the level of hostel fees and does not propose to introduce a national fee assessment scheme. The fee to be charged individual residents is determined by the hostel, with the agreement of that resident.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is, however, setting in place a basic protection for all residents by specifying a minimum amount of income that all residents must be left with after paying fees, income tax and the Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1984, the Commonwealth has protected financially disadvantaged people by limiting the fees they can be charged to 85 per cent of the sum of the maximum rate pension plus rent assistance. For other people, however, some proprietors charged excessively high fees including fees which exceeded a person's entire income.</PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements, coming into place in January 1989, will ensure that these people are now protected because there will be a specific minimum amount of income with which they must at least be left after paying fees. This will assist in maintaining the quality of life and dignity of all residents.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the new arrangements will provide maximum flexibility for service providers in setting fees for residents, while ensuring a basic level of protection for all residents.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Only those few proprietors who wish to continue charging excessive fees have reason to be concerned with the arrangements. These fee arrangements were the subject of extensive consultation with consumer and industry bodies and their concerns have been addressed through the provision of a generous transitional period by which to meet the requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> No resident is forced to disclose her/his financial position for fee setting purposes. Instead, residents may choose to either:</PARA>
<PARA>avail themselves of the protections afforded under the Commonwealth fee arrangements, and advise operators of their income so that fees may be set accordingly; or</PARA>
<PARA>opt to pay the fee asked by the hostel operator.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The Department has not undertaken a survey of hostels as it is considered that such a survey is unlikely to produce any meaningful results as Commonwealth funded hostels, of which there are nearly 1000, have very different financial arrangements. Instead, therefore, the Government has opted to introduce the new arrangements gradually, with a view to monitoring and reviewing their adequacy and modifying them where necessary.</PARA>

<PARA> My Department has no direct regulatory role in relation to food inspection. In the Federal arena specific issues are controlled by the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Imported foods have to comply with the same State or Territory food laws which apply to domestically produced foods.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Foodstuffs imported into Australia from Europe have been subject to a surveillance program since the accident at Chernobyl. Those imported from countries some distance from Chernobyl (List 1 countries) undergo random sampling at the point of entry to check for the presence of radioactivity and those from countries closer to Chernobyl (List 2 countries) must be accompanied by a certificate giving the concentration of caesium 137 in them.</PARA>
<PARA> If measurements or certificates show that a concentration of 100 Bq/kg (becquerel/kilogram) is not exceeded, goods are cleared through Customs quickly; if this value is exceeded, Customs refer the issue for consideration by my Department before clearance can be effected.</PARA>
<PARA> A variety of foodstuffs has been imported since the accident, but only a few have exceeded the trigger value of 100 Bq/kg. Permits are not issued if the concentration exceeds 600 Bq/kg. This is in line with the value commonly used in the European Community and is well below limits recommended by the World Health Organization.</PARA>
<PARA> Assessment of the risks to health from consumption of foodstuffs with values as high as 600 Bq/kg show that the risks are negligible, particularly as these foodstuffs are only consumed in small quantities.</PARA>
<PARA> State and Territory Governments may monitor appropriate foods for the presence of hormones and antibiotics. My Department is not directly involved in such monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that free radical levels in foods are not regulated and that methodology to test for the presence of irradiated foods is still being developed.</PARA>
<PARA> For hormones and antibiotics, acceptable levels are laid down in relevant State and Territory legislation with the levels being determined as safe when their presence in the food is not associated with untoward effects and represents the lowest residual amounts attainable.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr Dawkins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My Department provided $152,673 in 1987-88 for the production of a comic specifically addressing employment and training issues.</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, the Youth Bureau within my Department provided $37,000 in 1987-88 and $30,000 in 1988-89 as contributions to the development of other editions of Streetwize comics in recognition of Streetwize's ability to get across messages to a particularly disadvantaged group of young people.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The number of copies and distribution of Streetwize comics varies from one issue to the next. There were 200,000 copies of the employment and training comic. These were distributed to Community Youth Support Services (CYSS), Youth Refuges, Youth Centres, Schools and Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) offices and Youth Access Centres (YACs).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I received one complaint from a couple in NSW in February this year. In response, it was pointed out that Streetwize is a medium relevant to that section of young people who do not identify with conventional media treatment of those issues which are important to them.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. Evaluations of the impact of the comics show that their style and language are viewed by disadvantaged young people as realistic and relevant in terms of their own life experiences. Young people targeted by Streetwize Comics are not readily informed by more traditional media campaigns.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main debate on Third World debt at the September meeting of UNCTAD's Trade and Development Board took place in the context of a draft resolution tabled by the G77 under Agenda Item 5 (Review of the Implementation of the Guidelines contained in Board Resolution 222 (XXI)). The draft resolution called on creditor countries to extend to the most heavily indebted developing countries, the G7's Toronto Summit proposals for providing debt relief to the poorest countries. This approach was supported by reference to the major debt relief proposal contained in UNCTAD's Trade and Development Report 1988, which envisaged the writing off of 30% of the debt owed to commercial banks by the most heavily indebted developing countries. Group B countries with substantial exposure to debt problems, such as the UK, USA, France and Canada, assumed the leading role in negotiating the final text of the resolution which re-emphasised the Toronto Summit proposals, Paris Club practices and procedures and the outcome of the recent Berlin meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. The Australian representative participated in discussions within Group B and in the plenary debate. Australia's views on the Third World debt problem were reflected in the Australian national statement to the plenary which included the following points:</PARA>
<PARA> Part liberation from the debt problems, as envisaged in the debt write off proposal, is only a palliative and will not assist in the elimination of the fundamental causes of chronic indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia considers that a combination of growth oriented adjustment in the debtor countries supported by adequate flows of external financing and better policies in industrial countries leading to sustained world economic growth remains critical to the success of any debt strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia supports the present case-by-case growth-oriented debt strategy, including the development of voluntary market-based menu techniques. We also support the IMF's general approach to adjustment and conditionality which should be handled flexibly.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a contradiction between the agricultural policies of some of the major industrialised countries, which deny market access to the agricultural exports of important debtor countries, and the Baker formula for overcoming debt problems through structural adjustment and growth. Accordingly a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round would contribute substantially to successfully dealing with debt problems.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The length of the Hume Highway from the outskirts of Melbourne (Broadmeadows) to the outskirts of Sydney (Casula) is about 815 kilometres depending on the exact points chosen. The opening of new deviations and by-passes from time to time alters overall length.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Air freight capacity to and from Australia is provided mainly in the bellyhold of passenger aircraft operating scheduled airline services. There are also a number of ``Combi'' aircraft (whose main deck has provisions for both passengers and cargo), and a few dedicated freighter aircraft, operating scheduled services and offering higher freight capacity than do normal passenger aircraft.

<PARA> (2) Yes. In October 1987 the Government announced significant changes to its international air freight charter policy, which removed the previous regulatory requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The policy change in October 1987 removed previous restrictions on air freight charters to permit the carriage of any type of cargo in any mix to and from any gateway or combination of gateways.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No, the responsibility for ensuring that imported foods comply with domestic food standards rests with the state and territory health authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes, I understand that this is because the significance of Listeria monocytogenes as a food-borne pathogen was not established until the early 1980s. The Food Microbiology Sub-Committee of NH&amp;RC (FMC), the expert group on microbiological standards, has the question of legislative controls for the organism under active consideration and I trust that it will make appropriate recommendations to the Food Standards Committee of NH&amp;RC if it considers that specific controls are considered to be necessary for protecting public health.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes, I understand that the amendments to the Food Standards Code H9 for cheese published in Gazette No. P.19 were designed to accommodate changes to the Code which had been in the pipeline for a long time. As mentioned in my answer to question (4) above, the issue of standards for Listeria in cheese has still to be resolved by FMC.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) My Department has discussed this issue with the Department of Community Services and Health and the Bureau of Consumer Affairs, which between them carry Commonwealth responsibility for domestic food standards matters. The view reached was that this is unnecessary, given that the general provisions in food legislation require that processed foods shall be free of deleterious substances or organisms of public health concern. My Department considers that the correct approach to control is by ensuring proper pasteurisation and good hygienic practice, with related standards (e.g. the Australian Code of Practice for Dairy Factories) to ensure this. General testing for coliforms, as an indicator of good hygiene serves to provide a reasonable assurance that pathogens including Listeria are not present, without the need to specifically test for them. Specifying requirements for individual pathogens would commit control authorities to test for these on a routine basis, a process that is extremely costly and unproductive. The alternative process described above combined with targeting specific areas of risk, as in the case of Listeria, is preferred as a more constructive and cost effective approach. It is relevant to note that my Department initiated a joint state/commonwealth program for tightening up on pasteurisation controls in 1985, soon after the incidents of cheese related food poisoning incidents were reported in the United States and that similar controls were not introduced in the US until 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Yes. My Department considers Listeria monocytogenes to be a dangerous bacteria and has put into place procedures to test for it in imported cheeses and, in collaboration with the state dairy authorities, in Australian soft cheeses.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) (a) Testing of imported and domestic cheese commenced in November 1987 immediately following reports from Switzerland concerning an increase in morbidity due to Listeriosis.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The imported cheese program involved a national survey of 127 cheeses sampled over a 2 month period (about 50 percent of imports), 12 of which were found to contain Listeria monocytogenes. Following these findings, a routine program for sampling and testing all batches of imported cheese was introduced early this year. Despite the large number of tests conducted, only two batches of product contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes have been found since routine testing commenced. Both these batches were destroyed under quarantine supervision. Action in respect of Australian product involved a survey of factories manufacturing soft cheeses. Listeria was detected in product from three Victorian and three NSW factories. Product recalls were effected in each case and the factories cleaned and sanitised before they were permitted to resume production.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Tests are being carried out in a number of laboratories including the Australian Government Analytical Laboratory (AGAL) in Adelaide, Dairy Technical Services (a private laboratory) in Melbourne, the State Health Laboratories in Western Australia and Queensland, the New South Wales Dairy Corporation Laboratory, and the Public Health Laboratory in Hobart.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The allegations are not correct.</PARA>
<PARA>In the case of the Northern Division Rice Project, the majority of mangrove clearing occurred well before any technical assistance was provided by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).</PARA>
<PARA> Only four of the eight project locations for irrigated rice in Vanua Levu included significant areas of mangroves.</PARA>
<PARA> The first stage of Australian involvement in the project commenced in February 1987. This was mainly focused on design and construction of canals and ponds. Mangrove clearance on this area was restricted to 24 ha, for agronomic and engineering reasons and on consultant advice which AIDAB accepted.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of forests, Australia has assisted in funding the Hardwood Plantation Preservation program in Vanua Levu. Arsenic has been used on selected overstorey trees to allow more light to reach high value seedlings. This practice has been widely used in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> There is currently no alternative herbicide to arsenic pentoxide which is proven chemically effective and is cost-effective for large scale forestry operations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am not aware of any evidence that environmental damage of the type alleged (killing fish/poisoning drinking water) has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) In view of the above considerations it has been decided that there is no need for a full investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> A briefing on the environmental issues relating to the Northern Division Rice Project is being arranged for an Australian Engineer and a Surveyor (soon to be appointed under the Australian Staffing Assistance Scheme) whose duties will include the oversighting of the project.</PARA>
<PARA> AIDAB officers based in Suva have been asked to inspect the sites first hand as part of their regular project monitoring and inspection activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) AIDAB has clearly set out its environmental policy guidelines in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts investigation into Environmental Implications of Australia's Aid Program. More specifically AIDAB has developed policy guidelines to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The effective integration of environmental protection and resource management considerations.</PARA>

<PARA> (7) Reviews of discussions held during the day with ABC staff based at mid and far North Coast locations. Discussions were also held about a meeting due the following day with ABC personnel at Grafton who were affected by the decision to move the ABC radio facility to Lismore. The visit to ABC facilities at Kempsey, Lismore, Grafton and Tamworth was part of a routine tour by senior executives of ABC operations throughout Australia. Visits often involve public meetings and discussions with local organisations, parliamentarians and others with a direct interest in ABC activities in their region. The meetings are attended by varied numbers of people ranging from 150 to 400 people and have been widely applauded, especially in remote areas where the ABC is the sole television and an important radio broadcaster. They also provide an opportunity for executives to receive at first-hand, advice about specific needs of regional communities and to explore industrial and other issues with ABC personnel based in non-metropolitan areas. The visit to the north coasts of NSW in July was designed, in part, to meet concerns arising from the construction of a new facility at Lismore. This had generated criticism at Grafton, which was to lose an ABC station which had been based there for many years. It also entailed the transfer of staff to Lismore. Many of these personnel had had long periods of service at Grafton.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) Yes. However, my Department's review relied upon data collected in a survey conducted by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) in May 1987.

<PARA> (4) The issue of the payment of an overseas student charge for overseas postgraduate research students has been reviewed in the context of an overall review of overseas student policy. Based on the recommendations of the review, the Government has decided to phase out, over time, the subsidised overseas student program. From January 1990, all new overseas students will enter Australia on a full fee paying basis. Under these arrangements the OSC will be eliminated for new overseas students, however, those overseas students who entered Australia under the subsidised program will continue to be liable for the payment of the OSC until the completion of their present course of studies.</PARA>
<PARA> An integral part of the policy change is the Government's establishment of new targeted scholarships for overseas students from both developed and developing countries. The Overseas Postgraduate Research Scholarship Scheme aims to provide scholarships to quality students from developed countries who will be researching in priority areas of national interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, the Commonwealth does subsidise the establishment of occasional care facilities through the provision of capital and recurrent funding. The latter includes operational subsidies to centres and fee subsidies for low income families. Under its current locational strategy, the Commonwealth gives priority to establishing occasional care services in Central Business Districts, large regional shopping centres and in other areas which serve a broad catchment area. This ensures that as many people as possible have access to occasional care services and that services can be fully utilised in the longer term when local populations age.</PARA>
<PARA> Neither the operators of commercial child care facilities, nor the proprietors of shopping centres operating child care facilities, are eligible for Commonwealth funding under the Children's Services Program (CSP). Under the current CSP guidelines the Commonwealth provides funds only to child care services which are operated by non-profit community based organisations or local government sponsors.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Government has on numerous occasions made known publicly and privately its view that the key to the resolution of the political and economic problems faced by Fiji, and to a fully normalised relationship with Australia, is the promulgation of a constitution broadly acceptable to all the peoples of Fiji.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, public expressions of this view were made during the press conferences given by the Minister during his visit to Fiji (11-12 October) and in an address given by the Minister to the Foreign Correspondents' Association, `Australia in the South Pacific', in Sydney on 23 September 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister took the opportunity of his visit to Fiji and his discussions with President Ganilau of Fiji in Sydney on November 6 to raise privately with senior members of the Fiji Government specific details of the draft constitution. The Minister expressed the Australian Government's concerns at the possible nullifying effects of the savings provisions to the chapter covering fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual and the numerical imbalance in the proposed new parliamentary representation. Additionally, the Minister impressed upon his interlocutors the desirability of ensuring the broadest consultation possible on the draft constitution and the need for the final constitution to be broadly acceptable to all the peoples of Fiji.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Fiji Government has noted the concerns expressed by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Exact statistics are available only for the first six months of 1988. During this period, the Government made representations on 201 new human rights cases, to 59 different countries. This figure does not include cases previously raised, on which there were further representations. While figures are not available for the second half of the year, representations continued during that time at approximately the same rate.</PARA>
<PARA> It has not been the policy of this government to publicise comprehensive details of all human rights representations. Our objective in raising human rights cases is to achieve positive results for the individuals concerned, and it has been our experience that this is often assisted when our approaches are kept confidential. I therefore do not propose publishing the details requested by the honourable member, but I would be happy to have officers of my department provide a personal briefing at his convenience.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. At 2.00 p.m. the officer in charge of the Australian Protective Service's New South Wales Diplomatic and Consular Protection Group, Senior Sergeant Goddard, identified himself to Consulate staff via the intercom unit at the entrance to the Consulate grounds and requested permission for his contingent to enter the grounds of the Consulate. Although it is believed to have been heard within the Consulate, this request evoked no response. At 2.20 p.m., before any trespasses had occurred, Senior Sergeant Goddard made a second request for access, again via the intercom and with the same result. Shortly after this a number of young demonstrators illegally entered the consulate grounds. At this point Senior Sergeant Goddard contacted Officer Woodley, the duty officer at the Australian Protective Service Regional control room, and arranged for him to contact the Consulate by telephone. Officer Woodley made telephone contact with the Consul-General, Mr Glisic, at 2.28 p.m. and put to him a third request for permission for protective service officers to enter the Consulate grounds. Mr Glisic replied that he would `assist if possible' but no action was subsequently taken by any of the Consulate staff to allow protective service officers to enter the grounds. The shooting incident occurred shortly after the conversation between Mr Glisic and Officer Woodley, at about 2.30 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Possession of fire arms by staff of embassies and high commissions is currently permissible under normal licensing arrangements applicable in the Australian Capital Territory. Responsibility for control of the possession and carriage of fire arms in the Australian Capital Territory lies with the Registrar of Gun Licences.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Control of the possession and carriage of fire arms in New South Wales is a State responsibility. Staff of consular missions in Sydney are not required to seek the permission of Commonwealth authorities to apply for licences to carry fire arms, but they are expected to meet applicable New South Wales laws and regulations. I am advised that the New South Wales Police have no record of any weapons having been registered with them by the Yugoslav Consulate-General.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="169" SPEAKER="West The Hon S.J." NAMEID="XJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CURTIN">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr West</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Cooling tower water in air conditioning systems is tested for the presence of legionella bacteria when there are special concerns such as a suspected case, or suspected outbreak, of Legionnaires' disease in the area. Routine testing for legionella presence is not carried out. The reason for this is that legionella is widespread in water systems and little meaning can be attached to its presence in cooling towers. As detection techniques have improved in sensitivity it has become evident that legionella exists in rivers, mains water supplies, tree leaves, damp soil, and rain water, etc. It is not hazardous in these environments because the concentrations of bacteria are low.</PARA>
<PARA> All health authorities are agreed that there is little point in testing. It is far more productive to direct attention to cooling tower hygiene to ensure conditions do not develop which would promote the growth of legionella. This is the practice of Department of Administrative Services-Australian Construction Services which has maintenance responsibility for some 2000 cooling towers around Commonwealth assets. Simple tests for total bacterial levels are employed as indicators only that cooling towers are being maintained in a hygienic condition. The evidence from recorded outbreaks of the disease around the world is that they are invariably associated with neglected equipment (BBC's Broadcasting House in London in April 1988 and Stafford Hospital in England in April 1985).</PARA>
<PARA> There are many concerns about the inadequacies of legionella testing. Microbiological techniques are still evolving. Some laboratory techniques will detect legionella where others may not. It should also be appreciated that ``legionella'' is not a single microbe readily detectable. In fact it is a whole family of microbes. There are 23 species and 39 serogroups. Legionella pneumophila is one species-the dominant cause of the disease-but it has 14 serogroups. Very few laboratories would keep the range of sera necessary to test all these serogroups and so the presence of an uncommon one may be missed. Within each serogroup there is also a vast range of strains of legionella. Only a few strains of pneumophila have, to date, been associated with disease but only sophisticated monoclonal antibody reactions can detect these virulent strains.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only is there a difficulty in regard to the depth of the legionella family but there is also a difficulty in regard to the breadth, ie the number of species. These include not only pneumophila but other species such as bozemanii and micdadei, etc, which have caused disease. The recent outbreak in Adelaide (November 1988) was caused, it seems, by legionella longbeachae serogroup 1. This is a very rare legionella type and has already caused at least one death in Adelaide. However it would escape detection by commercial microbiological laboratories if normal techniques are used; only State health laboratories such as the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Research in Adelaide would be able to detect its presence. (Identification has been made from patient blood samples.)</PARA>
<PARA> There are several laboratories which, quite legitimately, promote legionella testing services. However, public misconceptions may arise when they publicise that legionella is or is not present in water systems. As mentioned, research has shown that legionella will be present (albeit, in low concentrations) in practically any aquatic environment other than deep sea water. Mere presence is of little significance; it is multiplication to larger concentrations which should be prevented. The measures in place for Commonwealth buildings reflect the best available scientific and technical knowledge on the subject and should be adequate to ensure the absence of outbreaks associated with these buildings.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Legionella bacterium was identified in cooling towers at Daw Park Repatriation General Hospital in January 1986. Testing and detection were carried out by the SA Health authorities who were of the opinion that these towers may have been the cause of the outbreak although this could not be proven. These cooling towers were newly installed and were still being commissioned by the contractor as part of a major construction project being completed at that time. It should also be noted that the SA authorities also found legionella bacteria of the same species and serogroup in cooling towers at a nearby shopping centre and at a manufacturing plant in the area. Of course, the Commonwealth cooling towers were immediately decontaminated by hyperchlorination and this practice is followed whenever there is some concern, such as an outbreak in an area or when the total bacterial levels in a particular cooling tower are regarded as excessive.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the 1986 Adelaide outbreak sound design and maintenance practices were put in place by Department of Administrative Services-Australian Construction Services for all Commonwealth owned cooling towers. These practices which resulted from worldwide discussions, have been acknowledged as state-of-the-art, not only in Australia but in the UK and USA.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the 1986 outbreak, all cooling towers at Daw Park RGH are routinely monitored for legionella. This is part of the hospital's infection control program as the people most susceptible to this disease are hospital patients suffering debilitating lung conditions. This testing is carried out by the resident microbiologist who is able to test other water systems in the hospital (the hydrotherapy pool, hot water systems, garden sprinkler systems, etc.) and is in a position to place a professional interpretation on the results. Similar practices are employed by other Repatriation hospitals and other large public hospitals. It is emphasised that the testing is carried out by the respective hospital authorities and is not a responsibility of Department of Administrative Services-Australian Construction Services. For such institutions the additional cost burden for this testing is not great.</PARA>
<PARA> Control measures for legionella (and other microbes) in cooling towers is a subject for which Department of Administrative Services-Australian Construction Services claims particular expertise. Department of Administrative Services-Australian Construction Services has produced many technical publications and conference papers on the subject and has assisted and co-operated with State Health authorities in the transfer of this knowledge as a community benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Item 78b of the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act exempts earthmoving equipment and parts for use exclusively, or primarily and principally, in carrying out contracts for a government department or authority or for a local council which is exempt from sales tax under items 74, 77 or 78 (see below). The Government is aware that, as with many provisions which exempt goods for use in particular circumstances, administrative burdens can arise where taxpayers must be able to verify that use. Similarly, anomalies may arise where some taxpayers but not others qualify for exemption.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No: the problem referred to does not arise from the item 78b exemption. The purpose of item 78b is to align the sales tax treatment of earthmoving equipment for use by private operators on government contracts with that applying had the equipment been purchased by the government body itself (Item 74 exempts goods acquired by government departments and certain government authorities for their own use; item 78 similarly applies to local councils etc; and item 77 exempts certain goods for use by public transport authorities). The Government is aware that private contractors who are unable to gain exemption for earthmoving equipment under item 78b may be at a disadvantage in competing with government bodies (and with private contractors who do qualify for the exemption) for non-government contracts.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The problems associated with these items have been drawn to the Government's attention by representatives of the earthmoving industry and are now under review.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government has no plans to repeal item 78B. As noted above, its repeal would not, in itself, remove the exemptions which apply to government bodies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs under way in Nicaragua and Peru, as outlined in a recent article in New Scientist.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) IPM programs reduce the use of broad banded pesticides, which in turn reduces the chemical load on the environment. This is achieved through using a combination of alternatives such as biological control, host resistance, cultural control, autocidal insect control (i.e. release of sterile or genetically altered insects) and the use of chemicals such as pheromones or insect growth regulators, that modify the behaviour of insect pests.</PARA>
<PARA> Broad banded pesticides are used less often and in some cases eliminated in favour of more selective pesticides, which are more effective through minimising the effects on beneficial insects and maximising the effects on target/pest species. Therefore, the total chemical load on the environment is decreased.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) CSIRO Division of Entomology is participating in research for an IPM program in China, where nematodes are being used to control a moth pest of apples. This is a joint project in collaboration with China and funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.</PARA>
<PARA> Several other research projects are being conducted by organisations funded by ACIAR (Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research) and AIDAB (Australian International Development Assistance Bureau).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) CSIRO and State Departments of Agriculture/Primary Industries are involved in several IPM programs. For example CSIRO are involved in developing control methods for the cotton bollworm (Heliothis spp) in Narrabri, NSW. Ongoing research on Heliothis and studies of the total cropping system combined with genetic engineering of a virus specific to the pest are being done so that a successful program can be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> Other programs include the control of the two spotted mite and European red mite, both orchard pests, soil insect pests on potatoes in Western Australia, pests of hops in Victoria and Tasmania and control of beetle grubs in sugarcane. All of which reduce the use of broad banded insecticides.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Department of Primary Industries and Energy through the Bureau of Rural Resources has fostered interest in IPM programs. It has recently coordinated a paper `IPM for Major Vegetable Crops in Australia' which was presented to an FAO meeting in Thailand. John Osmelak of the Victorian Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs prepared this paper. CSIRO and the State Departments of Agriculture are continuing to maintain a strong interest in IPM programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Commonwealth has encouraged the development of IPM programs. Since the State Departments of Agriculture/Primary Industries have extension programs in crop protection methods, it is their role to promote IPM to the farming community. In recent years there has been an increased awareness of IPM, however the consumer desires a perfect piece of fruit and this is not always possible with IPM.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr Hawke</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer, on behalf of all Ministers, to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1)-(10) The honourable member has asked a series of very detailed questions about departmental reorganisations that have taken place since July 1987. To answer those questions at the level of detail sought would require a major diversion of resources in all departments, not only in their corporate services areas, but also in line divisions. Attention is drawn to the descriptive material provided in departmental annual reports on the reorganisations that have taken place within departments during 1987-88.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I am not prepared to authorise a major diversion of resources, I do wish to make some comments on the honourable member's question.</PARA>
<PARA> As I made clear in my statement on Reform of the Australian Public Service in the Parliament on 25 September 1986 and reiterated in the Sir Robert Garran Oration on 27 October 1988, reform, streamlining and restructuring of the public sector have been a major and essential part of the Government's principal activity of restructuring the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> In the private sector, reorganisation is a constant fact of life as corporations adapt to changing requirements; similarly it is necessary for the public sector, and in particular the departments of the public service to adapt quickly to changing requirements of the elected government.</PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting private sector practices, the Government has done much to devolve responsibility from central co-ordinating agencies to departments and within departments. Increasingly, it is the responsibility of departmental Secretaries and their program managers to manage their activities within the resources available to them. An essential part of that process is ensuring that the human resources available to them are organised in structures which enable work programs to be carried out as efficiently and effectively as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst reorganisation should thus be seen as an ongoing part of the activities of all departments, the Government acknowledges that the extent of reorganisation that has taken place recently is greater than usual and results in large part from the reduction in the number of departments in July 1987. The Government recognised at the time that there would be substantial costs associated with the changes and substantial dislocation and disturbance both for agencies and many individuals. The changes made in July 1987 should, however, be seen as setting the basic pattern of Australian Government administration for many years ahead. In particular the two level ministry arrangements will minimise the need for the disruptive machinery of government changes that have been such a significant part of the history of public administration at the Commonwealth level over recent decades.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as staff morale and job enhancement are concerned, as I indicated in the Garran Oration, one of the main principles underpinning our reforms has been the need to provide maximum scope for our greatest resource, our people in the workforce, through greater individual initiative, innovation and job satisfaction. The Government recognises that more has to be done on these qualitative issues, in particular to ensure that there is sufficient recognition amongst departmental managers of the importance of providing resources for staff development and training and of fostering opportunities for individual initiative.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is not possible to provide the detailed statistical information sought by the honourable member particularly in relation to Administrative Service Officers Class 8, attention is drawn to the answers provided to Questions 304-321 and 518-535 asked by Senator Archer, answers to which appeared in Senate Hansards between August and December 1988. Attention is also drawn to the answer to Question 1039 asked by Mr Porter which is expected to appear in the House of Representatives Hansard of 28 February 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> Attention is also drawn to the information provided in the Public Service Commissioner's Annual Report for 1987-88 relating to the redeployment and retirement of Senior Executive Service (SES) officers, which indicates that in 1987-88 77 SES officers were offered and accepted retirement with appropriate severance benefits under section 76r of the Public Service Act 1922. The Public Service Commission has advised that between 1 July and 31 December 1988 a further 22 Senior Executive Service officers retired under these arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 provides that before accepting for further scrutiny the ballot paper(s) contained in an envelope bearing a postal vote certificate, the Divisional Returning Officer must be satisfied inter alia that the vote was recorded prior to the close of the poll (s. 200 (1) (d)). Where the envelope containing a postal ballot paper bears a postmark that includes a date after polling day the vote is taken not to have been recorded prior to the close of the poll and thus is not accepted for further scrutiny (s. 200 (7)). Where the postmark is absent or indecipherable the DRO assesses whether the vote enclosed in the envelope was recorded prior to the poll by reading the date on which the witness signed the declaration envelope.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of Transport and Communications advises that official post offices are not open on Saturdays, but about half of the 3,100 agencies do open. These agencies are equipped to provide postmarks.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Department of Transport and Communications advises that many country post offices have no Saturday postmarking facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Department of Transport and Communications advises that some country post offices (approximately 20) have morning closing times on Fridays. This is because of the need to connect with transport schedules. At such post offices letters posted on a Friday after the morning closing times will be postmarked the following Monday.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Customs Service intends to introduce EXIT, an electronic dial-up system for exporters to provide consignment details to Customs. EXIT is intended to be an effective replacement to the current manual reporting systems which have developed many problems. EXIT will provide for more efficient and effective control over statutory requirements to report all goods for export, including prohibited exports.</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the problems with the current system are:</PARA>
<PARA> Inability on the part of the Australian Customs Service to adequately identify and check possible prohibited exports or those subject to certain export controls before the cargo leaves Australia,</PARA>
<PARA> The late lodgement of export entries or export returns,</PARA>
<PARA> A high level of error in these export documents,</PARA>
<PARA> Failure by some exporters to use either manual system to report significant consignments.</PARA>
<PARA> These omissions have led to significant distortions in trade statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Rock Lobsters and Prawning Association of Australia made representation on this matter on 19 September 1988. I replied indicating the reasons for change to the existing procedures, which may require some procedural changes for industry. I also indicated that ACS officers are available to discuss any perceived problems.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Exporters have been advised of the deficiencies in the current system and the intended procedures for EXIT. This information is contained in several bulletins which have been posted to registered exporters. The bulletins have also been available at Customs Houses in all States/Territories. In addition seminars have been held in all capital cities to stress the weaknesses of the current system and the advantages of the new.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) All new systems require initial changes to procedures. Those changes should be minimal and will have short and long term advantages for exporters.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am aware of current procedures particularly the aforementioned difficulties which have to be addressed. I know many exporters will be pleased to forego the paperwork associated with the running of manual systems in favour of one paperless electronic system.</PARA>
<PARA> EXIT will give exporters cost benefits by linking industry participants to each other through the community network proposed by the Inter-State Commission on Waterfront Investigation. This community network will lead to simplified and standardised documentation and improve the competitiveness of the market. Preparation of data can be done in one place to enable a single reporting of cargo to the various participants. Savings within the export industry will be able to be put to revenue producing rather than revenue costing roles e.g. seeking new markets etc.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There will be some running costs to operate EXIT, mainly associated with payment for the OTC communications network. ACS will not levy charges during the introductory period for EXIT or for other entry lodgement methods (i.e. facsimile, telex). EXIT costs should be offset by savings to exporters by eliminating the need to maintain paper based records.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I fully support the introduction of EXIT. Many benefits will accrue to users and it will assist in building a more efficient and competitive export industry. I see it as the right direction for the export industry to go to keep pace with the current world trend to use Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in trade.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Customs Act already provides penalties for those exporters (and importers) who fail to properly report consignments to Customs. The introduction of EXIT will not alter those provisions. Exporters will need to report consignments before export. Allowances will be made for those exporters in particular trades who may need to confirm or amend details after shipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) EXIT is an electronic system and will be available 5 a.m.-midnight 7 days a week. It will give the exporter a cargo clearance within 10 minutes. This is a far better standard than that currently available under the manual entry system. Evaluations will be conducted after the system commences to determine if additional service is required.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1987-88 13 of the 106, or 12.3% of the samples of veterinary therapeutic products tested by the National Biological Standards Laboratory, NBSL, failed to meet acceptable standards.</PARA>
<PARA> The rates of failures by major category were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 3 of 19, or 15.8% of pharmaceuticals,</PARA>
<PARA> 8 of 41, or 19.5% of antibiotics,</PARA>
<PARA> 2 of 18, of 11.1% of bacterial products,</PARA>
<PARA> None of 28 viral products and other biologicals.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The only veterinary products tested by the Laboratory are veterinary therapeutic products. About 1700 types of these are registered in New South Wales, which probably has the largest number of registered products. Other States register some products which might not be registered in New South Wales. As noted above NBSL tested 106 samples in 1987-88. These were mainly biological products such as vaccines and antibiotics. Some State laboratories test chemical veterinary therapeutic products but none test biological veterinary therapeutic products.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are potential problems for human health if the potencies of veterinary antibiotics are not correct. If the doses given to food producing animals are higher than intended, residues could reach foodstuffs. If the doses given are lower than intended, antibiotic resistant microorganisms which might spread to humans would be more likely to develop.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) There are no reliable data within the portfolio on the proportion of veterinary therapeutic goods which are imported compared with those produced locally. There are no clear differences in the quality of imported products tested compared with locally produced products.</PARA>
