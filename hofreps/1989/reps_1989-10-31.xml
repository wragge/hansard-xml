<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister for Trade Negotiations. Will the Minister inform the House whether Australia supports the proposal of the United States last week to reform world agricultural trade? Will he indicate to the House the progress that was made on other trade issues during his recent visit to the United States?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2119" SPEAKER="Duffy The Hon M.J." NAMEID="6G4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOLT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE NEGOTIATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to say that the United States trade talks held in Washington from 18 to 20 October were conducted in a most positive atmosphere. Unlike previous similar talks, both sides had no major irritants to deal with. However, I did reiterate Australia's general concerns on issues such as US subsidies and particularly the export enhancement program, possible changes to that country's sugar policy, and the drafting of the 1990 United States Farm Bill. I raised these issues in talks with the United States Special Trade Representative, Carla Hills, and at meetings with other members of the Administration and Congress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From Australia's point of view, two major positive developments came out of the talks. The first was a briefing by the Administration on the proposal, which the USA has subsequently tabled in Geneva, for reforming world agricultural trade. At that stage it had not been tabled but we were briefed fully on it. What the USA has tabled is a realistic and detailed proposal which, if implemented, would restore fairness to agricultural trade.</PARA>
<PARA> In essence, what the United States is proposing is that all countries move to a system where, firstly, access to agricultural markets would only be restricted by tariffs which would reduce over time, getting rid of that multiplicity of non-tariff measures; secondly, export subsidies would be prohibited after five years; and, thirdly, a system for domestic support for farmers would be introduced whereby the most trade distorting policies would be prohibited, and supports not linked to production would be the only ones that would be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly such a set of rules would be in Australia's interests and of great benefit to Australian farmers. We support the approach which has been tabled by the United States and on which we were briefed in Washington the week before last. It is now for other countries, including Japan and the European Community, to consider this United States proposal, which is a radical proposal but a very sound one. If they want to see progress in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks as a whole, it is essential that those other countries direct their minds to this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> The other issue I want to touch on briefly is that I am pleased to report that under the agreement reached with the United States Australia will be permitted to increase very substantially its steel exports to the United States-a market in which steel imports have been tightly controlled under the voluntary restraint arrangements. Both of these developments are of particular significance to Australia. The steel decision creates trade opportunities immediately while the agricultural proposal has the potential to flow through to unprecedented agricultural exports if other countries can be encouraged to agree to the very sensible approach that the United States Administration is putting forward.</PARA>
<PARA> One final point that I make on behalf of the Government is to refer to the efforts of government officials both in Canberra and overseas in their excellent work both in the long drawn-out GATT negotiations-a process which is of course ongoing-and in ensuring that a very constructive environment existed for the Australia-United States commercial relations.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Government came to office in 1983 the challenge for wages policy was to restore the factor share so that we could get investment in this country moving again and repair the profit share, which we have now done and will continue to do over a period. As those changes have been moved into place, the Government has focused on the problems of getting more flexibility into the wage system, changing the structure of awards and of Australian unionism and the relationship of that unionism with enterprises and commerce.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite can hardly not get back there. We had those logs there for 31 years. Under that structure we did not have the kind of flexibility that we would all like. The Government is now moving, through award restructuring, to dramatically restructure awards. In the metals trade industry, what were 310 classifications are now down to about 10 or 11. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is now moving into enterprise agreements with one or two industry unions. That is the way the Government is changing the structure of Australian unionism and Australian awards to provide more wage flexibility and more flexibility in the workplace, as well as coming to macro-economic arrangements for wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members on the other side of the House reject all that. What they believe in is enterprise bargaining. We still have a craft industry trans-union structure but honourable members opposite believe in enterprise bargaining; that is, they think one enterprise can withstand the onslaught of a craft union or unions and that they will not have any unemployment. In fact, last week the shadow Treasurer was asked whether, under his policy, it was not necessary to increase unemployment to secure lower wages and more wage flexibility. He was also asked:</PARA>
<PARA>The facts of the 1980s are in countries like the United Kingdom and the United States in order to get inflation there have been employment offsets, that's my point.</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>No, I don't think it necessarily applies in Australia, and I think if you move decisively and quickly you can avoid any significant effect, over and above what is already in the pipeline, on unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, honourable members opposite think they can reduce wages and inflation without any unemployment. The honourable member for Wentworth went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Because we are moving across the board into my different sort of world-</PARA>
<PARA>his different sort of world-</PARA>
<PARA>and I'm asking you to accept the fact that there is a different world apart from the one you think and live in all day.</PARA>
<PARA>There we are. It reminds me of that song, What a wonderful world it would be. How do the words go? `Don't know much about history, don't know much trigonometry, don't know much about biology, but what a wonderful world it would be'. Obviously the honourable member for Wentworth has taken his economic lessons from the late Sam Cooke, who had it all together in 1960 in that song. There is a different world out there-not the real world of economics; not the real world that we know; not the world that business knows; not the world that the International Monetary Fund knows; not the world that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development knows; but `my different sort of world'. The honourable member for Wentworth will have lower wages to achieve lower unemployment, not higher unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here is the world champion conveyancer back again. The honourable member for Wentworth will have lower wages to achieve lower inflation and that will lower interest rates. The key line of the Opposition's so-called Economic Action Plan, in the third last paragraph on page 22, is that without higher unemployment it can have lower wages, which will give it lower inflation. Of course, if the inflationary floor under interest rates falls interest rates can fall too. That is the kind of tripe that the Opposition is peddling these days as its economic policy. When the honourable member for Wentworth gets asked a sensible question about effects in the United Kingdom and in the United States, where we saw massive unemployment to reduce the inflation rate, he says, `No, we do not need higher unemployment in this country'.</PARA></TALK.START>

He is doing press conferences, but not the Leader of the Opposition. There is no way that we will be able to ask him. Oh yes, he will do a doorstop in Sydney when he knows that the experts are not there to chase him down about how he would reduce inflation by reducing wages with an enterprise bargaining system, but he will not expose himself to the scrutiny of the Canberra press gallery. He will not face the press and answer the questions. Basically, he thinks it is clever to have the fire engines chasing after him, and to be asked about the technical aspects of economic policy. The fact of the matter is that the coalition has no policy; this sort of stuff is a joke; and the honourable member opposite ought to be ashamed to put that sort of stuff down in his own name.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been asked by the Leader of the Opposition essentially the same question for the third time-admittedly now by someone with more dignity and stature within the Parliament. I reply with essentially the same answer-that is, the record is there in terms of the Government's credibility in economic policy and in terms of what it is able to do by way of tax trade-off type packages. It is clear that we have the capability to produce economic policy on the basis of reducing the deficit, then increasing the surplus and achieving, over time, very significant savings. We do not have to deal with a situation where we throw together on a piece of paper some figures that will fall apart under scrutiny and therefore cannot be exposed to a press conference.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy advise the House of the effectiveness of the Government's quarantine policies in protecting Australian agriculture?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2122" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Rankin for his question. There is a bit of a campaign on at present. Some quarantine issues are being beaten up by the Opposition. The focus for this at present is the fact that we took the decision that we could no longer ban imports of Canadian pig meat because of disease. Australia is about the only country now that has been banning pig meat from Canada on quarantine grounds. After five years of consultation and trials, we decided to allow it in. It has been allowed freely into New Zealand for quite some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To get back to the more general thrust of the question, in 1987 I established the Lindsay Committee to review quarantine policies to ensure that we have the best assessment of quarantine risks and the best systems to counter these risks. This review followed decades of nonsensical attempts to impose a no risk assessment, regardless of the fact that there is no such thing as no risk. To achieve this, one would simply have to ban people, airplanes, ships and everything else from coming into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The practical effect was that quarantine was being used, in some instances, as a trade barrier and that is something that the Australian agricultural sector strongly opposes. We know that in the real world other countries, such as the European Economic Community, do impose quarantine barriers as a trade measure. The Government's policy is that quarantine is neither a trade barrier nor a trade lever. Quarantine decisions are taken on quarantine grounds alone. Some of the people whipping this issue up seem to want to use quarantine as a trade barrier most of the time or use it as trade leverage when it suits.</PARA>
<PARA> The Lindsay Committee supported the quarantine grounds only policy and recommended a formal transparent procedure based on assessed risk with significant industry input for taking quarantine decisions and allocating quarantine resources. The Government accepted those recommendations. The procedure is that there is an assessment not only of the biology of the threat but also of the strategies for countering the risks and the costs and benefits involved. The industry is fully consulted. That is pretty sensible; it is strategic management.</PARA>
<PARA> We take into account the pest, where it comes from, how it spreads and the biological consequences. We also take into account the strategies for exclusion and the risks of entry under those strategies. We also put into place in our assessment the costs and benefits of continued exclusion. In that way we can come to profiles on the various pests that we want to keep out of this country. For example, the profile of foot and mouth disease is such that there is simply no way that this disease can be allowed to come into this country. At the other end of the spectrum there are lesser diseases and pests. Beyond that, we are also implementing more comprehensive disease preparedness arrangements so that outbreaks can be dealt with. Again, a strategic approach is being adopted. The response must be tailored to the risks.</PARA>
<PARA> This approach does not mean the abandonment of a strong quarantine policy. We are not opening the floodgates to disease. On the contrary, we are shutting them as firmly as is possible under any system run by human beings. This logic does not worry the Opposition, which has been running round scaring people and implying support for the nonsensical notion that there is such a thing as zero risk. The Opposition's hypocrisy on this issue is exposed in its so-called economic policy, the electoral bribe which promises a cut of $23m, or 14 per cent, to the budget of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. What would that do to Australia's quarantine preparedness? It would mean bigger risks. It would mean being forced to respond after the event at greater cost. It would mean a `fingers crossed' approach to quarantine and disease preparedness. So not only has the Opposition repudiated its earlier promises to increase quarantine resources but also it is now planning to place Australia's entire agricultural sector at risk.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have become accustomed in this place to the Opposition consistently misrepresenting the Government's position. I repeat what I said yesterday-what is the factual situation-and that is, the industrial dispute in the airline industry is over. Just in case there be any doubt about this, let me say that I am supported in my analysis of the situation by none other than the newly restored front bench member, the honourable member for Bennelong, who has made it quite clear that he repudiates the analysis of the airline industry situation by the Leader of the Opposition and other members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it is not surprising that we should see the absolute diametrically opposed position between the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong on this because in today's press we saw the quite candid statement of the position between them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ex-Leader of the Opposition-the next leader-is saying that no industrial nexus exists between the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP) and the airlines. He is absolutely right. His uncomfortable heehaw over there does not change the fact. That is what he is saying. It is the truth. There is no industrial nexus between the AFAP and the airlines. Why? Because the AFAP made a deliberate decision and instructed its members to resign from employment with the airlines. No member of the AFAP is now employed by the airlines. There can be no industrial dispute between the AFAP and the airlines when the AFAP has no members employed in the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Increasingly, ex-members of the AFAP are joining the airlines. Not only are they not joining as members of the AFAP but one of the conditions they are imposing on the airlines as they rejoin is to say to the airlines `Don't have anything to do with the AFAP'. No industrial dispute is continuing between the AFAP and the airlines. As I said yesterday, that position is clearly indicated by the Industrial Relations Commission, which has said that there is no industrial dispute between the AFAP and the airlines. The Commission has said to the AFAP, `If you want to come back into this industrial situation, there are three things that you have to do. First, you have to drop the embargo on your members joining the airlines and signing the contracts. Secondly and thirdly, you have to abide by the decisions of the Commission'. I made it abundantly clear yesterday, although these boofheads on the other side do not want to understand or accept it, that of course, while there is now no industrial dispute between the AFAP and the airlines, that does not mean that there are not continuing problems in the airline industry.</PARA>

The fact is that the difficulties in the Australian aviation industry are being overcome-without and despite the activities of the AFAP and despite the continuous support, aid, succour and comfort that this Opposition has given to it. As I have said, if one analyses the difficulties in the Australian aviation industry at the moment, one sees that on the last day of October the position is the same as it was on day one of this dispute-that is, there are three groups of people who want to smash the industrial system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I conclude that part of the answer by again stating the obvious: the industrial dispute has been finished. That is a situation that is recognised by the Industrial Relations Commission. If the Opposition-the soul mates of Gallagher and the AFAP-want to deny the fact that has been recognised by the Industrial Relations Commission, that is well and good by me and it is well and good by everyone else. The Industrial Relations Commission tells them that they do not know what they are talking about, and that is good enough for me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the question of the payment to the airlines is concerned, obviously that position is coming towards an end. The further the airlines build up their capacity, as they are doing, the closer they come to restoring normal operations. When they are able to employ normally all their employees, then at that point the payments to the airlines will cease. I remind the honourable gentleman who asked the question of what has been the case from the beginning: despite the misrepresentations that have been put that this has been some form of compensation to the airlines for losses, it has not been; it has been payment to the airlines to enable them to keep their employees in employment so that they will be able to ensure that gradually capacity and service are restored to the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House and the people of Australia that when those services are fully restored in terms of the achievement of an enormous increase in productivity, it will have been one of the most significant pieces of micro-economic reform in the Australian transport system. It is something which is distinct from what those opposite would ever have been able to do. They would have caved in immediately to the pilots, which is what they have advocated from the beginning, and given them their 30 per cent. The reform they would have had would have been this: they would have destroyed a centralised wage system which has created 1 1/2 million new jobs and they would have done by that policy what they succeeded in doing when they were last in office, that is, giving Australia the worst unemployment it had had in 50 years. That is what they are committed to. Fortunately, they will never be given the chance of doing it again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will attempt to put the honourable gentleman's question and the issues it raises into an appropriate perspective. One would assume from the honourable gentleman's question that, as a result of the policies and attitudes that have been adopted by this Government, development had come to a halt in this country. Indeed, in the document that was released under the misnomer Economic Action Plan by the Leader of the Opposition earlier this month, there was this quite remarkable statement at page 9:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We do not have excessive investment and much of the investment we have seen has been in areas with little prospect of producing a significantly higher export income.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is said here now that it is true; we will see how true it is in a moment. I will repeat what the Leader of the Opposition had to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Much of the investment we have seen has been in areas with little prospect of producing significantly higher export income.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume that honourable members opposite will not question the source to which I shall go now, because I go to Access Economics. I assume that the Opposition will not question Access Economics, which I will now quote. If the Opposition wants to rubbish Access Economics, that suits me fine, because every syllable that comes out of the mouths of honourable members opposite rubbishing Access Economics rubbishes their own document.</PARA>
<PARA> What does Access Economics have to say about the Opposition Leader's claim that `much of the investment we have seen has been in areas with little prospect of producing significantly higher export income'? Under the heading `Investment Monitor' in its October publication Access Economics says:</PARA>
<PARA>A unique listing by sector and State of 500 investment projects worth over $5m each, under construction, committed or under consideration, in mining, manufacturing, tourism and public sector investment related to foreign exchange earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>It also states:</PARA>
<PARA> Projects listed have a total value of over $90 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> As a proportion of total investment, tourism represents 34 per cent, manufacturing 30.5 per cent, the public sector 21 per cent and mining 14.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Of total investment, 54 per cent is under construction or committed and 46 per cent is under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>It also states:</PARA>
<PARA>We have included projects in mining, manufacturing and tourism as major sectors with the potential to earn foreign exchange . . . Projects are spread across a much wider range of industries than was the case with the resources boom.</PARA>
<PARA>Access Economics then lists at $5 billion the projected annual foreign exchange earnings from some major investment projects under construction and in total just under $10 billion projected annual foreign exchange earnings. I repeat: this is Access Economics talking about actual earnings coming from projects under construction amounting to $5 billion per annum. However, what does the Leader of the Opposition say in his document? He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Much of the investment we have seen has been in areas with little prospect of producing significantly higher export income.</PARA>
<PARA>Access Economics says $5 billion will be flowing in investment income, export earnings, from this investment. The Leader of the Opposition cannot get it right. Of course, Mr Speaker, you will see the relevance of what I am saying in response to this ridiculous question-the assumption that, because of the policies adopted by this Government, no investment is undertaken in this country in regard to projects that will provide not only employment but also very extensive export earnings. The fact is that, as with so much of what was contained in the Opposition Leader's own document, which was vetted by Access Economics, this is just another lie in that document. The Opposition Leader said that there are no projects virtually that are producing export income. His own people have referred to projects under construction which involve $5 billion worth of export income.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Government-as I have said before in this place-has shown that this debate in this country does not have to involve only investment and development versus conservation of the environment. This Government has shown that we can have them all. We have conducted economic policies. We have created an investment surge which is at the highest level in the history of this country. The Opposition will not face up to the facts about the level of investment income. Let me give the facts; let us see what the figures were in the last Budget Papers. Business fixed capital expenditure increased by 15.5 per cent in 1988-89 after a similar increase in 1987-88 and represented 13.5 per cent of gross domestic product, the highest level on record. The facts are that under this Government we now have investment at a higher level than it has ever been in the history of this country. We can have investment, as we have, giving rise to an enormous increase in foreign earnings, and at the same time we can do what any government with any sense of responsibility should do: that is, to protect this environment for this generation and future generations of our children.</PARA>
<PARA> As we have said, at one and the same time we have had a rate of employment growth more than twice as fast as the rest of the world, and the World Heritage Bureau saying-I repeat it with pride; I have said it before in this House-that no government in the world has done more to advance world heritage values than the Australian Labor Government. As distinct from the implication in the question that has been addressed to me, that we cannot protect the environment with the sensible protection decisions that we have taken without prejudicing investment, the fact is, as is shown by all the statistics to which I have referred, and as is confirmed by the Opposition's own source, Access Economics, that we can have massive investment, as we have, investment at a higher level than ever before in the history of this country, but at the same time we can have an Australian Government of which everyone can be proud in regard to its environmental record. In making the decisions we have, we have properly earned the accolade of the government which has done more to protect the environment than any other government in the world. Far from making any apology for what we have done, we are proud of the fact that we have earned that accolade from the World Heritage Bureau. It is one that is thoroughly deserved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The authorities-as the questioner puts it-have been aware of the problem of the absence of capital taxation since the mid-1970s. One of the central reasons why the Government introduced a capital gains tax was to curtail the opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion. Honourable members will recall the massive fraud perpetrated on the Commonwealth via the bottom of the harbour tax avoidance schemes during the period of the previous Government. I remind honourable members of what special prosecutor Roger Gyles said in his 1984 report. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Tax avoidance and evasion of this kind in such volume is extraordinary in absolute terms but almost incredible in relative terms having regard to the small Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>What members should be aware of is that the whole basis of the bottom of the harbour tax schemes was the conversion of taxable company income into untaxable capital gains. What basically happened was that the act of selling the company to the promoter was the act that converted current year profits into a tax free capital gain. The bottom of the harbour aspect arose when those companies were then onsold to directors who had no assets. What was underpinning the whole scheme was the absence of capital gains taxation. In 1982 when the former Treasurer was flushed out by the McCabe-Lafranchi report the honourable member for Bennelong had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>These are cases in which shareholders of companies--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Howard said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>These are cases in which shareholders of companies were selling their shares in circumstances where there were associated arrangements under which the target companies were stripped of funds and left in a position where the companies could not pay the income tax that would in the normal course of events be assessed to them. The shareholders received the profits of the companies in a tax-free capital form, not diminished in any way by either company tax or tax on dividends but only by the fee charged by the promoter for his services.</PARA>
<PARA>That put in a nutshell the whole basis of the boom in tax avoidance. The Australian Taxation Office had been consistently advising the then Government from 1977 about the absence of tax avoidance. I remind the House of former Commissioner O'Reilly's historic letter of 1977 in which, when dealing with sales of companies with current profits, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> These sales also give rise to problems of avoidance by way of dividend stripping.</PARA>
<PARA> The absence of a capital gains tax increases the difficulty of devising provisions that would result in tax being payable on these profits without exposing true capital gains to tax.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1978, Commissioner O'Reilly said:</PARA>
<PARA> The basic avoidance technique is to arrange that a large share of income is diverted from a family business trust to an entity that, by one means or another, escaping paying tax on the income. The family receives the income, diminished by the promoter's fee, in a non-taxable capital form.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1980 he wrote to the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> For so long as we do not have a tax on capital gains, and do not tax gifts, I do not see that a solution lies in attempting to collect the tax from those people in whose favour companies and trusts are stripped.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that, right through the period 1975-80, with a myriad of letters beginning in 1977, the then Taxation Commissioner was enjoining the Government to introduce capital gains taxation because underlying all these schemes was the absence of capital gains taxation. But, instead of that, the former Government chose to stumble down the road and to try to prevent bottom of the harbour schemes by trying to determine the motives of vendors, not to deal with the problem at source. It was simply putting plugs in the cracks in the dam wall rather than building a new wall, rather than dealing with the problem as it really was at its source.</PARA>
<PARA> Then we had the famous statement from the honourable member for Bennelong, the former Treasurer, in 1982 that public opinion at the time was not strongly against the avoidance schemes. Of course it was not strongly against avoidance schemes because the people did not know about them. But, like so many things, the gaping hole was left for this Government to repair. The basic structural defect was left for us to repair by putting in a capital gains tax. But what have we now? The same crowd is trying to remove the very tax that stopped the tax avoidance. The very essence of the change which prevents this kind of scam today is now to be removed. Yesterday Mr McCrann, the noted business columnist, was talking about the indecency and inequity of removing the capital gains tax and saying that we will see the resources of the country turn to paper profits and tax avoidance schemes once more. Those opposite are at it again. Not content with destroying the tax system and making a swill of it in the 1970s and early 1980s, they are now about to try to give tens of billions of dollars of unrealised capital gains liability back to one per cent of the taxpaying population. That is not public policy; it is public theft.</PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite are using their powers as a parliamentary party to try to change the tax laws to benefit one per cent of the population by a shift of wealth that this country has never seen the likes of and no other country has even seen the likes of. Billions of dollars would be transferred from contingent tax liabilities in the hands of the Commonwealth to private individuals, many of whom are in the Opposition parties or influential in those parties, including on their front bench. Those opposite reserve for themselves the right to think that they can change the tax laws of this country to confer these billions of dollars of benefits on people as though it were a legitimate public policy change when it is nothing short of public theft.</PARA>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Wentworth moving forthwith the following motion:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House calls for the Minister for Social Security to detail expenditure cuts proposed by the Government which will be necessary to pay for all the new $5.8 billion tax cut and family assistance package announced by him in the interview published in today's edition of the Sydney Morning Herald. </PARA>
<PARA>When I picked up the Sydney Morning Herald this morning and saw the smiling face-indeed the cheshire grin-of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), I then went on to read:</PARA>
<PARA>``In April this year you got the largest tax cuts in history. Massive $5.8 billion . . . </PARA>
<PARA> ``And probably in a tax-wage trade-off next year you'll get something of the same order. All paid for,''</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `all paid for'. I suggest that it is a matter of urgency that, given the magnitude of the decision and the lack of detail, the Minister be called on to detail in this Parliament that decision to the benefit of the Australian people. Having read the story this morning, my mind immediately turned to, and I expected a call from, Wendy Woods of Alexandria. Everybody will remember Wendy Woods from Alexandria-Whingeing Wendy. She would probably say, `If it is all paid for, where is the money coming from?'. One can just imagine how the phone call would go. She would say, `John, I am really worried about this fellow, Brian Howe. You know, I supported the Australian Labor Party last time but this time I think I'll switch. John, will you do me a favour and tell Mr Howe that I and my family would like to ask him some really simple questions about--</PARA>

<PARA>I go back to the point I was making in relation to the sort of phone call one might expect from Whingeing Wendy. She would undoubtedly say to me, `John, please tell Mr Howe that I and my family would like to ask him some really simple questions about his free money-for-nothing promises. Where is his $5.8 billion tax cut money really coming from? John, will he cut out home nursing? Will he cut out two million meals on wheels? Will he cut out pharmaceutical benefits? Will he cut out pensions? Will he close child-minding centres? Please, John, get him to tell me what we want to know. Where is the money coming from, Mr Howe? The fact is, John, that Mr Howe, Mr Hawke and Mr Keating will not give us those tax cuts because they cannot make the spending cuts'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe): Where is the money coming from? In the text of an article in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald the Minister said that it would all be paid for. Where is the money coming from?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought about it for a while and it occurred to me that perhaps the Minister had three or four main sources for raising that money. Of course, the first one would be to run down the Budget surplus by $5.8 billion. I was not quite clear what the Minister had in mind today when answering the first question asked of him in the House, and perhaps he was not quite sure either, but he seemed to imply that he was prepared to run down the surplus, as the Government did last year. Perhaps he could clarify that point. Perhaps he could also go and talk to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about it because nobody would be more surprised than the Treasurer that that is what he had in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Just on a week ago the Treasurer made that speech to the Metal Trades Industry Association, which I must say was one of the most boring and torrid speeches I have ever listened to. He repeated it three times just to get the point across. Honourable members will have noticed how he repeats everything these days; he keeps repeating stuff over and over because he is not convinced about it, let alone anybody else. It would be nice if the Minister for Social Security told the Treasurer that what he had in mind was running down the Budget surplus, because the Treasurer said last week that he would not hesitate to raise the surplus next year. I think it will be an interesting feat for the Minister and the Treasurer to perform in the course of the next 12 months. It will be difficult enough, on the Treasurer's Budget forecasts, to sustain the current level of the surplus, in the sense that he forecasts simply that growth will slow dramatically and the revenue base will shrink. So it will be very interesting to watch the two of them work it out. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Treasurer will also be quite surprised that the Minister has been prepared to enter what he has described as a shabby auction. He was not going to have any part in a shabby auction with the Opposition, but as soon as his back is turned the Minister for Social Security is out there taking the bid side in the first stage of that shabby auction. It is against that background that I think the Minister should clarify the first point: is he prepared to run down the surplus to the extent of $5.8 billion next year? If so, what is the intended size of the surplus, given his growth forecasts and his potential revenue base, as implied by this year's Budget Papers?</PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested to me that the second way in which the Minister might achieve his result-that the package will all be paid for-is that he intends to cut expenditure by $5.8 billion. Where will he cut expenditure? Where is his hit list of expenditure cuts? What is his secret agenda? Last Sunday he conceded, I think on the Face to Face television show, that more could be done in the welfare area. At the time I had not concluded that he had $5.8 billion of cuts in mind, but obviously that is what he has in mind in current circumstances. Or perhaps the Minister is working from one of Senator Walsh's old hit lists? Remember that some time ago Senator Walsh identified about 200 different government programs which he said could not be justified on social or equity grounds, but they will not be abandoned because the Government does not have the political courage to do so. Is the Minister telling me that he now has the political courage to go into Senator Walsh's hit list and take out perhaps all 200 programs to fund his $5.8 billion package?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh is on the record as identifying a very wide range of proposed cuts that potentially could be made-things such as age pensions, war widows' pensions, home and community care, invalid pensions, service pensions, repatriation hospitals, education allowances, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, child-care programs-child-care programs have been of particular interest to Senator Walsh-secondary school funding, other cuts in tertiary education funding, and training programs. I could go on. Senator Walsh is a very thorough Minister for Finance in the sense that he would have left no stone unturned. In his hit list he would have gone right through the whole spectrum of government expenditure. So which of these programs is the Minister intending to cut? Perhaps he is going to cut them all. By how much is he intending to cut them in the course of the next few months as he plans the details of his tax expenditure package?</PARA>
<PARA> The third option is, of course, that he does not intend to cut expenditure entirely or completely. Perhaps he has in mind one of the Treasurer's favourite alternatives-the consumption tax that he proposed back in 1985 in the course of the Tax Summit. Remember that classic option C that he wanted so that he could broaden the indirect tax base in this country and raise a substantial amount of revenue? Perhaps that is what the Minister had in mind in terms of his solution to funding this $5.8 billion tax package. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it will be interesting to watch the Minister put that package together. We would then realise just how much the Treasurer has increased consumption taxes already. Presumably the Minister would be raising $5.8 billion net in terms of additional revenue from those consumption taxes. This Treasurer has increased revenue from the principal consumption tax-the wholesale sales tax-by 201 per cent over the life of the Hawke-Keating Government. This is more than three times the increase in the rate of inflation and roughly double the increase in consumer expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer talks today about taxation by the back door. What does he think that is? None of that has been through the budgetary process; none of that has been approved through the processes of this House. Presumably one of the options is, therefore, a broad-based consumption tax over and above what is already $15 billion to $20 billion of tax revenue being pulled out of the indirect tax area. </PARA>
<PARA> The final option that occurred to me that the Minister might have in mind in funding his $5.8 billion package is that really he is little more than a flunkey for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). We all know how the Prime Minister tends to panic when he is put under pressure-and has he had a run of what he would call `unintended consequences' in recent days! Everything that he has touched has collapsed or disintegrated in his hands. The Prime Minister has obviously been in panic mode since the early part of this financial year. He was unable to capitalise on the fact that he delivered his tax cuts on 1 July. He has not had the electoral standing. There has not been the crack of light in the polls that he is looking for in order to go to an election. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since then he has run around this country trying to create circumstances in which he may be able to go to an early election. Of course, the longer he waits the bigger the gap is in the polls, which are moving against him, and the more frustrated and toey he has become. We have seen the way in which he has performed in the Parliament in the last couple of days-frothing at the mouth, carrying on a treat, declaring things like the pilots dispute to be at an end when, of course, everybody knows that it is far from that. I note that the Minister for Social Security is leaving the chamber. Perhaps he is going to look up his notes for the basis of that decision. Everyone knows that the pilots dispute is a long way from being finished. </PARA>
<PARA> There is in the Parliament today a delegation from Tasmania which is trying to get the attention of the Government. It is trying to explain the impact of the pilots dispute on the welfare of those in the tourist industry in Tasmania, let alone the entire Tasmanian economy. But members of the delegation are finding it hard, if not impossible, to get any sort of access to any senior Government Ministers because the Treasurer and other senior Ministers, in their typical arrogant fashion, have wandered around this country day after day, week after week, saying, `It does not matter. There is not a pilots dispute. It is not significant'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer quoted the example of the occupancy rate of a Sydney hotel that he happened to be staying in. As I asked before, what was he doing staying in a Sydney hotel? I thought he actually lived in Sydney. But his interest in this issue does not go beyond major hotels in major capital cities. Go up to Cairns, go down to Launceston, go visit Hobart--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is fine. I have plenty to go, do not worry. The Minister for Social Security probably has been convinced that this is a great coup for the the left wing of the Party. We know that the Left and the Right have never got on. There is a gap between the Left and the Right of the Australian Labor Party that makes the San Andreas fault look like a mere crack. We know that in those circumstances he perhaps could have been convinced to go out there and simultaneously push the views of the Left and, perhaps, white-ant the Treasurer, who has been trying to maintain an air of fiscal and financial responsibility all through the circumstances whereby this balance of payments and inflation performance has been dramatically out of line with the expectations he set just a few months before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the Prime Minister has duped the poor Minister for Social Security. Perhaps he has tried to pin the tag of fiscal irresponsibility on poor, unsuspecting Brian. Which one is it? Is it the run-down in the surplus? Is it the intention to cut $5.8 billion out of Government expenditure? Is it the fact that the Government has up its sleeve the hidden agenda of a consumption tax? Or is it simply that the Minister for Social Security has been duped by the Prime Minister and is out there doing his bidding, white-anting the Treasurer in the process?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Government has absolutely no solutions to our current economic problems. I remember the Treasurer's first reaction when we brought down our Economic Action Plan. In about the third paragraph of his press statement on the reaction to our Economic Action Plan he said that basically it endorses the thrust of Government policy. Then, a few paragraphs later, he said, `It provides absolutely no answers to Australia's emerging balance of payments and debt problem'. Which one of those is it? That is living proof that he has no answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Every time an inflation or balance of payments number comes out which is larger than the Treasurer expects, the answer is always the same-some special factor that month has moved it off course relative to expectations; something has just nudged it away. But do not worry, it will turn round; things will get better; circumstances will improve; this time next year we will not have the same sort of problem. That is what the Treasurer was saying 12, 13 and 14 months ago. But a year or more has passed and the problems are that much bigger. In the first three months of this financial year the current account deficit is sitting at 57 per cent more than it was in the first three months of the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Treasurer's performance on inflation. Out of seven attempts to forecast the rate of inflation, he has hit one and that was in his first year before he really hit his straps. Every other year inflation has accelerated well away-far and above anything that he has had by way of a Budget forecast. Of course, in the last year we had circumstances in which he predicted that inflation would run at an annual rate of 4 1/2 per cent to the end of the year-that is, to June of this calendar year-and fall to 3 to 4 per cent next year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of that forecast he negotiated what he said was one of these wonderful wage-tax trade-offs that we are talking about today. I wonder whether the union movement will be so gullible as to rush into another round of this sort of process. In the middle of last year the Treasurer was boasting that he could achieve a zero earnings increase in return for the tax cut that was to be promised. By the time we reached January this year he had given an enormous amount of ground and the agreement was for a 6 1/2 per cent earnings increase in addition to that tax cut. In this year's Budget we saw a further drift of this so-called deal to a 7 per cent earnings growth in addition to the tax cut. Right now earnings numbers are running as high as perhaps 9 per cent. What a great trade-off there was implicit in that deal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five minutes available to me I do not have time to make the points I want to make. I am delighted to have an opportunity to stand here and talk to the Treasurer about his failures, which most people in this country understand. However, the turkeys opposite have no idea of them and they figure to go to an early election. I am right on in the motion because what I am talking about is a tax-wage deal which is precisely what has been foreshadowed and promised by the current Minister for Social Security. He said that another version of it will come down next year, that it will be about the same order of magnitude-$5.8 billion-and that it will all be paid for. But will the union movement rush into another one of these wage-tax deals?</PARA>
<PARA> What is the bottom line of the way this Government has run this country? Basically, it has run with a bias towards short term growth. I have four minutes to go. It has consistently overheated the economy; demand has outstripped supply in every year but one, and that, of course, was the recession year of 1985-86. As a result of the way it has run the economy it has built a bias into the tax system. It has overheated the economy; it has boosted the revenue base; it has boosted its tax base; and then it comes cap in hand and says, `What about a deal? What about we give you a bit of that back. What about we give you back just a bit of what we've taken by way of a tax cut in return for wage restraint?'. This is not an effective solution to our current inflation position; it is not an effective solution to our current balance of payments problem; and it is not an effective solution to our emerging debt crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The monumental failure is inherent in the fact that those deals have not worked. Right through all the manifestations of the accord this Government has been unable to control inflation and unit labour costs. It is no exaggeration to say that our inflation rate is roughly double that of our trading partners because our unit labour costs are roughly double those of our trading partners; and because our inflation is roughly double that of our trading partners, our interest rates are roughly double those of our trading partners. The Government has been forced to increasingly use high interest rates and monetary policy to clean up after wage-tax deals that have not worked and to clean up after what occurred when it actually eased fiscal policy quite significantly in the course of the last couple of years. It has absolutely no solution to our current economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have the incredible situation of a senior Government Minister, who does not even stay for the debate but leaves the Parliament and comes out in the Sydney Morning Herald with the announcement that next year there will be another one of these deals-which will not work-to the tune of $5.8 billion and that it will all be paid for, but we have no details of how it will be paid for. The point of this motion is that that Minister should come into this Parliament and detail for the benefit of the Australian people exactly how he intends to pay for that deal. This Opposition has put down in more detail than has any other opposition an Economic Action Plan that will solve this country's problems. This Opposition has put down in considerable detail how its tax cuts will be paid for. We have put discipline on ourselves. We have explicitly detailed how we will fund our tax cuts. We have further disciplined ourselves by a commitment on bracket creep. Where is the Government's fiscal responsibility? Let us see those opposite meet the same standard of fiscal responsibility of putting together next year's package as we have done. Let us see them accept that they should give back bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> It is almost inconceivable that a senior Minister went out and made that statement today, without any authority, which he claimed he had in Question Time today. He acted as if he had simply made the remark off the cuff. We want to know the full extent of this Government's hidden agenda. If it intends to bring down a tax-wage package next year, we need to know how it will be paid for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just had a motion moved by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who could not sustain the debate. It was the limpest performance I have ever seen. Seven minutes into the speech he could not sustain it. It was like being flogged with a warm lettuce. It was like being mauled by a dead sheep. He had the hide to ask us where our fiscal responsibility was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a government which has taken a 7 per cent deficit in the public sector borrowing requirement and turned it into a surplus of 1 1/4 per cent and cut outlays by 7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). And the honourable member for Wentworth has the gall to ask us where our fiscal responsibility is. Those opposite went to the last election with their former Leader offering $7.8 billion worth of unfunded tax cuts and we went with a $400m package which was fully paid for. And the honourable member asks us where our fiscal responsibility is. Last week he had the gall to say that the Opposition would have a fiscal policy which was lower than ours as a proportion of GDP; that is, absconding with all our work over seven years-all those months in the Expenditure Review Committee meetings cutting down public outlays from nearly 31 per cent of GDP to 23 per cent, and copping the Opposition's criticism for nearly every one of them, one after the other. Finally, we bring down a Budget with outlays to GDP just above 22 per cent in a year or two, and those opposite say they will knock $140m off it and that it is all theirs. We have built the structure of fiscal policy. As I said, it is like building the Empire State Building and those opposite us jumping into the lift, rushing to the top, putting a brick on top and saying, `Look what I have built'. It is a joke that they talk about fiscal responsibility. As I said today, in talking about economic policy--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wentworth was heard in silence and we expect the same treatment. Last week the shadow Treasurer stated, `We are moving across the board into my different sort of world'. Imagine if I stood up as Treasurer of this country and said, `Look, economic policy will now be conducted in a different kind of world'. The press would beat me to a pulp, and they would be entitled to. The honourable member for Wentworth says, `We are not going to have any rising unemployment; we are going to have a weak fiscal policy, wage mayhem with enterprise bargaining, sole reliance on monetary policy, but we are not going to have any higher unemployment because we are moving into a different kind of world'. He said, `If you move decisively and quickly enough you do not have any significant employment effects'. What twaddle. As if anyone with any self-respect, with a view about economics, would put that kind of stuff across and hope to get away with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we go back to the Economic Action Plan, this is the key line: `reducing inflation and shifting the weight off monetary policy'. How does one reduce inflation and shift the weight off monetary policy? Those opposite say `by cutting wages', but how does one cut wages without monetary policy? They will cut them because they have enterprise bargaining. What an unbelievably sick joke that is. Opposition members are not prepared to defend the central tenet of their policy. They run away from it. When a questioner puts the question, `Will this not have unemployment effects?', the honourable member for Wentworth says, `Oh, I am living in a different sort of world-not the world of economics like everyone else has to live in, a different kind of world'. This is unbelievable stuff. </PARA>
<PARA> For the honourable member for Wentworth to think that they could parrot this kind of rubbish and then get away with it shows either an arrogance or naivety-one or the other. That is why they were laughing at him at the Metal Trades Industry Association. What did the chairman say when he got up? He said, `We do not want toe to toe industrial contests; we want a mature industrial structure whereby we get a change in the craft structure by evolution through such things as award restructuring'. Which was the industry body putting the big effort into the award restructuring? It was the Metal Trades Industry Association. Those organisations know what enterprise bargaining means: it means that they get cut to ribbons. They are in the eye of the storm. </PARA>
<PARA> The people sitting at the top table the other night were in the eye of the storm in 1980-81. People such as Bert Evans watched these industries consigned to the scrap heap under the previous Government's wages policy, and members of the Opposition are back here with the same policy. The three of them are there, the tragic trio: the honourable member for Wentworth, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and Senator Stone. The three people who have already destroyed the economy once want a return bout. They want to come back and have a second go. We would not mind if they said, `We have used the seven years to think about our structure. We will have something different'. But oh no!-no thinking, adopt the Government's fiscal policy, adopt all of its deregulation, adopt its structure and have the same policy, enterprise bargaining, pretend the craft structure does not exist, let the wage mayhem start, bring interest rates down on them and give Australia a recession, because that is really what it needs; it will cut the import growth and lower the inflation rate. That is the Opposition's dull policy. That is the bankruptcy of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of creativity or ingenuity the Opposition has nothing as a party or as individuals. No party in the world would see done to a country what those three did to Australia and then have the front to propose them again to manage the economy. Anyone in American politics who did this would be drummed from the regiment; they would never appear again. Anyone in British politics who sent the British economy into a recession and the rest would never appear again. But oh no, those three are back again, large as life, cocky as you like, saying `We can do it all again'. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Opposition propose in its policy? Basically it proposes a set of bribes and then a set of give-aways, the most outrageous of which is the capital gains tax. It cannot even keep together the basic fabric of the structure that the Government has put in place. We have done the hard work and put the capital gains tax in place. We have taken the political risks and put it there. The Opposition does not have the decency or the common sense to understand that something of value has been done and that it should be preserved. Oh no, the Opposition thinks it can give one per cent of the tax paying public tens of billions of accumulated contingent tax liabilities sitting there. It thinks it can hand them over. As I said, it is not the legitimate operation of a party thinking about a better policy structure with a proposal for a change in public policy. It is a proposal for public theft; that is what it is. It is on that basis that I move the following amendment, to put some real substance in the debate:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) this House notes the widespread criticism of the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition to abolish the capital gains tax, and in particular, the disastrous consequences for the economic health of the nation of the proposal;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) consequently, this House believes the Leader of the Opposition must provide the public with a detailed account of:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) what prompted the Opposition to backdate its proposed concessionary speculative gains tax to 19 September 1985;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) on what basis has the Opposition calculated that the revenue cost of their proposal would be $450m a year, and to what extent does this costing include an allowance for the realisation of windfall tax-free capital gains derived from the backdating of the Coalition's proposal;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to what extent does the Opposition's costing make allowance for increased tax avoidance, the potential for which was described by Business Commentator Mr Terry McCrann in the Melbourne Sunday Herald on October 29, 1989 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Peacock proposes to turn back the clock and once again unleash the assembled might of the legal, accounting and financial professions in the drive to turn otherwise taxable income into tax-free capital gains of five years' standing. That is unacceptable-not only on equity grounds, but in terms of promoting the very changes necessary to make Australia more competitive and more efficient. We don't want our best brains and available resources devoted to shuffling bits of paper for tax and financial reasons. Better they be directed to investing in and building real businesses;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to what extent does the President of the Liberal Party and Chairman of Elders IXL, Mr John Elliott, benefit from the Opposition's proposed changes to the Capital Gains Tax;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) to what extent does the Liberal Party Candidate for Barker and Director of Elders IXL, Mr Ian McLachlan, benefit from the Opposition's proposed changes to the Capital Gains Tax;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the discussions that took place between Mr Elliott and the Leader of the Opposition prior to the latter's challenge for the Leadership of the Liberal Party and what discussion was there of the Opposition's proposed changes to the Capital Gains Tax;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) similarly, what discussions, correspondence or other communications have taken place between the Shadow Treasurer or his office and Mr Elliott or his advisers on the structure of the Opposition's capital gains tax proposal;</PARA>
<PARA> (h) what prompted the Leader of the Opposition to tell the Metal Trades Industry Association on 23 October that ``countless millions'' of taxpayers pay capital gains tax, when statistics of the Australian Taxation Office show that less than one per cent of individual taxpayers paid capital gains tax in respect of the 1987-88 income year;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) what has prompted the Leader of the Opposition to claim that his is a proposal to help small business when more than two-thirds of the capital gains tax payable by companies is paid by the largest 1 1/2 per cent of Australian companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (j) whether it is Opposition policy, as stated by the Leader of the National Party in his address to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association last week, that exploration `farm-out' agreements will be exempt from the Opposition's so-called Speculative Gains Tax? and why was this exemption not included in the Opposition's so-called Economic Action Plan; and</PARA>
<PARA> (k) what other exemptions from its Speculative Gains Tax proposal has the Opposition agreed to but not detailed in its Economic Action Plan and what is the revenue cost of these exemptions?</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment calls on the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) to provide the public with a detailed answer to these questions. In particular, the amendment asks the Leader of the Opposition to provide an account about what discussions, correspondence or other communications have taken place between the shadow Treasurer or his office and Mr Elliott or his advisers on the structure of the Opposition's capital gains tax proposal, particularly around the Harlin Holdings proposal. Tell us about the relationships and the questions about--</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Hewson interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we are not. I know that Elliott was in touch with the shadow Treasurer's office about Harlin; I know he was in touch with his office about the structure of the shadow Treasurer's proposal, because Harlin does not succeed unless one goes back to September 1985. I repeat: Harlin does not succeed in terms of capital gains treatment unless one goes back to September 1985. Let the Leader of the Opposition tell us whether, in his discussions with Mr Elliott prior to the change in leadership, the capital gains tax issue and the backdating to September 1985 was discussed. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to tell us these things and then we will see what veracity there is in the Opposition Leader's claim that this is just a change in public policy. It is a fact that the proposal is for the largest transfer of wealth of the public's contingent capital gains tax liability as taxpayers to the Commonwealth in the nation's history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us get a real issue on the table of the House of Representatives and not some phony proposition from the shadow Treasurer about fiscal responsibility when members opposite in fact bequeathed to us the most disastrous fiscal inheritance in the nation's history. I would not be bothered tabling once again the note from the then Secretary to the Treasury saying that the speed of the fiscal deterioration in Australia was unparalleled in the post-war years. If my memory serves me correctly, he might have said, unparalleled in our peacetime history. That is what the Secretary to the Treasury said in the note that was given to the then Treasurer before the 1983 election-the fastest deterioration in fiscal policy ever. Who was left to clean it up? It was this Government. The shadow Treasurer has the temerity to come in today and say that, because my colleague the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) refers to the wage-tax trade-off of this year-which is, of course, the successful plugging of a wage explosion-and speculates about the prospect of such an economic technique being employed again, the Government would then have some kind of irresponsible fiscal policy. In fact, the very wage-tax trade-off that the Government introduced on 1 July succeeded in plugging a wage explosion. That is why we will have wages growth of 6.5 to 6.75 per cent this year instead of about 15 per cent which we would have had under the Opposition parties, which would then have been followed by a crash landing, a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's plan did work and, despite the cynicism that it was greeted with as being an election ploy and the rest, it was a necessary part of economic policy. The Government will make judgments in the future about what is required in terms of wages and fiscal policy. As I said the other day, the requirements of fiscal policy will be paramount: that is, the question of demand will be paramount. The Government's stance on fiscal policy for the coming year will be determined in the coming year and all other judgments will be contingent upon that requirement, a requirement of a reduction in demand. So the Opposition's proposition is fraudulent and without any basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I want the shadow Treasurer to face up to his claim about his different world and to tell us what kind of world he believes exists, what kind of different world exonerates him from the laws of economics. What kind of different world frees him of the laws of economics and the behaviour of economic aggregates and economic variables? Let the shadow Treasurer tell us that, because if any one of the rest of us said something like that he would be beaten to a pulp by the media of this country, as he deserves to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition asks one fundamental question of this Government: Where is the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe)? Why did he skulk out of this chamber like a dog with its tail between its legs? Why is he not here to face up to an issue which he and he alone put on the public agenda of this nation by way of the contents of his release in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning? We have been told by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), as we were by the Minister at Question Time, that it is all just a terrible mistake, that what he said was not said. For the benefit of the House I will put on the record exactly what the article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>`In April this year you got the largest tax cuts in history a massive $5.8 billion.'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howe went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>`And probably in a tax-wage trade-off next year-</PARA>
<PARA>honourable members should note it is next year, not this year, as both he and the Treasurer claimed-</PARA>
<PARA>you'll get something of the same order. All paid for,' Mr Howe said. </PARA>
<PARA>The issue is quite straightforward; the Minister has been caught out very seriously. One could even ask whether he was actually prepared to influence the contents of this article which appeared in the newspaper. Was he capable of doing that? If he was here, perhaps he could tell us, but he is not. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion asks the Minister to detail expenditure cuts proposed by the Government. We want to know, the Australian people want to know, and the millions of Australian social security beneficiaries want to know what the hidden agenda is that this Government has up its sleeve. One could perhaps ask the most interesting question and give the Government the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps the Government's response to our Economic Action Plan was so pathetic because we got in first. Maybe the Government also has an action plan based on cutting back government expenditure. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague asks what it is. What is the great mystery? Why will the Government not tell the Australian people? Why will it not tell this Parliament? Why is the Minister not here? I come back to that fundamental question: Who better to tell the truth, something we find almost impossible to extricate from Ministers of this Government, than the person who gave the interview in the first place?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts of the situation simply are that we know why the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security made such a pathetic response to our Economic Action Plan. It is because they know and we know that our policy is right, but we got there first. The Australian people accepted our message. They know it is right. In a matter of a few months the Government will see in the hard realities of the ballot box what the outcome will be for its failure to face up to the real economic difficulties facing this country, as we have, and to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Minister for Social Security has inadvertently announced has revealed the Hawke Labor Government's desperation to be re-elected at any price-in this case nearly $6 billion. That is the price that the Government is prepared to pay to once again bribe its way into office. After seven Budgets and seven failures, and economic indices being wrong on almost every occasion, the Government's credibility in the marketplace of Australia's voter-land is near zero. That is what the Government has to face up to. That is what the Australian people will remember in a few months' time, and that is why we need to know now and the Australian people need to know now precisely what the Government's big tax cuts in the pipeline will be and, above all, how the Government will pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security has not said how they will be funded. He has said that they will all be paid for. But how do the members of this Parliament and how do the people of Australia understand what those tax cuts mean unless they also know what is on the other side of that particular piece of coinage? Where are the cuts to be made? If they are to be unfunded, the Treasurer's entire economic strategy will be destroyed. I venture to guess that the reason the Minister for Social Security is not in the chamber is that those commitments are unfunded. Why did he have the Treasurer here to defend him? Because the Treasurer had no alternative but to face up to the reality that his economic policy now has a gaping hole in it; a hole put in it by none other than his colleague of the Left, the Minister for Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that if these cuts are not fully funded, injecting a further $6 billion of unfunded tax cuts and benefits will have catastrophic effects on inflation, on the balance of payments and, above all, on international confidence in Australia's currency. The sad part is that such a policy will destroy utterly and forever the very people, the disadvantaged, whom the Minister for Social Security claims so often to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister not only has told us about the Government's re-election strategy but also has confirmed that it has its own hidden agenda for reducing expenditure. Once again I quote his words. He said they would be `all paid for'. What we want to know and what any sensible Australian voter wants to know is what is on the other side of the coin. If they are to be paid for, how? If they are to be paid for, who are the losers? If they are to be paid for, who are the winners? What do we get from the Government? We get silence; absolute, abject silence, backed up by this putrid performance by the Treasurer, throwing aspersions on my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), hiding behind aspersions as a miserable alternative to sensible, soundly based debate, because the facts, which are so abundantly clear, are that the Government has no case, it has nothing to present to the Australian people, and it has been caught out once again. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike Labor, the Opposition has no hidden agenda. Our family package is fully funded from the responsible expenditure cuts contained in our Economic Action Plan. We have announced it and, unlike Labor's scheme, it is there for all to see. In addition, we are committed to returning bracket creep each year and not giving phoney tax cuts paid out of the massive tax receipts obtained from higher inflation which has made Australians today the generation of highest taxpayers this century. There has been no such commitment from Labor. It has made a virtue of higher taxes. It is those higher taxes and those higher taxes alone which are the fundamental basis, the fulcrum, of what the Minister for Social Security inadvertently perhaps let out in that interview. The Minister must tell us where Labor will cut expenditure and where the Minister for Social Security especially will cut expenditure in his area of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In July, on television, he said categorically that there was no rorting of the welfare system. I was there. I heard it with absolute amazement. To say I was silenced would be an incorrect statement, but certainly he ought to have been. On 25 July, he was interviewed on A Current Affair with Jana Wendt as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Jana Wendt. ``. . . Mr Howe, is the dole system being rorted?''</PARA>
<PARA>That was a straightforward question. The interview continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Brian Howe: ``Well, no, the figures I think are very clear . . .''</PARA>
<PARA> Jana Wendt: ``Is the system being rorted or not?''</PARA>
<PARA> Brian Howe: ``Well no.''</PARA>
<PARA> Jana Wendt: ``Categorically not?''</PARA>
<PARA> Brian Howe: ``No.''</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that. He said, `No'. The welfare system is wide open to massive abuse. If that were not the case, why does the Budget contain a whole range of changes to tighten up the system? If that were not the case, why did he say only in the last few days-in fact, last Sunday-on the Face to Face program:</PARA>
<PARA> I think there is always scope to be rigorous. </PARA>
<PARA>Was that a warning? Was it a warning to the dole bludgers, the cheats and the welfare fraud artists? Or was it a warning to the hundreds of thousands if not millions of Australian families and people who are on welfare benefits, and legitimately on those benefits? What is the meaning of the word `rigorous' which he used last Sunday? Where does it fit in with this little story in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning? Surely as an Opposition we are doing our duty to the Australian people in asking the Government, in asking the Minister at the table, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), `Where is your hidden agenda? How are you going to fund further tax cuts and some welfare benefit increases to the tune of some $6 billion a year?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has given us a warning of what is in the pipeline. What we ask is to be told precisely and without any further obfuscation and delay, by someone with some courage who has the capacity to come into this chamber and face the music, exactly what is in store. We can only conclude that Senator Walsh has finally won and that the 200 programs which he identified as not being justified on social and equity grounds are to be abandoned. The House should well remember the words of Senator Walsh:</PARA>
<PARA> I can think of 200 programs that are not justified on social or equity grounds but will not be abandoned because the Government does not have the political courage so to do. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the Government suddenly does have some courage. Perhaps we have misunderstood the Government. But if this is a demonstration of its courage, why has the Minister for Social Security demonstrated so publicly for all to see that he is singularly lacking in that very qualification which was so well and eloquently referred to by Senator Walsh-that simple word `courage'. But he is not here. He has left the field. He has run away. There is no alternative explanation. He is now in the vanguard of the retreat from the political scene by the entire Hawke Labor Government. We are seeing only stage one. </PARA>
<PARA> We will drive the Government from the treasury benches just as the Australian people will drive many Government members from this House at the next election. They are no longer satisfied to put up for ever with a government of deceit, obfuscation and duplicity; a government whose Ministers do not have the courage to come into the House and face up to the quotations for which they are responsible. If Minister Howe's quotation is wrong, why did not the Minister, in answering two questions today, say so? If the quotation is wrong in terms of the conclusion we have interpreted from it, why did he not have the courage to stand in this House and say so?</PARA>
<PARA> This man has been condemned from his own lips. His silence gives us precisely the reason to move this motion. His removal voluntarily-or was it perhaps involuntarily at the request of the Treasurer-from this House demonstrates for all to see that the man is guilty, that he has said more than he ought to have said and that he has now put the Government's hidden agenda on the record. It has a hidden agenda-not just the odd bauble of a couple of million dollars here or there but of some $6 billion. We want to know where the money is coming from. The Australian people want to know where the money is coming from. Until the Government has the courage to tell us, it has no right to ask Australian voters to give it any support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard a couple of the most pathetic speeches in this place, particularly the first one from the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) seeking an explanation from the Government on a few of its positions. We have to put some order into this debate and ask a few real questions which go to the heart of public policy and which have been at the heart of public policy for some very considerable period. We are providing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) with an opportunity to appear at a press conference subsequent to this and to answer the questions presented by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his amendment. From the point of view of the public of this country, these questions are critical to the Opposition's credibility in the area of economic policy. If the Opposition intends, as it has announced, to keep cutting to provide its tax changes-there is one area of tax changes on which it has not announced that-it needs to tell us exactly who will pay for John Elliott's $17m tax pay- out and those of its other supporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The desperate bunch opposite are trying to get back into the good books of businesses who have lost confidence in the Opposition. Opposition members have been expressing concern about the fact that they are not receiving the contributions that they ought to be receiving from businesses, particularly to their New South Wales branches. For that reason the Opposition Leader has decided to bring back his predecessor to the front bench in order to improve the Opposition's capacity to collect money from its former supportive business interests. But for the Opposition to produce that document so obviously as a bribe to encourage those contributions is one of the shoddiest pieces of public policy perpetrated in this place. That is the first point that has to be made. </PARA>

He was obliged to go forth and correct himself, having obviously stated what was an accurate position in the first place. In the first instance he presented the Opposition's hidden agenda. In the second instance he presented the Opposition's election policy ploy. Some interesting economics are going on on that side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the more interesting speeches was given not in this debate but in a previous debate on economic policy in which the Leader of the Opposition came into this place and said, `We will accept the discipline of handing back unfunded bracket creep. We will accept the discipline to provide ourselves with an opportunity to play Santa Claus'. It was unbelievable discipline that he imposed himself when he made the statement, `We will accept the discipline to play Santa Claus'. It was repeated in here by the honourable member for Bradfield. Opposition members claim to represent the party of fiscal discipline. They come in here and lecture those on this side of the House about unfunded tax cuts and fiscal discipline. Although repeated by the honourable member for Bradfield, it was issued first by that economic manque, the Leader of the Opposition, when he said that the Opposition would accept the discipline and hand back the $3.5 billion of bracket creep unfunded. He did not say that there would be any wages trade-off or trade-off in the area of outlays; he said simply that the Opposition would hand it back. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has the hide to come into this place and put forward a proposition accusing us of allegedly having some unfunded tax cuts hovering around in the wings. We on this side of the House know all about funded tax cuts. We have provided fiscal discipline. We have reduced the percentage of our gross domestic product taken up in Commonwealth outlays from about 30 per cent to 23 per cent. At the same time we have reduced the tax burden on our population to make us the fourth lowest taxing country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development group of nations. To be the fourth lowest taxing government is not a bad achievement by this Government. At the same time as we have done that in the social security area-the area in which people in the community are supported-we have increased welfare benefits to people who really need them. </PARA>
<PARA> The central unanswered question is: Who is ripping off this capital gains tax proposal? But one of the many other unanswered questions from the people who are paying for the tax benefit to those one per cent of taxpayers in our community is: What will the Opposition do about indexation? In case those opposite are unaware of it, we have introduced all sorts of social security benefits, including, and most importantly, what is a very generous family allowance supplement which goes not only to families in poverty but also to some just below the poverty line-a very substantial proportion of the Australian public-and is indexed--</PARA>

Perhaps we are beginning now to understand exactly how that handover of massive resources to the speculative end of the business community-not the productive end of the business community-will be paid for. After the first year, it will be paid for by cuts in the child-care program-a program brought in by this Government and continued. After that first year it will be paid for in the second instance by the elimination of indexation of an allowance that is absolutely critical to deal with the problem of child poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What a hide the Leader of the Opposition-this man supposedly concerned about child poverty-had to come in here the other day and ask the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a question on that when, sitting in the phalanx of his policies, is a proposition for no indexation of child support after the first year. What did he think Bishop Hollingworth was referring to when he said that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) had produced a set of propositions to really deal with child poverty in this country? What did he think the Australian Council of Social Service was referring to when it congratulated the Government on its performance in the area of child poverty? Did he think it was referring to some sort of mickey mouse club show down the road? It was referring specifically, front and centre, to the indexing of that family assistance package. Yet the Leader of the Opposition had the hide to come in here, ask a question on it and then mosey on out. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition have a hide to come in here and talk about what they intend to hand back to families as some sort of an achievement, and then ask the Government where its policies are. I will tell the Opposition where the Government's policies are. Government policies have provided a benefit of $25 per week to the typical family example that the Opposition uses in its economic statement. That is what we have done this year; that is our policy. The Opposition suggests that it will be extremely generous by working out a $5 contribution. What position does the Opposition think that those families on low incomes will be in when the family assistance package is not indexed? That $5 a week disappears very quickly when one fails to index the family assistance package, yet honourable members opposite have the hide to come in here and issue a challenge to the Minister for Social Security to respond on how he intends to conduct social security policy in the future. They have produced a document as full of holes as the sieve in which the Jumblies went to sea in that famous fable. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are on the subject of fables, let us look at the Opposition front bench that has emerged in recent times. It is a merry-go-round of personnel. We do not have to have Kremlin watchers any more, as the Soviet Union democratises; we have to have Liberal front bench watchers, watching who sits where and when. On occasions we can try to find out who likes whom at what time. We find that the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) shifts up one end of the front bench when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) goes down the other end. It is like the three bears. The father bear comes into this place and says, `Who has been sitting in my seat?'. The mother bear comes in and says, `Who has been sitting in my seat?'. This revolving door of Opposition frontbenchers is supposed to be presenting to this country a stable image of what it intends to do. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate is very much a matter of trust. Who trusts whom? Can we really trust the Opposition to deliver a package which has been found to have in it a hole amounting to a minimum of $854m? Can we trust an Opposition which says that it will continue a policy of caring for the poor and needy in this community but which, at the same time, produces a proposition on taxation which means that vast holes in the public revenue will simply have to be filled, either by taxing those who cannot run away from taxation-and that is the bulk of the pay as you earn taxpayers in this country-or by ripping social security off the genuinely needy? The Opposition asks people to trust that it will not do that, but a verdict was delivered by the newest member of the Liberal Party front bench on the subject of whether we ought to trust the man who laid down those documents. As far as he is concerned, `there is no trust between us'. This is a public facade of unity that we are supposed to have been presented with here. The public is supposed to trust this man to deliver when the newest appointment of the Leader of the Opposition to his front bench does not trust him, and well he might not. Unquestionably he is not worthy of trust on any of these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we have the timing expert. He came into this place obviously expecting that we would just sit down here and again listen to the bilge that he was prepared to utter. He made about 10 minutes worth of speech in this place, and it has occurred not just when he has been taken by surprise; he has come into this place effectively publicly prepared. He comes in here and talks for about seven minutes, and he accuses the Treasurer of repetition. But what do we get from him? He went round and round the garden, and he certainly gave us a display of circumlocution. Actually, it is not a shame for an honourable member to sit down a little earlier if he wants to. The honourable member for Wentworth could have got up, given us 10 rip-roaring minutes, and then sat down. We all accept that, every now and then, a fellow runs out of a bit of puff, and if an honourable member has about 10 minutes worth in him he should be able to deliver that and then sit down. So an honourable member does not actually have to fill in his full 20 minutes. When the honourable member for Wentworth gets a bit of experience in this place he will know that he is not obliged to take up his 20 minutes in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition in this area is an opposition ambushed. In fact, it has not used this as an opportunity to elucidate any further where it is going with its social security programs; it has not used this as an opportunity to elucidate any further where it is going with its taxation programs; and, most importantly, it has not used this as an opportunity to elucidate any further where it intends to go on wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worthwhile concluding on this note because, again, it gets to the heart of fairness in the taxation system: we have been able to deliver on wages policy for one very important reason-we are trusted by the ordinary wage earner in this country, who holds his or her wage demand in check, to deliver real tax benefits in a fair taxation system. The Opposition would permit a situation to develop where it would open up rip-offs. Does the Opposition expect the trade union movement to exercise restraint and stand back and say that, on the basis of the Opposition's policy it will work the economy for the benefit of those speculators who will organise theft from it? It is a pathetic illusion, but one that would be extraordinarily dangerous for public policy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is contemptible. It needs to answer those questions. It needs time to get out and discuss this matter with the press gallery. It would be the first performance of the Leader of the Opposition for about three weeks before the press gallery. I will give him time by now moving:</PARA>
<PARA> That the question be now put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I am extremely pleased to introduce this Bill, which includes measures providing for the grant of secure title to land to Aboriginal people in the pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. These measures are part of a package agreed to recently by the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments-an agreement which represents a significant breakthrough in obtaining land justice for Aboriginal people who either live or recently lived on pastoral properties, or whose traditional lands are on pastoral leases. These people have had a long and until now virtually fruitless struggle to obtain secure title to land. Many live on pastoral properties or town camps in conditions equal to those found in Third World countries. It is to the discredit of this nation that such conditions have been tolerated for so long. The provision of secure title to land is essential before these communities can be provided with the infrastructure and facilities necessary to improve their living conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Before describing the measures contained in the Bill, let me review the long history of failed attempts by governments to address this problem. The 1971 report of the Committee to Review the Situation of Aboriginals on Pastoral Properties in the Northern Territory, the so-called Gibb report, recommended the excision from pastoral leases of community living areas. These living areas were envisaged as relatively small areas of land sufficient to meet the basic living needs of an Aboriginal community and to provide that community with a measure of autonomy. In the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission in April 1974 Justice Woodward again drew attention to this need. Since that time, numerous government committees and independent inquiries have pointed out the urgent need to provide secure title to land to Aboriginal people in pastoral areas. The overriding problem has been that most land in the pastoral areas of the Territory is land leased from the Crown by pastoralists. The Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill 1975 introduced by the Whitlam Government included provisions to authorise an Aboriginal Land Commissioner to recommend the grant of land on a needs basis in certain areas including land under pastoral lease. In April 1975 the Whitlam Government appointed Mr Justice Ward as interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner to hear needs based claims to land within towns and on pastoral leases. Mr Justice Ward had heard a number of such claims before the events of 11 November 1975 terminated the hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> Much to its shame the Fraser Government did not proceed with this proposal. Thus the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976-the Land Rights Act-provides for Aboriginal people to claim only unalienated Crown land or alienated Crown land held by or on behalf of Aboriginal people. As a consequence, several thousand Aboriginal people missed out on the right to acquire title to land in pastoral areas. The Northern Territory Country Liberal Party must also share some of the blame for this. In 1976 the Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly gave the Commonwealth an assurance that complementary legislation to the Land Rights Act would be introduced. Amongst other things, this legislation would have established a process to handle applications to meet the needs of Aboriginal people in areas where traditional land claims could not be brought. On 4 June 1976, in his second reading speech on the Land Rights Act, the Hon. Ian Viner referred to this assurance:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Bill gives scope for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to participate in this most important legislative process in particular . . . in the handling of applications to meet the needs of Aborigines in towns and other areas where traditional claims cannot be established. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received assurances from the Leader of the Legislative Assembly that the Assembly is fully prepared to co-operate in the introduction of complementary legislation in these areas which accords with the spirit of this Bill. There will be full consultation with the Territory Assembly and between the Assembly and Aborigines in preparing Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>The assurance sought by the Hon. Ian Viner and given by the Majority Leader was not honoured. When this Government came to office in 1983, my predecessor, the Hon. Clyde Holding, initiated discussions with the Northern Territory Government to facilitate the granting of community living areas on pastoral leases. Initially, in 1983, the Northern Territory Government proposed a Community Living Areas Bill. The then Chief Minister, Paul Everingham, acknowledged that for some time the Northern Territory Government had recognised the need for a proper legislative mechanism to enable excisions of community living areas to be achieved more smoothly. At that time only 12 excisions had been granted. In spite of Mr Everingham's acknowledgment the Territory tied this Bill to other legislation alienating land under claim. That legislation was outside its constitutional powers and was opposed by the Commonwealth. Following extensive negotiations by the Commonwealth, in April 1985 the Northern Territory introduced administrative guidelines for excision applications, and undertook to accelerate the process of dealing with those applications. For its part, the Commonwealth undertook to amend the Land Rights Act to limit the right of Aboriginal people to claim stock routes and reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments were enacted in June 1987. However, the Commonwealth said that they would not be proclaimed until arrangements were made for the granting of land to Aboriginal people ineligible to apply for excisions under the Northern Territory's guidelines. The proclamation of the amendments would have resulted in the immediate withdrawal of most land claims over stock routes and reserves from the jurisdiction of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> When I first became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1987, I began negotiations with the then Northern Territory Chief Minister, the Hon. Steve Hatton, to try to speed up the very slow progress on the provision of living areas. Unfortunately the working party we established to resolve the delay was later disbanded when the Northern Territory Government withdrew in 1988. By early 1989 it had become clear that the rate of progress in issuing titles under the Northern Territory's living areas guidelines was unsatisfactory. The real losers in the failed attempts by governments to achieve a satisfactory resolution to this problem were of course the Aboriginal people themselves. People who had in many cases seen other Aboriginal people obtain land justice through the land claim processes available under the Land Rights Act were forced to endure years of protracted negotiations with little or no result. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory recommenced negotiations earlier this year. In September the two governments reached an historic understanding when a memorandum of agreement was signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. This Bill fulfils the Commonwealth's commitment under that agreement. For its part, the Northern Territory has passed legislation which will provide a statutory mechanism to allow certain Aboriginal people to make applications for community living areas on pastoral properties. Land granted under that arrangement will be under freehold title in accordance with Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written to the Chief Minister and expressed my concern that the Northern Territory legislation does not entirely reflect the words of that agreement. This failure has caused some disquiet amongst Aboriginal people. I believe that it is up to the Northern Territory to prove that this disquiet is unfounded. It is one matter which the review process provided for in the agreement will be able to address. Under the terms of the memorandum, the Commonwealth undertook to amend the Land Rights Act as a matter of priority, to provide for the granting of certain parts of existing land claims to stock routes and reserves. At the same time the earlier amendment to the Act limiting claims over stock routes and travelling stock reserves will be proclaimed. The selection of the areas to be granted has been determined after consultation with the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, a number of these areas relate to the needs of individual communities originally considered by the Gibb Committee, 18 years ago, and by Mr Justice Woodward, 15 years ago. In deciding on the areas to be granted, the Government has been concerned to ensure that the terms of the memorandum of agreement are adhered to. The areas to be granted represent only a small proportion of the land subject to existing claims over stock routes and reserves. The total area of all of the parcels of land described in the Bill, some 2,312 square kilometres, represents only approximately 26 per cent of the total stock route and reserve claims. Looking at the stock route component, the total area of the portions of stock routes to be granted represents approximately only 6 per cent of the total stock route claims. The area of land to be granted is about 0.17 per cent of the total area of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken steps to ensure that pastoral operations are not unreasonably interfered with by the granting of these areas of land. Where appropriate I have sought relevant undertakings from the Aboriginal claimants for the continued use of station roads, bores or infrastructure by the pastoral lessees. In some instances, the areas have been amended to exclude access corridors or areas of particular concern to pastoralists or the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go into the detail of the undertakings that have been given, or the land which has been given up by claimants, I want to make two general observations. Firstly, these undertakings are really about sharing the country and the resources. In acceding to my requests for undertakings, the Aboriginal claimants have again demonstrated a willingness to share their land with pastoral operations. This continued willingness to share, and to compromise, is a real tribute to the Aboriginal people. Secondly, where possible, every effort has been made to resolve issues of particular concern raised with me by the Northern Territory by a letter of 25 September 1989. However, I wish to express my disappointment that the Northern Territory has not continued to inform me or officers of my Department of its concerns in relation to the areas to be scheduled as consultations have progressed. While Aboriginal people have remained willing to compromise, the Northern Territory has again shown a disinclination to consider realistically how detrimental issues might be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, it seems that it is the Aboriginal people who are expected to make all the compromises, and I want to detail now the undertakings they have given. Perhaps the most important undertaking in respect of continuing pastoral operations relates to continued access to water resources. Claimants for the areas at Ammaroo, Alice Well, Black Tank Bore (on Bond Springs), Finke, Mount Peachy (on Maryvale), Henbury/Orange Creek, Mount Kathleen (on Loves Creek) and Undoolya Bore and Williams Bore (on Undoolya) have given undertakings to share access to bores with pastoralists. </PARA>
<PARA> In order that pastoral operations will not be inconvenienced by access problems, the claimants for areas at Ammaroo, Ranken River, Undoolya Bore, Forster Range (on Stirling), Mount Peachy, Henbury/Orange Creek and Mount Kathleen have given undertakings relating to the continued use of station roads which may cross the areas to be granted by the pastoralists concerned. Where there appears to be major station infrastructure situated on reserves, at Ammaroo, Mount Peachy and Ooratippra, claimants have undertaken to allow continued access by pastoralists to that infrastructure. As well, an undertaking has been given for the continued access across a stock route for cattle operations at Lorne Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> Undertakings have also been given relating to allowing the construction of a water pipeline through Undoolya Bore, the continued use of areas at Mount Solitaire (on Hamilton Downs) by the CSIRO, the grant of easements for the gas pipeline at Birdum (the Jommet Block) and at Elliott, and for the continuation for a reasonable period of a grazing licence affecting part of the land at Birdum. The specifics of the undertakings which have been given will be discussed with the lessees of the relevant pastoral properties. I also put on notice that I will consider any requests for further undertakings which may be put to me by affected pastoralists or the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of my consultations with the Northern Territory Government, four areas, previously identified, have been excluded from this scheduling process because, in terms of the memorandum of agreement, agreement had been reached that the claimants' needs could be satisfactorily met by a grant under Northern Territory title of a portion of stock route and an adjacent excision.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also agreed to amend the descriptions of some of the areas to be granted to take into account particular concerns expressed to me by the Northern Territory. In particular, I ask honourable members to note the following examples. The southern boundary of the area to be granted in the Birdum locality has been amended to provide a greater distance between the area and the town of Larrimah. The south-east section of approximately 19 hectares of the area at Newcastle Waters has been excluded from the scheduling process because the claimants recognised the importance of that area in terms of the water needs of the town and surrounding district. In accordance with concerns raised by the Northern Territory, an area used for cattle yards and a dip at Elliott has been excluded from the area to be scheduled. At Finke, the claimants have given up most of the two stock route portions previously included in this area, limiting scheduling to a small section of stock route only. At Henbury/Orange Creek, the original claim was for a length of a stock route cutting across two properties. The claimants have agreed to the granting of four separate portions, representing a reduction of more than 50 per cent of the original claim. Claimants have agreed to the amendment of the southern boundary of the area to be scheduled at the 16 Mile (Bond Springs), at the request of the pastoralist, to provide an access corridor for cattle operations. As well, the area containing the airstrip used by the Alice Springs Gliding Club has been excluded from scheduling. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion of the agreement between the two governments and the action to be taken because of it finally provide some certainty for Aboriginal people who have been living in these appalling conditions for so many years. It is my hope that living conditions for these people can now be quickly improved. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the other provisions contained in this Bill. In 1987 complex new provisions streamlining processes relating to mineral exploration and mining on Aboriginal land were included in the Act. I am now introducing a number of measures to fine-tune those new provisions. Currently, the new exploration and mining provisions do not apply to the Coronation Hill project area and the remainder of the Kakadu conservation zone. The amendments remove this anomaly by providing for the new provisions to apply to these areas. Other amendments to the exploration and mining provisions will allow for an agreement, entered into in relation to exploration, to continue after the end of exploration activity. This will allow for, among other things, rehabilitation of the land to be completed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are special provisions relating to the eastern areas on Groote Eylandt and the Coronation Hill project area. These provisions will provide that, where land either is, or becomes, Aboriginal land, exploration licences can be issued without the Land Council's consent. However, a terms and conditions agreement would be required to be entered into. The issue of mining interests on these areas will also be subject to a terms and conditions agreement. I wish to make it clear that this provision will only affect Coronation Hill if and when it becomes Aboriginal land. I expressly state this, as the intended effect of this provision has been misrepresented. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the payment of mining royalty equivalents into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account, subsection 63 (3) of the Act is dependent for its operation on the provisions of the former Mining Act of the Northern Territory. However, the Mineral Royalty Act now sets the amount of mining royalties for hard rock minerals and has changed the system from an ad valorem to a profits based royalty system. Subsection 63 (3) will be amended so that it can now function within the new royalty regime operating in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a provision to allow Aboriginal people to have access over alienated land where that is necessary for access to their land described in the schedule. There is a provision which will allow for the modification by regulation of the boundaries of areas granted under the new parts to schedule 1. This power is provided to allow for minor correction of descriptions of the land where further survey or other evidence suggests that the boundaries have not been accurately described. The provision is not intended to permit major changes to the area of land to be granted and the power will not be available after the land has actually been granted. There are a number of other amendments of a miscellaneous nature which are more particularly set out in the Bill and the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, together with the yet to be enacted Northern Territory legislation, provides some measure of justice for deprived groups of Aboriginal people which is long overdue. I regard these proposals to provide land for Aboriginal people as one of the most important achievements in my time as Minister. I wish to thank the Prime Minister and my party colleagues for their support and assistance throughout this process and also to express my appreciation to the officers of both the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Northern Territory Government and officers of the Northern and Central Land Councils. I hope this agreement heralds a new era of cooperation between our governments which can only lead to benefits for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Territorians. I commend the Bill to the House, and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During debate last night on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill and the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill I pointed out that the Government was not fair dinkum in respect of this legislation. The major purpose of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to exempt those paper products made exclusively from recycled paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I claim that the Government is not fair dinkum in bringing forward this proposition, and I do so for two reasons. Firstly, the total amount of revenue forgone by the Government in respect of this measure will amount, in the Government's own estimation, to less than $500,000 in a full year. So, for the Government to bring forward a proposition which in its own estimation will encourage the recycling of paper but will cost the Government in sales tax revenue forgone less than $500,000 in a full year is simply not fair dinkum. Secondly, the Government is not being fair dinkum in encouraging the recycling of paper because the sales tax exemption will apply only if all the paper in the product has been manufactured from recycled paper. That is simply not possible and I will give technical reasons why in a few minutes. It is my claim, as I said in my contribution last night, that this legislation is brought forward only as a sop to the conservation movement and in the hope that the Australian Labor Party will attract the radical conservation movement. </PARA>
<PARA> During debate last night the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) came into the House with a bundle of envelopes and claimed that envelopes could be produced from recycled paper. In a moment I will explain the technical reason why that is not possible and point out in that explanation why this legislation is such a sop. As I said, I will explain why it is technically not feasible to achieve the Government's aim by bringing forward this sales tax exemption legislation. First, I will tell the House of my qualifications. During an earlier part of my career I worked for over six years in a paper manufacturing plant and, therefore, I claim to have more technical expertise in the production of paper than any other member in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dunkley claimed that envelopes could be made from recycled paper. Technically, that is not possible. One of the major specifications for an envelope is high tensile strength. In other words, the envelopes should be strong enough to stand up to the buffeting to which they are subjected during their life cycle. That is a major specification. If that is not the case, the paper in the envelopes will simply break down under the heavy buffeting to which they are subjected and will tear apart, and their contents will be laid open. Obviously that is unacceptable when looking at the specifications for an envelope. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain why recycled paper cannot produce the high tensile strength that is a necessary specification for envelopes or, for that matter, for many other paper products. During the pulping process it is necessary to separate the fibres of the wood product, but tensile strength is obtained by having the fibres bind themselves together. That binding together is what produces the tensile strength. During the pulping process the fibres themselves are damaged, and that damage reduces their capacity to bind themselves together. Therefore, the more pulping the fibres are subjected to, the less capacity the fibres have to bind together. The damage to the fibres can be minimised during the initial pulping process so that we can still produce paper that has high tensile strength and the specifications required by end users. However, the more pulping the fibres are subjected to, the less capacity they have to bind themselves together and, therefore, the less tensile strength there is in the end product. </PARA>
<PARA> The tensile strength of an envelope produced in the binding process using only recycled paper-in other words, paper that has gone through the pulping process once, twice or repeatedly-would be so low that the thickness of the envelope would have to be three to four times greater than the envelopes we have at present. In other words, they would be like a package and not like an envelope. If they were not, they would simply fall to pieces. The same applies to any sheet of paper, be it newsprint or typing paper, produced using only recycled paper. Because of that technical requirement, a proportion of recycled fibre is mixed with new fibre in the manufacturing process. Therefore, we can use recycled fibre in the manufacturing process but only if it is combined with new fibre, new wood product, and still produce a high tensile strength product. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what happens. In fact, it happens in respect of over 50 per cent of the paper that is produced in Australia. Fifty per cent of all paper produced in Australia goes back into the recycling or manufacturing process. That is happening now. However, it is not technically possible, because of the technical requirements of the paper product itself, to produce in any great quantity a product that is made wholly from recycled paper. That is why I claim that this measure is nothing more than a sop to the conservation movement, and the Government--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3F4">Mr BURR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sham, as my colleague says. As I said to the House last night, the only paper products I can think of that are made wholly from recycled paper and from nothing else are, firstly, egg cartons and, secondly, household insulation. The Government is offering a so-called sales tax exemption and claiming that it is part of its environmental package, but it applies to only a very small range of products. Obviously it will cost the Government in tax revenue forgone less than $500,000 in a full year. I claim that at present over 50 per cent of all the paper produced in Australia goes back into recycled paper. Much of it is being used in downgrade quality products such as cardboard where high tensile strength is not a major specification. Much of it goes into the manufacture of cardboard, but it is being recycled and going back into product. Over 50 per cent is not going back into the recycling process. If the Government were fair dinkum about wanting to get that other 50 per cent back into the recycling process and therefore making better use of the resources available in Australia it would try to encourage more of the paper product to be collected and brought back into the recycling process. The other 50 per cent that is not presently going into recycling ends up on the tip. Somewhere in Australia it ends up on a tip to be burnt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I pointed out to the House last night, there are many charitable organisations in Australia that will collect paper for recycling as a method of raising funds. Organisations such as the Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides Association of Australia and many of the sheltered workshops collect paper for recycling. Much more would be collected if it were possible to get that back into the system. The major inhibiting factor is not the capacity or the preparedness of those charitable organisations to collect paper for recycling, nor is it the preparedness of the Australian people to offer that paper for recycling. The major inhibiting factor is not the sales tax that may be applied to a product that is manufactured from recycled paper but the cost of transporting that recycled paper from the point of collection to the point of manufacture. In many cases the cost of transporting that product from the point of collection to the point of manufacture is greater than the value of the product itself. It is because of the transport costs that a considerable quantity of raw material is not collected for recycling. </PARA>
<PARA> If my friends on the other side of the House were fair dinkum about encouraging more paper to go into the recycling process rather than coming forward with a sop of a Bill such as is produced here-a sham of a Bill, as my colleague has described it-they would come forward with a fair dinkum proposal that would reduce the cost of transporting goods in Australia. That would be a far more effective way of encouraging the better use of resources in Australia. As I said to the House last night, not only is the potential for recycling products and resources being inhibited because of the cost of transport but also, naturally, it is having a much greater and broader effect across the whole of the manufacturing and productive industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to take up any more time of the House. I charge the Government with not being fair dinkum with this measure. Trying to make better use of our resources and to have more material reused and recycled in Australia is a laudable objective, but I do not believe that the Government is fair dinkum in bringing forward this measure because the effect of it will apply only to those products that use recycled paper in the manufacturing process. The range of products made from such a procedure is so limited that it simply will not have the widespread effect it should have. On that basis I hope that the Government will take this Bill back and redraft it to have a far wider effect and to genuinely encourage the recycling of not only paper products but also, many other products that have the potential for recycling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to support the second reading of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill and the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill and to oppose the amendment. I have heard the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) and I want to deal later with a couple of issues he addressed. They concerned application, and I wish to make a couple of suggestions there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to focus on some other aspects of the legislation. There are two that I find particularly attractive. The first one relates to this change in the threshold tax level for small manufacturers. What has happened is that the Government has decided to raise the threshold tax level for small manufacturers from $12,000 to $50,000. The lifting of the tax threshold means that those small manufacturers will be exempt from paying tax. That is a very sensible move. It is one that I know many small businesses in my area in the Osborne Park and Balcatta business centre welcome because it deals specifically with concerns that they have raised with me. </PARA>
<PARA> This lifting of the tax threshold is very important. I can deal in specific terms with what it would mean but one clear aspect is that it minimises some tax and record keeping obligations for manufacturers, aside from the improved market position of having that exemption threshold raised. That is very sensible. I might add, incidentally, in the context of this debate that this sort of move in responding to the community is one that we have tried to pursue in relation to a number of tax matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of this legislation that I want to talk about is the question of goods that are being used by a subcontractor when that subcontractor is working specifically for a manufacturer. Quite clearly, the intention is not to impose a sales tax until a good is in its final state of reaching the marketplace. Quite clearly, if a subcontractor is working for a major manufacturer-again, I have many major manufacturers in my electorate of Stirling-it would be silly to impose a tax upon materials that are being used in that factory when those materials are not end products, they are merely transitional products. If we think about it in terms of the operation of a factory when a subcontractor is called in to do particular work-whether it be insulation work, electrical work, air conditioning or other activities that are going on in the factory-to impose a sales tax when that work is specifically going towards activities within the factory is a quite unusual arrangement. This is a more sensible arrangement because it means that a manufacturer can now employ a subcontractor provided-I give this qualification-that all of those goods are being used in that manufacturer's activity. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to be careful about the question of loopholes here. It is important to emphasise to people who might be listening to this debate that there is the requirement that those materials being used are wholly for the work carried out within the factory. At one stage I was working for CSR Ltd, and I was interested in the number of small subcontractors who were doing maintenance and repair work for CSR. The application of this provision to them is quite significant, as it is for many manufacturers. I would add the qualification that it is important that goods that are being used are used wholly within that maintenance process-if I can use that term-or management process of the factory and that there are no loopholes in that. There are appropriate record-keeping and tracing arrangements to ensure that the legislation will be adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two points together represent a significant gain for small and medium businesses. I believe that they are important reforms in the context of this Government. When we look at the behaviour of business and the impact that tax can have upon business, I have a concern that business is often weighed down with excessive record keeping and excessive complications in the tax law. We have to have a long term policy of trying to minimise the amount of record keeping and the application of tax law to small business. We can do that only if we remove some of the anomalies and the difficulties in tax application. There are two examples that I can think of. We can go down that track of improving the application and administration of tax law only if we also get cooperation and compliance with tax law. Unfortunately, in the past there was a tendency to try to avoid application of tax law, but I believe that through sensible administration of tax law we have a much higher rate of compliance. I could talk about the prescribed payments system but that is outside this legislation. In fact, it would be foreshadowing something that we may well be dealing with in the House shortly. It is important to say that when we improve the compliance level in tax law, we can begin to minimise the application and the record keeping requirements. But one has to precede the other. It is important to emphasise that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have many debates with business people about tax laws and I say to them, `I agree with you that, in terms of the efficient operation of business, it is important to minimise the amount of record keeping required and it is also important to minimise the incidence of tax law to the extent to which it may interfere with the productive activity of business. But you can only do that if you are assured on behalf of the general public that there is compliance with tax laws. Once you are assured of that, you can proceed to minimise the applications'. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole thrust of this Government's deregulation strategy has been to try to do those things sensibly. It will always be a matter for judgment, and it will always be a matter for professional advice from the Taxation Office and also from accountants and business people. In the context of this debate, I would say that this Government is aware of that and is aware of the general role that the Government can play. These two elements in relation to this sales tax amendment are very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move to the other matter, which was being dealt with by the honourable member for Lyons, and that is the question of sales tax exemption on recycled paper. I heard what the honourable member for Lyons said about the tensile strength of paper and about the difference between original paper and recycled paper. At the outset, I make the observation that it is possible to use recycled paper products in high volume. The honourable member for Lyons referred to egg carton and cardboard manufacture. I set those aside because there is agreement on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The letterheads used in my office are made from 100 per cent recycled paper. The quality is good and the tensile strength is sufficient for it to go through the rollers of a photocopier where it is stretched. It is reasonably good paper. I am not unhappy with it. In fact, many of my electors have said that they are pleased I am using recycled paper. I take the point of the honourable member for Lyons that envelopes made out of recycled paper are not available in the marketplace, but certainly letterhead quality paper is available. I find it is quite sufficient in terms of standard and I think that members of parliament should be setting the standards for the community by saying that we, too, can play a part. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a big change, a sea change, concerning this notion of environmental decay and public concern about the environment. Governments are responding to that change. A number of us have been aware for a long time about the importance of environmental management. There will not be a revolution overnight about the change in the treatment of recycled paper. That is understood. Very clearly there will be a continuing market demand for fine, white paper products. That is understood in this place. That is all right provided people understand the cost of those white paper products. We know that, in this legislation, we are making the right sort of decision. It would be foolish to stand in this place and say that the Government has an environmental policy but that it will not give any incentive to people to use recycled paper. It would be foolish of the Government not to offer incentives, and that is what this legislation is about. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that people can use recycled paper products. I am already doing so. Rather than receiving criticism from the electorate, I have had praise because I am doing the sensible thing. I admit that, for some products currently in use, the recycled materials are not of sufficiently high quality or there is insufficient market demand for such a recycled product. But we have to start somewhere and the Government is starting with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lyons made some sensible comments about transport. That raises another issue. As governments-the Federal Government, the State governments, and local government-we need to look at how we can assist in the recycling process. One good example is the recycling of freon gas which is used in car air-conditioners and refrigerators. The Government must provide tax incentives for people, both manufacturers and consumers, who choose to use recycled freon gas. It is a great shame that when a refrigerator has come to the end of its useful life and the seals on the door have perished and the handle has broken off, the freon gas is not retained. People dispose of old refrigerators and the freon gas is emitted into the atmosphere when the refrigerator is crushed up. The Government should be looking at providing an incentive for people to collect the freon gas and for consumers who use recycled freon gas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should be providing an incentive to manufacturers to protect a car air-conditioning unit so that, in front end collisions, the car air-conditioning plant does not fracture. It is alarming, when driving along a street, to see signs reading, `Top up your air-conditioning unit'. That means that freon gas has been emitted into the atmosphere either because the seals on the air-conditioning unit are loose or the pipes have been fractured in small collisions. I come from a State where 40 degrees centigrade is common in the summer months and people require air-conditioning. Manufacturers and motorists should consider the price being paid for air-conditioned comfort. I speak in terms not of the current market price but of the real social price. That matter should be addressed. Apart from the actual purchasing price, the social costs are that there is not in place an efficient and economically sensible recycling arrangement, and the manufacturing system does not protect the car air-conditioning unit properly. The Government can move in that direction but, very often, to do it, governments have to provide a tax incentive and the education process, which is clearly what we are debating. </PARA>
<PARA> They are simply examples of what can be done if we are determined enough to go down that track. Governments, particularly the Federal Government, must show that they are serious about the environment and about recycling. What better way is there than starting with paper products which are commonly used? A good deal could be done in terms of encouraging the effective recycling of freon gas used in car air-conditioners and refrigerators. A good deal could be done by offering tax incentives to those who choose to recycle and choose to use recycled products. I refer to the manufacturer and wholesaler as well as the consumer. This legislation gives a lead by removing sales tax on recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that this product can be used. My letterheads in my electorate office are made from recycled paper. I am very happy with the product. It is not the fine, white paper that people press for in certain circumstances. But why should we let advertisers determine our destiny as we often do? Quite often we allow the advertisers to tell us that we should not use paper unless it is absolutely white. I refute that claim out of hand because we have to consider the cost of producing fine white paper. When I look round the chamber, it is a great source of dismay to me to see the quantity of paper wasted. It is nice to know that much of it is being recycled. It is very fine paper that is being used. </PARA>

That is absolutely right, but it is also a place in which we need information. We ought to think seriously about making a contribution to this effort by saying that there is nothing incompatible with having small screens in our desks. Incidentally, the cabling is already in place. We had to apply some pressure to get that because some people-possibly the architects; they have many sins for which they are responsible-resisted the idea of installing the cabling to enable us to have small screens in our desks. It would be sensible to provide the screens because Hansard is already on line, through the Library service, and it is an excellent service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. We could call those up and get rid of the hard copy. My colleagues are equally sensible on this, but why have we not done something? The reason is that the thinking that has dominated this matter is out of date. Incidentally, the same dopey, out-of-date thinking put stairs in the dining room of our Parliament House. We ought to get smart about this. The phrase I use is that one should never let architects loose on the inside of a building or even the shell of a building. But I do not know whether they were responsible. However, the thinking that requires us to walk around with hard copy instead of having a screen that enables us to call up material is bad thinking. If we could call up information on the screen, we would not have to use any paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I have walked in with the second reading speeches on three Bills and the Budget statements, which would also be on line because they are incorporated in Hansard. I also have yesterday's debate on this legislation. All of it could quite sensibly be on screen and we could have eliminated that paper demand. It would not do away with the jobs of our colleagues in Hansard. It would not do away with the Opposition's access to information. It would improve the access. I say to my colleagues in the Parliament that there is a lot of interest in doing something about calling up information on screen. We could easily do that. It would make a great difference, and it would support the general thrust of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that this legislation is in place. But what does it mean in terms of what is happening locally? I heard the honourable member for Lyons say something about transport costs. One of the difficulties at the moment is that we have a bottleneck. The amount of public offering of recycled paper is considerable. I hope that colleagues will do what we do in my office, that is, shred most of our material and try to package it ready for collection for recycling. The difficulty is that the amount of recycled paper being provided is exceeding the current demand for it, which is why it is important to remove the sales tax. Incidentally, I give out information to my local community. I compliment my local authority, the Stirling City Council, which provides a lot of information on where newspapers can be recycled. It also has a house to house collection service for recycled paper. It plays a substantial role for which it is to be commended. The City of Stirling has recycling locations in Balcatta, Carine, Doubleview, Innaloo, Joondanna, Maylands, Osborne Park, Scarborough, another in Scarborough and Yokine. It also supports a house to house collection service; it is done by the Australian Mutual Provident Society but the Council supports that thrust. So a lot is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard the remarks of colleagues in this debate. We have to work this issue through. It is not the sort of issue on which we should hammer away as in a party political debate. We are talking about a matter on which we have shown a sensible initiative in removing the sales tax. I point out to colleagues that they can use recycled paper products; I currently do. I say to the community in general, `For goodness sake, do not be confused by the advertisers. We have to reject the same line that they use in relation to toilet paper-that if it is not very white it is not very good.' Certain advertisers have a clear interest in creating a market expectation. If we can get the public to think differently, I am sure we can get them to increase their demand for recycled products. This legislation will play its part. Accordingly, I am pleased to support the legislation and to oppose the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), in this debate I want to address my remarks to the issue of the sales tax exemption for recycled paper. Other speakers from this side of the House have made it clear that the coalition supports this initiative by the Government in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2). We do so with a sense of pride really because over a year ago we announced the coalition's environment policy in which we proposed precisely this measure. It has taken the Government a year to pick up the initiative from this side of the House. I am glad that it has picked it up and I make no partisan comment about that. When the Opposition makes constructive suggestions and the Government takes them up, we see one further aspect of our parliamentary system truly working, and working well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, this Government initiative came out of the environment statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 20 July 1989. I must say that that statement and many of the initiatives in it, including this one, seem to have more to do with winning the preferences of the Green movement at the forthcoming Federal election than with any broader commitment to improving our environment. I give an example of where the Government on the one hand is reducing, or getting rid of, the sales tax on recycled paper but on the other hand is taking away similar sorts of sales tax exemptions for other environmentally friendly initiatives. I received a letter recently from Mr Brian Esselbach, the President of the South Australian Soft Drink Association Inc, who drew my attention to the fact that since 1 September the Federal Government has removed an exemption which encouraged the use of refillable bottles by beverage manufacturers. The South Australian Soft Drink Association has pointed out that previously the cost of recovering and refilling the bottle designed for multifilling was exempt from the calculation for sales tax on the product. The Government has taken away that exemption. It is interesting to note that the cost to a big soft drink manufacturer such as Coca-Cola Bottlers in Adelaide is about $400,000 a year. That initiative discourages the practice of recycling bottles-not paper in this case. That does not sit comfortably with this initiative by the Government to take away the sales tax on recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason is that the issue of recycling bottles has apparently had a lesser public profile than the issue of recycling paper. If that is the case, and if that is the only basis for a government making one decision heading in one direction and another decision heading in another direction, any fair-minded person-not just a party politician-would conclude that the initiative of the Government is a cynical one. I wish that governments generally, especially the Federal Government, would be more sincere in their approach to environmental issues, look at the merits and the demerits of different propositions and try to work out what are the best social and economic answers to the conundrums with which we are faced. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will know, many emotional arguments are put forward-I have heard many an emotional argument put forward in this debate-in favour of certain so-called environmentally friendly initiatives without very much serious analysis of the social and economic benefits and disbenefits of those initiatives. We need to establish first and foremost in this debate whether the recycling of paper is worth while. Obviously, to some extent the recycling of paper is deemed to be worth while because a fair amount of it takes place in Australia already. In other words, there is an existing economic incentive to recycle some paper. What the Government is proposing in this legislation is that that economic incentive, or the economic circumstances that currently exist, should be enhanced by a sales tax exemption to act as a further incentive to encourage the practice of recycling paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the basic argument here is that the optimum level of recycling occurs where the net social benefit is maximised. That must be axiomatic. The maximisation of the net social benefit does not necessarily occur at the same point as the greatest degree of profitability that can occur for industry through a recycling operation. What I am really saying is that industry costs perhaps do not reflect all social costs. That is one of the arguments I often use in the whole environmental debate. Our advanced Western capitalist economy works basically on the basis of maximising benefits and minimising costs through the operation of the market system, which is as it should be, but in some areas, particularly in the areas of the environment, social costs are not properly measured and incorporated into the market mechanism. Where those social costs are not properly incorporated, there is a basis for government taking some action, such as the action being taken here in providing what by some arguments is an unlevel playing field, giving recycled paper an exemption when such exemption does not exist for other sorts of paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that we have to ask ourselves whether recycling of paper is fundamentally a good thing. In other words, overall, will the social advantages as well as the economic advantages of recycling paper outweigh the costs? I suggest that there are about five different reasons why the recycling of paper is on balance a positive initiative, although some negatives come out of it. First of all, it is argued that we will save forest resources by recycling paper. That must surely be the case. That may not matter if those forests are not native forests, and if they are plantations, they can simply be replanted after the wood has been used. But, of course, some very severe long-term environmental costs occur to society through the depletion of native forests. Only between 15 and 20 per cent of paper manufactured in Australia-much of our paper is actually imported-comes from native forests, so between 80 and 85 per cent comes from plantations. </PARA>
<PARA> But the depletion of those native forests I think imposes a very high social cost which is not easy to measure in simple financial terms. It imposes costs on fauna, on water catchment areas and on soils because of the soil degradation that may occur. It depends how responsible forestry practices are. The depletion of native forests also imposes an aesthetic cost because the loss of those forests leads to a loss of some natural beauty. So, clearly, a cost is involved in depleting native forests which are used for the production of paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument in favour of recycling is that through recycling we can avoid some of the water pollution which occurs from the processing of wood in order to create paper. The third advantage is that we can achieve lower energy costs through recycling. Clearly through the achievement of lower energy costs we are moving towards maximising economic efficiency. Fourthly, through the practice of recycling we can avoid the disposal costs of wastepaper, and I will come back to that issue a bit later. Finally, through the practice of recycling we can make a contribution to improving Australia's trade balance. After all, much of the paper that is currently used in Australia is imported. If we can recycle paper rather than have greater imports being drawn into the country, there is an obvious advantage to the trade balance. Australia also exports some waste paper which is used for recycling purposes. So maybe another way we can help to contribute towards our trade balance is by expanding that sort of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget, though, that through the process of recycling paper there are some disbenefits. The issue of waste paper collection costs is not one that should be ignored. Substantial costs are involved with the collection of waste paper and, at the moment, those costs are not properly recognised in our pricing structure. But collection does impose substantial costs and therefore a redistribution of scarce economic resources away from some sectors of the economy. We should not overlook that. Also, the practice of recycling involves some water pollution, just as the manufacture of ordinary paper involves some pollution of waterways. In particular, the process of de-inking can seriously contribute to water pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> So when we look at the whole practice of the recycling of paper we see that there are costs and there are benefits. My argument today is that those costs and benefits need to be reflected properly in the market price of these operations. At present many particular costs are not properly reflected in the market price that we charge for paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just have a look at three things that are not properly included in the market price. We do not include the depletion of forest resources-in particular, native forest resources-and I have mentioned already some of the costs associated with that. We do not include the full cost of water pollution that comes about from the manufacture of paper. For example, we do not properly recover from the manufacturer the costs that the manufacturer imposes, for example, on downstream water users. The cost of cleaning up that pollution is generally borne by the broader community and not by the polluter himself; therefore, that cost is not reflected in the costs for the purchaser of ordinary, newly created paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we do not reflect properly the disposal costs of waste paper in our society. For many people just throwing away paper is really costless. I suppose everybody thinks that the throwing away of paper is costless. In reality, it is not costless because thousands upon thousands of tonnes of paper have to be disposed of every day. Disposing of that paper is a very expensive business and the general taxpayer ends up picking up the bill. In the case of local government, the ratepayer might well be the person who ends up picking up the very hefty bill for the disposal of that waste paper. So in the practice of purchasing ordinary new paper, as distinct from recycled paper, those three costs are not included. In a sense, people are getting non-recycled paper-new paper, if you like-on the cheap because the cost of forest resources, the cost of water pollution and the cost of the disposal of waste paper are simply not included in that process. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see that the Australian Environment Council in its report of, I think, last year picked up similar points to these. It recommended what I thought were some fairly radical solutions to these problems which, in a sense, would have created a level playing field for the practice of recycling paper-a level playing field brought about by incorporating costs which are currently not incorporated in the price of new paper. It argued for a marriage of economic rationalism and environmental conservation. I think a lot more work needs to be done on that proposition and a lot more thought needs to be given to it by honourable members on both sides of this Parliament. But the Australian Environment Council argued for a very respectable proposition-that we ought to move more in the direction of the user and the polluter paying. I think in many respects I have probably covered how that could work in the context of the recycling of paper as against the use of new paper. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties that the Australian Environment Council has alerted us all to is the difficulty of defining the exact value of the environment, particularly if we are to assess in some way the costs associated with the depletion of native forest resources. I think that will be one of the important challenges that the Resource Assessment Commission will have to pick up very soon because those issues arise in many environmental debates, not just in the area of the use of paper. Some formula will have to be found in the years ahead for defining the exact value of environmental resources, of natural resources. I have been interested to see that in the United Kingdom the new British Secretary of State for the Environment has commissioned some work on that exact issue. I think here in Australia we ought to do a lot more work than we are doing on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has actually taken a very arbitrary measure-it is only a notional measure-of the value of the environment and the costs, if you like, to the environment of using new paper. I suppose that we can measure the arbitrary value that the Government has taken, in terms of lost revenue, through this measure. I apologise for not knowing precisely what that figure is. It is probably in the legislation somewhere, but I have forgotten to look it up. But the Government has gone for the sales tax solution as an alternative; a very rough and ready, arbitrary, and economically irrational alternative. Consequently, different ways of encouraging the practice of recycling and different ways of assessing social costs as well as ordinary commercial costs need to be developed by the Resource Assessment Commission and by the Parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Environment Council recommended a number of other ways in which a government could allocate costs fairly arbitrarily. It recommended that the Government could encourage collection schemes for higher quality waste paper. I think there is a great deal to be said for that, although it is easier said than done. Incentives would have to be given to people to provide waste paper for those collection schemes. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) pointed out how local government can contribute to that by facilitating collection schemes and perhaps more ought to be done in that area. The Australian Environment Council also recommended that the Government alter its own demand for high quality paper which can be more easily recycled than a low quality product. Again, that is something that the Government itself needs to examine much more carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this piece of legislation can be commended. It takes up an initiative of the Opposition and I am very glad that the Government has done that. But I think a great deal more work needs to be done on relating economic rationalism to conservation. The recycling of paper is a perfectly good example of this. I must say that I am getting sick and tired of hearing people in the community in general-certainly not just politicians-saying that recycling is just a good thing. Without looking at all the costs involved, they say it is a good thing and that is the end of the debate. As a matter of fact, that reflects something that I know the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) would agree with-that we are a fairly scientifically illiterate society. People are not prepared to try to understand the true costs and true benefits probably because they have not been given the opportunities to learn those things through our education system. The declining number of people taking up science in schools and tertiary institutions is only compounding the problem of a scientifically illiterate society. If I, for that matter, were a little more literate scientifically, I would have a much greater capacity to understand the degree to which we should move towards the recycling of paper and thousands upon thousands of other similar things. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to make the same point that I made at the beginning of my speech, that I think this piece of legislation has been introduced only for political purposes. It is not part of a broader contemplation of ways of improving our environment because it bears no rational relationship to other things that the Government has done. If, on the one hand, the Government can discourage, through changes to sales tax, the use of refillable bottles and, on the other hand, encourage the recycling of paper in another piece of legislation, it is clearly not thinking things through properly and in a coherent way. I hope in the months and years ahead that we will see the new Peacock Government and State governments contemplating these matters in a coherent and rational way, that we will work towards trying to establish true costs, including environmental costs, and that we will ensure through economically rational practices that we are able to conserve our environment better than we can at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to rise in this debate to support the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and cognate Bills which are now before the House. There has been some debate already about the detail of these Bills. I note that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) commented in some detail on the sales tax exemption that we are providing in this legislation for recycled paper. I want to place on record my view that I think the Government has taken a very sound decision which will tend to encourage the use of 100 per cent recycled paper. Because there will be some price advantage in the market place, this decision may tend to discourage the consumption of new virgin fibre in the manufacture of paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept part of the hypothesis advanced by the honourable member for Mayo that there is a need for additional work to be undertaken by government in this whole area of recycling. I hope that in the next few months it will be possible to put together a comprehensive strategy which will, over time, ensure that we recognise the value of recycled products in our community. I am not sure that a more rational economic system is the way to go. But I concede that more needs to be done in this area if the community is to have a better understanding of the relative costs and merits of using recycled products as against new products. </PARA>
<PARA> Put simply, the legislation gives effect to the commitment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the July environment statement to reduce the rate of sales tax on recycled paper from 20 per cent to zero. I must say that that exceedingly comprehensive environment statement traversed a whole range of environmental matters that affect the way in which we live and work in Australia. It covered matters such as land care programs and soil conservation, which we describe as the biggest single problem facing Australia in the 1990s. The statement recommended, among other things, a decade of land care. I know that that aspect of the statement has been very warmly welcomed in my electorate of Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say that the decision to eliminate sales tax on 100 per cent recycled paper has also been very warmly greeted in my electorate of Bendigo. Over the last few months I have had a large number of representations from schools in my electorate inquiring about this policy commitment and asking when it will come into effect. Over the years I have taken a great deal of interest in the work of Sandhurst Enterprises, a local industry which is now the largest recycler of waste products in Bendigo. This firm is now recycling in excess of 20 tonnes of waste paper a year. I am very pleased to see the way in which it has expanded and the many employment opportunities in Bendigo that have been created. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there has been a change in the consumer ethic in the community. Generally, consumers are now keen to use a product which can be economically recycled and which, in the longer term, will be better for our environment. There is a greater concern about environmental issues. In that sense, members of this House would note, again with some pleasure, that the largest single mass distribution newspaper in Australia today, Age Pension News, which is sent to every aged pensioner and war veteran in Australia, is now printed on 100 per cent recycled paper. That is very much a step in the right direction. It is still a quality product and the change has been received very well in my electorate. I have received a very positive feedback on the fact that it is printed on recycled paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess with a lot of speculation around about when the next Federal election will be held in the next eight months, the question--(Quorum formed) I was talking about the impeccable record of this Government in the environment area. I was referring to that part of the legislation which eliminates the 20 per cent sales tax on fully recycled paper. As has been said previously in this debate, the exemption will apply to a wide range of paper products, including writing, drawing or printing paper that is blank, incorporated printed guidelines, a trade mark, logo, letterhead, or similar matter. It will also apply to envelopes. Contrary to the comments made by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), it is possible to buy envelopes made from recycled paper. Although not many are on the market yet, I understand that more envelopes made from recycled paper will appear in future. Other exemptions in the legislation apply to toilet and facial tissues and paper bags for use by householders and retailers. So it is very sensible legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I was interrupted by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) calling a quorum, I had said that an election is due in the next six or nine months. Over the last few years a number of people have suggested that the Parliament should seriously look at how-to-vote cards. Normally in Federal elections people representing the different political parties stand outside polling booths and hand out how-to-vote cards to everyone who turns up to vote. On average, one how-to-vote card has to be printed for every voter. Therefore, on any election day in Australia 10 million how-to-vote cards are printed and used. I believe that in the next parliament-probably it is not something that can be undertaken in the run-up to the election-an environment committee or select committee of that parliament should carefully examine the role of how-to-vote cards and whether for every general election we need to print up to 10 million of those cards to hand them to people so they know how to vote. In round terms, there are 10 million cards for each political party. Bearing in mind that the major party in Australia, the Australian Labor Party; the minor parties, the Liberal and National parties, and the other parties, the Australian Democrats--</PARA>

<PARA> My final comment about the exemption of sales tax on recycled paper product is the general one of how it ties into environmental programs. I noticed earlier this week that thousands of people have signed the one world petition. The terms of the petition will be included in Hansard. In my electorate, 380 to 400 people signed the petition in support of the one world campaign. Basically that is a campaign of interested, committed, Australians who are concerned that we ensure that the world is sustainable both economically and environmentally. Obviously, providing incentives for people to consume recycled paper products is an important element of that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the legislation will increase the small manufacturer exemption thresholds of sales tax. That initiative will be of great benefit to my electorate. It will be of particular benefit to a large number of small industries, particularly potteries and craft shops, which are vital to the tourist trade throughout central Victoria and which enjoy such a fine reputation for producing products of real quality. In the past, goods manufactured by small manufacturers were exempt from sales tax only where the manufacturer's average annual sales were $12,000 or less or where the manufacturer's sales tax liability was $250 or less per annum. The legislation before the House will increase the exemption thresholds to $50,000 per annum in average annual sales or $1,000 per annum in sales tax liability. When I was first elected to this Parliament in 1983 I received a number of representations from small potters and craft shops in my electorate which were concerned about that limit. I concede that it has taken some time for an amendment to be made to the Act but I know, from my communications with those people in my electorate, that they very much welcome the changes being introduced in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the sales tax on flavoured milk drinks, over recent months I have received, as the Federal member for Bendigo, a number of representations, particularly from canteen managers. I note that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who is in the chamber, indicates that he too has received representations. I suggest that perhaps a national campaign is being organised by a particular group which is inspiring canteen managers and schools to complain about the level of sales tax which applies on flavoured milk. The level of sales tax applying to most flavoured milk products is only 10 per cent. The rate of sales tax applied to most other flavoured, sweetened or coloured non-alcoholic drinks is 20 per cent. The point that needs to be emphasised-I have made it to canteen managers-is that the present sales tax rate of 10 per cent on flavoured milk products is already a concessionary rate. Moreover, the letters that I have received from canteen managers have lauded the nutritional value of milk. What I have also been able to point out to those canteen managers is that because the Government recognises that, whole milk is totally tax-exempt in Australia. No sales tax applies to pure milk which is sold in school canteens or tuck shops. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament-because this legislation is supported by the Opposition-has a commitment to ensure that young people are not denied access to a nutritious product. No sales tax is payable on a 100 per cent milk product. Sales tax is payable on flavoured milk at only 10 per cent. As I said, that compares with 20 per cent for most other milk products. In this Bill before the House we are reducing the minimum milk content requirement of flavoured milk from 95 per cent to 90 per cent. So the vast majority of flavoured milks on the market will now qualify for that 10 per cent concessional tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make one last general comment about sales tax. Just before I came to speak in this debate I was presented with a submission from the National Farmers Federation (NFF) in which it proposed the introduction of a broad-based goods and services tax to replace the wholesale sales tax regime. The Federation suggests that it would replace the wholesale sales tax base as its stands at the moment and the whole excise tax base as it stands at the moment. It would also replace customs duties and certain tariffs. If one does the sums in the existing Budget Papers for 1988-89 one finds that about $20 billion of total government revenue of $82 billion-in other words, around one-quarter; $1 in every $4-is raised from these taxes: from sales taxes at the wholesale level, from excise and from customs duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The NFF is proposing a broad-based goods and services tax to replace that revenue base of $20 billion. It has said that it thinks the rate would be around 10 per cent, but the calculations I have done suggest that, if $20 billion of the general revenue base were to be replaced with a straight tax on goods and services, the rate would in fact be much closer to 20 per cent than 10 per cent. This would mean that the tax on many goods, and therefore the price, would rise considerably. This is very relevant to this debate as I have been discussing matters such as the tax rate on flavoured milk and recycled paper. Of course, under a broad-based consumption tax-a goods and services tax such as the NFF is proposing-all of those items would be taxed at a rate of around 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The NFF has made a valuable contribution to economic debate but I cannot support its proposal for a broad-based goods and services tax because, on my calculations, it would mean a general rate of around 20 per cent applying to every good and service produced in Australia. That rate is too high. I think the existing wholesale sales tax system we have in place is sensible because it is possible for government to make changes and to change consumption patterns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sales tax is an area of considerable concern in the community. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), made some remarks regarding the sort of burden it imposes. As he said, the Budget Papers reveal that tax collections amount to, if we take into account other fees, nearly $26 billion in various forms of consumption taxes or taxes that are not upfront; I call them taxes by stealth. Of course, I have always been of the view that, whoever is in government, such taxes should be much more easily identified. I would welcome every service station in the country having to advertise fuel at 20c a litre plus tax. This occurs in the United States of America, where consumption tax laws are very explicit. Places such as Disneyland and Disneyworld are at pains to advise the tax component of what is being spent. I am sure it is a great discipline on politicians. The consumption tax area is a mechanism for much larger government spending because it is hidden taxation, particularly as practised in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved an amendment to this legislation which simply and quite correctly complains about the massive growth of sales tax under this Government. We are under no illusions at all that the incumbent Treasurer (Mr Keating) is the biggest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history. He has managed to double not only the sales tax-the hidden tax-but all tax collections during his term in office. Tax collections were at about $44 billion in the last Fraser Budget. Of course, they now total nearly $96 billion. It is interesting to note that pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers are now paying $41 billion in taxation. The total tax collections in the last Fraser Budget were about that amount. So under the world's best Treasurer, PAYE taxpayers collectively are paying as much tax-and their numbers certainly have not doubled-as the entire tax system delivered in the last Fraser Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, a few aspects of this legislation will slightly reduce tax collections, and I welcome them. The Government followed the initiative of the coalition, which announced prior to the world's greatest environmental statement that it would include in its policy a provision to remove sales tax on recyclable paper. The Government, which was still struggling with this decision, has now followed our initiative and has put it in the world's greatest environmental statement. Recycling is to be encouraged at every level for economic as well as environmental reasons. I would like honourable members to think for a minute, in relation to recycling, of the mix of the economy and the environment that so frequently is either ignored or separated by people. Australians cannot maintain their current standard of living unless they develop environmentally acceptable industries. They have to use the resources available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a stupid situation where this Government still allows the export of woodchip because it has not discovered the means by which that woodchip can be turned into paper, thus providing the community with all its value added benefits. The Government's solution is to put up the barricades and stop the projects that have been offered to us because it does not know how to fix the problems. The argument has raged-other countries have not accepted it-that environmental damage is caused by the current style of kraft paper production. But if we were to accept that damage could be caused, as a country that considers itself to have high levels of technology, we are doing nothing to discover solutions that might make paper pulp manufacture in Australia environmentally acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are we having difficulty discovering solutions? In every Budget this Government has deliberately cut back on the research effort of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The very group of government activists who could do something about the problem are having their budget cut; scientists are being sacked. What other solution do we have? We can go on recycling paper until someone eventually finds that arsenic levels or something have built up to an unacceptable point and that people's health is at risk. We can also go on exporting woodchips. But this nation, as we all know, cannot survive in that situation. It is amazing that for environmental reasons we continue to export raw materials because we do not have the scientific research to establish environmentally acceptable means of meeting other manufacturing criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome this reduction in sales tax but it is a drop in the ocean in the environmental debate. We deplore a government that is so short of ideas that it has to stop a major pulp paper manufacturing development in Tasmania because it does not know how to fix the problem. I assure the House that we will ensure that resources are available for those sorts of decisions because we have a commitment to productivity. We further have a commitment to prosperity through productivity. That is the vast difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Government has a system that says, `Screw the wages down and we will prove some form of growth or reduction in unit costs'. We say that the means of achieving reduction in unit costs is by an increase in productivity and the associated prosperity that goes with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Every area of tax has grown under this Government, as has sales tax. I would like to comment on the fact that this legislation also provides for an allowance before the small manufacturers have to levy sales tax. I use the word `levy' advisedly. Quite clearly the sales tax legislation requires that the manufacturer or the wholesaler is the taxpayer. That is often forgotten. The consumer pays in the end, but in terms of the law it is the responsibility of the manufacturer or wholesaler to pay. This legislation exempts certain manufacturers, but not if their turnover exceeds $1,000 a week-slightly less than that, in fact. That is not a very big manufacturing exercise; in fact, it is minuscule. No adjustment has been made to that level since 1979. It is not as generous as it looks because the $12,000 that was applicable previously would represent about $27,000 today; but it certainly is a help. I think it should have been more generous. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to speak on how the burden of collecting sales tax is imposed upon small business. As I have just explained, small business is the taxpayer. Small businesses have to pay their tax on the due date, notwithstanding that most times they have not been paid for the goods themselves. I made an impassioned plea to the Treasurer some years ago. He wanted to adjust the tax scales and even them all out at 10, 15 or 20 per cent, whatever the figures were, but in the process pick up $110m. I pointed out that it would be a good opportunity to use that windfall, which was not in his Budget, to extend the time that small business had to pay that sales tax to the Australian Taxation Office. I proposed that, even if it were progressively extended by five or 10 days a year until at least the period in which the small businessman had to pay that tax, it was equivalent to the terms of credit that he extended to his own clients. The small businessman is a tax collector, but under the law he is made a taxpayer; he cannot get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> That raises the second question. The great problem with sales tax for small business is knowing when it has to be collected. The complexity of the legislation is such that we frequently cannot even get an answer from the Tax Office. The Tax Office is in the happy situation of being able to second-guess it. If a person is given advice by the Tax Office and it is wrong, it is tough. It can second-guess the situation and say, `You should have collected it anyway'. Examples have been brought to my attention where businesses have gone broke. Over a period they have continued to sell a product thinking that it was either tax exempt to a certain group, or otherwise not knowing that it was taxable at all, and then the tax inspectors have come in. The amounts outstanding can be quite gigantic. We are talking about 20 per cent of the value of a particular product that might be valued at thousands of dollars. One cannot buy much under $1,000 these days. The amount of money owed is probably in excess of the value of their property and assets, and down the tube they go. It is nearly as bad as the Government's recent decision to dump the new tax collection regime on small corporations by 15 July following the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> If the next speaker from the Australian Labor Party knows anything about small business-I have demonstrated time and again that the Treasurer does not; he claims to have been the manager of a rock band, which only meant that he was the truck driver-he would understand that most small businessmen are unable to extend their stocktake by 15 July, let alone have their affairs in order to calculate and pay their tax. It is a most stupid suggestion and it is doubly stupid simply because the Government had just arrived at a reasonable arrangement; it got away from a single tax point for the year to a point of quarterly payments, which had a much more balancing effect on the money supply. I supported that because it did not have the shock of a single payment. Everything was reasonably balanced, and the Government goes back to a single payment per annum and expects people to be in a position to calculate their tax within 15 days at the end of the financial year. That is fine for companies such as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and others with their massive computers and those sorts of things; they can do it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think that tax on small business and sales tax are areas of concern. I have taken this opportunity to raise them. I also wanted to mention how difficult sales tax is in many regards. I represent a rural electorate where many of the items that are taxed are exempt in their use in the rural industries, the agricultural industries. I applaud that longstanding decision. Some most remarkable situations have arisen. A constituent of mine wanted to weigh the fleeces of all his sheep for the purpose of improving the efficiency of his flock management. The scales which he wished to use to weigh the fleeces are exempt. They are considered an aid to manufacture. But the computer to which he wished to link it so that this could be an automatic process-this was essential to make it work-was not so considered, and, notwithstanding our representations, we never got anywhere on that matter. Again, it would be of great value if some legislation were brought before the Parliament which addressed the difficulty that smaller businesses in particular have-there are 750,000 of them in Australia-in dealing with such complexities as the sales tax legislation and now the company tax legislation, which many of them will have to deal with as they are incorporated. It is a real problem to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point I note is that there are to be changes to the requirements for paying tax for some subcontractors. That is to be welcomed. We are not critical of that. I remind the House of the concentrated efforts of the Opposition to stop the Government in its original attack on flavoured milk. It is nice to see the Government being generous at this stage by lowering the tax requirements, but it is a pity it was introduced in the first place. This Government did it, ever chasing revenue. This Government keeps talking about economic management and balancing its Budget. Every bit of it is being done by increasing taxes. I frequently tell audiences that it is just like a wife who considers herself to be a good budgeter because she is able to tell her husband how much money to go out and earn each week. Those sorts of people do not get that opportunity. The Treasurer has just gone on adding to the tax burden of Australians year after year, and he says, `Am I not a wonderful manager?'. He rabbits on in here about capital gains taxes and other matters. He was in it for one reason, and one reason alone-to get more money. He certainly managed to achieve that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Opposition members are consulting their House of Representatives Standing Orders and books on practice I intend to make some comments about the legislation before the House, which deals with sales tax, an area which is very complex, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is an area which requires some consideration by this Parliament. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has moved an amendment in relation to this legislation. It is an amendment which is worthy of some consideration. The honourable member for Wentworth has moved that `the House deplores the Government's economic irresponsibility in increasing sales tax revenue by 200 per cent in an ad hoc and distortionary fashion'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have gone to the trouble to dig out the Budget Papers on sales tax. People in the gallery might be aware that the honourable member for Wentworth was the senior economic adviser of the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), during the Howard-Fraser years. When one looks through the figures as to the real rates of change in sales tax in the last 10 years, guess in which year there was the greatest real increase? (Quorum formed) I thank the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) very much for calling the quorum and wasting so much of the time of the House. It is a pity that not one member of the National Party has even entered the chamber at this time of night. I ask the Deputy Opposition Whip perhaps to speak with a few of the National Party members to get them into the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved an amendment in relation to this legislation, saying that this Government should be condemned for the massive increase in sales tax. Honourable members would be interested to learn in which year there was the greatest increase in sales tax. Guess which year it was? In 1981-82 there was a 22 per cent increase in sales tax. Who was the Treasurer then? It was the honourable member for Bennelong. Who was his main adviser? It was the current shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth. That is the record of the previous Government-a 22 per cent real increase in sales tax revenue in 1981-82 compared to a projected increase for this year, in this Government's most recent Budget, of only 5 per cent. That is the Opposition's record on sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Some very interesting words are used in this amendment proposed by the Opposition. The Opposition says that it deplores the increase in sales tax in an ad hoc and distortionary fashion. What is the Opposition getting at there? How could one increase sales tax in a manner that is not ad hoc? One could do so by introducing a consumption tax, which, we realise, is the Opposition's hidden agenda. That is the way it would fund all the extravagant promises it is making around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that John Elliott wants the Opposition to introduce a consumption tax. We know that Opposition members slugged it out in the smoke-filled rooms of this building as to whether they would have a consumption tax in their policy. We know that the honourable member for Wentworth was arguing for a consumption tax. We know that the main economic advisers of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) were right there behind the honourable member for Wentworth, supporting him, arguing for a consumption tax. It was only the Leader of the National Party (Mr Blunt) and John Stone who, somehow or other, were able to gather the numbers and stop the Opposition advocating a consumption tax in the lead-up to the election. </PARA>
<PARA> But what is going to happen after the election? What would happen to the Opposition's policies if it won office? We have had vast experience of the Liberal and National parties. They make extravagant promises as to how they will cut income tax and introduce tax indexation but they never deliver. In fact, they take back what they give within six months to a year. So that is the Opposition's record. It cannot stand by any of its promises on tax. We know that many senior members of the Opposition would like to have a consumption tax in the Opposition's policy now, but if they cannot get that they will take second best. They will ram through a consumption tax if, by chance, they get elected at the next election. I do not think that is good enough for the Australian people. I do not think it is good enough that the Opposition can try to slink into office without telling us where it stands on sales tax and a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening I have the pleasure of having a group of children from the Dooralong Public School visit Parliament House. It appears that a class from another primary school is currently in the gallery visiting Parliament House. Perhaps I could let the children in the gallery know that when the students from Dooralong Public School in my electorate took the opportunity to ask me questions about what I do as a member of parliament and what the Government's position is, one of the students said to me, `One of the most important questions I have for you, Mr Lee: is what is the Government doing about the environment?'. That is a very pertinent question. I would not be surprised if a few of the children in the gallery asked similar questions of their local member. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are indeed. I was able to explain to the students from Dooralong Public School that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) promised in July that more than one billion trees will be planted in the next 10 years, which I believe will do a lot to ensure that we have as many trees as possible converting carbon dioxide into oxygen, making their contribution towards lowering the level of carbon dioxide in the air and, therefore, reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that someone from Dooralong Public School should be the one to raise this because Dooralong Public School was a timber centre in the 1800s. Dooralong had some of the best red cedar in all of Australia but it is all gone now. It is very hard to find any red cedar trees on the New South Wales coast. The Government is trying to say that we need to make sure that we conserve the resource that we have. That means that a Bill such as the one now before the House is very important. The students in the gallery may not be aware that the legislation we are now debating will exempt recycled paper from sales tax. It means that we will be encouraging people and companies to use more recycled paper instead of new paper all the time. I am sure the students would be aware that if we never used recycled paper but only new and fresh paper, it would result in more trees being cut down, more expense and the use of more energy requiring more coal to be burnt in the power stations. It is more energy efficient to recycle paper than to use new paper all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who followed the debate on Wesley Vale would know that if we used more recycled paper there would be less toxins, such as dioxin, being pumped into Bass Strait and our rivers. While on the question of rivers, the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) has done a lot of research in this area and I understand that by using recycled paper we use less water, which is very important to a dry continent such as Australia. Anything that encourages the use of recycled paper has my full support, and I am sure that the students in the gallery would also encourage Parliament to look at ways to recycle paper. I think we should also do more to recycle some of the plastics and glass that we use. I think that local government could do more to make sure that consumers can return paper, bottles and plastic materials to the manufacturers as easily as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate there is a firm that uses the tail ends of large paper rolls. I understand that many companies that use paper have massive rolls, but the heads and tails of those rolls of paper are usually thrown away because the companies do not like to interrupt their manufacturing processes at an inconvenient time. A company in my electorate takes those heads and tails and processes them in such a way that they can be used to produce paper products. Every time the company uses one of those heads or tails, it means that new paper does not have to be used. It is just the same as recycling. I suggest to the Government that it should consider extending the sales tax exemption to the products made from the heads and tails of paper rolls. I accept that that is not something I will receive an answer to in next 24 hours, but I hope the Government considers it because I think it is important that we encourage these people as they do their bit to make sure that we do not cut down trees unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House also alters the law which imposes sales tax on computer software, which is an area in which I have been very interested since about 5 May 1988 when a constituent of mine-a Mr Mickey Benefiel, who was then the proprietor of a company called ADP Systems &amp;Software-came to see me in my electorate office at Toukley. Mr Benefiel ran a company which provided a service to people who needed computer work on software which was used in their business. If anyone had a fault with his computer system, he could contact this company and it would come out and investigate the computer programs and implement amendments or corrections and fix up any errors, or perhaps provide extra computer software options so that it could do new things or do things in a better way. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in the early part of 1988 the Australian Taxation Office wrongly interpreted, in my view, amendments to the sales tax law which this Parliament passed in 1986. Honourable members might be aware that in 1986 we changed the law which imposed sales tax on computer software. We thought that some people were using a licensing system to avoid the regime which then applied to sales tax on computer programs. Unfortunately, I believe the Australian Taxation Office sought to extend the changes that were made in 1986 to cover areas that were never intended to be covered. It was my experience-certainly through Mr Benefiel-that the Tax Office was seeking to impose sales tax on services that were being provided by these computer firms, whereas in the past sales tax applied only to goods such as glasses or pens. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Tax Office-in my view wrongly-said that sales tax was payable on the wages of people who fixed computer programs. That might sound very esoteric, but it resulted in this company being advised by its accountant and Tax Office officials that it was liable for a massive tax bill, plus a penalty, plus interest. I took up this matter with the Tax Office at Newcastle, which is run by Deputy Commissioner Bill Mulheron. I point out that it was not until several months later that we received a reply from Tax Office experts in Canberra. I believe it was as a result of efforts on the part of people such as Mr Benefiel that we were able to convince the Government to change the law on sales tax on computer software. In fact, the letter that finally came from the sales tax section of the Tax Office in Canberra contained the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the original advice has been reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA>That was very nice, because we learnt that the threatened impact on this company was to be waived. However, that threatened action was very disconcerting for everyone involved. I do not wish to criticise Tax officers at Newcastle, because they have done a great job in making sure that those who live between the Hawkesbury River and Port Macquarie receive excellent service. That office has been running some very progressive outreach services to ensure that pensioners and other members of the community can receive good advice from the Tax Office very easily, and I commend it for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I return to what I said earlier about the fact that students in my electorate have been saying that the Government should be doing more about the environment. When I said that I saw a few nods in the gallery from the school students who are visiting Parliament House tonight. I understand that they are from the Aldercourt Primary School. I am sure that all honourable members would join with me in hoping that the students enjoy their brief visit to Parliament House. I am glad that they are seeing Parliament while it is better behaved than was the case between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. today. That was not our fault but the fault of some other members of Parliament. I am sure that the children in the gallery could teach a few members in this place a thing or two about manners. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I return to the Opposition's amendment, which in part provides:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the House deplores the Government's economic irresponsibility in increasing sales tax revenue by 200 per cent in an ad hoc and distortionary fashion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have demonstrated that the single greatest increase in sales tax revenue occurred not under this Government but in 1981-82 when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer and the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), now the shadow Treasurer, was his main adviser. We know that under its real agenda the Opposition wants to introduce a consumption tax and that is why the amendment includes the words `ad hoc and distortionary fashion'. The Opposition wants to introduce changes to the sales tax laws, changes that are not ad hoc or in a distortionary fashion; in other words, a consumption tax. We know that that is what the Opposition wants, but the Government will do all in its power to ensure that the people of Australia know that that is what the Opposition is up to. </PARA>
<PARA> We will make sure that the pensioners out there in the electorate of Adelaide know that the Opposition wants to apply a 10 to 15 per cent consumption tax on cornflakes, the socks they buy and the materials they need for their garden. That will ensure that they can provide more cuts in taxation for their friends in business, such as Mr Elliott. That is how they will be able to provide for the abolition of the capital gains tax on Mr Elliott's shares, so that he can get that $17m in his back pocket. That is what the Opposition is all about-taking money away from the pensioners and the children who spend money in the supermarkets and giving it to Mr Elliott. I am sure that the people of Australia will make the right decision. </PARA>

I am sure that all those pensioners that he alluded to would be just as grateful for the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Port Pirie last week when he referred to the pensioners and veterans of Australia as silly old buggers. If the honourable member wants to match it one for one, I am sure that we can accommodate him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to support quite a few of the facets that have been raised concerning sales tax and bring to the attention of this House some salient points in regard to sales tax. I was grateful to hear previous speakers refer to recycling. That is the subject on which I shall base my remarks. My speech should last only about 10 minutes, so we can keep future debates going. There is a riddle on tax-free recycled products. It is a growth industry. A lot has been brought to the attention of the public. The honourable member for Dobell spoke about a company that uses the tops and tails and butt reels to sheet. I wonder whether it is the Higgins Trading Company Pty Ltd, whose owner wrote to one of my constituents on 11 August seeking some assurance. The honourable member for Dobell thought that he would not get an answer within 24 hours. It will be much longer than that because the letter to the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) written on 23 August has still not received a reply. The company uses the butts and reels for recycling. It is an operation which converts the printer's waste paper into packaging paper for use in butchers' shops and other food outlets. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of what the Prime Minister said was correct-it is a matter of utilising existing materials in preference to damaging or depleting scarce and environmentally valuable resources. To encourage this the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the 20 per cent sales tax on recycled paper products. The company went on to say that following discussion between its representatives and senior government policy advisers, sales tax exemption will not apply to its produce despite the obvious recycled use. Since the introduction of sales tax in October 1988 it has noticed a decline in sales due to buyer resistance. The company operates recycling plants in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland and employs over 40 staff in what is a very labour-intensive process. It is very keen to be included in this scheme of events, to outline those facts, to take an interest in this anomaly relating to the exemption of sales tax, and to bring these facts to the attention of those in government. We are still waiting on a reply. That company may be at cross purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> A very enterprising woman in my electorate in Adelaide, Mrs Erica Arnold, has developed a recycling aid. Recycling occurs at the kerbside or at the rubbish bin in the kitchen or flat. The housewives of Australia are probably at the coalface of recycling. We have to educate the community. Both sides of the House would agree that we have the opportunity to separate at the source domestic waste to be recycled, whether it is aluminium, plastic or paper. The Scouts and the very many charities have the ability to make money from recycling if they can collect this waste as it finds its way into the kerbsides. It has been said by the Government speakers that, as Government members, they must take the lead in recycling our paper. It was very interested to see a leaked document in which it was impressed upon the Australian Labor Party that it should make available money tins for collection and to have letterheads which are printed on 100 per cent Australian recycled paper. I have a letter here which is written on recycled paper. So it is the intention to lead by example, I presume. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is commendable. I come back to Mrs Arnold and her recycle aid program. As a housewife, she has developed a program where a cross-section fits into a rubbish bin, together with small domestic plastic bags which are used to collect the refuse and place it further into the recycling program. Certainly in South Australia there seems to be some riddle on tax-free recycled products. Mystery surrounds the Federal Government's commitment at an early stage. The sales tax sections of the Australian Taxation Office, in this press release that I referred to, demonstrated which products would be exempt from the tax and when. That brings me to the company that uses butts and tails in its three factories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Printing and writing paper, tissue and toilet paper and paper bags made from 100 per cent recycled paper could be tax-free. The community must be alerted to the fact that we do not need virgin white paper. We do not need nappies that are clinically white. We do not need the tissues and toilet paper that are pristine in their colour and appearance. Even though recycling involves several stages, it is less costly in raw materials than new wood. That is an incentive for companies to recycle as much paper fibre as they can. The cellulose fibres that come from the trees and are used for paper making can be reconverted into pulp stock and reformed into paper products. Of the 2.4 million tonnes of paper and paperboard Australia consumes each year, over 900,000 tonnes are recycled-that is, 40 per cent. This is almost the same percentage as in the United Kingdom and West Germany but is approximately 50 per cent higher than in countries such as Sweden and the United States. It is happening in Australia, and community pressure must be brought to bear to continue this concept. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of recycling that is going to be linked to the assistance with sales tax, paper can be recycled in age over time. The cellulose fibres gradually disintegrate so that paper cannot be recycled over and over again. Some paper is obviously irretrievable, such as that from toilet rolls and tissue paper, and paper that has been burnt. Sixty-four per cent of all paper and paper board packaging consumed in Australia is manufactured from recycled material. In order to acquire the many tonnes of waste paper required, paper recycling companies have found it necessary to establish a wide range of collection systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) refer to the recycling of freons. I have had the opportunity in this House to refer to a company in Adelaide called Wye Industries Ltd which produces a product called kixotol. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) has also indicated his heavy support for it. This company produces polyurethane, which is blown by CO2, not freon, which just evaporates into the atmosphere. It has fire retardant abilities. It is the polyurethane that goes around the skin and casings of aeroplanes and on the dashboards of cars, and it is very widely used in the softgoods manufacturing industry. It has huge fire retardant abilities when mixed with a paint; so its application is wide ranging. Freon is a dirty word in blowing and in being a propellant. The kixotol-which is really `low toxic' spelt backwards-has something to offer the community and the environment. Its manufacturers would not mind a lazy couple of million dollars from the Government tacked on to the back of the $36m to be given to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, because the company is struggling to survive but has so much to offer. When supporting the recycling of freon gas in motor vehicle air conditioning plants, I bring to the notice of the House the other product from Wye Industries Ltd in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of sales tax to the recycling of waste products must be given more than scant regard. It is to be hoped that what is being done tonight will afford an opportunity for greater concessions to be made in this important area of recycling rubbish, whether it be in kerbside bins or municipal destructors. If this principle is applied so that it can enhance our quality of life and improve the environment that Australia requires, the Government and our community will be the leaders and the world can follow. </PARA>

It is interesting to consider the terms in which it was moved. The shadow Treasurer complains that the Government is increasing sales tax in an ad hoc and distortionary fashion. I went to the Liberal bible, the Economic Action Plan, which is the Liberal and National partys' economic and tax policy. I have to confess that I had a keen desire to look at what they said about sales tax and I wanted to check on the marginal rate. It is interesting that the Opposition can have an Economic Action Plan and an economic and tax policy, yet have not much action and not much policy. Looking for the marginal rate is like looking for the emperor's new clothes. Everybody has to say how marvellous it is but no-one can see it. We are, of course, in that ludicrous situation; nothing is mentioned in the policy about sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his contribution, my colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) suggested that we ought to look at the telling words `ad hoc and distortionary fashion' which appear in the amendment. The amendment is talking about what the Government has been doing. The counter to that-a very deliberate and extortionate one, I would think-is to introduce a consumption tax. The people of Australia have to understand that the Economic Action Plan announced by the Opposition is really the emperor's new clothes. Nobody can see what it is and the only opportunity to find out what it is, heaven forbid, is when the Opposition is in government. One comment by my colleague with which I agree is that the coalition parties will introduce a consumption tax. A consumption tax will hit the weakest section of our community. I visit the five pensioner clubs and senior citizens centres in my electorate of Chifley where we are very proud of our senior citizens. The introduction of a consumption tax will really distress them. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point raised was who really increased sales tax the most. The Budget Papers show that it is not this Government and it is not in this year because, under the Labor Government, sales tax has been increased by 5.1 per cent whereas in 1981-82, when you-know-who was in power, sales tax increased by 22 per cent. Which troika was responsible? It was the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who is newly restored to the front bench but was then Treasurer in the conservative government, his adviser the honourable member for Wentworth, and the then head of Treasury, none other than Senator Stone. </PARA>

<PARA> I turn now to the removal of sales tax on computer software. Like a number of members, I receive letters from a wide variety of Australian software firms seeking relief in sales tax. I am absolutely delighted to have the privilege tonight of saying to them that I made representations on their behalf but that the Government is very sensitive to the needs of the information industry, which is a growth industry, and that tonight Government members are speaking in support of the changes they sought. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have to remind the House that, in the software industry, it is claimed that Australia has a particular advantage in the skills of its programmers; so it is wonderful that we are not inhibiting them, although, as I understand the Bills, the medians of the programs, that is, the discs or tapes and the packaging, will still be subject to sales tax. The Bill also treats as firmware computer programs on microchips, that is, the programs that are burnt in. So I am delighted to support that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I also support the lifting of sales tax on recycled paper. This was part of the Prime Minister's comprehensive environmental statement. One of the most encouraging aspects for those concerned with the environment is the growing concern among constituents, and particularly among young school children, about the environment. I am proud to say that my children are better environmentalists than I was at their age, and that is tremendous for the country and it bodes well. I put out a student information kit on the environment and I have had tremendous response from the schools and the students. It is interesting that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt), an Opposition Liberal member from South Australia, was very complimentary of not only the Government but the Labor Party for seeking to use as much recycled paper as possible. I strongly support that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Rooty Hill residents action committee in my electorate, which is an environmental group, mounted a very strong campaign on behalf of the Rooty Hill residents against the mill. It ended up having to raise something like $140,000 to take the matter to court. They are still working very hard at fund-raising and are to be congratulated for the job they have done. They approached me concerning the shredded paper coming out of my office. They asked me whether I would be prepared to assist them by giving the shredded paper to them. I am pleased to say that I was only too happy to do that for a time but, unfortunately, the price being paid by merchants for shredded paper does not make the exercise worthwhile. I hope that that situation will change and that there will be opportunities for people to put shredded paper from our electorate offices into the system so that it can be recycled and not burnt off and thrown onto dumps. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the initiative announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the proposals embodied in these Bills to be picked up by all State local authorities. There is still a lot that councils can do to assist recycling, in particular to split the refuse from households into paper, glass, cans and other refuse. We need to work cooperatively and embark upon a public education program. I urge my two local government councils, Penrith and Blacktown, to pick up this challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great opportunity for States to put deposits on glass bottles and cans. I commend what is being done in the recycling of aluminium cans but I believe we ought to go much further. It is a pity that the initiative taken many years ago in the State of Oregon has not been copied elsewhere. It introduced a deposit system which completely cured a severe litter problem there but, more importantly, it worked very constructively in creating concern and caring for the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, there is one element of what the New South Wales Government is doing in terms of recycling to which I object; this may appear a bit inconsistent. As honourable members will know, there have always been proposals to turn the tidal waters inland and to harness the great river systems on the east coast of Australia. But I am afraid to say that the New South Wales Government has come up with a far more imaginative program to turn inwards the sewerage lines of Sydney, from the north shore and eastern suburbs and to inundate the western suburbs. I hope you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will forgive me for being parochial in raising this, but I am sure you can understand that we in the western suburbs object very mightily to receiving this pollution that we have not generated and that we are not in any way involved in. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I reiterate the point that I made earlier, that the most heartening thing is that young school children are becoming more environmentally conscious. I am sure, for example, that the school children from the Frankston Special School in Bob Chynoweth's electorate of Dunkley, who are in the House today, feel the same as the school children in my electorate. I have received a number of letters from young primary school children asking what they as concerned young Australians can do about the environment. There is a lot they can do, and I am sure they are pleased that this Government is tackling that problem. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable members who have participated in this cognate debate on the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989 and the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill 1989. There are a few remarks I wish to make in relation to those contributions. In doing so, I emphasise the significant concession the Government has made in the two computer program Bills by removing the sales tax on computer software. This has come about as a consequence of the need to ensure that the sales tax law is clear in its application and that the avenue for its avoidance is closed off in this area. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that as far as I am aware the changes have been welcomed by those engaged in the software industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure honourable members will also appreciate the other main measure in the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill. I refer to the ongoing statutory guarantee that sales tax payers will be allowed up to 27 days after royal assent is given to this and subsequent legislation imposing sales tax obligations from an earlier date to find out about and meet those obligations without attracting penalties. This guarantee will give peace of mind to those taxpayers affected by such sales tax changes and who are unsure of what, if anything, they should be doing prior to the changes becoming law some time later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) gives effect to four measures, three of which are Budget initiatives while the fourth was announced in the environment statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in July this year. I am sure honourable members appreciate that the measures contained in the Bill will reduce both the amount of sales tax required to be paid by the Australian community and the administrative obligations taxpayers must meet under the sales tax law. The measure announced in the Prime Minister's environment statement, to exempt from sales tax certain paper products where the paper in those products is made wholly from recycled paper, represents a constructive incentive by the Government to encourage the manufacture and use of recycled paper. It is a limited exemption. While the Government is exploring the possibility of expanding the range of recycled paper products that are to be exempt from sales tax, we recognise the difficulties associated with this kind of exemption, such as introducing tax avoidance opportunities and economic distortions. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House want to implement as a matter of priority a constructive environmental policy. To do so it is necessary to consider carefully all the relevant information. The Budget measures contained in the Bill also include significant assistance for small manufacturers, subcontractors carrying out activities of a manufacturing nature and producers of flavoured milk. Touching briefly on each of these measures, sales of goods by small manufacturers with average annual sales of $50,000 or less, or an annual sales tax liability that does not exceed $1,000, will be tax free. The range of goods exempt from sales tax when they are for use by a subcontractor exclusively in carrying out activities of a manufacturing nature is to be extended. This amendment will be of great benefit to certain subcontractors who perform work on behalf of other businesses where the business is entitled to sales tax exemption but the subcontractor is not. Manufacturers and wholesalers of flavoured milk drinks will benefit from the reduction in the milk content requirement that drinks have to meet to be eligible for the concessional rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude my remarks on the two Bills removing sales tax on computer software, I cannot let go uncorrected the suggestions made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) that the earlier sales tax Bills on software introduced in November last year were withdrawn because they did not accord with the software industry's understanding of the Budget announcement of the changes to be made and that those Bills did not reflect the Government's intention. If those Bills had not given effect to the Government's intentions at the time, namely, to remove sales tax on customised software and to impose sales tax on packaged software transferred electronically, those Bills would not have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry outcry that arose after the introduction of the Bills related primarily to the qualification to the removal of sales tax on customised software. The qualification was that the tax would remain payable on packaged software used in creating that customised software. Apparently, the industry had expected that only some types of such packaged software would be taxed. However, the Budget announcement gave no indication that this would be so. Nevertheless, given the software industry's concerns that the Bills were not satisfactory, the Government had further extensive discussions with industry representatives to explore those concerns. Following these discussions the Government concluded that the Bills would not adequately address fundamental problems associated with applying sales tax to computer software and that instead sales tax on all computer software other than firmware should be removed, as the two computer program Bills being considered propose to do. It was that conclusion that necessitated the withdrawal of last November's Bills. I reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth and I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The change to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill relates to the measure announced in the 1989-90 Budget to extend the range of goods to be exempt from sales tax where those goods are for use by a subcontractor exclusively in carrying out activities on behalf of one or more manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment I have just moved recognises that certain persons who undertake activities of a manufacturing nature may not be manufacturers for sales tax purposes. It will allow a sales tax exemption to be available for goods for use by a subcontractor exclusively in carrying out activities for one or more persons, even where those persons are not technically manufacturers for sales tax purposes. The exemption will continue to be available only if each of those persons could have obtained exemption for the goods under the existing aids to manufacture provisions of the sales tax law had the person acquired and used the goods to carry out the contracted activities. </PARA>

<PARA>Consistent with the Government's decision to remove sales tax liability for all computer software other than firmware, and with the general principle that sales tax applies to wholesale transactions, the Bill as introduced proposes the removal of sales tax liability on sales by retailers who put computer programs on carrying media, other than microchips, where a wholesaler or manufacturer has already paid sales tax on the carrying media. The amendment I have just moved will extend that measure by also removing sales tax on sales by retailers who put programs on carrying media, other than microchips, which they have imported themselves, rather than buying them from a wholesaler, and in respect of which they have already paid an appropriate amount of tax when clearing the media through Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> But for this amendment, such retailers would have the administrative costs and additional burden of registering for sales tax purposes, lodging returns, paying sales tax on the wholesale value of the carrying media and applying for refunds of the tax paid to Customs. The cost to revenue of this measure is estimated to be $1m in a full year. This amendment to widen the concession for computer software will apply from 23 December 1988, the date from which the other computer software changes proposed by the Bill will take effect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989 primarily amends the Wool Marketing Act and then makes some corrections to and tidies up quite a number of other pieces of rural industry legislation. The main purpose of the amendments to the Wool Marketing Act is to establish a Wool Research and Development Council which comes at a time of significant activity in the wool industry. Significant purchases of wool are being made by the Wool Marketing Authority to maintain the floor price. The Australian Wool Council is about to meet for its annual review and to take account of the work of the International Wool Secretariat (IWS) in relation to wool promotion. Recently the Government announced that in two years time it will be terminating any contribution to wool promotion although it has now made an announcement that it will be helping Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd with some exports, which once again reveals this Government's double standard concerning industry. We have a crisis in our live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia and we have a potential oversupply of mutton. The Bill itself is a compromise after lengthy debate between the industry on the one hand and the Government on the other as to whether there should be a research and development council or a corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the wool stockpile a combination of circumstances has caused wool purchased by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) since 1 July to increase from under 200,000 bales to over one million bales. There are a number of reasons for this. First, there is a 20 per cent increase in offerings this year compared with last year. That is made up of an 8 1/2 per cent production increase, plus some carryover for sales from the previous season, and the previous season itself was a record year of production. This increased offering exacerbates the concentration that always occurs whereby most wool is sold in the first half of the wool selling season; that is, about 60 per cent of the total offering for the year. Traditionally, the Australian Wool Corporation will buy in during that period, if it is to buy in, because of that concentration of selling and the fact that it coincides with a period of slack demand in the Northern Hemisphere, caused by holidays, et cetera. Generally, the Wool Corporation has been a net seller rather than buyer of wool in the second half of the wool selling season-that is, in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA> The final reason is the withdrawal of China from the market. China had moved up to be the second largest buyer of Australian wool. Not only is China no longer in the market but also there is the indirect consequence that other countries, including Japan, which has reduced its purchases, used to buy and then on-sell our wool to China. So the stockpile, which has rapidly built up to over one million bales, could easily grow to two million bales by the end of the wool selling season. The woolgrowers' market support fund has $1.8 billion to purchase that wool. Beyond that, the Corporation has the ability to borrow commercially and, therefore, in theory, the stockpile could grow to well over two million bales. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to indicate my complete confidence in that marketing policy of the Australian Wool Corporation and its maintenance of the present floor price. The present situation is not new. A stockpile of over one million bales has existed for more than half of the years that there has been a floor or reserve price arrangement. The Wool Corporation has always resold that wool at a profit and, in so doing, has added billions of dollars to the exports of this country. This highlights the importance of the wool industry in terms of exports. The industry is our most consistent and significant net export industry, with exports of $6 billion last year. That money stays in Australia and that should be the real test of the export value of an industry. But, because of the wool that has been purchased and put into the stockpile, exports could be down $2 billion this year to about $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind everyone that the policy of the AWC over the years has been sound in that the wool has been ultimately sold at a profit to the benefit of all Australians. One must bear in mind that there will be a $2 billion reduction, or potential reduction, for wool, and reductions of at least $2 billion to $3 billion for tourism, $500m for wheat and $500m for meat and sheep. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague said, they will all be down. This country's trade deficit for this 12 months period will not be the $18 1/2 billion as guesstimated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the Budget. It will be possibly $25 billion and this will have very serious ramifications for interest rates and the standard of living of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government support for this very important and great industry which has $4 billion to $6 billion worth of exports is, first of all, $16m a year for research on a dollar for dollar basis. That is the standard rural industry research arrangement. Nobody disagrees with that and I think it has strong bipartisan support. The Government also gives $25m for the overseas promotion of wool. The wool industry has always had a great record of concentrating on research. The industry and all Australians have benefited from that investment. In fact, wool has the highest percentage of industry contribution in terms of research work done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Once again, one can point to a double standard in that the rural industries are putting in a far higher percentage of the total research cost of work done by CSIRO than are other sections of industry. Woolgrowers this year will invest $434m for their future; $230m for the market support fund-the revolving fund; and $190m for wool promotion through the International Wool Secretariat. The IWS will contribute $16m. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the decision that was announced yesterday in relation to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. Kodak has annual exports of about $200m to $250m. The Government will be providing that company $13m a year for three years. Yet, although the wool industry has exports of $4 billion to $6 billion a year, the Government has announced that in two years time it will be terminating any direct assistance-that is, the $25m for wool promotion-and will continue the standard dollar for dollar industry research arrangement which, as I said earlier, indicates the higher commitment of rural industries to research compared with that of industry generally. I want to highlight that double standard. This great industry of Australia, which has its problems from time to time, puts more of its money into research than do other industries. We do not have any idea what Kodak will be putting in for research. Yet, the Government has said that in two years time the $25m for wool promotion, which will be all spent overseas because the wool growers themselves spend $16m each year for promotion in Australia, will be terminated. The wool industry deserves better than that. </PARA>
<PARA> But this highlights the lack of equity on the part of this Government in supporting the industries of Australia-whether it is Kodak, the banks, the airlines or the waterfront. It is interesting to note that today the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority presented a report on the manning and the operation of bulk grain terminals in Australia. Honourable members will recall that some months ago the industry itself wanted to proceed with enterprise employment-in other words, the exporter determining the amount of labour and what type of labour would be employed in the bulk terminals, particularly at Fisherman Island and Port Kembla. But due to tremendous pressure from the Government, the Wheat Board backed down and agreed that the Reform Authority should take control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reform Authority has indicated that there will be no enterprise employment on these two bulk grain terminals and, presumably from that, on any other bulk terminals in Australia or on the waterfront generally. We will have a union dominated and managed industry in which the union will say how many people will be employed. So much for the Government putting pressure on the waterfront and achieving micro-economic reform to reduce the exorbitant costs that export industries have to face. They are required to be more than efficient in world terms in order to meet competition from other countries, notwithstanding the fact that our interest rates and inflation rates are twice those of our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> Other aspects of the sheep industry are very important and critical at present. We have a large number of ageing sheep because, with better wool prices, many sheep have been kept for an extra year. We now have a situation in which we need significant mutton sales. It is preferable that these sheep be slaughtered rather than shot. The price of the sheep has fallen considerably. Live sheep sales are important in order to maintain a commercial price for sheep of a certain age and type. With the termination, hopefully just for the time being, of the Saudi Arabian market, the price of sheep of this type has fallen by up to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had more interesting news today on that front. Hopefully, it is good news. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has agreed to write to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia indicating the importance of this trade to Australia which is about $130m to $150m a year. This part of the industry is certainly not getting any support from the Government such as is being given to Kodak. I raised this matter in Parliament on 31 August and suggested that we need a higher level of intervention on a diplomatic basis to indicate to the Saudis that this is a very serious matter for Australia in terms of both trade and more general relations. We have enjoyed very good relations with that kingdom. The Prime Minister said that I was stupid. He said:</PARA>

However, even if he has done so much later than he should have, I commend the Prime Minister for now accepting his responsibility. I also commend him on an earlier intervention with the Canadian Prime Minister, which I have used as an example of what can be achieved for the canned fruit trade between our countries. The problem of the Canada-United States free trade agreement puts at risk our best export market for canned fruit, worth $35m. The proposal that the Prime Minister brought back from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, after talking to Prime Minister Mulroney, is not a certainty. Negotiations are necessary both on the tariff for US fruit and Australian fruit and on any trade-offs that may be necessary. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister's intervention was a positive one. When somebody does that I commend him for it. I just wish that with the live sheep trade he had intervened two months earlier when I believe-and I hope that it will now-that it would have had a positive result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) seeks to establish the Wool Research and Development Council, which is a compromise between the competing views of the industry on the one hand, which wanted something like the existing arrangement to continue, and, on the other, the research and development corporation model which we will be debating in general terms later this week, of which the meat industry is the best example and which many in primary industry believe is an improvement over the council model. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the wool industry is different. It is a more integrated industry between the grower and the statutory authority-the Australian Wool Corporation. It has an international presence through the International Wool Secretariat. It is, as an industry, more attuned to research and development. The Wool Council already has in place research subcommittees. Wool has an established accountability arrangement. Whether one is talking about accountability for research and development or for marketing in general, through the statutory authority-the Corporation-I believe that the wool industry has the best accountability arrangement of any of the rural industries. In addition to presenting its annual report to Parliament, the Wool Council-the peak industry body-has twice yearly meetings in different parts of Australia. As I said earlier, the next one will be in Perth in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Research and development is very important to the wool industry. The level of research is increasing by 5 per cent per annum and, for textile research within that total framework, by 10 per cent per annum-that is, it has the major priority for wool research. Production research-that is, to improve on-farm production-has a lower priority. It has a real increase each year but nowhere near to the same extent. There is not much point producing a product if it cannot be sold profitably. The more value that can be added to a product, which does not necessarily mean by further processing but by selling that product in the luxury section of the market, the better. Obviously, any research that can be done to push wool into that end of the market is very valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a significant role in textile research. Whereas the great majority of the development work through the IWS is spent overseas, we must remember that 70 per cent of the IWS's budget is from Australian wool-growers. No other industry in this country has that commitment to international promotion of an Australian product-to expertise and development of that product. The money is spent, through the IWS, in the major markets-the fashion areas of northern Europe, et cetera-which determine the use of different types of competing fibres. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the present level of the levy is 0.35 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, under the Government's arrangement, up to 0.5 per cent of GDP is eligible for a dollar for dollar contribution. Wool research funds have definitely been improved by the price increase of the last few years, but one has to remember that it has fallen by 30 per cent over the last 18 months. I have no doubt, in view of the wool industry's proud record, that as more money is needed for wool research that percentage levy will be increased as necessary to the maximum. The coalition Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) covers several aspects of primary industry, I wish to deal with one of the most important for my electorate-that of soil conservation. Many parts of my electorate have suffered severe dry spells and drought over the past few seasons. Parts of the area suffer salinity and land degradation. Several land care groups have been established to deal with the problem. One of the most impressive I have seen is the Mundubbera land care group called the Central Burnett Land Management Group. It has established an extensive project to deal with several aspects of conservation. Last year, the group received a grant of $73,000 to assist with the scheme. Parts of the Mundubbera area suffer the basic symptoms of soil degradation: that of soil erosion, soil salination and some effects of vegetation degradation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government is assisting land care in conjunction with other levels of government. Land care will consist of three elements. The 1990s will be declared the Decade of Land Care. There will be a review of all policies and an expansion of the national soil conservation program. During the Decade of Land Care, the Government will provide over $320m for land care and related tree planting and remnant vegetation conservation programs. In 1989-90, $23.4m will be provided to the national soil conservation program. Ten million dollars will be used to overcome problems associated with insufficient data on land capability and the location and extent of degradation. About $6m will be used to fund projects of land care groups, coordinators and the preparation of farm and regional plans. About $5m has been allocated to research and development projects including research into economic issues. The remaining funds will be directed at information and technology transfer projects, such as school curriculum material, ecological advice for landholders, technical bulletins and training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The national soil conservation program has grown appreciably since 1983-84. Over the past five years, the program has contributed to over 400 projects. There are about 200 land care groups throughout Australia and a further 1,000 groups are intended by the year 2000. The program is of concern to my electorate. A land degradation severity index shows that both the coast and parts of the Central Burnett and Isis areas have a moderate problem which is the second worst scenario on the index. There are tables suggesting the interrelationship between tree clearing and land degradation problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The case appears to have been proven in my electorate. Most of my electorate has shown a severe-70 to 100 per cent-clearing of trees since settlement began. That was only 200 years ago. Three-quarters of our rainforest is gone. Large areas of what was once rainforest, cleared for agriculture in the 1800s and early 1900s, are now unproductive, infested with weeds, heavily eroded and swept by fire. The poplar box woodlands area of central Queensland is an area under threat. There is now the potential to clear 30 to 50 per cent of the 100 million hectares of poplar box woodland in Queensland through the aerial application of a chemical called graslan. The operation would cost between $2 billion and $4 billion. My complaint with the Queensland Government is that the chemical is freely available at produce agencies and there are no supervised guidelines for its use. To prove the point, I sent a staff member to buy it. She had no difficulty obtaining it and was not questioned about its intended use. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the fragile nature of parts of our environment, I would have hoped that a closer monitoring of chemicals such as graslan could be undertaken. The clearing in questions if it went ahead, would mean the loss of some five billion trees. The region represents the heartland of Australia's remaining koala population. Scientists have argued that the area would be vulnerable to salination and overgrazing. Last night the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) mentioned that I have raised this matter before, and that is correct. I am concerned about our environment, particularly in Queensland. It is not so much the chemical but the action of the Queensland Government that worries me. The former Minister for Primary Industries, Neville Harper, said graslan was merely another tool to clear the land. Any chemical with the capabilities of graslan needs to be monitored carefully. That comment from Mr Harper reminds me of a comment from another fool, Barry Goldwater, who once said that the atom bomb was merely another weapon. Mr Harper is now Minister for Land Management. That is like putting Nero in charge of the fire brigade. The Queensland Nationals cannot control law and order, they cannot control drought relief, and I do not believe they can control the use of chemicals. The problem we have had with dieldrin is another classic example. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia currently imports about $1.5 billion worth of timber and pulp and paper products, accounting for 10 per cent of the current account deficit. (Quorum formed) As the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who called the quorum, has complimented me on my concern for the environment, I will repeat what I said. I am concerned for the environment. It is not so much the use of the chemical graslan but the behaviour of the Queensland Government that worries me. The former Minister for Primary Industries, Neville Harper, said graslan was merely another tool to clear land. Any chemical with the capabilities of graslan needs to be monitored carefully. That comment from Mr Harper reminds me of a comment from another fool, Barry Goldwater, who once said that the atom bomb was merely another weapon. Mr Harper is now Minister for Land Management. That is like putting Nero in charge of the local fire brigade. The National Party cannot control law and order-I am pleased the honourable member for Wannon agrees with me-it cannot control drought relief and it cannot control the use of chemicals. The problems we have had in the past with dieldrin highlight that fact. I will now get back to where I was when the quorum was called. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Liberals are a bit touchy; they do have to live with the National Party. Australia has about one million hectares of plantations-about 2.2 per cent of the total area of forest. Most of the plantations are softwood and 50,000 hectares are hardwood. There are examples throughout Australia of trees being grown primarily for environmental reasons but the value of the timber helps offset the cost. I have read that in Canberra pine forests were initially grown to restore and improve degraded land and protect the quality of Canberra's water supply. As well as being a popular recreation area, the forests now pay for themselves and return a small profit from logging. Formerly unproductive land has been converted to sustainable productive use, providing employment for 450 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Research has improved the economics of hardwood plantations. Plantations in the future are expected to achieve double the yield of unmanaged native forests on the same site. A significant commercial development can be derived from specialty or feature timber or multipurpose woodlots on plantations. In the past, Australia had ample quantities of blackwood, scheer ash, rosewood, Queensland maple, silky oak, mountain ash and cypress pine. Today, Australia imports feature timbers. A decision to grow feature timbers is a 50-year investment, but one well worth making. There is every reason, however, to suggest that the decision to grow such trees can also be a useful environmental tool. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government has recognised, we cannot afford any longer to blindly ignore the environmental difficulties on our farming land. Wheat yield per hectare on the Darling Downs is five times the national average. Each year it loses four to eight millimetres, or eight million tonnes, of rich black topsoil. At this rate the soil will be gone in 30 to 50 years. In a 1985 publication entitled State of the Environment in Australia, it was estimated that the value of nutrients in soil washed from the Darling Downs in drought-breaking rains in 1983 was about $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in farmers' interests and Australia's interests that farmers become greenies on issues of soil conservation and land degradation. Agriculture still plays the foremost role in our export capacity. So it is in the economic self-interest of all rural communities to get behind the land care schemes already in place. Over 2.6 million square kilometres of our land have been assessed as needing treatment for degradation and in 1983 two-thirds of Australia's farmland needed soil conservation treatment. That is a sad indictment. It is a major challenge, and I believe we can overcome it. I commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the local communities for the roles they are playing in facing up to the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) covers a wide range of rural issues, as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) have already alluded to. Frankly, the debate tonight has reflected a wide range of rural issues, as I am sure you would be the first to acknowledge, Mr Deputy Speaker. Many rural industries are covered by this legislation, and among the Acts affected by this omnibus Bill are the Wool Marketing Act, the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Act, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act, the Honey Levy Collection Act, the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act, the Barley Research Levy Collection Act, the Oilseeds Levy Act, the Rural Industries Research Act and the Wheat Marketing Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be relieved to know, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, will be relieved to know, and I suspect the House will be relieved to know, that it is not my intention tonight at this late hour to address all the aspects of the Bill. In fact, I am somewhat exasperated by the fact that the limited number of sitting days that the Parliament has had will force us to prune our opportunity to debate the legislation currently before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pick up some of the comments that were made earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Murray about wool marketing. I have to concede as one who represents the electorate of Wakefield-the electorate of Wakefield includes the merino capital of the world, the town of Burra-not only that the wool industry plays a major role in the capacity of Australia to earn export dollars, but also the research for the wool industry is funded by woolgrowers at levels that make other initiatives in other industries seem almost paltry by comparison. Because of the huge research effort that has characterised the wool industry and, as the honourable member for Murray said, because of the level of promotion that growers have themselves committed to it, as I understand it, the wool industry has made approaches to the agriculture Minister and successfully sought from him a concession to have set up a research and development council rather than a research and development corporation. The Minister has wisely acceded to this request from the industry and the Opposition supports the Minister in this particular move. We recognise that research in wool is essential, that the wool industry is unique and that a research council may well more appropriately meet both its historic and future needs than a corporation would. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet I indicate that both the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker)-he is not in the chamber now-and the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) had sought to participate in this debate because of the lifelong interest they have had in the wool industry and the contribution they have made to it, but the shortage of available time for debate tonight will not make that possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray has already made much of the real input that growers make in wool research and wool promotion. He said, and I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . last year growers paid $434 million in levies for promotion and market support-$25 million up on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an astonishing amount of money. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> From these levies $230 million went into the market support fund, $190 million to promotion and $14 million to research. </PARA>
<PARA>The woolgrowers of Australia have already made a realistic commitment to addressing this nation's balance of payments deficit. They have put their money where their mouths are in an effort to improve both research into wool and the promotion that wool enjoys on a world market. Sadly, in spite of their efforts and through no fault of their own, the capacity that wool has to be a major export earner in this country will not be reflected in the figures. It is expected that wool earnings could go from somewhere near $6 billion in the last financial year to a figure closer to $3 billion in this financial year. Be that as it may, the point remains that the growers have contributed 70 per cent of the promotion budget of the International Wool Secretariat, and they have shown a real commitment to the wool industry. The Opposition is prepared to support the legislation before the House because the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, recognising the commitment of both the wool industry and the woolgrowers to addressing Australia's need for export income, feels that research in wool would be better addressed by a wool council than a wool corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address another aspect of the Bill, pick up the comments made earlier by the honourable member for Hinkler, and reflect for a moment on the impact of the soil conservation amendments currently before the House. As a representative of a rural electorate, I am somewhat distressed at the direction the debate on soil conservation is taking. Along with every other member of the House I applaud the heightened consciousness in Australia of the importance of soil. Everyone recognises that the key to Australia's agricultural productivity, in many cases the key to our capacity to improve our export earnings, and certainly the key to feeding Australia and enabling us to make a contribution to feeding the world, is the way in which we treat our soil. I am distressed about the impression that is abroad in the community that soil conservation is an issue that is largely being neglected by farmers and that the new-found enthusiasm for soil conservation measures has largely resulted from urban initiatives. This bothers me. I want to address the fundamental issue; that is, that even the Government's land care program, successfully launched last week and representing cooperation between the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation, has not been successful in removing the impression abroad that land and soil conservation has largely been an urban initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> About five weeks ago I visited Roseworthy College. I accompanied the principal of the college, Dr Thistlethwaite, around that key agricultural learning institution. Dr Thistlethwaite showed me some of the photos that had been put together as part of the college's history. The astonishing thing about those photos, taken over 100 years ago and reflecting what has happened in college growth over that time, was that, wherever there was a photograph of agricultural activity, the photograph was set to a backdrop that was denuded of trees. These photographs were very largely taken in the mid-north of South Australia, in some of South Australia's most productive country. The early settlers had taken what they thought was a very responsible decision in removing trees in order to increase productivity-and in the short term, of course, they were absolutely right. The removal of trees is not a recent phenomenon. Our early settlers quickly recognised that their soil, farming and tillage practices were encouraging soil erosion. So in South Australia we had not an urban initiative but a rural initiative to establish soil conservation boards. These soil conservation boards recognised that not only in the mid-north, but also in the Mallee areas of South Australia, in the fragile soils frequently exposed to drought, sandhills were growing larger and soil was moving. The work of these soil conservation boards found that, for example, the sowing of rye on sandhills allowed the sandhills to be held and crops to be re-established in the area. Predecessors of mine such as the Hon. Bert Kelly, a former member for Wakefield-he had his own farm in the Tarlee area of South Australia-established some of the early contour banking techniques that prevented the soil erosion problem from expanding. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to applaud what has been done by farmers in my State and around Australia to conserve Australia's precious agricultural topsoil. I am not critical of the land care program, though I suspect that we need to do much more than is being done, and I am not critical of the new-found enthusiasm that the electorate at large is showing for the environment and for care of the soil. I am critical of the fact that there has been very little recognition of the role played by farmers throughout my generation and previous generations to correct the difficulties being experienced on the land. I have to restate the case that frequently it has been the astute use of modern chemicals and modern techniques that have been developed by research and the astute adoption of recommendations from soil conservation boards around South Australia and across the nation that have enabled us to put in place soil conservation measures. This is not a recent phenomenon; it has gone on for some decades. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation currently before the House, which amends the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act's current provision for a committee with a maximum membership of seven, by lifting that level to 12, is something that the Opposition supports because it allows a greater input into the question of how we go about soil conservation. But we need to acknowledge that, before the Federal Government took a role in soil conservation and the establishment of land care programs, local communities, through their soil conservation boards, were already endeavouring to address many of the shortcomings. The difficulty they faced was, simply, inadequate funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition acknowledges that in this year's Budget the Government has increased funding for the national soil conservation program by more than 100 per cent, to $23.4m. That is applauded. The Government has said that it intends to provide a total of $260m to the program over the next 10 years. That is also applauded. But alongside what has just been made available to the Kodak company, suddenly soil conservation no longer seems to be the priority that it was presumed to be when the Prime Minister announced the Year of Land Care. What we are to spend on soil conservation in one year will not be as much as the money that has been offered to the Kodak company. I call on the Government to recognise the demand there is around Australia for sensitive soil conservation measures. The community is already prepared to make those conservation measures work but needs more realistic funding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly I will respond to the comments of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) about the land care program. I am pleased that the Opposition supports the Government's activities in this area. It is certainly an area that has been neglected by past governments. This Government, clearly, has recognised the need to fund land care. Certainly the Minister at the table, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), has been one of the forerunners in this area. I had the opportunity some time ago to visit the town of Inglewood in the area of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron), who I see is here, to represent the Minister. I watched at first hand the activities of the local farming community who have participated in a very successful land care program. Certainly the honourable member is correct in saying that farmers have been aware of the problem for many years but have not had the support from government which they are getting from this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) covered a number of issues which I am pleased to associate myself with. He shares my concern about the problems the people in Queensland have had with the National Party Government in that State. Hopefully, that will soon be rectified and Queensland will get back to some sort of order. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to be able to take the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) tonight. The changes that this Bill will bring into effect show this Government's determination to get moving industries that those opposite ran into the ground when they were in government. Part of this Bill will allow Wool Research and Development Fund moneys to be used for commercial exploitation of the results of research. Overall responsibility for planning, funding and coordinating research and development lies with the Wool Research and Development Council (WRDC). The Council's objective is to plan and recommend a research and development program with the principal aims of increasing demand through new products and processes and by more efficient production and marketing of wool textiles and increasing the efficiency of sustainable raw wool production. </PARA>
<PARA> The WRDC has an expenditure program of $56m for 1989-90, which is the largest fund established under the Government's rural industry research policy. It envisages growth in research and development expenditure over the next five years of a nominal 15 per cent per annum, with expenditure forecast to rise to $82.2m by 1993-94. The latest forecasts by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics have indicated that Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) stocks would close at 900,000 bales at the end of 1989-90. This would represent an increase of 712,000 bales over the closing stocks as at 30 June 1989. The market indicator was forecast to average 905 cubic kilograms in 1989-90, a fall of 7.6 per cent over the average for 1988-89. Despite the increased volume of wool exports, the fall in wool prices assumed in the Bureau's September forecast would mean that the value of wool exports would fall from $5,960m in 1989 to $4,910m in 1989-90 as a result of a shortage and uncertainty of foreign exchange in China and, to a lesser extent, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, two of Australia's major customers. </PARA>
<PARA> The current state of the wool market needs to be viewed against the longer term trend and movements. A significant expansion in production of wool in Australia has occurred. Production is now predicted to reach 1,027 kilotonnes in 1989-90, the largest clip on record and up by over 48 per cent since this Government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 is in line with the national soil conservation program (NSCP) which has expanded rapidly. The budget has increased from $6m in 1987-88 to $23.4m in 1989-90. Similar levels of funding have been promised by this Government over the next 10 years. Financial assistance is now provided under four subprograms: community land care support, research, major program support, and public awareness, education and training. The number of NSCP project applications received has risen from around 100 in early years to 500 in 1989-90. The Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985 currently provides for a soil conservation advisory committee with a maximum membership of seven, to make recommendations to the Minister with respect to priorities and strategies for activities by the Commonwealth relating to soil conservation and for matters relevant to the operation of the Act such as project selection. </PARA>
<PARA> On 26 October the Minister for Resources, Senator Peter Cook, announced the formation of a private company to manage a national information and education campaign in support of 1990, the Year of Land Care and the beginning of the Decade of Land Care. The land care initiatives have been welcomed by the rural community as a very positive step forward. These moves have been well received within the rural areas of my own electorate of Oxley and there are moves under way to establish land care groups. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the changes these amendments will bring is to increase the number of persons with experience and special knowledge of, or educational qualifications relevant to, soil conservation on the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee from not less than four to not less than five. This will bring the total number of the Committee to eight. The maximum number of members with these qualifications who can be appointed to the Committee has not yet been prescribed, to enable flexibility in appointing members without the need for further changes in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Research and Development Act 1985. These amendments will alter the Act to clarify the intention of allowing the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to invest surplus money in specified ways without needing to seek the permission of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for each transaction. At the close of the financial year 1988-89, the Meat and Live-stock Corporation's financial position was much better than at the end of June 1988. This year's operating situation shows a surplus of $15m. Some $12m of this year's surplus will be used to rebuild the Corporation's reserves. The turnaround in the financial position compared with the year ending 1988 can be attributed to an increase in income and reduction in the rate of organochlorin testing. Income flowing from higher levies which were operative for the full year resulted in a 58 per cent increase to $85m. Despite the increase, budgeted income for the period was adversely affected by a decline in sheep, lamb and cattle slaughtering. During the year, overall expenditure increased by 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The very good outlook for export markets has encouraged herd and flock rebuilding. In 1988-89, Australia exported 723,726 tonnes of meat. Exports to Japan and Korea grew strongly. The United States remains Aus- tralia's largest export market. (Quorum formed) I did not realise that I was saying anything that would upset the Opposition. I would have thought that honourable members opposite would have been quite prepared to support this legislation. However, I am pleased to see that all my colleagues are now in the chamber to support me. Obviously in the rural areas of Australia the farming community has a lot of concerns, and that is why this side of the House is the most strongly represented party in the rural sector of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, on the Queensland scene, come 2 December, there will be no-one left from the National Party of Australia. A moment ago I was providing a few statistics on the export of beef cattle and I made the point that the good outlook for export markets has encouraged herd and flock rebuilding. In 1988-89, Australia exported 723,726 tonnes of meat. Exports to Japan and Korea grew strongly. The United States remains Australia's largest export market. Shipments of beef, veal and mutton were restricted in late 1988 due to provisions in the United States meat import law. In August 1988 the United States asked Australia to `voluntarily' restrain beef, veal and mutton exports to the United States to 363,000 tonnes. Had the Government refused this request, the United States could have reduced access to its markets even further. The Government, after consultation with the Corporation and industry, reluctantly agreed. A further allocation of 5,800 tonnes, most of which was filled by Australian exporters, was given to Australia in December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Technical Developments Division of the Corporation ran four major projects in 1988-89. The producer feedback project aims to encourage over-the-hooks trading and the use of price grids which reflect market requirements. Following extensive research of consumers, home economists and retailers, the division developed a retail labelling system based on uses of various cuts. The system called `right meat' aims to increase consumer satisfaction with beef. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority for Uniform Specification Meat and Livestock-AUS-MEAT-started abattoir operations on 1 July 1987. Its initial charter was to implement a uniform language based on an objective measurement to describe meat and livestock. This was to be the cornerstone to establishing a system throughout the meat industry, with benefits to producers and buyers, both locally and overseas, of Australian meat. Firstly, it would allow buyers to describe their requirements using the language. Secondly, market needs could be passed on to the producers in terms everyone could understand, allowing producers to target markets through breeding or management. The AUS-MEAT system is based on accreditation of abattoirs and boning rooms which adopt certain standards of operations. AUS-MEAT area managers make unannounced visits to accredited establishments every 10 to 15 days to monitor the operations of the AUS-MEAT system. Establishments not satisfactorily maintaining their quality assurance program or misusing the language have it pointed out to their management. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments remove inconsistencies in the Act that resulted from amendments made in 1987. The effects of these amendments will be to provide greater flexibility to the operations of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research Development Corporation to recruit senior staff who are more suitable to carry out the duties of furthering the programs I have previously outlined. This Government has been one of the greatest reforming governments that this country has ever had. No matter how much those opposite carry on, those are the facts. These amendments will allow the various authorities named in this Bill to operate with greater efficiency and responsibility. I do not wish to take any further time. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

There is a long shaft of amendments: the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has taken the opportunity to introduce seven or eight amendments to various Acts. Of course, the legislation covers the whole spectrum of rural industry in Australia, which gives us a great opportunity to talk on almost anything, and I hope you note that, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Bill allows me, as the member for Maranoa, to talk on almost anything in respect of primary industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the House that the first amendment relates to the Australian Meat and Livestock Research Development Corporation and will allow it to invest surplus funds that it has at any time. It is nice to know that a corporation such as this may have surplus funds to invest. I guess that with 18.5 per cent interest on offer for investments, that is a fairly attractive thing for the Corporation to be doing. I am pleased that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is present and taking a keen interest in the debate on this legislation. I ask him: What is going on with live sheep exports to the Middle East? Why have hundreds of thousands of sheep exports worth $200m to $300m a year ceased? I wonder why it is that the Minister has not given up some of his valuable time to travel to the Middle East. I know that the Minister's opposite number in the Middle East took the opportunity to have a holiday just as the market crashed in a heap, but I would have thought that our Minister could have taken a bit of time off to travel to the Middle East to get this trade going again. It is most important for meat producers throughout Australia that this trade continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the honey levy collection. There are many honey producers in the electorate of Maranoa who travel with their hives out to the Channel country and Cooper Creek chasing the best of flowering gums, and they do an excellent job. A lot of our honey is exported, although most of it is consumed locally. We produce some of the purest honey in the world. At the moment there is a lot of hype about conservation and pure food, but the honey producers in Australia produce some delicious sweet honey. The legislation will help simplify the collection of the levy, and I point out once again that everything that moves in this country has a levy on it. The honey producers levied themselves and, with the help of the Government, there was a monthly collection of the levy, if honourable members can imagine that. We receive a form on our desk every mail day now. If one has a farm in the bush one gets a form that has to be filled in. These poor honey producers have had to fill in a form every month to put in a return. If they are paying less than $100 a month and up to $1,200 a year, they only have to pay annually. At least the honey producers will save a few stamps and allow themselves to make a bit more net profit. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to soil conservation. Where is the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice)? He raves and rants in here. He took the opportunity of mentioning my name and electorate. Previously I have spoken in this House about the chemical graslan. This bloke has set himself up as some expert on graslan in the State of Queensland. The truth of the matter is that the chemical graslan was actually imported from America. It was tested by this Labor Government. The Federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy tested graslan for a number of years, as it does with other chemicals before their release. The Minister's Department tested this chemical for a number of years before deciding that it could be released. It was released to the States of Queensland and New South Wales and the Northern Territory. Those State primary industry departments then carried out extensive tests on the use of graslan. </PARA>
<PARA> I am still waiting for the honourable member for Hinkler to get into the chamber so that he can listen to me talk on this subject. It is amazing how he makes comments and then ducks for cover and shoots outside. This graslan chemical is the safest chemical we can use. It is made up into a clay pellet. There is no spray drift. Most chemicals that are used are sprayed out of aircraft. This chemical is distributed out of aircraft in pellet form. It is used to control regrowth and to allow our grasslands to maintain their production. </PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing how people are concerned about trees in Australia, but most parts of Australia are covered by eucalypts and woody weeds, brigalow suckers and eucalypt suckers. The more we knock them about, the thicker they grow. It does not matter what we do to them, we cannot kill them. This chemical has been imported. It has been used in America for the last 20 years at no detriment to anybody. It is an excellent chemical to use. I have used it myself. We could grab a handful of it and throw it under some regrowth, some brigalow suckers. They will slowly die over 12 months because the chemical goes through the ground into the root system as it rains. We hope that the things curl up and perish because the regrowth is the sort of stuff that we do not want when we are trying to run sheep and cattle. We are not running giraffes. Our stock do not feed from the tops of trees. They feed on grass. We need to thicken the grass to make a living. There is nothing wrong with the use of graslan. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hinkler also mentioned drought aid to Queensland. Under a fair distribution of drought aid, when will Queensland get its share of drought aid. The Minister has cut off drought aid. The honourable member talks about drought. We are trying to conserve and save our productive sector for export. But as soon as there is mention of a bit of a rort on in Queensland-we have had an inquiry but nobody has been charged with the misuse of drought funds-this Government cuts off funds to Queensland entirely. We have had no drought aid at all for six or 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the honourable member for Hinkler? He is still not in this chamber. In his speech he attacked the Queensland Government. He attacked the Minister, Neville Harper, for what he had done. Neville Harper set up the inquiry. We have looked at the drought aid problem and have come up with recommendations. Nobody has been charged with the misuse of funds. This Minister and this Government have still restricted the amount of funds that go to Queensland. They persecute us because we happen to have a National Party Government. I want to tell the Minister that the National Party in Queensland will continue to help primary producers in that State to preserve the cattle and sheep herds of Queensland, which are badly needed to boost the balance of payments with which this Labor Government has put us down the gurgler. We need as many exports as we can get. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to praise the Minister. I only hope that the breakthrough that we may be getting with the Americans on the subsidisation of grain comes to fruition, that we can continue to talk them out of the heavy subsidisation that takes place with their grain sales throughout the world. That also applies to Europe. I again mention the files and forms that appear on the desks of downtrodden farmers. The number of forms sent to barley producers has been reduced from 20 to four. I praise the Minister for this initiative. I certainly support this amendment. Those of us who run a farm or a small business are absolutely inundated. We practically have to employ a full time secretary these days to fill out all the forms that we receive from the Government as well as dealing with the questionnaires and levies we have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard an awful lot about wheat and the Wheat Marketing Act of late. We have had long-winded debates in this House. I would like to point out to the Minister that Bulk Grains Queensland is asking for funds. It is $80m in debt. Since the wheat market has been deregulated, Bulk Grains and the grain growers of Queensland are finding it practically impossible to keep up the interest and redemption payments. I put it to the Minister that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his cohorts in Cabinet, Dawkins and company, are prepared to give Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd $30m or $40m just like that. The silver bodgie, the Prime Minister, represents that area. We are the battling farmers. The Government has deregulated the wheat industry. Eighty million dollars is owed. The Government can give the banks $200m. It is not as if the banks need help, for God's sake, but they got $200m to keep home loan interest rates down. Why could they not have given borrowers some of their profits? Why did the Government have to stitch up a deal with the banks and give them a bit more interest? Surely they could have paid the home-owners a bit out of the profits they have made. But no, the banks are not allowed to reduce their profit margins; they cannot do that. They have to have some special deal stitched up by the Treasurer. The poor wheat farmers' Queensland organisation is going bankrupt. It is $80m in debt. It has built this export facility in Brisbane. It is asking for help. What is the Federal Government doing? It is not doing a damned thing: not lifting a finger to help. That is the wheat part of the Bill covered, involving the transfer of funds for wheat research. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Bass Strait Freight Adjustment Levy Act. That is doing away with-I hope-the import parity pricing policy. It was apparently terminated in 1987. There are four amendments relating to this that do away with it. That is the best thing that we ever did. I was always opposed to the Fraser-Anthony Government introducing import parity on our oil production. I thought it was the worst economic move that we ever made. I was proved right in the end; it has been abolished. Unfortunately, the tax that was collected can never be done away with. It was moved to the pump. It was moved from the well-head, and it is now taken into excise on fuel, on petrol. The excise tax paid on petrol is now 22c a litre. It has gone from 6c to 22c. At least it is better than the parity pricing, the iniquitous set-up where we tried to control the world price of oil. No sooner had we done that than the Arab group fell to pieces, and of course we fell to pieces as well because the income was not there. So the taxation was moved across to the pump. The Government had to do that to continue the welfare payouts. It is a pity it could not abolish the tax because the fuel industry in this country is super-taxed. I believe that the taxes on the industry ought to be reduced. If we are to remain self-sufficient in fuel, we have to take a very close look at the taxing regime and reduce it substantially. All this Government has done is increase it. </PARA>
<PARA> The main amendments in this Bill relate to the Wool Marketing Act. A number of members have spoken about this Act. I am still waiting for the honourable member for Hinkler to come in and listen to me. I do not know where he is. He has made all sorts of statements tonight but he has still not appeared again. I would be very grateful if he could lever himself off his couch and leave his can of beer to one side and come and listen to what I am saying. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry is our biggest industry. Last year it earned $5.4 billion in exports, which was 12.4 per cent of the total of $33 1/2 billion in Australian exports. Unfortunately for the Government, it is expected that the income from wool this year will be down to $4.2 billion. The Wool Corporation informed me that it will not be lowering the floor price. It has never been lowered and it is not the intention of the Corporation to lower it. It may have to maintain the floor price at its present level. It will be reviewed next June. The Corporation is absolutely emphatic in this regard, and it is important to tell the buyers of this product that the price of wool will not be lowered. </PARA>
<PARA> The floor price scheme is a great cost to our woolgrowers. Approximately $200m a year is collected from the growers and is put into a revolving fund. Recently, they were paid back a couple of hundred million dollars but each year the growers have to roll in another couple of hundred million and the fund is built up. The Corporation has actually spent over $1 billion in the last six months buying in 1.1 million bales of wool at a cost of about $1,000 a bale plus storage and interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Corporation has about $800m left to continue to buy in at the floor price. After that it has to borrow funds against the stockpile. It has a capital investment in the stockpile, about one-third of which is sent overseas. It is being stored in countries such as Japan for immediate sale to users. Until the wool is sold the value is not included in export income, but it is included from the moment it is sold. </PARA>
<PARA> Maranoa has many woolgrowers. Woolgrowing is one of the bigger industries in the electorate. It is of great concern to all of us that the price of wool has not remained as high as it should have for a longer period. If it had, many producers would have been able to overcome their economic problems. The wool industry still suffers the high interest rates of this Government but I will not divert on to that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) made a very good speech last year about how high interest rates were. He was perfectly correct when he said that some producers were paying up to 27 per cent interest on the money required to stay in business. Australia is getting to the level of New Zealand because that is the sort of interest rate New Zealand producers have to pay to stay in business. As the honourable member for Gwydir said, it is an absolute disgrace that producers should be forced to pay 27 per cent interest. How can anybody pay such an interest rate and survive? They cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> Some good things have been happening in the wool industry. A very advanced artificial insemination (AI) centre was opened on 11 October on Haddon Rig stud, which is one of the leading studs in Australia. It produces fine wool and many sheep that are used locally and overseas. It is a great plus for the industry and I wish it every success in its new venture. It is not really a new venture; it is more of an extension of its operations. The AI centre was set up so that overseas buyers can purchase rams and hold them at the centre, and semen can be taken into quarantine and then exported. It is a very good development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) indicated quite clearly why he has lost preselection. I would like to thank all honourable members who have spoken in the debate, including the honourable member for Maranoa, and I shall touch briefly on some of the comments made. The debate has ranged widely on this very large omnibus Bill. I thought that that was appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most comments by honourable members related to the wool industry. I should like to join with honourable members, all of whom said that the wool floor price scheme is working very well and that they have total confidence in it. The present situation with the Australian Wool Corporation buying in duplicates occured on two previous occasions on which funds were applied to exactly the use for which they were accumulated. As the stockpiles were sold off on each occasion, the industry reaped quite a large gain. I am quite sure that the second half of the present wool selling season will see a different situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), quite rightly said that what is being done with wool research and development to some extent is a compromise. Basically the wool industry wanted to retain the status quo. I take the view that we cannot tolerate a situation in which some of the major recipients of wool research funding distribute the funds to themselves. There are real and distinct advantages in having research and development to some extent at arm's length from the marketing organisation. I believe sincerely that the wool industry is different inasmuch as the fact that there is an International Wool Secretariat means that the disbursement of funds and the clear links from marketing through to product development certainly assume a profile different from that in other industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving to a full corporation would certainly have had advantages to the industry, though we probably have the best of both worlds with an enhanced council. Moving to a corporation means moving into joint ventures, capitalising the benefits of any patents, and mobilising additional funds, and the management of such a research organisation has more flexibility. It can employ staff on more flexible conditions. By and large, in the papers accompanying the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on science and technology including research innovation and competitiveness we are setting out for the whole portfolio what principles should prevail, what the advantages are, and the various structures that we can erect. The Opposition tends to fail to look at principles at times; it picks up more acutely on the debate or the wishes of the various farm interest groups instead of looking at what the Government is on about, and making criticisms of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party made two statements which were simply untrue. The Government has not announced the termination of wool promotion in any final sense. What the wool industry now has is three years of assured funds and then another decision will be taken. I will not revisit history but all governments through time have had a problem with wool promotion. The razor gang in the infamous days of the Fraser-Howard Government slashed wool promotion back to $20m. It has always been subject to the whim of the fiscal fiend and quite frankly that is a disastrous approach. Wool promotion is one way of an Australian government saying where its earnest is as far as Australia's greatest export earning industry is concerned. We must look at this intellectually. As it is the only industry to which government gives money for promotion, it is somewhat inconsistent. But the wool industry has sufficient place in this country to warrant the continuation of wool promotion. If wool promotion is ever to be terminated, the industry has to be given a lot of notice of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The other claim by the Deputy Leader of the National Party to which I take exception is, to use his exact words, that there was tremendous pressure from the Australian Government on the Australian Wheat Board with respect to the Fisherman Island incident during the time that the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) was negotiating a package that could be put together for three months. I point out that WIRA is one person. I was certainly very much of the view that I should back very strongly the Government's position that we accepted the Inter-State Commission's advice, that WIRA had been established and that we were in the three-month period of negotiation. We now know what came out of that three-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> I put no pressure on the Board. I heard various rumours to the effect that the National Party Government in Queensland, the National Farmers Federation, Bulk Grains Queensland, Mr Ahern and Mr Harper were getting involved and were going to pull a stunt at Fisherman Island. I made an inquiry of the Chairman of the Wheat Board in the first instance to ask what was going on. He said he would get back to me, which he did. I pointed out that WIRA was being misrepresented. People were talking about the need for representation on WIRA when it comprised only one person. In another telephone conversation I simply spelt out the Government's position but issued no instruction. I said it was entirely up to the Wheat Board how it handled the matter. There have been further negotiations and the number of people at Fisherman Island has been reduced from six to two. I understand that various people in the industry want only one person to supervise the loading of ships at Fisherman Island. This will be a matter for industrial resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party made another point with respect to the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia. This issue is still so sensitive that I cannot go into all the details of it. It is my job to solve the problem rather than to blab about it and tell everyone every little detail I get to know about it. If the Opposition wishes to prove to the industry that it has the industry's interest at heart and is taking a keen interest in this issue, I am quite happy to affirm to the industry that the Opposition is as concerned about this matter as is the Government. But, if the Opposition wishes to embarrass the Government, I am afraid that I will simply take the view that I have taken and I will act on my judgment about all the professional advice I am getting on this issue. There is no sense in my going there. It would have been a positive impediment to resolution of the matter if I had gone to Saudi Arabia when the Minister was not there to talk to. It was not advised that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) should write to the King, the custodian of the two holy mosques, until we had an answer from the Minister for Agriculture and Water. That has now taken place and I believe, as does the industry-there has been a lot of consultation with the industry, including for nearly all of today-that we are handling this matter in a very professional manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not link the Prime Minister's involvement on the canned fruit issue with the Saudi live sheep issue. Canada is a different society from Saudi Arabia. Whenever any Minister is abroad, whether it be the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) or me, we are all de facto Ministers for Trade in a way. It was very handy that the Prime Minister could take up the canned fruit issue with Prime Minister Mulroney. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) made quite a few comments about environmental matters. He touched on land degradation and drought assistance and referred to some of the scandals in Queensland. I give much credit to the honourable member for Hinkler because, had it not been for him, the waste of taxpayers' money by the Queensland Government on supposed drought assistance would have gone unnoticed. Quite frankly, I did not believe some of the allegations around. I was very much aware of the rumours. I have to deal in an ongoing fashion with whoever is my corresponding Minister in Queensland because we both act in the interests of the farmers of Queensland from the Commonwealth and State level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Public Accounts Committee unanimously reported that some $30m of taxpayers' money had been wasted on drought transport subsidies and that up to $300,000 went to some individual companies. That report was an indictment of the National Party administration, and was all the more damning because the report from the Committee was unanimous, and the majority of members of the Committee were members of the National Party. The report was explicitly critical of the administration of the previous Minister. But the Queensland National Party has not really learned anything from the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, from the Public Accounts Committee inquiry or anything else. There has simply been a series of manoeuvres by Sir Robert Sparkes to get rid of whichever Premier he does not want. Mr Harper attempted to answer the charges against him. He ignored three of the Committee's five criticisms. His answer to the other two is that Queensland Ministers are allowed to treat public servants as arbitrarily as they like and to spend the money as they like. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to deal with other Queensland Ministers in other forums. It is really sad to see people in that Government who simply do not understand the issues of accountability that apply to Ministers and members on both sides of this House. They seem to think that one can have a hillbilly dictatorship and that that is the way things are played. As I have said, it is quite sad. The standard of public administration accepted by the new Queensland Premier is pretty bad. The new Minister for Primary Industries-I have not met him yet-went around the State asking those who would have benefited from the waste of money what they thought. Surprise, surprise! They did not want any change. So the Queensland Government has decided to continue the policies; nothing has changed. The argument is that the Public Accounts Committee's recommendations would damage the grazing industry. That is nonsense. Only a small proportion of graziers benefit from the waste of money, and they are mainly the big pastoral companies. The pastoral industries in other States get along satisfactorily without that sort of waste. Other States handle the matter with decency and honesty-not maladministration. That is why we acted against the Queensland Government's waste of money by taking drought out of the natural disaster relief arrangements and establishing a task force to report to me on long term drought policy early next year. </PARA>
<PARA> While our long term drought policy will depend on the task force's report, we will certainly not be paying any more money to the Queensland Nationals while they are so corrupt and hopeless at administration. When we hear of things like this, is it any wonder that the farmers in Queensland are backing the Australian Labor Party? The only hope for that State is for it to get a Labor government after all these years of crooked government. </PARA>

I make one point here: I agree with him partially and disagree with him partially. Farmers have shown some magnificent examples of soil conservation, but there are still some bad examples. At the end of the day, as I am sure he would rightly concede, there is more chance of people on the land caring for the land than if governments put down legislative prescriptions or regulations. What farmers really need is a bit of encouragement. The land care project being administered by my colleague the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) is simply just the way to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two Bills under discussion are the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1989 and the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. It might be helpful if I dispose of the latter Bill first. As far as the Opposition is concerned, that Bill is largely unexceptional and we are prepared to support it. The Bill itself is really a matter of tidying up certain amendments relating to the Overseas Students Charge Act. Those amendments are consequential upon the passing of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989 but, because it was a tax Act, the original amendments could not be made in the former Bill; they have to be made separately. Thus this Bill contains a clause to amend the definition of `overseas student' to reflect amendments previously made in the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. For consistency, we are more than happy to support that Bill. I think it should be noted that, in this legislation and in the other Bill, essentially we will be dealing with tidying up exercises where certain defects have been found in the drafting. Clearly, some amendments were made to the Overseas Students Charge Act that would have been ineffective. They would have been ineffective simply because it was not done in a separate Bill, as required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second and more substantial piece of legislation is the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill. Again, this Bill will make a number of amendments-people like to use these words-to correct unintended operations of that Act and to satisfy the promise made to me by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) during debate on that legislation. It is that latter matter, which is the most substantial aspect of this legislation, that I will be addressing. </PARA>
<PARA> In order that my discussion might be complete, let me note that the main provisions of this legislation concern the definition of a properly endorsed entry visa that is to be inserted in the Act. At the moment there is only a definition of `properly endorsed valid entry permit' while entry under visa is allowed on pre-checked flights. Under section 9 of the principal Act this amendment will allow the visa to be endorsed overseas, and it is to amend section 11 of the principal Act to place people entering under such a document in the same position as a non-citizen who may become an illegal entrant due to providing false or misleading information. Amendments under new section 11e aim to enable the quick issue of tourist visas. In new subsection (18) and section 20 certain amendments require people making decisions under those sections to consider only prescribed matters and it is aimed to promote consistency. The power to arrest a person who has escaped from custody will be made clear in amendments to paragraph 17 (n) of the principal Act and the principal Act will be amended to allow a regulation to fix fees to be charged for English language tests. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the most substantial matter involves an amendment to subsection 17a (2) of section 8 of the principal Act, which provides that the Minister must deport an illegal immigrant if satisfied that the person is liable for deportation. It is known as the mandatory deportation provision and it has been a fairly controversial question. The amendment will require the Minister to follow prescribed procedures before becoming satisfied that the person is eligible for deportation. This amendment aims to address certain difficulties arising from the removal of ministerial discretion in certain cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his explanation during the second reading debate said that during the passage of the amendment Act concerns were expressed by the Opposition that it was possible, under its provisions, that a person recognised by Australia as a refugee could unintentionally be expelled by being deported or being required to depart. The Minister noted that he gave assurances that this would not be able to occur. He said that to ensure that those legitimate concerns are put to rest and his assurances kept, provision is to be made for procedures and criteria for the exercise of powers of expulsion and for that to be prescribed in regulation. That is the explanation of the substantial matter that we are dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to note here that I do regard it as important that, where there are exceptional circumstances of a compassionate or humanitarian kind which affect particularly refugees, it would be absolutely preposterous if mandatory deportation provisions were actioned and a Minister could not stop that procedure if it were put in place by some accident or omission on the part of officers. The Minister believed that he would be able to do that when he gave me the assurance. He believed that he would be able to ensure that nobody would be deported if they had valid refugee claims or if there were proper compassionate circumstances. Of course, what he has found, presumably on advice now, is that that view he had was wrong. It shows a certain inadequacy in the preparation of this matter, I suspect, because it was one of considerable comment. But I am pleased that he has endeavoured to honour the undertaking that he gave. New subsection 17a (2) of section 8 deals with that matter. Essentially, it is very simple. The new subsection states:</PARA>
<PARA> Insert ``, after following the prescribed procedures,'' after ``Minister'' (first occurring). </PARA>
<PARA>It is also proposed that new subsection 18 (1) be added to section 8. The new subsection states:</PARA>
<PARA> Insert ``, after considering the prescribed matters and no other matters,'' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make a number of points in relation to that and I would seek certain assurances from the Minister as to the way in which this question is going to be addressed. At the moment the explanation is that the Minister is going to prescribe certain procedures that have to be followed and certain questions that will have to be asked by officers before this mandatory deportation provision is actioned. Presumably, if those procedures are not followed, a person would be able to seek redress before a court to ensure that he was not deported. There is a further embargo. It is proposed to insert after `Minister', presumably the decision maker, the words:</PARA>
<PARA>`, after considering the prescribed matters and no other matters,' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is a matter that I think needs to be looked at. We are in a situation where we are going to consider putting in place a procedure when we have not yet seen what are to be the prescribed procedures to be followed. In other words, the regulatory framework is not before us. Yet, the courts which are to deal with these matters are being told that no matters are to be entertained other than those dealt with by the prescribed procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not wish to deny passage to this legislation. But I would again seek from the Minister either an undertaking that those regulations will be made available to us before the Senate has finished dealing with this legislation or, alternatively, his assurance that these matters will be properly referred to the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the committee that is looking at the reasonableness of these provisions. I note that the Minister interjected and said that he believes that that is to occur. I welcome that assurance because it seems to me that the kernel of this matter is the way in which the regulations themselves are framed and the extent to which there are proper protections where this very onerous provision operates. As I say, I thank the Minister for his comment and I assume that it will be put in the form of an undertaking when he responds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make a number of other brief comments in relation to the shape of this legislation that we are amending. When the legislation was before the House previously, a number of points were the subject of very considerable discussion. One of them-because we are putting in place a regulatory framework-involved the question of ministerial discretion. One of the compromises that were reached between the Opposition and the Government was that where the words `the Secretary' were used in legislation the words `the Minister' were substituted. The purpose of that was to ensure that ministerial discretion, where discretion was to exist in the migration legislation, would be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition regarded that question as being of a threshold nature. Yet, it does appear that there is some confusion in the minds of the Government and its advisers as to what has been done. I note that during the hearings of Estimates Committee E on 28 September 1989 the Minister's adviser, Mr Gibbons, was asked to comment on certain publications that were being made available and the money that was being appropriated for the provision of them. Senator Durack questioned Mr Gibbons about the broad parameters that were to be followed in relation to the recasting and rewriting of immigration procedures and pamphlets. Mr Gibbons said:</PARA>
<PARA>The rationale is that there has been a radical change to the migration law which comes into force on 19 December. That involves a shift from the situation where the Minister has absolute discretion to one where he has none unless the law, in the form of regulations, provides it. All the rules for immigration decision making are being made in regulations. Those rules provide that the applicant be told up-front precisely what the law is and what the guidelines on administering any areas of discretion admitted in the law are. There is a need to produce instruction manuals for our staff and information material for our clients and revise every form that we use . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make it very clear that my understanding is that the very reason we have the Migration Regulations Committee is to examine those regulations to ensure that the discretion to deal with compassionate and humanitarian circumstances which exist in policy now is put in place in this regulatory framework. So I am concerned when it is suggested that a considerable shift occurred when this legislation was promulgated. The only shift so far as I am concerned is that the discretion has to be set out in the regulatory framework and that the discretion that the Minister has had will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently had drawn to my attention a letter that was written by the Minister's private secretary. I do not know whether it is a confidential letter. The person who received it gave it to me. But the Minister's private secretary seems to be perpetuating this view. I want to quote a paragraph from that letter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>You have suggested discretionary powers to take account of such situations. You will be aware that as a result of recent changes to the Migration Act, policies on applications for entry and for residence are currently being enacted into regulations. These will guide decision makers in applying the provisions of the Act in a consistent and fair manner. It is not expected however that the regulations will result in discretionary provisions of the kind you propose. Such discretionary provisions would also be at odds with Australia's non-discriminatory migration policy. To allow for special consideration for one group of applicants would go against this fundamental principle of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I must say that in this case the gentleman concerned was asking for certain special account to be taken of the circumstances of those who were victims of oppression in Iran. He was putting forward characteristics of a humanitarian kind for which special provision might be made. Yet the Minister's private secretary says that there will be no scope for this under the changes to the Migration Act. As I understand it, special provisions are already in place in relation to people from the Lebanon. Nobody has said that that is at odds with Australia's non-discriminatory migration policy. The fact is that the matter that is taken into account is that of humanitarian considerations. One would believe that a judgment would be made as to whether or not special account should be taken of the circumstances in other countries. But that has nothing to do with discrimination in terms of race, religion or anything else of that character. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that there appears to be a view-and it has been put to people by the Minister's office-that there will not be a capacity to deal with characteristics of a humanitarian or compassionate kind. That goes against the thrust of Government policy as I have understood it over time and the regulations which a committee of this Parliament has been asked to review against that policy. I would hope that the Minister would ensure that the comments of his senior advisers and the correspondence from his office reflect the decisions and agreements that were reached in this Parliament leading to the establishment of a committee and the decisions that were reached whereby the legislation was allowed to pass with certain amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill sought to enact certain provisions relating to the regulation of migration agents. The provisions were in two parts: they repealed the provisions that formerly existed in the Act and they dealt with the definition of migration agents; the requirement to notify the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs of the intention to work as a migration agent; the Minister's express powers to direct that persons cannot act as migration agents; the provision setting out maximum charges that can be demanded by migration agents; the requirement to furnish fees to authorised officers of the Department on request; and the requirement to provide passage or make passage arrangements for non-citizens within specified time limits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his second reading speech commented that those provisions were outdated and he put in place what I would call consumer protection provisions which put the onus on a party who has a complaint with a migration agent to pursue new remedies which are created under the Act. I must say that when I looked at those provisions at the time it did not seem to be unreasonable to make that change. The new provisions created a new offence, where migration agents claim that they can influence decision making by certain officers, either by themselves or through a third person. They also made migration agents more accountable to their clients, giving them two important consumer rights-that is, the right to receive a detailed statement of services performed and their charges, and the right to seek reparation of losses incurred where a migration agent commits an offence against division 6 of the Act. The explanatory memorandum to those provisions noted that this right to seek damages would be the most effective control of the actions of migration agents. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time I was not aware of some of the complaints that have now come to my attention about the conduct of immigration agents. I notice that the Minister has issued a press release in which he has warned people, counselled people, that they should be on their guard in relation to the activities of immigration agents. But it seems to me that a lot of very undesirable activities are occurring and they are of a character which demand the attention of this Parliament. I would go further and suggest that the Minister needs to review the provisions that he put in place in this legislation and to do so before it is proclaimed on 19 December. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear the honourable member's comments. The Minister may care to note them. During our consideration of the estimates for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, I asked the Minister what efforts have been taken to use the existing provisions for controlling the activities of immigration agents. I stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Will the Government be relying on clients only to seek redress under amendments to the Immigration Act or to use consumer protection law? I raise that question relating to agents in the context of illegal immigration because of the large number of complaints that are now coming to notice of large amounts of money being paid to individuals holding themselves out to assist people with applications for a change of status. The distinct probability is that those people holding themselves out to assist are not able to do so and very large amounts of money are being lost to individuals because of those representations. It seems that, notwithstanding an increase in the numbers of illegal immigrants located . . . there was still a net increase in the number of overstayers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The point I was making then was that problems were arising. The separate questions that I posed do not appear to have been answered by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Department has been able to formulate a procedure for the accreditation of migration consultants to service business migrants. It has done so by contract. Certain fees are charged. I have seen copies of the agreements. A very comprehensive scrutiny is involved. The only basis upon which applications can be submitted by such people on behalf of clients is if the agent is registered. So there is very close supervision. The licensing of consultants who service the rich is quite comprehensive, but the regulation of the agents who service the poor is almost non-existent. The point needs to be made that those people who use migration agents in general are the ones who most need protection. They tend to be the illiterate, the poor, the people who have little command of English. Often they are frantic to seek assistance because of their lack of expertise and, I might say, the inability of departmental officers to provide adequate assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that officers are cautious about offering advice, particularly after the Shaddock and Parramatta Council case in which some personal liability might be incurred. Members of Parliament should consider that when constituents go to their offices. We give advice and counsel in circumstances where people cannot get advice and counsel from the Department. We produce forms and information for people to read, but very often they lack the capacity to do so. So they seek an explanation from other people who, in many cases, are not qualified to offer it. People are now holding themselves out to be advisers and some are solicitors. Generally speaking, solicitors are licensed by their respective law societies. Incompetence and dishonesty should be dealt with by their professional bodies. I still hold a practising certificate and I would not want to reflect upon any colleagues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are certain ethics in relation to these matters. Nevertheless, some are not as expert as others and that is a matter of concern to me. Maybe what we need in this area is what is being encouraged in family law, whereby people who have some expertise can be put on an appropriate list or referred to by law societies, or whatever, in respective States. However, there are others who have no particular training but who hold themselves out to be agents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are numerous complaints. I refer honourable members to some newspaper articles I have seen. Only recently there was in the Australian an article under the byline of Adam Courtenay headed, `Scared Chinese ripped off in migration rorts'. Somebody from my office has gone through the circumstances mentioned in that article with the people involved. Certainly, prima facie, large numbers of Chinese students are being forced to pay large sums of money, even though they are counselled in their newspapers and the like not to do so. There are people advertising in newspapers who are holding themselves out as agents and creating fear. There is one advertisement in the Daily Telegraph which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Overstayed students or visitors</PARA>
<PARA> This may be your last chance</PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Federal Government approved an amendment to the Migration Act. . .these amendments are expected to become law in December</PARA>
<PARA> One of the Section will cover persons who are overstayed and automatic deportation is intended against you</PARA>
<PARA> Talk to [us] now!!!</PARA>
<PARA>People then get into those offices and in many cases there are no independent witnesses. They are asked to pay money up front and certain representations are made. No receipts are issued and there is little evidence that the offence that this Act says is likely to lead to prosecution has been established; the Department would not be able to deal with it. But the reports are legion. </PARA>
<PARA> The large number of people advertising their services in a way which preys upon people under great stress embarrasses me. Not so long ago it was occurring amongst the Fijian Indians who had made their way to Australia after the coup. Now, after the massacre in China, people are holding themselves out as agents to offer advice. A certain agent in Sydney has told his clients that as a result of the Chinese massacre only 3,000 students will be able to stay as permanent residents and that he has the capacity to squeeze students into this quota, provided they pay for it. </PARA>

The charge of $3,475 was made to process the application for change of status. These matters are of concern to me and they should be of concern to all honourable members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What troubles me is that the capacity of the Department to act in these matters appears most limited. I suspect that, notwithstanding what the Minister has said in his press release about encouraging people to be wary, we are in a situation where his power to assist is extremely limited and those people who are being ripped off will not be able to obtain redress. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek additional regulation, but it seems to me that, where it is required, it ought to be looked at in a constructive way. I am very concerned about what is happening in this area. It is the Chinese students who are now being exploited. When we look at the way in which we responded to the massacre in Tiananmen Square we can appreciate why we ought to be very conscious that they not be ripped off in the way which is occurring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), raised a number or questions in relation especially to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill. The most profitable thing that can be done is to try to deal with some of the problems that he has raised. I make the general observation that these problems are more apparent than real. We are in the process of putting into place probably the biggest changes in the migration system and in the Migration Act for 40 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member said that he would like an assurance that certain regulations will go to the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations for consideration. He is a member of that Committee, of which I have the honour of being the Chairman. The fact is that we are considering a huge amount of regulations that have come out of the previous Act. The point about those regulations is that they are intended to put into place an entirely new approach to the immigration system. The approach which they are putting into place is that, whereas previously many issues were left to subjective judgment on the basis of rules that were given to various immigration officers which they could follow if they chose to or, if they chose to ignore, could justify, now we will have a much more objective international system. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important point because that objective international system is intended to make the immigration program a non-discriminatory program around the world. It is intended that those criteria apply, as far as is humanly possible, equally around the world. The various marks that will be given in the points system will be put into the computer, which will then put them into the pool. Then at a given moment-every six months in the first year and every four months in the second and consequent years-the computer will choose from that pool the number determined as the total number going through the immigration system. We have a completely new approach, a completely new objective process, in immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, naturally when the Act and the regulations were drafted, one might have imagined that there would be some areas which required further legislation or further amendment. That is what this Bill does. The shadow Minister ought not reflect on either the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs or the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), both of whom have done a massive job in putting together the new policy, the new Act, the new rules, the new handbooks and now the new regulations. An enormous job had to be done.</PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, there are areas which needed further clarification. This does not reflect badly on the Department; I think it reflects well on the Department and on the Minister that we have already identified some problem areas even before the Act goes into place on 19 December. I reject the comments of the honourable member for Dundas that there are inadequacies in the Department. This is not an inadequacy; it is simply the recognition that an enormous job has had to be done. In the process of doing that job we have identified certain areas that needed further clarification and further legislation, and that is what we are about to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dundas, referred to assurances that he had received about the procedures in relation to mandatory deportation provisions. He was basically saying: Will there be new regulations consequent upon this legislation becoming law? The answer to that is yes. The new regulations will be supplementary to the regulations which are being considered at present by the Migration Regulations Committee. The further regulations that will come up will most likely-subject to the matter being further looked at by the Minister and his approval-go before the Migration Regulations Committee in its next phase of considerations, after it has considered the existing regulations which have just come before it in penultimate form. The answer is that there will be new regulations within this framework in relation to the mandatory deportation provisions. That is a very good thing. The new regulations will specify the procedures which the Minister will go through and will probably be considered by the Migration Regulations Committee in order to ensure that they meet the various considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the question of whether a residual power will reside with the Minister in relation to exceptional circumstances which might come to his attention. As far as I understand it, the answer again on this point is yes; but if the Minister makes a determination under such a provision, then he is required to specify reasons for such a determination before the Senate. That is required under the procedures before the House of Representatives. As I understand it, when the Minister makes a provision which is outside the bounds of the regulations themselves, he is required to make a special statement in relation to that in the Senate or the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the next point raised by the shadow Minister in relation to the discretion of the Minister. The honourable member made many points. He said, `If we can have special provisions for the people of the Lebanon, how come the Minister cannot have discretion to deal with, for example, the situation in Iran, or if, say, something else breaks out in another part of the world where humanitarian considerations might come into play, why cannot the Minister have discretion in relation to that?'. I think what has happened here is that the word `discretion' is being bandied about a little bit in a number of contexts. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the shadow Minister took out of context parts of the letter from which he read. He tried to maintain that, if in some part of the world a situation arose which required special action by the Minister, then the Minister would not have the ability to deal with that situation. That is not correct; the Minister would be able to deal with it. In that situation the Minister can bring down regulations of the kind which we are considering in relation to the people of the Lebanon. What are we doing with the Lebanon situation? We have specific regulations to deal with that case. If a special situation arises in another part of the world which requires further determinations, then we will bring down another set of regulations to deal with those specific instances. That is the way in which the Minister has a discretion-to use the term of the honourable member for Dundas-to deal with a special problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as if the Minister does not have a power to deal with exceptional situations; but where the Minister does not have a discretion is in not being able to overthrow the regulations and act independently of the regulations, except in the special cases I mentioned where he tables an explanation in the House of Representatives or the Senate in relation to that. So the Minister does have an additional discretion in certain cases to go outside the regulations, but that only when the Minister can table the reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue that was raised by the honourable member for Dundas has been, continues to be, and can be, dealt with by either the promulgation of additional regulations in relation to a specific group or, if the Minister feels, for example, that there is not enough time for the promulgation of such regulations, he would be able to deal with it by making an explanation in the House of Representatives or the Senate. I believe that those two issues which have been raised by the shadow Minister are capable of being dealt with and can be dealt with by the procedures which have been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the shadow Minister's comments in relation to migration agents. I think every member of the House would share the concern that he has about migration agents and people who pretend to be able to do things for migrants, whether or not they are registered agents. As honourable members will know, under the new rules there will be no registration of agents except in the business migration area. We are all concerned about people who purport to be agents or purport to be able to help people and then rip them off. That is precisely why new legislation has been introduced-because we want to be able to deal with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister pointed to examples which have applied in the past, about which we are concerned, but I remind him that the new rules will not be put into place until 19 December. After 19 December, very tough provisions will be in place. First, people who consider themselves to be ripped off by a migration agent or anyone purporting to help them in immigration matters will be able to deny payment to that person. They will have the full support of the law in making such a denial. In other words, the onus will be on the person who purports to be an agent to prove or to show that the service has been delivered. The onus will not be on the person to whom the service has been delivered. Secondly, if money has been paid to such a person, an application can be made to a court that misrepresentation has taken place and the court will be able to make restitution to that person. There is a consumer-type protection for people who have been ripped off by migration agents or people purporting to be able to help them in immigration matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, there will be provisions for the punishment of people who misrepresent claims. I refer, for example, to people who try to give guaranteed assurances that they can help people to remain in Australia, or people who suggest that they have a special method of approaching officers of the Department, the Minister or a member of parliament in such a way that they are able to assure or guarantee that that person will be successful in his immigration application. That kind of misrepresentation will be punishable; it will be considered to be a criminal offence. Those are the two aspects: there will be redress on the consumer side and there will be redress on the other side in terms of criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that the honourable member for Dundas should suggest that these provisions are insufficient, yet he did not suggest what additional provisions might be possible or necessary in order to assist the situation. He seemed to be suggesting that we should return to some system of registration of people who purport to be agents. But there are two problems with that. Any provision to protect people, including the poor-and he talked about protecting the poor-would apply only to the registered agents. Under the new rules, anyone, whether he is registered or not, who purports to help a migrant and who takes money for that purpose is subject to those rules. So a much broader spectrum of people is covered than would be covered under a registration system. Anybody who is ripped off by a person promising to help them in immigration matters will be covered by this law. The suggestion that we should have some system of formal registration in a sense defeats the purpose and would make the situation more narrow. So we reject that approach. </PARA>
<PARA> We suggest that anyone who purports to assist a migrant, anyone who takes money for helping a migrant, will be open to these provisions and could be punishable. We strongly support that approach unless and until either a better approach is generated or is shown to be able to work or an alternative is brought up which can deal with problems that may arise after 19 December. </PARA>

What we are saying is: wait until 19 December and after, see how these rules-which are much tougher, in our opinion-apply, and then, if there are gaps or problems in relation to the rules, I am sure that the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories and Minister Assisting the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Holding), and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), the Minister in the other place, will both be ready to consider any further tightening or further amendments. The approach that has been taken here is much better than what previously existed because now we are able to cover any kind of situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember the situation which used to exist. A case came to my attention involving a welfare worker-not a registered agent in any sense-in an ethnic community. When people talked to him about immigration problems, he asked them to pay him money and promised to help them. If we had a registration system, we probably could not cover that sort of person because he would not seek to be registered. But under this legislation, such a person would be covered. This person had the gall to go to various members of parliament and ask them to make representations for people, claiming to be a welfare worker. Unbeknown to the members of parliament, that person was collecting money from the clients concerned. It was only when a particular case failed that the matter came to our attention. </PARA>

Under the new provision, that person would be subject to criminal offence provisions and could face criminal charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the provisions that we have drafted take account of all the matters raised by the honourable member for Dundas. I welcome this legislation, as I welcomed the earlier legislation in relation to the Migration Act. Let us all get together in the spirit of bipartisanship that has existed so far to try to eradicate whatever problems can be located and to get the most objective and the most revolutionary, in a sense, Migration Act operating in a proper way for the future of this country. There is no doubt that this Act and the previous Act together are seen as a model for the rest of the world. </PARA>

Today, in Question Time, in reference to the environment, children or whatever, he said that his Government's record was the best record of any government in the world. We are accustomed to these imaginings. It would be curious to find the Prime Minister actually confronting some of the realities that exist in this country. He prefers to deal with things which exist in some far off country to be found in his mind, such as the non-existent airline pilots dispute. We know, of course, that there is none.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I certainly am. I will address my remarks to an issue that arises out of the Overseas Student Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2). Students are people and people can be hurt. This Government has, by its recent actions in respect of Chinese students, deliberately-because it cannot have been done by oversight-set out to hurt, to damage, a group of people who have no redress at all, people who have gone through the painful process of getting together money so that they could come to study English in Australia. The changes came about in a way which, on the face of it, was perfectly innocuous. A statement was made on behalf of the Government on 30 August this year by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), and by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). In that statement procedures and criteria for the People's Republic of China's English language students were set out. They were altered. The relevant part of this notice states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The backlog of 25,000 applications in the People's Republic of China wishing to undertake English language courses will be asked to fill in a questionnaire, and these applicants will then be assessed against the following criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> they must have a minimum educational level to the Australian standard Year 10;</PARA>
<PARA> a maximum age of 35 years;</PARA>
<PARA> they must present some form of certification of the relevance of the course to their current employment, or demonstrated relevance to future employment, or evidence of provisional enrolment in appropriate further education. </PARA>
<PARA>This was done against the background of Tiananmen Square. This was done against a known and stated backlog of 25,000 applicants. This was done-we are not talking about blocks of wood-in respect of people who had, at great trouble to themselves, got together the money up-front for the purposes of English language tuition in Australia. English language tuition in Australia was to be their entry into a better life. As I understand it $5,000 must be paid up-front before a visa application can be submitted. </PARA>
<PARA> I take one example from the literature on this subject and I think that everybody in this House would have read some of it. We know that there have been large protests around our consulate in Shanghai and the reasons are very simple. Many people feel that they have been treated wrongly, unjustly and harshly by this Government. I refer to the case of a Mr Chen as reported in the Age of 11 September 1989. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke wept when he said (after the 4 June massacre of democracy protesters) that the Chinese people were bleeding. Does he not realise we are also bleeding in the heart because of what he has done. </PARA>
<PARA>This is Mr Chen's story. He had to borrow $5,000 to attend a short term English course in Australia and he now finds that he does not meet the new criteria. He is afraid to go back to his pregnant wife in Shanghai. He was forced to leave his mechanics job after acceptance into a Sydney language school in March. Having lost his job he can earn about $A36 a month. According to the article, his wife is at breaking point. The money that Mr Chen has to pay, for a man in his position, is just alarming. To get the $US4,700 to study in Sydney, he had to borrow on the open market. That cost him about $A12,925. It is higher, or course, because he could not deal in the official rate; he had to deal in the unofficial exchange rate. Add on to that some other costs and his commitment comes out at $A15,250. Presuming that the Sydney school returns all of the $US4,700 he has paid, he will find himself with a deficit of $A10,910. That is a huge debt for a person in his situation-a debt that he will never be able to repay. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chen is but one example of many people in this situation. What are the reasons for this? Why was the change made so shortly after Tiananmen Square? Why were the changes made retrospectively and were known to operate retrospectively? Was it to guard against the risk of students overstaying? That could be guarded against in different ways. Does one think that simply because students are under the age of 35 years they will be less likely to overstay? On the contrary, I should have thought that the younger they were the more likely they would be to overstay. What will happen to this man and to people like him? The truth of the matter is that they are in the most grievous and sad of circumstances. We have seen great expressions of compassion by this Government. We have seen the Prime Minister looking at the cameras telegenically and weeping the odd tear or two, and we have seen him weeping the odd tear or two over Tiananmen Square. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That dispute is over, as my colleague says, like the pilots dispute! The Prime Minister has wrung as much out of it as he could. Who gives a damn about these poor people? They are only Chinese, they do not vote, they are sitting in China, their hopes are nil, their prospects nil and their situation is desperate. At the very least, if the Government is going to change the rules of the game retrospectively, as it has done on so many occasions, it could do the decent thing by these people and make sure that somehow they are financially compensated for the outlays that they have incurred in the hope that the same rules would apply as applied at the time when the money was handed over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If you allow money to be handed over and after it is handed over, knowing the effect and the changes that it will have on the people who have handed it over, you do things which have perfectly disastrous consequences on individuals, then what you are doing is wrong and immoral. But one would not expect anything different from this Government. It is a sad story. It is a story that I think most people around here would consider to be sad. Yet, nothing will be done about it unless the Government has a few second thoughts. But why should anyone have a few second thoughts about people who do not have a vote? That is all I wish to say on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I now mention one other matter, and that is the position of those who act as agents for persons who wish to settle in this country or who may be here and wish to stay. It is understandable that people should take advice and it is understandable that people want to explore all kinds of avenues. I suppose that nobody can object to people performing a service and getting a fair fee, but in this area we have to look very carefully at people who proffer advice and who exact very considerable fees from individuals who may feel they are not in a position to strike a fair bargain and thus must accept whatever rate is put to them. When that happens one cannot say that they have had a free choice. I do not suggest that all who proffer advice are in this position, but one can say that in some cases such people have been unfairly taken advantage of. That is something that we should make sure does not take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Realising the lateness of the hour, I will endeavour to be brief. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Consequential Amendments) Bill and the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) deal with very complex legislation which is related to the Migration Act 1989. It is understandable, as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) suggested, that there should be some revision, some clarification and perhaps some improvement and changes as a consequence of the passing of that legislation. As I said, this is very complex legislation. It is the sort of legislation that everybody is trying to drive a truck through. It has been the case with migration legislation in this country that for many years there has been a great deal of concern about the way in which it has been possible to slip and slide past the regulations and past the Act. The fact that we have 50,000 to 70,000 illegal immigrants in Australia is an indication of that. It is very difficult to police this legislation as well as one would like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might say that the contributions of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) have influenced me to say one or two things. Indeed, the honourable member for North Sydney suggested that it was unacceptable that Australia should place some sort of criteria on those who choose to come to Australia from the People's Republic of China to learn English. He suggested that it is unacceptable that we should require that there should be a minimum requirement for an educational status of Year 10, that it is unacceptable that we should ask that the maximum age requirement for these people be 35 years; that it is unacceptable that they should have to certify that in some way their study of English is relevant to their job or occupation, and indeed that they should be able to provide evidence of provisional enrolment. I would say that it is absolute humbug on the part of the Opposition to suggest that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney is sitting on the back bench now because he is one of those who supported the line put by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) some time ago in this House which suggested that Australia had every right to determine the criteria for immigration and for visas for those who wished to enter this country and that Australia should proclaim that right and make it clear. For some reason that same person is suggesting that it is unreasonable to provide those sorts of conditions. We have 15,000 students from China who have sanctuary in this country until July next year. I imagine that the honourable member would support the view that Margaret Thatcher takes, knowing his political position, about those Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong, whether they be real refugees or economic refugees, who are being sent back to Vietnam. It is the sovereign right of the United Kingdom to take that position, and he would support it. But there is no sovereign right for Australia to apply those sorts of criteria and conditions as to who gets a visa to come to Australia. I find that very difficult to comprehend, and inconsistent. I suppose I should not be surprised because it was put forward by the honourable member for North Sydney. He comes in here with a bleeding heart for the Chinese after he supported the position put by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) when he was Leader of the Opposition. I know and respect the position of the honourable member for Dundas, who did not support that view. He took a completely honourable and moral stance on that issue. I say to those in the Opposition that they should be consistent about these things. We did not raise this issue. The honourable member for Dundas came in here and raised it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other two issues are seminal to the legislation. The first is that of ministerial discretion. It should be understood that ministerial discretion still exists. We have separated the criteria. Once there is a suggestion that someone wishes to appeal, then there are two appeal processes within the legislation. At that stage the Minister has discretion. The only difference from that which existed previously is that it requires the Minister to come to this place and justify his decision. Those who come into this House and plead for privilege and for the position whereby there should be unfettered discretion for the Minister, so there can be hand- outs and favours all around the country for members of parliament who have access to the Minister and for nobody else, do not seem to realise that it is inconsistent. It is inequitable, it is not objective and it is not fair. It is perfectly reasonable that we should curtail that discretion which previously existed for the Minister and to bring in some decency in the way this system operates. That is what we are trying to do with this legislation. We are trying to remove that unfettered discretion which led to privileges for members of parliament and some sections of the community who had access to the Minister but there was no fairness for many other groups. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are suggesting is perfectly reasonable. I think the honourable member for Dundas understands that within the regulations there will be considerable discussion and toing and froing until we reach a reasonable compromise through consultation. When that procedure has finished we will be in a position where, when decisions are taken on immigration, the Minister will have discretionary power. But we are requiring him to come in here and justify it before the House. That tightens it up. It makes it fairer and more objective. I think it is something that people will appreciate when they consider this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue that was raised and canvassed by the honourable member for Dundas and the honourable member for North Sydney was that of consultants-the immigration advisers who see themselves as migration agents and have over a period of time had the opportunity to take advantage of people who were in very difficult circumstances and in need of advice and assistance, people who wished to be reunited with their relatives and who had a particular concern about immigration issues and went to migration agents for advice and assistance. Previously anybody could call himself or herself a migration agent. Unfortunately there was no power for this Parliament, and indeed for the law, to take action against those who made outlandish claims of influence and who charge outlandish fees. We now will have a schedule of fees. If the claims of influence that are made by the migration agents are shown to be false, action can be taken before the law. The point I would like to make very clearly here is, again, that there is duplicity in the Opposition's position. The Opposition states its position on immigration on page 39 of the Economic Action Plan:</PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure savings of $20 million will be achieved in this portfolio through improved administrative efficiencies and increasing cost recovery for migrant entry. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps that means it will increase the fee charged for visas but I suggest it means a thinning down of the bureaucracy. At the same time the office of the shadow spokesman for immigration is saying that the capacity of the Department to act on these matters is limited. I am suggesting that if the Opposition wants more scrutiny from the Department, if it wants to improve its performance--</PARA>

We will save money if we talk about capital gains tax. We will improve the efficiency in the running of this country's economy but, to do that, we will cut down on the bureaucracy'. If that is what the Opposition wants to do it should say so. Opposition members should not come in here saying that they want to increase the scrutiny of these people, because that is inconsistent with the Opposition's position on this portfolio.

It is perfectly reasonable that we have ministerial discretion as has been set out in this legislation because it is fair and objective and it does not provide privilege to those who do not deserve it. It is perfectly fair and reasonable that those guidelines that we have set down in this legislation, which improve the ability of the consumer to take action against a migration agent, should be followed through. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the lateness of the hour I do not wish to say much more. However, those issues are important to those on this side of the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take part in this debate because I want to use this opportunity to talk about the different position in which self-supporting retirees are placed as compared with sponsored aged relative migrants to this country. I also want to examine the changes that have been taking place in the relative positions of each of those migrant groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear that our economy is in need of substantial change if we are to overcome some of the basic difficulties, including our huge balance of payments deficit. Under the migration legislation we admit people to this country who we hope will generate resources that will help us overcome those difficulties. Amongst those, of course, are the permanent migrants. But we also admit tourists. They enter on visitors visas which are temporary entry permits. We admit students to come here and study and they are admitted on a visa which, by its nature, is a temporary entry permit. We admit retirees. Retirees, however, now fall into two categories. The first is aged dependent relatives and the second used to be called self-supporting retirees, but now the visa under which they enter has been changed in character. </PARA>
<PARA> Until December 1988, those admitted under both of the categories to which I have referred were admitted on permanent entry visas. Now, aged dependent relatives are approved for admission and continue to be eligible to receive a permanent entry visa if they pass all of the other qualification tests. However, self-supporting retirees, if approved for admission, are now eligible only to receive extended stay visas. This is a new and interesting concept. Permanent residency gives to the person who enters this country with that type of visa the right to remain here permanently; eligibility for social security benefits and pensions subject to permanent residency for a qualifying period; eligibility for Medicare benefits; and further, eligibility to become an Australian citizen subject to permanent residency for the qualifying period and satisfying the various character tests. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the extended stay visa now available to self-supporting retirees denies them the right to apply for permanent resident status and denies them access to social security pensions and benefits because eligibility for those pensions and benefits depends on permanent residency for a qualifying period, and their living in Australia does not qualify them because they are not here on a permanent resident visa. It denies them access to Medicare benefits. It denies them the right to apply for Australian citizenship, as eligibility for Australian citizenship depends upon permanent residency and residency with such a visa for a qualifying period. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that self-supporting retirees should be put into any changed position from that in which they are now placed, but I want to look at various aspects of the difference in the way in which we are treating aged people who are given the right to come and live here permanently or on an extended stay visa. It is a pre-condition of an entry permit being granted to an aged person that some form of assurance be given that the retiree will not become the responsibility of the general community, for five years in the case of an aged dependent relative and for the whole period of the temporary residence in the case of the extended stay retiree. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us for a moment examine the nature of the assurance that must be given. A self-supporting retiree now not admitted as a permanent resident but on an extended stay visa must have at least $500,000 capital for transfer to Australia-one might question why-or at least $150,000 capital for transfer and an annual income in excess of $35,000. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to these people, concerns have been expressed, will continue to be expressed and must be expressed as to what checks are made in respect of the transfers to and the retention of the assets in Australia. As I mentioned a minute ago, why require the transfer? Is not their self-supporting living on an income making an economic contribution to Australia just as a tourist coming to Australia and living on an income brought in from overseas is making a contribution to Australia? The important thing is that in both cases neither the tourist nor the long-stay retiree should have a right to draw on our social security system, our Medicare system, our nursing home system or, indeed, other public sector responsibilities discharged by the Australian Government in respect of Australian citizens who have spent their whole working lives here. </PARA>
<PARA> Approval for an applicant to extend a long-stay visa, originally granted for four years, is not necessarily automatic, so one may ask who would transfer $500,000 to Australia without some longer term assurance that that person could stay. Such people should be able to stay if they are good citizens and provided that they are not a drain on the Australian social security and other public sector-funded schemes. Under the present arrangement they can stay for only four years. They cannot be assured of a renewal of their visa, although they may apply for a renewal and it will probably be granted. They then have to be able to establish that the assets they have in Australia are of a value equal to the requirements then required. Who knows whether the requirement will be $500,000 or $5m in four years time? That is the risk that these people run. There is no assurance that they will be able to stay provided that their assets have maintained, for example, an inflation factor. That may be the understanding, but it is not in the rules and regulations as they presently exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do we not grant permission to these people to enter on the basis that they are prepared to give an undertaking not to make any call on social security benefits, fringe benefits or other benefits scheme, Medicare, publicly funded nursing homes, et cetera and that they have enough income to support themselves? That has an economic value in itself. They would not necessarily have to transfer their assets to Australia if those assets are earning income overseas, as are the assets of many Australians. It is to be hoped that they would make a business judgment that this is a good place to invest some of their savings and if they chose to do so they should be allowed to, but they should not be forced to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone will ask how we can be sure that they will not become destitute, need hospital treatment, be without an income and ask for a social security pension or special benefit of some form or other. We could require that these people not only give an undertaking, but also back up that undertaking with what I would describe as a performance bond from some approved financial institution. Performance bonds are not unheard of. In many transactions a party gives an undertaking but is then required to provide from a third party some form of performance bond. These people could go to a recognised, perhaps listed, financial institution and get the performance bond required. In the event of such persons having inadequate resources, the third party bond grantor would meet any liabilities incurred by the Commonwealth Government in respect of those retirees' failure to meet their undertaking not to make a call on social security, Medicare, nursing home or other publicly funded sectors. If this undertaking is given, why then limit to four years the period for which a self-supporting retiree may enter Australia? Why require such people to transfer assets to Australia? Why not grant them the right to stay here indefinitely, still on a long-stay visa which could then be withdrawn in the event of a default under the guarantee, so that they do not acquire Australian citizenship or permanent residency rights?</PARA>

<PARA>31 October-1 November 1989 REPRESENTATIVES</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the case of aged dependent relatives. Under existing arrangements, after five years of residence of retirees sponsored by a relative, we take public sector responsibility for their social expenditure in the same way as we have taken that responsi- bility for someone who has been here for 55 years. However, in many cases the com- munity is required to take responsibility for these aged dependent relatives for a substantial proportion of their first five years in Australia. This is because the guarantees of sponsors, obtained as a precondition to the grant of an entry permit, have in many instances proved not worth the paper they were written on. </PARA>
<PARA> However, from April this year the procedure has been changed but in my view will nevertheless prove inadequate to ensure that sponsors or the Australian citizens who provide the assurance of support meet the obligation that these assurances of support involve. The procedures now laid down require migration officers to conduct pre- migration checks of an assuror's ability to honour a five-year assurance. Frankly, I believe it should not be limited to five years. We should consider making the assuror responsible for the whole of a person's period in Australia if that person is aged 60 or 65 or more and can make no contribution to the Australian economy other than perhaps to bring some investments. </PARA>
<PARA> But are our migration officers really trained and experienced in testing the creditworthiness of those who offer assurances? What do they have to do? They are told by the departmental regulations that they have to check whether the person offering to provide the assurance has received any welfare payment in the previous 12 months. So be it. But what about that person's likelihood of receiving a welfare payment in the next five years or during the period over which the assurance is supposed to be of some value to the public sector? The migration officers are supposed to check whether an assuror has previously defaulted in meeting obligations under an assurance of support. They are supposed then to test whether the assuror has the current ability to honour his proposed obligations. But we are talking about an ability in four or five years time. Departmental officers are instructed that they must ask assurors to provide their latest income tax assessment, current pay slip, evidence of major assets, including housing, bank slips and so on, confirmation of liabilities for housing repayments, hire purchase liabilities and credit card obligations. They all relate to current liabilities. But what about the future? They must also ask for such other evidence-this is the all-sweet clause-as may establish their financial ability to meet obligations undertaken by giving the assurance of support. </PARA>

<PARA> I wonder whether migration officers really understand what testing the creditworthiness of an assuror involves. I have my doubts. I would be interested to learn whether they are put through training courses in the same way as bankers and officers working for credit-providing organisations are. I doubt it. But then an assuror's income is prima facie sufficient if the assuror is not eligible for a health care card. Assurors are regarded as having the capacity to pay the equivalent of the pension, to provide hospital and medical insurance for the relative being brought to Australia, if as a single person their income is $167 per week or, if they are married, their income is $278 or more, with an increase of $34 for each additional child they may have. </PARA>
<PARA> Where possible the officers are required, except when checking with the Department of Social Security to determine whether an assuror is receiving a pension or has defaulted on a previous assurance, to deal on the spot with the assessment of the ability to pay. I ask honourable members to contrast those requirements with the requirements that are imposed on the self-supporting retiree-$500,000 to be transferred to Australia or, if not $500,000, then $150,000 and an income of $673 per week. The way out of this different treatment of aged people who seek to retire in Australia because they have friends here, because they like the place or because they have relatives here should be to treat them all the same. They should be viewed in the same way as students who come here and pay university fees on a user pays basis. We should treat them as tourists who come to Australia and pay on a user pays basis. We should welcome them, because it will expand our foreign currency transfers to this country. </PARA>

<PARA> We should require people in Australia who sponsor retirees to provide an assurance of support for the lifetime of the aged relatives. Those assurances of support should be backed up by the sort of performance bond that I have advocated in respect of the self-supporting retiree. Those bonds should be required from recognised Australian financial institutions. Sponsored aged relatives should be granted indefinite stay visas rather than permanent resident visas-not short term visas or long stay visas but indefinite stay visas. Those visas should continue to be valid except if those migrants default. Then they can be deported either in the way in which people are deported under existing arrangements or if they default by making a significant or substantial claim on the public sector social expenditure liabilities that are provided for Australians who have spent their working lives in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole matter needs to be very carefully considered. The marketplace would establish a fee for organisations such as third party guarantors and the parties that provide performance bonds. Fees have been established for existing types of performance bonds. For some, a fee would be set and some sort of charge would be taken over the assets, or perhaps a pension from some other source of the person who is asking for it. The fee would vary according to the commercial assessment of the likelihood of the retiree either not supporting himself or herself or not being supported by the relative or friend in Australia. That would free up the migration process for the relatives and friends in Australia who want to bring aged relatives from overseas, whether they are parents, brothers or sisters. Those people would not have to be tested on the basis of whether or not they were going to be a drain on the Australian economy because, in effect, they would be coming here on a user pays basis. They would have to pay for their own social expenditures, or those who were giving the guarantee would have to do so. In that way many Australian residents would be able to bring to Australia their brothers, sisters, friends and other relatives simply on the basis that they could then clearly establish that they would not come back onto the social security system. </PARA>
