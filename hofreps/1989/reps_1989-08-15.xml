<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question. Yes, indeed, we are acutely aware of the difficulties that are being created by this totally unjustified action by the pilots. We deplore the recent rolling strike action that the domestic aircraft pilots have taken, which, I may say, directly contravenes Australian Industrial Relations Commission directives. As is well known, I and the Government are totally committed to the centralised wages system and we would like to see the air pilots dispute resolved within that system. That system, of course, contains rights but it carries as well obligations for those within it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make it clear that if the pilots refuse to abide by their obligations within the centralised system the Government would support any move for the cancellation or suspension of existing pilots, awards and agreements. It must be understood that that would, of course, cancel all the rights and all the protections that are provided to them by the centralised system. If the pilots choose to go outside the system, this Government will fully support any action by the airlines to bring the dispute to an early end. The matter is quite simple and straightforward: either the pilots in this country accept the obligations of the award system that entitles them to their rights or they forfeit those rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous Government did absolutely nothing about the waterfront or the sea, and after the study by the Inter-State Commission and a range of other studies the Government put in place the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. An in-principle agreement was thereby reached that for three months ending in September all disputes, demarcation and all the rest of it, would be put off and that a package would be delivered back to the Government. As you understand, Madam Speaker, the Government has put money on the table and the stevedoring companies are putting money on the table. Out of a work force that has now shrunk to about 5,400 A-class waterside workers, we are proposing that 3,000 positions go. If honourable members think this is a matter that can be negotiated very easily, they have another think coming. The only position I took was to inform the Wheat Board Chairman of the existence of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, saying that this was making good progress and that for the National Farmers Federation or the National Party in Queensland, where it is getting increasingly desperate, to sabotage all that work for two shifts of five men would be a very silly step indeed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support.

Can the Minister indicate the progress with the investigation of the fatal balloon accident near Alice Springs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like every other member of this House, I was very sorry to learn of the ballooning accident which occurred on Sunday. I would like to extend my condolences, and I am sure the condolences of every member of this House, to all the relatives of the accident victims. This tragic accident involved a balloon which was one of a number operating joy flights around the Alice Springs area. Witnesses reported that the balloon collided with another balloon while it was climbing and that the basket of one balloon tore the canopy of the other and the canopy began to deflate. The pilot attempted to keep the canopy inflated by using the burners. The attempt, unfortunately, was unsuccessful and the canopy collapsed. The balloon fell about 1,000 metres, fatally injuring all the passengers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation is at Alice Springs to investigate the accident now. The team includes officers of the Civil Aviation Authority and the Australian Ballooning Federation. I would like to emphasise that ballooning is essentially safe but, regrettably, like all activities, it is accompanied by an element of risk. There is no truth to the report in today's media that the Civil Aviation Authority has suspended ballooning operations at Alice Springs. Regulations for flying balloons in Australia are basically the same as those applied worldwide. As charter operators, balloon operators have to obtain air operator certificates in the same way as other commercial operators of air services. Ballooning is subject to airworthiness and flight crew requirements similar to those applying to aeroplanes. Balloons must meet the airworthiness standards determined by the Civil Aviation Authority and are registered aircraft. Australian commercial balloon pilot requirements are higher than those in most other countries, notably the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA> Commercial balloon operations are supervised by the Civil Aviation Authority. Balloons are not subject to the same separation requirements that are applied to aeroplanes. For practical reasons, it is not possible to direct balloons to do anything other than to land and to take off. However, balloons are fairly large and conspicuous objects which are allowed to operate only in good visual conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation preliminary report on the accident should be available to aviation authorities by the end of the month. My Department has been advised by the Northern Territory authorities that the balloon operator held the necessary insurance coverage to meet obligations under the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Act. It is a very unfortunate accident, and I would like to again extend the condolences of the House.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Grayndler for his question. Madam Speaker, in recent days, as we are all unfortunately aware, the fighting in Lebanon has escalated, with intensified shelling in Beirut and elsewhere causing in that tragic country new and even higher levels of misery than have been experienced before. It is a tragedy that so many Lebanese are forced to live in that climate of violence and fear. The Government's very grave concern at the horrific situation in Lebanon has been emphasised on many occasions since March. On 22 May I wrote to the United Nations Secretary-General offering Australian support for any United Nations initiative in this regard. On my recent visit overseas I raised Lebanon as a matter of priority with world leaders in Europe and in the United States. I have today written to both President Bush and President Gorbachev about the Lebanon, and I will be discussing this situation with Prime Minister Rocard of France this Friday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure I speak for all members of this House when I call on all sides to cease the violence in Lebanon. In particular, I urge Syria to stop the shelling which is killing and maiming innocent civilians. I express the hope that the Arab League, which has done so much to this point to try to secure an effective mediation of this dispute, will renew its attempt to bring the main protagonists to the negotiating table. Australia offers its firm and unequivocal support to the Arab League in its initiative.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia deplores kidnapping and hostage taking in any circumstances, including the particularly harrowing circumstances in Lebanon. On 2 August the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, condemned the brutal murder of Colonel Higgins, a man serving the United Nations in the cause of peace. Australia also condemns threats to execute other foreign hostages being held in Lebanon and calls for their immediate release. The Government urges all countries with influence on groups in Lebanon to use this influence to secure their release. Our embassies in Tehran and Damascus have made representations to the Iranian and Syrian foreign ministries, and we will do whatever we can to assist in obtaining their release.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government understands and sympathises deeply with the concerns of Australians of Lebanese origin about their homeland, about their relatives, and about their friends still in Lebanon. We have agreed to extend temporary entry permits for Lebanese visitors in Australia to the end of September, and we will keep that situation under constant review. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has instructed his Department to explore options for making available up to 1,000 additional places in our refugee and special humanitarian programs for people affected by the fighting in Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, this tragedy has been going on for too long-for some 14 years. It is a tragedy, as we know, which is compounded not only by the existing confessional differences that exist within Lebanon but also by the attitude of external forces imposing on Lebanon their own disputes and by the intervention of those external forces. We express the hope that it will be possible to achieve and commit this Government to the position of achieving in some way, firstly, a diminution of this tragedy and, hopefully, the creation of a situation where Lebanon can be restored to what it was-a country of peace in which it was possible for people of different persuasions and different beliefs to go about their lives peaceably.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his question. I cannot give him a precise date as to when they will be available, but let me say that we do intend to develop national guidelines for bleached kraft pulp mills. We intend to do that after consultation with the States and Territories, industry and conservation groups. It is our intention that those guidelines which will emerge from that process of consultation will ensure that only those mills incorporating the world's best in process and effluent technologies will be built in Australia and that, through appropriate baseline studies that will be done and appropriate monitoring and reporting systems being put in place, we will have an industry that will satisfy the dual criteria that I hope would be accepted on both sides; that is, we want to see in this country appropriate economic development and the processing of raw materials-that is an appropriate and necessary development for this country-but I hope all of us would share as well the other criterion, that these things be done in an environmentally acceptable manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We certainly take the view that we were not prepared to accept the situation that was being put forward before under the proposed Wesley Vale project, under which we would have had 13 tonnes of organochlorins dumped daily into the ocean. That position was not acceptable, but I repeat that we are serious in trying to get these guidelines which will marry the twin criteria of desirable economic development and acceptable environmental standards. I know that the honourable gentleman has a real interest in this matter. As soon as I am able to give him a more definite date, I will be happy to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So no doubt he will not have to do it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In answer to the question from the honourable gentleman, I am able to give him complete assurances in that regard. In fact, I am able to give him the assurances that were given by the Chief of Naval Staff to Cabinet-that the ship that was selected entirely met Navy's requirements and that it was completely satisfied with it. As the Chief of Naval Staff has said in a statement today-and this is again consistent with his advice to Cabinet-the Navy is totally satisfied with the Meko 200 design and is very pleased with the level of excellence it will obtain with the new light patrol frigate in terms of both design and capability. Navy's decision to recommend the selection of Amecon proceeded independently of further higher committee consideration and reflected the unanimous decision of the Chief of Naval Staff and his senior advisory committee. Admiral Hudson said in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA> The Navy is being provided with a ship that is marked by excellence in all its aspects.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his advice to Cabinet, advice that he was prepared to give publicly. Via various committee processes, that advice arrived before government. The decision was not based simply on cost. The quality of the industry package, the capacity to support the ship, the capacity to operate the ship, the management teams involved-a whole raft of considerations-went into the recommendation. Price was extremely important, of course, as it ought to be in the determination of all defence contracts. It does not have to be exclusive, but it ought to be significant. The price gap between the two tenderers was substantial. It would have been an irresponsible government that walked away from that gap in price.</PARA>
<PARA> Propositions for the alternative to that which was eventually successful were put before various lobbyists, including the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner. When Mr Greiner appeared here and was asked specifically what sort of cost differential he would be prepared to tolerate, what he thought a prudent government ought to be prepared to tolerate to fully benefit his State, his answer, in front of numerous witnesses, was 2 per cent--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bilney" NAMEID="RE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two per cent. In this regard I noticed also that quite recently Mr Greiner's State awarded a contract to a yard in Queensland for the construction of Sydney Harbour transport vessels. If Mr Greiner is of the view that the Newcastle yards require a particularly favourable decision outside the framework of a sensible decision on price, it would be very sensible for him to start with his own backyard before illegitimately criticising the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As for the areas where this ship is going to be built, both areas-Williamstown and Newcastle-are winners. Newcastle, as a result of this decision, is back in the Navy. A massive amount of major work will be done in Newcastle, both of the nature that Newcastle currently does and new work. Five frigates will be launched from Newcastle if New Zealand comes into the proposal. This is a good decision in defence terms. The Navy has a good ship, the sort of ship that it requires for the task that it has set itself in that area, and the Government has responded to the task. Australian industry has a good industry package across the board, in a number of States, ensuring that the ship will be well supported throughout its life. As far as the defence budget and the Government's Budget are concerned-I would have thought that the Opposition would have a few concerns about the efficiencies of defence expenditure-the most responsible decision was taken.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="6" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Newcastle will share in the ongoing maintenance work on this ship. I think Newcastle will also share in the ongoing maintenance work of many other ships. In fact, there is a yard now in Newcastle that is beginning to do very well out of Navy repair and refit requirements. I think that will continue because there are now a number of excellent operations in Newcastle capable of supporting the Navy. In terms of the latter part of the honourable gentleman's question, in so far as one can give assurances well beyond the period of time one could reasonably anticipate being Minister for Defence, I think I can give him those assurances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the first part of the honourable member's question concerning through-life support, aspects of that were included in the tender process. Some aspects were more nebulous and could not be included in the tender process. The Navy remains confident that it would have had the support it needed from either the Dutch backers of their particular proposition or the German Navy backers of the Meko 200 design which was eventually successful. Sometimes that can be overstated.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that on both ships a considerable amount of equipment was common in the tender and in that regard through-life support was not dependent on either of those navies, but rather on those manufacturers. Through-life support is of lessening significance in Australia, basically because we seek to do these things ourselves in accordance with the principles of self-reliance on which defence policy is based. If one looks at a number of the other items of equipment that are in service with the armed forces, one sees that it is not their original manufacturers to which we look for through-life support and development, but rather our own industries or other people with whom we have a relationship. For example, with the Oberon submarines, we do not look particularly to the Royal Navy for through-life support. Some of the more important aspects of that we get through cooperation with the United States Navy in the combat system. One can go through a whole host of items of kit where that applies. It is not sensible to rely on through-life support from nations that are 12,000 miles away from us. Basically we have to do that work ourselves. As a result, in my view, there has been excessive emphasis on that in some of the discussions prior to the decision on the frigate project. In so far as it is important, both sides were about as good in what they offered and therefore it played little role in Cabinet consideration.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. The Opposition has been trying to rewrite history, in a manner that Joe Stalin would have been proud of, by suggesting that the Fraser Government had in place an effective program to combat land degradation. That is simply untrue. Senators Puplick and Brownhill have misled both the public and their own leaders as both Opposition leaders have repeated the claims. I do not blame the Opposition leaders. No-one expects them to know the facts about anything much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would point out that Environment Minister Cass during the time of the Whitlam Government put in place a most comprehensive study which became known eventually as the collaborative study. That was by far the most comprehensive statement that had ever been made on soil conservation and land degradation in this country. I well remember when Mr Kevin Newman was the Minister and he was sabotaged completely by the Fraser Government. A decision was taken. In the end an extra $3m was given to the States in general purpose grants, and it was frittered away. I well remember debates here in the late 1970s in which the right honourable member for New England, among others, said that the whole question of soil conservation was really a matter for the States, because in those times I raised these matters in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that Senators Puplick and Brownhill-certainly Senator Brownhill-both confuse the national soil conservation program. What the Fraser Government had was an election gimmick to build dams which probably would have made salinity problems worse. It also provided taxation concessions for land clearing, which basically runs counter to everything we need to do with respect to the environment. What the coalition had was not a program to counter land degradation, but programs to make it worse. It was this Government that introduced the national soil conservation program, with funding increasing from that which applied in 1983-84, when we first came into government, to $23.4m this year. It was this Government that set up the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. The previous Government never had the wit, or the will, to get that together. It was one of the most important steps ever taken by a government and a shining example of the cooperation one can get.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's environment statement tied together all the work that has been done for a long time, and it is very comprehensive. This is a measure of the Government's commitment to solving this major national problem-Australia's main conservation problem. This was done after years of coalition policies that only made the problem worse.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Speaker, I have both publicly and privately condemned the action of the air traffic controllers. But I did not satisfy myself simply with condemning them. What I did was convene a committee which consisted of people, including Mr George Polites, who I thought had the capacity to deal with this matter. They conducted discussions with both the Federal Airports Corporation and the air traffic controllers. I believe that as a result of those discussions which I initiated, where we put a very strong position to the air traffic controllers that we would not tolerate a continuation of the very damaging tactics that they were earlier employing, we have started now to move to a rectification of this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say this: having condemned, as I did and as I would do again, the action of the air traffic controllers, as in many situations-not only industrial situations but also interpersonal relations-it was not a case of 100 per cent fault being exclusively with the air traffic controllers. It is fair to say that they had some legitimate concerns. In that respect I would say to the honourable member that we have taken steps to accelerate the provision of appropriate radar equipment in Melbourne and in Sydney, where the major problem area was. I am hopeful that, as a result of both the tough position that we put to the air traffic controllers and what we have done to accept our responsibility for accelerating the provision of new equipment, the situation that the honourable member rightly refers to as a problem area for Australia will be rectified. I think we have to understand that those people do have a very responsible and stressful position. They are entitled to expect that everything will be done to provide them with the best equipment at the earliest possible time. We are accepting our obligation in that respect. As I said before, in all these matters there are rights and obligations. We have accepted our obligation and I trust that in the future the air traffic controllers will accept theirs.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="8" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that as the honourable member for Grey he has a very keen interest in the efficient operation of grain handling facilities in seaboard terminals. When I was recently in his electorate I gained an appreciation of the work that he has been doing with the people on the waterfront and also on ships. I am aware of the work that he did in conjunction with the Minister for Industrial Relations, the then Minister for Transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take it as a central thesis that Australia is a small trading nation and that we cannot afford to have anything but a first-class transport handling system. The House will be aware, of course, that the Minister for Transport and Communications has instituted a process whereby the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission in respect of the waterfront can be put into effect. The process of reform on the waterfront is a matter of utmost concern. Huge savings can be made from the process of restructuring in our stevedoring industry and in the practices which presently characterise operations on our seaboard. The estimates of savings are anything up to $650m.</PARA>
<PARA> I might add that there is nothing strange or unusual about my interest in this matter, for within the responsibility that I have as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy industry reform has occupied the bulk of my time. These efforts, which will result in more flexible, efficient and competitive industries, have not always been fully welcomed, particularly by the primary industries involved.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may not be aware that, contrary to the exaggerated image touted by the `Industrial Wish Upon a Star Club', the Australian Wheat Board and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia have negotiated, over a period of time, improved practices in the handling facilities in Western Australia. Those negotiation were characterised by a joint intent to see that the operations of these facilities was efficient and effective. I might add that this agreement between the Wheat Board and the Waterside Workers Federation has, as a central tenet, that the introduction of new technology in the grain terminals will result in further moves on manning levels.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there are some elements who are not prepared to grind their way through reform. They see the waterfront as reason for calling, as I said in answer to an earlier question, a jihad in which all wharfies, all unionists, all workers could be put to the sword. Not surprisingly, the more disreputable of this hard line, yet soft-headed crowd includes the Queensland Government, the Grains Council of Australia and the National Farmers Federation. They say that they are concerned to see efficiency gains on the waterfront. They say that manning practices must change. They say that the Inter-State Commission's recommendations must be implemented. They are saying what we are saying. But what they are trying to do is bring on a political stunt to sabotage the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has just remarked to me that the honourable member for Cowper appears to have asked this question in recognition of how interested in and how concerned about family incomes people in his electorate are, particularly about the reforms in the area of family allowances that have come from this Government. As the honourable member would know, in the history of family payments in this country never has a standard been set in relation to family payments and never have family payments been indexed in real terms. Since child endowment was introduced in 1942, never have we had such reforms-reforms that go to the question of adequacy, to the question of equity; reforms that are sustainable in the longer terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In those circumstances, where the Government has made decisions that involve income testing and the various family payments, it is important that people be aware of the individual payments, of their potential eligibility for those payments and of the significance of the payments to them, to their living standards and to their participation in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in making information on family payments available, has been very pleased with the results. I take as an example one of the targeted payments, the family allowance supplement. This payment is now being made to more than 175,000 families. Over 400,000 children receive it. On average, each family-we are talking about low wage families-receives $45 to $50 a week. It is a significant payment. We expect that the take-up for that payment, in part as a result of our advertising, will take us towards 200,000 families before the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to think of a reform that is more important in terms of wages policy, tax transfer policies and, above all, family policies than the family allowance supplement. The Government would be stupid not to advertise, not to make sure that people are aware of the range of family payments, such as the family allowance supplement.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for his question. I know that he is taking a very keen interest in this. In May, Wye Industries Ltd wrote to me advising of the product, and asked not for financial support but for access to people, particularly to officers of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in the United States, to describe the importance of the discovery in the hope that it might be developed internationally. Certainly, the reports of the product are impressive. It is a quantum leap as a chemical fire retardant. It would enable polyurethane foam to be blown without the need for CFC or any of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. As a result, I wrote to the regional director of UNEP in North America asking that it assist Wye Industries to find the most appropriate channels for environmental assessment of the discovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since then, and following a number of press reports on the subject, I sought details of what requests had been made by Wye Industries for support. No request has been made to the Commonwealth for support through any of our research and development arrangements. Testing of the product in the United States was funded by the Adelaide Innovation Centre. The company's application for an export development grant was granted in July 1989. The most recent press report, in the Sunday Mail on 13 August, quotes the South Australian Minister for State Development and Technology, Mr Lynn Arnold, as suggesting that his Department is working to see what can be done and is, in fact, trying to find investors.</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, I understand, negotiations are going on between the company and some investors in South Australia. I hope that those negotiations will be fruitful. At this stage the South Australian Government is not itself directly involved. I hope that this will be a good opportunity for Australian investors to put up `patient money' for something that I think is really a very important contribution to removing the amount of CFCs going into the atmosphere and threatening the survival of the ozone layer. I wish Wye Industries the very best of luck, and hope that it is one example where the private sector will come across. It is essentially something where the private sector ought to recognise the enormous commercial opportunities, and seek to exploit them properly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is possible, then, for the Government to provide itself and, indirectly and more directly, the Australian people and the national community with the capacity to pursue all of those objectives that it sets itself as a result of its responding to the reasonable expectations that the national community has. The fact is that there is a road user charge built into the excise on fuel, and this year that road user charge will be about 5.4c per litre. That achieves about 25 per cent of the target that had been set by the Australian Automobile Association, to which the honourable member referred. It suggested that we should increase the amount of excise per litre of fuel going back into the road system by 2c. This year we have achieved 25 per cent of that objective, if the Association wants to set it as such. In the process we have also been able to increase the amount of fuel excise going directly back into roads from the Federal Government from $1.2 billion to more than $1.3 billion. That represents an increase this year of almost 10 per cent and by any measure indicates quite clearly a real increase. So the basis upon which the general question has been formulated is quite spurious. As I have said before, the honourable member knows as well as everyone else does that the Federal Government has a tax structure which has been designed to provide the sort of revenue that is necessary to achieve national objectives. We will continue to do that and we will continue to do it well, as we have in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member wants to know whether I agree, the short answer is no, I definitely do not agree. I want to thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. One of the reasons I was so shocked by these comments by the shadow spokesman was a recent visit that I made to the electorate of Hinkler, and particularly to Bundaberg, where I met many Telecom employees. I must say that I was very impressed with the efficiency of the operation in Bundaberg and also, I have to say, by the representation of the local member. Far from operating in a sheltered environment, the recent policy initiatives of the Government in telecommunications have exposed Telecom to a range of pressures, both in the marketplace and in terms of its accountability to the Government and consumers that has never taken place before. In particular, Telecom now is subject to the independent regulator called Austel, whose job is to ensure Telecom performs efficiently, competes fairly in the marketplace and meets specific performance targets. Telecom also has a price cap on it set by the Government to ensure its service delivery and overall performance become more cost effective. Telecom and its staff, I believe, have responded to this challenge very positively and with great enthusiasm. Their recent achievements speak for themselves. First of all, last week the Opposition spokesman and I were present when Telecom launched its new technology called ISDN--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It launched its new ISDN technology, which provides Australia with one of the most advanced telecommunications networks in the world. Telecom is also developing further the range of satellite based services which provide enhanced services in outback Australia, at sea and in education services. It also is at the forefront of the value-added service market where it is competing with the private sector. It has introduced a whole range of innovatory products. But I think one of the most important initiatives, which has not been discussed at all in this House before, is the development of a lot of its commercially based subsidiaries and joint ventures, which are competing very successfully in the marketplace. For example, only about two weeks ago I launched with Pacific Dunlop Ltd, Olex, a new contract that Pacific Dunlop and Telecom have won. It is a $30m contract with Pakistan. I think that is something that this country should be proud of. Telecom in fact is doing a remarkable job competing not only in the new field that exists in Australia where there is considerable competition with the private sector on value-added services but also in the international arena.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that under this legislation-legislation that this Government brought in-the Government has ensured that Telecom competes in the market place on a fair basis. Telecom is responding very well to that competition and we are seeing great technological improvements in business achievements by Telecom. Finally, again I want to pay tribute to the 80,000 people around this country who make up Telecom. The Opposition has no interest in what is basically a great institution of which Australia can be proud. The Opposition's simple solution to handling any of these government business enterprises is to privatise them. We do not accept that as an alter- native. We want to see government business enterprises operating more efficiently. We believe in competition in regard to value added services but primarily we are very proud of the achievements of government business enterprises, and particularly the contributions they are making to electorates such as the electorate of the honourable member for Hinkler.</PARA>

Hansard trains many staff here-trains them superbly-and then, unfortunately, loses some of them to the States. The President and I have been concerned about the situation for some time. We have consulted with the Department of Industrial Relations in regard to submissions for increases in salaries. We are presently considering a report that has come to us from the five permanent heads in regard to another matter, which may help. We have sought the assistance of the Auditor-General in regard to Hansard. His report will come to us on Thursday. Hopefully, after that time I will be able to get more information back to the honourable member. I know that all honourable members will be concerned about the situation, but I know that they will all agree that we should not condone unreasonable workloads or lack of reasonable rest breaks for the staff.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable members will recall that, on 11 April 1989, I made a statement in this House reporting on the outcome of a series of inquiries into the administration of Aboriginal affairs. Those inquiries were established in response to allegations of serious shortcomings in the administration, including financial management, of the Aboriginal Development Commission and of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. At that time, while the bulk of the inquiries had been completed, I advised the House that a further report was expected from the Auditor-General in relation to some particular enterprise projects in the Aboriginal Development Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also indicated that the Government was awaiting a final report from Mr Andrew Menzies, AM, OBE, on certain matters which had not in his view otherwise been dealt with to finality. I made the point that, pending Mr Menzies' final report, it would be inappropriate to comment on the conduct of any individual. I also made it clear that, with the bulk of the inquiries then completed, the Government felt in a position to inform the Parliament of its views and intentions concerning organisational arrangements for the future, and I advised the House of actions which the Government proposed to take, while standing ready to refine our response and undertake any further action should that be necessary when remaining reports were received. </PARA>
<PARA> The final report from Mr Menzies was received by the Government during the parliamentary recess. That report has four parts, but Mr Menzies has recommended, and the Government accepts, that Part 4 not be published, given that it contains only names and addresses of certain persons and one Aboriginal agency who made submissions in confidence. The report makes reference elsewhere to the inputs of the persons and agency concerned but their identities are not central to the issues discussed. Copies of Part 4 of the report have been made available to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt), the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Chaney) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Haines). For the information of honourable members, I now table in the House the final report from Mr Menzies, other than Part 4. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will find that Part 1 of the report is an introductory chapter, including an overview. Part 2 covers the inquiries into three matters involving Mr Charles Perkins, to which I shall return shortly. Part 3 of the report deals with a number of miscellaneous allegations which Mr Menzies has investigated. In the case of two of these allegations, the report indicates that they have been referred to police for investigation. By agreement with Mr Menzies, the Auditor-General will be reporting on the other case. In none of the cases in Part 3 on which Mr Menzies himself has reported was corruption or serious illegality established. While Mr Menzies finds some cases of questionable practice, he recognises that action is already in hand to respond properly in those cases. </PARA>
<PARA> In Part 3 of the report, the only formal recommendation made by Mr Menzies relates to the activities of an organisation which is not a Commonwealth agency but is in receipt of Commonwealth funding. The relevant department, the Department of Community Services and Health, is acting on this recommendation. That Department is also following up the recommendation that the activities of a South Australian Aboriginal agency be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to that part of the report which deals with matters involving Mr Charles Perkins. By way of introduction, I remind honourable members that various allegations made about Commonwealth administration in the Aboriginal affairs area over the past months have attracted a great deal of publicity. Many of the accusations have been extremely serious. Some, for example, alleged patronage, favouritism, nepotism and cronyism in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Others alleged or implied corruption. The name of Charles Perkins was linked with many of those allegations and with much of this publicity. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that none of the several inquiries conducted for the Government, including this final report from Mr Menzies, supports allegations of that kind. I advised this House in April that the Public Service Commissioner did not substantiate allegations of patronage, favouritism, nepotism and cronyism in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. None of these reports has substantiated in any way allegations of corruption. It can and should be firmly said, therefore, that these serious allegations, so prominently publicised, have been grossly unfair to Mr Perkins and to his family. There is nothing which emerges from any of these intensive inquiries to suggest that Charles Perkins ever took any action out of self-interest or self-reward. It is true that he has occasionally been a controversial figure; but only, I believe, where he saw this as important to his continuing effectiveness as a leader of his people. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will see that this final report from Mr Menzies brings out some further shortcomings in administration in the area of Aboriginal affairs-in some cases shortcomings for which Mr Perkins, as the departmental Secretary over much of the period, has to bear ultimate responsibility. Although such shortcomings are identified, however, Mr Menzies does not find that Mr Perkins's role in any of the three issues addressed in this final report amounts to failure to fulfil his duty as an officer such that disciplinary action should or could be taken against him. I would add, Madam Speaker, that the bulk of the deficiencies identified in the various inquiries conducted for the Government were in the Aboriginal Development Commission and not in the Department for which Mr Perkins carried ultimate responsibility. And even within the Department, there would be incongruity in any attempt to find the blame for most of these deficiencies in Charles Perkins personally. As the Public Service Commissioner found, there were deficiencies in systems and procedures going well beyond the realm of Mr Perkins's personal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one of the three issues relating to Mr Perkins on which I wish to comment further. This relates to the source of the $50 which Mr Perkins paid for taxi fares for some of the persons who were demonstrating outside the Returned Services League headquarters on 9 September 1988. In the conclusions in his report, Mr Menzies expressed regret that Mr Perkins had refused to disclose to him the source of this $50. The report notes at paragraph 3.10 that Mr Perkins gave an `unequivocal assurance that the $50 used for the taxi fares did not come from any political source at home or abroad or from any corporation or organisation. Neither did the money come from any official source'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Mr Menzies was not satisfied with this response has caused Mr Perkins's advisers to write to me submitting further information. I now table their letter. The letter points out that Mr Perkins's refusal to disclose the precise source of the funds was based on legal advice, first, in relation to a dispute over Mr Menzies' jurisdiction in this matter and, secondly, on what was seen as an undue invasion of personal privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the conclusions on this matter reported by Mr Menzies, however, and notwithstanding their continuing concerns about privacy, Mr Perkins and his legal advisers have now provided in their letter to me an unequivocal assurance from Mr Perkins that he paid for the taxis out of his own pocket. I accept that assurance. I state again that none of these various and extensive inquiries commissioned by the Government has found any evidence of misconduct or other actions by Mr Perkins of a serious kind warranting disciplinary action or censure. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time this House and this Parliament put those matters behind it and instead expressed its recognition of the substantial contribution Charles Perkins has made throughout his working life in the interests of advancing the cause of the Aboriginal people. Mr Perkins was at the vanguard of Aboriginal people to have a degree conferred on him from an Australian university, and while at university was President of Student Action for Aborigines. He became more widely known during the period from 1965 to 1969 when he was manager of the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> He then moved into the government arena and for some 20 years has been applying all his energy, and drawing deeply on his commitment, to advance the cause of his people from his various positions within government. He has been a path-breaker for his people in working his way up through Public Service ranks in a competitive environment until he reached the top-the position from which he was best able to guide the development of policies and programs of value to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Charles Perkins believed that one of his most important roles was to keep in close touch with as many individual Aboriginal people, and as many Aboriginal communities, as he possibly could. Accordingly, he travelled extensively, and was able to bring to this Government and to previous governments an invaluable insight into the concerns and attitudes of his people. This is the context in which honourable members should view the reflections in these various inquiry reports on administrative shortcomings in organisational areas for which Mr Perkins has had responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, Charles Perkins advised me some time ago that he wished to retire from the Public Service as soon as possible to pursue an alternative career, and has recently arranged to do so in the normal way through the Public Service Commissioner. I am advised his retirement will take effect from today. I express, on behalf of the Government, regret that his services as a full-time officer will be lost to the Government, and I hope honourable members will join me in wishing him well in his future career. For the Government's part, it will be actively seeking appropriate opportunities to engage Mr Perkins in appropriate part-time activity so that the wealth of his knowledge and experience is not totally lost to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to turn to the central issue in all of these inquiries-the quality of administration in Aboriginal affairs. I remind the House of the Government's approach set out in my statement of 11 April: that we should draw upon the lessons from these inquiries and look to the future, ensuring that mechanisms are put in place and support provided so that future administration is enhanced. Since then, steps have been taken in both the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to respond to findings in the earlier inquiry reports which were addressed in my statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Aboriginal Development Commission, the adequacy of the Commission's procedures, systems and management controls has been audited by Price Waterhouse in the light of the findings in the earlier inquiries, and the recommendations from Price Waterhouse have now been implemented. A budget management committee and audit committee consisting of senior managers have been established in order to strengthen financial management and accountability. The Commission has also established a computer-based reporting system on program and project performance using monitoring indicators similar to those used in its reports to the Senate Estimates committee. Program and project performance reports are provided regularly to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. In the case of the Department, substantial progress has been made in the development of program budgeting and in the provision of training for implementation of program budgeting and continues to be made in the administration of grant programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Ways in which aboriginalisation may be advanced are under discussion with unions, the Public Service Commission and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. New guidelines have been issued for official hospitality and for use of consultants; travel practices have been reviewed; and corrective action has been taken in regard to classification matters as recommended by the Department of Finance. Most importantly, priority has been given to staff development and training which will provide the specialist skills required for the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by reminding honourable members of what I said in this House about ATSIC in my statement on 11 April. The Government's view then was and still is that this new Commission is the logical and appropriate next step for the advancement of both the great principles of self-management and ministerial accountability. Nothing in the earlier inquiry reports, nor in this final report from Mr Menzies, has shifted that belief on the part of the Government. Indeed, as I said in April, the inquiry reports give us encouragement that the proposed structure of ATSIC will be beneficial. As Prime Minister I fully support, and the Government as a whole fully supports, the initiatives the Minister has taken in proposing the creation of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members know, we have made some amendments to the ATSIC legislation in the light of these various inquiry reports and the report of the Senate select committee. Having done so, we are now firmly committed to proceeding with this legislation and establishing this body as quickly as possible. I hope this House and this Parliament will now accept that passage of this legislation, and establishment of ATSIC, is clearly in the best interests both of good government and of the necessary advancement of the administration of Aboriginal policy and programs for the benefit of the Aboriginal people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leave-agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908, authorises the publication of the final report of the inquiry by Mr A. C. C. Menzies into allegations as to the administration of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In a letter to Mr A. C. C. Menzies dated 10 November 1988, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) outlined the nature of the inquiry into `certain aspects' of the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). At that time, the Auditor-General, the Public Service Commissioner and the Department of Finance were undertaking investigations into allegations which fell within their respective responsibilities. Mr Menzies' task was to inquire into specific allegations of illegal, corrupt or improper conduct or serious mismanagement of public funds or resources in light of the findings and recommendations of the previously mentioned investigations and audits, and any other matters which in his judgment warranted further examination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Menzies issued an interim report in April 1989. At that time the Prime Minister made a statement to the House reporting the outcome of the inquiry so far and outlined the Government's proposal for a complete reorganisation of Aboriginal administration in the form of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). Mr Menzies' final report was delivered to the Prime Minister in June. It has been tabled today, and it is no doubt hoped that it will be lost in some of the pre-Budget build-up and hype. The Prime Minister has also foreshadowed a renewed push for the Government's ATSIC legislation. Debate on the ATSIC Bill was guillotined in this House in May and it is now, as I understand it, to be debated in the Senate during this Budget week. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been instrumental in pursuing the question of maladministration of the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs by the current Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and by Ministers before him. That the Opposition had just cause is vindicated in the various reports issuing out of the many inquiries, including the Menzies inquiry, and the Prime Minister has admitted as much today. The report of the Auditor-General's special audit in particular illustrated the flawed nature of the Government's administration of Aboriginal affairs, and such maladministration is the fundamental reason why the government funding has not reached the very people most in need. Mr Menzies is also critical of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in his general observations. At page 6 he comments:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a senior-level Task Force supported by seconded expert officers should be established to assist DAA to improve its administration. </PARA>
<PARA>The report clearly exonerates Charles Perkins. It recommends, as the Prime Minister has indicated in this House today, that no action should be taken against him-only that the terms of inquiries relating to him be brought to his attention. The Prime Minister now speaks in praise of Mr Perkins. His own Minister condemned Mr Perkins, and no wonder the Minister squirmed at the Prime Minister's words today. I have to say that, from the Opposition's point of view, the offer to employ or engage Mr Perkins in appropriate part time activities is welcomed by us. I have known and observed Charles Perkins over most of the period of my public life. We have seen one another from time to time over those many years at infrequent periods but I have had plenty of years to observe and develop a respect for him, and the respect that I hold him in is shared by honourable members on this side of the House. I am sure that he will be best able to judge his future uncoerced by any form of Government rhetoric, and I wish him well on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister today has also referred to improved guidelines, procedures and accountability for both the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal affairs. The Government has known of deficiencies in the administration of Aboriginal Affairs for years, and we could well ask why reforms were not undertaken some time ago. Now the Government proposes to undertake a massive and radical reorganisation of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio when its house is not yet in order. The Prime Minister's support for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as `the logical and appropriate next step for the advancement of both the great principles of self-management and ministerial accountability' is extraordinary. The ATSIC proposal has since its inception been fundamentally flawed and we on this side have been strong in our condemnation. I should advise the House of a number of the strong reasons for the coalition's continued opposition to the ATSIC proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the minority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs found that the proposal for ATSIC was unjustified, unnecessary and culturally inappropriate and that it would operate to the detriment of Aborigines and lead to worse services and to less accountability to both Aborigines and Islanders and to all Australians. Secondly, the consultation process preceding the proposal for ATSIC has been inadequate. The majority of Aborigines do not identify with it. Thirdly, ATSIC regionalises and centralises control and therefore undermines traditional and local Aboriginal networks. In fact, the Minister will retain ultimate control of the Commission. Fourthly, it is a bureaucratic means of representation which takes no account of traditional Aboriginal processes. Fifthly, it is fundamentally flawed in that it seeks to incorporate representative and administrative processes in the same structure. Sixthly, it will add to waste and the duplication of programs at the three levels of government. And, seventhly, it will further isolate Aboriginal Australians in what would virtually be a black parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Prime Minister's tabling of the Menzies report today and hoping that its findings will not undermine ATSIC, the coalition, as you will gather from these objections, Mr Deputy Speaker, will continue its strong opposition to ATSIC. The Government must get its administration of Aboriginal affairs in order before indulging in ideologically motivated schemes which do not address the real health, education and housing needs of our Aboriginal people and which could further marginalise their position as Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I start by saying that the Opposition is very pleased to be back in the Parliament today and very pleased to have the Government clearly in its sights. Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will deliver his seventh-and undoubtedly his last-Budget. It will be an election Budget-a Budget with a very big surplus, a surplus obtained by ripping more and more taxes out of the pockets of hard working taxpayers around this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, the Government's presentation of the Budget is absolutely predictable. The first thing we will be told is that this is the world's best Budget from the world's best Treasurer. Some of our friends in the media and some of the commentators will say that it is a master political stroke for the Treasurer to grab back the initiative and to put himself firmly in charge of the economy. I know that these things will be said because we have heard it all before. In fact, 12 months ago the hyperbole was just unbelievable. This time last year we were told that that Budget really was the greatest Budget ever presented and that what the Treasurer had been able to do was to combine his tremendous economic expertise and his great talent for politics, and thrust himself to the top job in the Government and in the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He burnt the bacon. I thank my colleagues for their interjections. Mr Deputy Speaker, as we all know, sadly economic events have clearly demonstrated that this propaganda was wrong in the past, as it will be in the future. I just say to the Government: the public will not be conned. There is no way that one can con the working mums-the mums who go to work not because they want to but because they have to to make ends meet. They know that the Government fiddles the consumer price index. When they go to the supermarket they are not going to be convinced by some Treasurer who says that he is going to fix inflation and that it is going to go down. They are in the supermarkets. The Treasurer ought to take the advice of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and get into a supermarket occasionally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a few sops for the elderly, and they are not going to be conned by that. They are not going to be bought off with a couple of dollars from on high and in gratitude vote for this Government. Those opposite really are completely out of touch. The fact is that the elderly in this country have had more changes to superannuation and more changes to pension arrangements than they have had meals on wheels. They will not be bought off by a Budget which will offer very little for their future. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say that, for all the hot air coming from this Government-and there will be lots of it tonight, and tomorrow particularly-everybody knows that Australia has not been run very well in recent years. I do not need some opinion poll to substantiate the obvious, but I noted yesterday a poll to the effect that the community sentiment about this country's economic health was bleak: nearly 50 per cent of voters regarded the economy as poor and only 11 per cent considered economic conditions good or very good. One does not need to be an economist to see some of the problems that have brought people to make those sorts of conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put on the table today seven of the deadly sins, if you like, of Labor's economic management. Firstly, wages: wages are very interesting, because this Government has very strong claims about wages. If we look at the detail, we see that the fact is that we have been running one of the worst wages policies of any country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. We have a system whereby we keep paying ourselves increases much higher than those of our competitors. One of the things that really undermine the competitiveness of this economy is, in fact, our wage structure and wage policy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is followed up by the other side of that coin, that is, very high inflation. I mention that because, in fact, inflation higher than our wages growth brings me to my third sin, that is, Labor's low wage policy. One of the things I really resent about this Government is that it tells everybody else that they ought to pull in their belts but it never actually bothers to pull in its own belt. Those opposite-and they are proud of it-say to people, `We have done a great job. We have encouraged the whole community to tighten their belts'. When one thinks about that, it is a pretty odd thing to say really, because the bottom line of that is, `We have done really well because we have encouraged everybody to actually accept a lower standard of living'. It is a low wage policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth deadly sin is a continuing balance of payments problem-over $17 billion in the last year, quite contrary to all the projections made by the Treasurer last year. The fifth deadly sin, I say, is the way in which we run industrial relations in this country. Again, we hear a lot of hot air from this Government about the level of strikes and industrial disputes in this country. Have a look at the figures, because the fact is that, when it comes to industrial relations, we have a record which is appalling. I do not say that lightly. Look at our international competitors and see how many days they lose as a result of strikes and industrial disputes. Look at West Germany. Our record is something like 50 times higher than West Germany's. Honourable members will not be surprised. Look at the Japanese economy. Our figure is something like 24 times higher than that country's. Let us look at the United Kingdom. The Labor Party loves to say, `That Margaret Thatcher, she is a terrible woman; she is a confrontationist'. But our industrial record in this country is 2 1/2 times worse than the industrial relations record in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth area, I say, is productivity. `Productivity' is an economics jargon word, but it is a pretty simple one which I think most people understand. It is a measure of how efficiently we run this country. It is inputs over outputs. Again, if one looks at the figures on productivity, one sees that our record is not a good one. I call it the yawning productivity gap. In this country our productivity levels are actually on the decline; they are actually falling. If one compares that with how other countries are doing, one sees that their productivity figures are actually on the increase. We are going down; they are going up. If honourable members want to know why this country is lacking competitiveness and why we are having trouble selling our goods in the markets of the world, the fact is that we are not running our businesses as efficiently as we ought to. That yawning productivity gap tells a considerable story about our economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh deadly sin that I put on the table today is the one that really sums everything up, and that is this country's international debt. We are told about the tremendous abilities of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-what economic whiz kids they are and what a great job they have done for seven years-but let us look at the figures. When they came to office this country had a debt-it had taken us 190-odd years to get to it-of about $23 billion. They reckon that that was a lot of money. They say, `Blame it all on the last Government', but under their economic management our debt has gone from $23 billion to $103 billion. Eighty billion dollars of that debt is their business. It is the result of their economic management and they ought to be pinned with the responsibility for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Every month we buy, as a nation, more from overseas than we are capable of selling; so every month we increase the debt. The Government's answer is that because our economy is growing too fast we must tighten our belts and spend less. That is its only solution. So it jacks up interest rates deliberately so as to stop families, young people and businesses from spending; in fact, it puts a choker on the whole economy. It is just a joke for the Prime Minister to come in here and talk about what he is going to do by way of relief for young home buyers when that is his policy. It is like playing Australian rules and a bloke clocks you from behind, breaks your leg, and says, as he carries you off on a stretcher, `She'll be right, mate. I'll buy you the crutches'. If it was Bob Hawke he would say, `And vote for me as well'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that it is the Government's policies that have given us high interest rates. The Government has some choices but it cares not to take them. Labor's policy, therefore, is that if we do well, if the economy booms, we have to put on the brakes. That is a poverty trap of macro proportions. It is the ultimate stop-start approach. The Treasurer is very keen on the analogy that he will move us from the fast lane into the middle lane. The truth is that his policy is quite different from that. In most races one goes round and heads towards the finish, perhaps stopping once in the pit stops for a fuel pickup. Under the Treasurer's policy one goes into the pit stops after every lap. Whenever this economy starts to get going and get a head of steam, Labor's policy says, `We can't do any more, we can't grow, we have to put a stop to it'. That is a very negative view about the future prospects of this country. That is where the differences between the way in which the Labor Party runs the economy and the way in which we would run the economy are very great and considerable. The Labor Party takes a negative view. We say in response that there is a much better way of running this country than has been the case in recent years. We reject the defeatist policy that keeping interest rates high is the only thing that can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I have identified some of the ills and will now look at some of the prescriptions. Looking at the prescriptions, the good news is that there are literally hundreds of thousands of things that we, as a community, could do to pick up this economy, to pay off our debts and to move forward without the sort of millstone around our grandchildren's necks that will be the legacy of this Government. The one thing that Labor fears the most is that the people in the electorate, the people who ultimately decide these issues, will cotton on to the simple message that there is a much better way of running this economy than what we have had from the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I have brought in here a few of the plans and policies. We have policies coming out of our ears. We have plans, schemes, new ideas, and initiatives-good things to do to start turning around this economy. It is a pretty thick list. If the Prime Minister stood up on it he would be up to the shoulder of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). Chapter 1 deals with industrial relations. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) is at the table. The fact is that there is much that we can do. This area is significant because it is not just about how we run our businesses. Having industrial relations policy and doing things better are things we can do in virtually every institution in the country. I am the shadow Minister for education. Our industrial relations proposals for universities are a great idea. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is attacking them; he wants to run higher education from Canberra. If we had our industrial relations practice and policy put into place that would put a stop to a lot of that right from the start. We can have better industrial relations in our schools. We have a plan for that. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) is going to talk about what we could do with the waterfront if we had better industrial relations. The waterfront is costing us $850m a year. That is a conservative estimate. It has absolutely ruined our reputation as a reliable supplier, and the frustrating thing is that the answers are obvious. We have printed them in black and white. We have fine print by the load. The fact is that even the Government itself has acknowledged, on privatisation and some of these other issues, that there is a better way of doing things than we have now. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take industrial relations. We say that one of the first things we ought to do in industrial relations is to encourage a different approach to the way in which we conduct the whole thing. At the moment if there is a problem in industrial relations the first thing people do if they are in a union is pick up the phone and ring the union representative. If they are employers, the first thing they do is pick up the phone and ring the employer organisation. If those two cannot get together, they bring in the umpire. The first thing we ought to do in industrial relations is to encourage people to talk one to another. So one of the ideas we have is share ownership. I think that is a great idea to encourage people, to say to them, `Look, you have a stake in this business and, through having a stake in your business-your enterprise-you have a stake in the future of this country'. The list of good ideas that we have to turn this country round is a long one. Let me conclude by saying that this is a good country; we have a good people; we have a bright future; but in recent years we have not been running this country as well as we should. It is time for a change, and it is time for the community out there to grasp these good ideas, to support them and to criticise this Government for its failure to adopt some of the good ideas that would address our basic problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I waited and waited and finally, in the fourteenth and fifteenth minutes, industrial relations got a mention. But I am sorry to have to relate to the House that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in the last two minutes of his speech did not have the opportunity to enunciate that which he had put on the daily program as a matter of public importance. It was a vacuous speech; it was a speech that contained nothing. I could have made a much better effort for him with my eyes shut and my hands tied behind my back. I can remember enough of what he has had to say in the past. It was the same old tawdry record. As I have said before, he has learned nothing and he has forgotten nothing. What he said was the same old thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important thing to say about the Opposition in respect of industrial relations is that the heart of the honourable member for Flinders was not in that speech. His heart was not in it because he recognises, as do many on this side of the House, that the shadow Minister for industrial relations, Senator Chaney, is really only the nominal shadow Minister for industrial relations. We recognise, as the honourable member does, that Senator Chaney is just filling the chair for the time being. The real policy in industrial relations from those who sit opposite is not being driven by Senator Chaney. He is a nice man; he has a very amiable and pleasant manner. He says lots of nice things about almost anything. There is rarely a subject that one can raise that he will not have something nice to say about, but when we come to matters that count, such as industrial relations and economic policy, it is not him that is driving the policies for the Opposition; it is the old New Right-it is a hard term, is it not?-the disciples of the New Right. I refer to the Kemps, the Copemans, the Costellos, the McLachlans, Senator Stone. They are the people who are driving the policy for the Opposition. If the role of the honourable member for Flinders is to be defined, it is simply that of being the spokesman for the Confederation of Australian Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> That explains why in that 15 minutes we got a two-minute, very brief, mention of the subject of industrial relations. I will have to try to put the Opposition's policy forward to the House for the honourable member for Flinders, because he did not have time. What he is saying is that the Opposition's viewpoint is that we should have an enterprise by enterprise arrangement. He is saying, `We should go back to the nineteenth century. We should go back to the old style of pitting employer against employee in every shop, on every farm, in every factory, in every mine, and in every workplace. Some will win; some will lose; the strong will exploit the weak'. It was the exploitation and the abuse of that system that led to the establishment of unions and of industry associations, and to the establishment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court in order to have an orderly system of conducting industrial relations. That orderly system has evolved over the decades to the current system of the accord. No matter how the Opposition tries to denigrate the accord, the accord is about industry and trade unions working together to get a better result for this nation. If we look back over the past 6 1/2 years we find that, in a period when industry, trade union leadership and government have worked together, we have had some remarkable improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders talked about inflation. Let me compare inflation: it was 11.5 per cent in the last year of the Fraser Government; it is 7.6 per cent under this Government. It is not low enough; it has to come down lower. The Government has that as an objective and will continue pushing for that objective. He talked about wage costs. Let me remind the House that in the period of the accord we have seen a reduction of some 14.6 per cent in real unit labour costs. That was not mentioned by the Opposition; it does not suit the argument it is putting. Real wages have gone down by over 4 per cent in the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition is saying is that wages should go down further still-that wages are not low enough in this country. That is a fascinating policy. At the same time the Opposition has a policy that says that there should be a broad-based consumption tax and an increase in family living standards. It is fascinating: imposing a new tax and decreasing real wages is going to lift family living standards! At the same time, the Federal President of the Liberal Party is saying that 30 per cent of welfare should be cut. Here we have one of the richest men in this country, chairing one of the largest companies in this country-a company that not very long ago was seeking to move offshore to try to minimise its tax obligations-saying to the pensioners and to the genuine sick of this country, `Listen here, fellows, women and children: you are getting too much and you are going to get a 30 per cent cut'. That is what the Opposition stands for. That is what is driving the Opposition's policy-not the sweet-talking shadow Minister for industrial relations, Senator Chaney. He is a nice man who says all sorts of nice things, but what he stands for is that attack on the elderly, upon the sick, and upon the low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders referred to the rate of industrial disputation and said that it was appalling under this Government. Let me say to the House that the rate of industrial disputation in this country under this Government has been reduced by something like 60 per cent. I would like to know what the Opposition thinks of the rate of industrial disputation under the Fraser Government. If a 60 per cent reduction is an appalling record, the record of the Fraser Government is beyond description. There has been vast improvement and there will be continuing improvement as things get under way and the consultation process this Government follows carries on. The honourable member made no mention, when he talked about labour costs, of the 1 1/2 million new jobs that have been created in this country under the policies of this Government. One and a half million new jobs are out there-the lowest rate of unemployment in well over six years. They are the achievements of this Government--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Humphreys" NAMEID="FH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FH4">Mr Humphreys</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. And if we are looking to increase family living standards, we look to ensuring that family bread winners have a job. It is no good talking about family living standards if people cannot get a job. That is really what the Opposition stands for, because what the Opposition is about in this enterprise by enterprise arrangement is pitting employer against employee, doing away with the industrial relations system, and fighting it out in the workplace. What the Opposition is about in this enterprise by enterprise arrangement, pitting employer against employee, doing away with the industrial relations system, fighting it out in the workplace, as the honourable member let slip, is Thatcherism. Opposition members are about generating unemployment. They are about crushing the trade union movement and organised representation for workers, and they are about then forcing employees to take poorer conditions. We utterly abhor and reject that kind of policy. What those opposite stand for is conflict, divisiveness, confrontation. The honourable member for Flinders made that very clear this afternoon. His reference to Thatcherism and Thatcherite policy made it clear to all of us what they really stand for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to contrast that, Mr Deputy Speaker, with the policy of this Government. Our policy is centred upon consultation. It is about bringing people together, about employees participating through award restructuring-that streamlining and simplification of job classifications. I will come to that in a moment. It is about consultation, about involving people in the workplace, involving the trade unions, industry associations, employers and, where necessary, government, and improving productivity. I thought I would have heard something about productivity from the honourable member for Flinders. We did not; he did not have time. We are about getting people together to lift the level of performance in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> He also referred to the balance of payments. The balance of payments is a problem which has been generated, as he well knows, by the record rate of business investment. As the Opposition and most reasonable economic commentators know, the lift in business investment has generated that demand for imports and we have to slow down so we can cope with the level of growth that is there. We cannot accommodate that same growth of demand without lifting our level of performance, without lifting our production capacity; so in those circumstances things have to be steadied down. </PARA>
<PARA> First the honourable member said that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) fiddles the consumer price index (CPI). He said `the Government', but he knows the Government does not have any role in the consumer price index. That is a decision of the statutory authority, the Australian Bureau of Statistics. So the accusation is that the ABS fiddles the CPI. He went on to talk about working mums. Let me remind the House that most of the people affected by the Industrial Relations Commission decision on increased pay rates for low paid workers are mums. They are working women, many with dependent families, dependent children. So on the one hand he says that the Opposition is concerned about working mums. On the other hand, Senator Chaney, the shadow Minister for industrial relations, made this statement after the Commission's decision was brought down in which he attacked that decision, and he attacked the concept of lifting incomes and wages for low paid workers. So there is the hypocrisy. It is really a mock concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member referred to the plight of the elderly. I quickly state the position again because it is that important: it is a mock concern for the plight of the elderly. The Federal President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, is one of the richest individuals in this country. It is really an obscenity when you have a person of that wealth, that standing, leading a political party when his company was trying to go offshore to get its tax commitments down. He is saying to the elderly they are being paid too much. </PARA>

They are the people being attacked by the Liberal Party, and here we have the honourable member for Flinders with this mock concern about payments and incomes for the elderly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He said the Opposition has this mammoth stack of policies: pray somebody produce them, somebody explain them. There are only two things we want to know at the moment. What is the Opposition's tax policy? We have been promised it for almost two years now, week by week. But let us put it on the table. Where is the tax policy? The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) says they will produce it at the appropriate time. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said that. But let them put that policy on the table. When we come to expenditure cuts that are touted by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), let us put that on the table too. Let us be fair dinkum.

<PARA> Let me go back to the real world of business-this enterprise by enterprise arrangement touted by the Opposition. Honourable members opposite do not know what they are about. Let me deal with that arrangement and what one of the leading industry organisations in this country thinks of it. Bert Evans, the Executive Director of the Metal Trades Industry Association, was reported back on 28 June as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't need anyone lecturing me about the supposed benefits of enterprise bargaining and a totally decentralised system . . . We had it for more than 20 years and we had strikes on a daily basis. Industrial relations was just conflict from factory to factory. In the 1967 work-value case we had 500 companies on strike for five weeks . . . We stopped counting at 500 because we couldn't get through on the phones. What we are doing today-</PARA>
<PARA>which is under this Government-</PARA>
<PARA>is immeasurably better. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the real world. This Government, through the process of award restructuring, is going to provide the opportunity for industry to have a better trained, more flexible work force, a work force which will have a broader range of skills and be able to carry out a broader range of tasks, a work force which will have better access to training and a work force which will have career structures built into its awards. In that way we are going to get a more efficient, more productive work force. We are going to be able to lift the level of competitiveness of this country. This is the only way that we will be able to provide the security that workers need for the future. This is the way in which we will be able to continue to generate new jobs in addition to the 1 1/2 million jobs that have been provided under the policies of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a number of years we on this side of the House have become very used to having to listen to drivel coming from the Government side of this chamber. But, of course, `drivel' is too mild a word to describe what we have just heard from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris). The Minister's performance today gives us a very clear indication as to why he was unable to achieve for his constituency the very handsome rewards that would flow from the Navy's Anzac ship construction contract. Had he been able to do a better job there, I am sure his constituency would want to have him back again. But, having failed, I do not think they will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, what we heard today is a classic example of why the Minister was unsuccessful. We heard him go on about people like working mums-he kept on talking about working mums and how there was a need to do things for them. Let me just say to the House that there are more working mums in the work force today than there ever have been simply because of what this Government has done to the economy and to the standard of living of the average Australian. By jacking up interest rates and by lowering the standard of living of every Australian, it has forced more and more women into the work force and, as a consequence, the issue of working mothers today is a critical one. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also talked about the Opposition's policies-indeed, egged on by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), he referred to a pack of policies. The Minister obviously has not been paying attention to what has gone on in this Parliament over the past 12 months because I can assure him that the Opposition has a stack of policies. I have one of them in front of me-a policy on the reform of the waterfront. Twenty-seven policies have been put out by the Opposition, the Liberal and National parties, over the past 12 months. Those policies put us in a unique position because no Opposition since Federation has had more policies than we have at the present time. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, having got those policies, we are prepared to implement them. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the policies that we are going to implement lock, stock and barrel is the one that I held up a few moments ago. I refer to our policy on the waterfront which we launched in April of this year. Having sat through the speech by the Minister for Industrial Relations, one can only be confirmed in one's view that what this Government is all about is hypocrisy, being two-faced and having double standards. The Government is engaging in double standards in that some people in the community are going to be exempt from rules which apply to everybody else and they are the people in the trade union movement, particularly the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation today where the Grains Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation (NFF) and the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) are endeavouring to ensure that they can deliver wheat to the export market at a cheaper price. They are going to do this by trying to avoid having to employ Waterside Workers Federation employees at the grain handling terminal in Brisbane. This is a classic example of what we often hear the Government talking about, that is, micro-economic reform. We have seen the Government impose upon the wheat industry over the last few months something called deregulation-deregulation of the wheat industry that is part of the Government's grand plan of micro-economic reform. I am afraid its grand plan of micro-economic reform came to a deadly halt when it got up to the wheat industry because, having got to that point, it went no further. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members on this side of the House will recall very clearly promises made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and by Government members themselves that, as part of the package of deregulation of the wheat industry, there would also be deregulation of the waterfront, genuine reform of the waterfront along the lines of the Inter-State Commission's report that was tabled earlier this year. Unfortunately, once we had got the Parliament to approve deregulation of the wheat industry, what did we see happen? Part of the package of promises that went with it was broken. That promise to deregulate, to reform the waterfront, came to a deadly halt when we had the Inter-State Commission's report tabled here in the Parliament because the response to that report by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) here in the House on 1 June was inadequate. He left out the very hardest parts. The bits that actually protected the Waterside Workers Federation he left in. Those parts that referred to compulsory stand-down provisions, to enterprise-based employment and that gave employers the right to hire and fire were left out; they were avoided by the Government. As a consequence, the Inter-State Commission's recommendations, which were acceptable to all parties bar the Waterside Workers Federation, were not properly implemented and will not be properly implemented by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of double standard that we see in the Parliament today under this Government. We see the Grains Council of Australia being told that it has to accept deregulation of its own industry and in return it will get deregulation of the waterfront, the transport industries and so on. Unfortunately, that promise has been broken. Now that the Grains Council of Australia, the NFF and the AWB are trying to do something to reduce the costs that are imposed upon their industry by some of the trade unions, such as the Waterside Workers Federation, what happens? Does the Government encourage them and say, `Oh, yes, this is all part of our micro-economic reform, our reform to try to reduce costs for our exporting industries so that they can earn more export dollars for Australia, so that Australians can have some more income coming in'? No. What does the Government do? It does not encourage the Grains Council, the NFF and the AWB; it discourages them. It rings up the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who rings up the Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Mr Condon, and says to him, `You're not allowed to let this happen. We're not going to have these sorts of reforms going on in the grain terminals. We are not going to have cost-cutting procedures going on because, in the process of implementing those cost-cutting procedures, you are going to affect some of our mates, the Waterside Workers Federation'. Of course, we all know how symbolic the Waterside Workers Federation is to the trade union movement. When we talk about it, people like Bill Kelty and so forth get all dewy-eyed because it is so symbolic to them. Of course, it is this type of double standard, this type of hypocrisy that we are experiencing constantly from this Government, that we see so clearly in its reforms of the industrial workplaces throughout Australia and in its refusal to allow the NFF, the Australian Wheat Board and the Grains Council of Australia to go ahead with the changes they propose at the grain handling terminal in Brisbane in order to reduce the cost of handling grain at that terminal and, indeed, to reduce the cost of handling grain throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard the Minister just a few moments ago say that he has not heard many of our policies. Let me just give him a reminder of what our policy on the waterfront that we launched in April of this year is all about. If he wants to know what we are going to do on the waterfront, I will give him a couple of pages of that policy which tell him exactly how we are going to reform the waterfront so that there are genuine increases in our productivity, so that we can export more, be more competitive and bring home more dollars for Australia and so that we can increase the standard of living of the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to change on the waterfront is to open up the whole industry to competition. The gradualist approach, which has been adopted in the past, has failed to solve the fundamental problems on the waterfront. There are three dimensions to introducing competition on the waterfront. First, greater competition between ports should be encouraged. This should include putting individual ports under their own port authorities. Port authorities should primarily be run by users and should have explicitly commercial charters. Secondly, there should be greater competition within ports between companies providing services such as stevedoring and towage. All port services should be provided following an explicit tendering process. Contracts should be for relatively short fixed terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The third part is that competition should be introduced into the labour market. This entails a number of things. Firstly, employers should have the normal freedom to hire and fire employees. That is something that is not presently available on the waterfront today. Secondly, the Federal and port coordinating committees should be abolished. There should be no third party interference in manning levels. Individual companies should be free to determine how many employees, including casuals, they require. Employers should not be required to recruit labour from the Waterside Workers Federation register. There should be no obligation on employers to recruit labour in the name of rejuvenation beyond what they deem commercially appropriate. There should be no externally imposed obligations on training. Levy arrangements should be terminated. Employers and employees should be free to negotiate directly terms and conditions of their own employment, and there should be changes to legislation governing union coverage to permit employers to negotiate with unions not traditionally represented on the waterfront. There should be legislative changes in order to enforce all of those things. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition is all about in its package of policies for the waterfront, one of which I have just referred to, is to make this country more productive and more competitive. What we see today, with the Government's refusal to allow the Wheat Board to implement its reforms, is hypocrisy of the greatest order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That really was an extraordinary speech. It did not have much to do with the subject of the matter of public importance, which is supposed to be about industrial relations. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) was apparently recycling a speech on waterfront reform that he had given in the earlier part of the year in an earlier sitting of the House. It was strange to hear him talking about a subject that really had nothing to do with the subject of the matter of public importance at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposer of the matter, in his vacuous and rather bland speech, made some extraordinary comments. The one that leapt out at me, I must say, was that wages were increasing too fast and that wages were too low. He seemed to want to have it both ways. It was an extraordinary speech. This is really an astonishing matter of public importance, if we take it as it is written, because at the very same time that the Government, employers, unions and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are cooperating on the introduction of major reform of the whole industrial relations system, award restructuring, the Opposition is proposing to destroy that reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite really do not seem to have been watching what is going on at all. They appear to be arguing that wages would increase more slowly in the kind of deregulated system that they are advocating; but their view ignores history and it is, of course, simplistic and doctrinaire. On the worst recent occasion when the centralised wage fixing system broke down, 1981-82, there was a period of inflationary wage growth which was quickly followed by escalating unemployment as a result of the loss of jobs. The application of the kinds of simplistic competitive models of the labour market which they are proposing neglects the fact that complex human beings are involved who have a strong sense of justice about comparative wage levels, and that unions are performing a centrally important job in restraining exploitation and in ensuring the sharing of the benefits of increasing productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> A wise incomes policy, as distinct from the very superficial one that the Opposition is advocating, must take account of all the realities, as well as desired outcomes. The accord, which has been in place for the past nearly seven years, draws unions, businesses and other community groups into consultation with government to reach broad agreement about the distributional questions which underlie inflation. This discussion and persuasion is more humane than the brutality of the Fraser years of bludgeoning the economy into submission through high unemployment, large numbers of bankruptcies, and bitter labour disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the Minister describe the successes of the voluntary, comprehensive and equitable prices and income policy which we have had in the last six or seven years. He has talked about the reduction in the number of industrial disputes. He did not proclaim that as strongly as he might have. In 1981 there were 4,200 days lost per 1,000 workers. In recent years, that has been down to just over 1,000 days per 1,000 workers each year, which is just about a quarter of the level it was at in 1981. Of course, the principal achievement of the accord has been that through the stable, steady industrial relations system, and the wages that have flowed from it, we have had a growth in employment of about 1 1/2 million. The Minister made that point very strongly and it is the centrally important achievement of the prices and incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to understand why Opposition members should continue to raise the question of an enterprise-based approach to industrial relations. Which planet have they been on during the last two years? In that time, huge strides have been made through the accord to accommodate greater enterprise flexibility in the centralised wages system while ensuring economically responsible wage outcomes. Let me remind the House what those developments have been. In early 1987, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as it then was switched the emphasis of the wage-fixing system away from indexed across-the-board increases to productivity-based wage rises at enterprise level. That was the two-tiered system. </PARA>
<PARA> This new system was a breakthrough but it was interpreted in many companies as a narrow cost cutting approach rather than a long term efficiency approach. That led to the three wage decisions of the past 12 months which put in place the structural efficiency principle and the framework for award restructuring. It is far more constructive today to discuss the qualities and benefits of the new system than to waste any further time on the doctrinaire and quite superficial alternative being proposed by the Opposition; and we did not get much of the alternative in the presentation of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wrote it myself and I believe it is true. Award restructuring implies nothing less than the complete overhaul of Australia's antiquated system of industrial awards and agreements. It has now been endorsed and developed as a focus for wage determination and labour market reform in a series of Industrial Relations Commission decisions beginning in August last year. In the first place, the new structural efficiency principle has been developed to go beyond the narrow costs offsets approach of the two tiered system. This encompasses a number of issues which are being addressed in negotiations on new awards, including the recently agreed metal and engineering industry award. These issues do not simply require change on the part of the work force. They place a clear responsibility on employers to act as well. These principles include the reduction of outmoded job classifications to a smaller number of skill levels. The Opposition could not possibly disagree with that proposal and I am delighted to see the agreement of unions and business to that kind of principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principles also include development of new career structures with opportunities for personal advancement. They include the provision of high quality training with recognised standards and accreditation. It is impossible to see in the Opposition's approach to industrial relations how it provides an incentive for training, yet training is the necessary condition for building up productivity. They involve expanded opportunities for women and the removal of discrimination in awards and procedures for sharing inform- ation and consulting workers on new technology, training and work organisation. The framework for change at enterprise level is to be established by the award negotiations themselves and we see they are under way at present. Trade unions are required to pursue this fundamental review of their awards together with employer bodies. Progress is taking place in a structured, broadly based way. An environment is being created for the translation of the new awards into action, not just in a handful of go-ahead companies, and there are plenty of those, but in the vast majority of enterprises throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most significant feature of award restructuring is its restoration of the principles of equity and fairness to centre stage. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be achieved by the new matrix of relationships between key award rates proposed in the Australian Council of Trade Unions blueprint and accepted in principle by the Industrial Relations Commission in its May decision, and by the assessing of new minimum rates. Not only will this dramatic step bring in a fairer wage system, but it will also ensure greater stability through what we must all fervently hope will be an elimination of destructive leap-frogging. Let me say that I regard the series of national wage decisions over the past year as the most revolutionary since the 1907 Harvester judgment established a basic wage. Award restructuring provides an historic opportunity to strengthen the foundations of the accord by translating the principles of involvement and fairness into action at the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's motion is really fantasy. It simply applies ideological categories to an area of policy about which it appears to know next to nothing. Its views are outdated. They take no account of the realities of the workplace. Their proposals will allow exploitation; they are fundamentally unfair. Members of the Opposition have not even worked out the details in the same way as they do not seem to have worked out the details of their tax or any other policy. Their proposals, in so far as they can be discerned, involve destroying an amazingly effective system in a complex and fragile situation which could lead to breakdown, disorder and chaos. Australia is far better to stick with what it knows. It is far better to rely on the workable than to be tempted by an illusion. The House and all Australians should wholeheartedly reject the Opposition's confused and misguided proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 contains about 20 pages of amendments to several Acts of the Parliament for which the Attorney-General is responsible. I think it is fair to say that most of the proposed amendments require no comment at all. Some of them are machinery provisions. Other provisions are of more substance and yet, despite that, are not contentious. I would simply draw attention to a few matters that fall under four headings because they seem to deserve particular attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first relates to what might be described as telephone offences. We find in the Bill that two new offences will be created. We support this proposal. The two new offences that will be created will be, first of all, offences relating to the unauthorised call switching devices that are used apparently by illegal bookmakers. I am not familiar with their use of such devices, but I am informed of it and the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has given us the factual basis for this change to the law. I am prepared to accept that what he says is true. Apparently, unauthorised call switching devices are in use. They are used by illegal bookmakers and others to divert telephone calls in the course of conducting their businesses-if that is the appropriate word-the object of that exercise being to prevent detection. It is appropriate that the use of such devices be an offence. Therefore, we support the Government's proposal to make it an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The second offence being created under this heading is with respect to the actual equipment by means of which illegal telephone interceptions are effected. The change to the law will in effect outlaw the actual equipment itself. We regard those as being two changes to the law which, I am sure, will contribute to the law enforcement and law detection process. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area relates to telephone interceptions. The Bill will allow designated technical officers to give technical assistance when telephone interceptions are being carried out. The second reading speech refers to the people concerned as `civilian technicians'. The Bill itself uses some other expression. Because of the use of the other expression-`a designated technical officer'-it would seem to be the objective that the officers will not be police officers themselves, but rather civilians who provide the support staff for the Australian Federal Police. The proposal is to allow these designated technical officers employed by the Australian Federal Police to give technical assistance when telephone interceptions are being carried out. There are only two things to say about that. The first is that we would support the proposed change to the law on the basis that there is a need for those persons to assist the police in the course of conducting their lawful telephone interception activities. One can understand why this technical assistance is needed and it is appropriate that the law should provide for it. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe, however, that the clause is too wide. As I have said, undoubtedly there is a need for particular persons to be authorised to carry out this activity, but the Bill goes further than that. The Bill allows classes of persons to be designated technical officers for the purpose of this new provision. We believe that it is too wide. It is one thing to give this authority to individuals; it is another thing entirely to give a broad general authority to classes of persons. I presume the classes would be described by reference to their grading, their grouping or their category of employment. We would not be designating who they are. We believe that that goes too far. It should be remembered in considering this issue that they are given quite extensive powers. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at clause 44 (5) one finds that when authorised these people will be able, amongst other things, to engage in the following activities: first of all, the installation of equipment which is going to be used to intercept telephone calls. So they are going to be able to install the equipment itself. Secondly, and most importantly, they are going to be able to use it. They will be engaged in the maintenance, testing or use of the equipment. So, in fact, they are going to be using telephone interception equipment. No light burden is being put upon them; no light authority or power is being given to them. What we say is that if it is necessary to have such persons engage in this assistance-and we accept that it is-they should be designated by some more precise terms and not by terms which are as wide as those used in the Bill, namely, classes of persons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How would you define them?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be proposing an amendment and in the course of discussing the amendment I will answer the honourable member for McEwen's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third matter I wish to raise relates to the Privacy Act which honourable members will recall we passed last year. The purpose of the amendment that the Government is proposing is to have officers of the Ombudsman around Australia authorised to receive and handle privacy complaints on behalf of the Privacy Commissioner. One may wonder why that is necessary. We are given the answer to that by the Bill and by the Attorney-General's second reading speech, the answer being that it will enable the Privacy Commissioner to have an Australia-wide presence. I understand from a letter I have received from the Attorney-General that the Government will be moving an amendment to tighten this up and I can see that the proposed amendment is an improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect, I think there are still some difficulties. The proposed amendment to the Bill which will limit this power to those who have received an express delegation from the Privacy Commissioner may go part way towards resolving the problems. But it may be that in the course of the debate here today some of the potential problems in the use of this new procedure will be further elaborated on. However, at this stage we can simply make the point that the purpose is apparently to provide a sort of shopfront presence for the Privacy Commissioner throughout the whole of Australia. One can do that by two means: one can set up an office in each capital city and presumably each provincial city so that everyone can get to the Privacy Commissioner; or, alternatively, one can take some path such as the path proposed by the Government, namely, to allow the officers of the Ombudsman to receive on behalf of the Privacy Commissioner complaints under the Privacy Act and to handle them. It may be that when the Attorney-General is proposing his amendment he will tell us a little more about how this is going to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth and final area to which I wish to draw attention is an amendment to the Evidence Act relating to evidence which is prejudicial to security. That Act allows evidence taken-I am abbreviating the system here, of course-in Australian courts to be used in proceedings in foreign courts. Here again, it is proposed to make an amendment. In this case the amendment will propose that the Attorney-General may make an order prohibiting the production of documents or the giving of evidence or information if that evidence would prejudice Australia's security. It is proposed, therefore, that if evidence is going to be given which would prejudice Australia's security, the Attorney-General may make an order prohibiting the giving of that evidence or the production of those documents, presumably in accordance with the principle that the national security overrides all. We would support that principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill goes on to tell us that the Federal Court of Australia may enforce compliance with the order. It may be that some would argue that the Court itself should make the order and not just enforce it, which is what the Bill does. However, we would support the amendment as it stands because, as I have already indicated, matters of national security really should be left to the Government to determine. It is up to the Government to make right decisions on these matters. Of course, there is a price to pay if the Government does not make the right decisions, which on occasions it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I think it is worthwhile referring in passing to the new Independent Commission Against Corruption which gets a mention in this Bill. That body is joining the league of approved bodies on whose behalf telephone interceptions may be conducted. The Bill will allow this New South Wales body to be one such body. It is a body to which intercepted information may be communicated. As with all other similar bodies set up in the fight against corruption and major crime, we trust that giving this not inconsiderable power and right to the new Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales will result in some achievements being realised. We want some results. We are giving a considerable power to this body and one hopes that one will see the results from the use of this and its other very extensive powers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) that the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales is indeed achieving results. One may recall, of course, that the Greiner Liberal Government set up that body to trap the Labor Party. It was going to be one of those wonderful political arms of liberalism, of conservatism, to be used as a political weapon against its opponent, the Labor Party. Indeed, what has been the result? We are getting the National Party-Mr Murray and his cronies. We are seeing an extension of what occurred in Queensland flowing down into New South Wales. So I would say without question that the Independent Commission in New South Wales is a magnificent body and I support what it is doing. I suspect that not too far down the track more National Party members will get caught in the trap. This is one of those wonderful weapons that politicians sometimes come up with, that they think will be a wonderful thing for themselves and which turns around and bites them on the ankle. I hope that many more conservatives in New South Wales get bitten on the ankle by this beast. I am pleased in fact that the Opposition does not object to the extension of powers to the Independent Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say, Mr Deputy Speaker, with due respect to the honourable member for Menzies, whom I would not put in this individual category, that in general terms the conservatives in this place are, of course, soft on crime. They are the people who historically have been absolutely supportive of the sorts of corruption which, when we took office, had become endemic in this country. One only has to go back to the 1980s, only a couple of years ago, when a man who was called, from memory, Johannes Bjelke-Petersen had been the Premier of Queensland for a number of years. I recall that when we raised matters in this House that dared suggest that Johannes Bjelke-Petersen was anything but a fine, upright, moral man we were greeted with hoots of derision from the conservatives opposite. In fact, any suggestion by members of this House that corruption was rampant in the northern State under conservative rule was treated most violently. Indeed, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the famous head kicker of the House, was one of those who did more violent gyrations in this place when there were attacks on the honourable gentleman from the north. We all know what is the Bible of conservative government in this country. It has been printed; it is a large book. This copy has a red cover. Of course, the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct-the Fitzgerald report-is now the ultimate Bible of conservative government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we know that probably the same thing will flow from New South Wales-that bribery and corruption follow when those who see power as a means to an end do get government and do control office. The suggestions coming from New South Wales are that Mr Murray and his cohorts are more than anxious to assist their friends in development. The evidence coming out of New South Wales is similar to that from Queensland under the conservatives there. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, crime knows no boundaries and regrettably from my point of view-I have made this comment before-I thought the Fitzgerald inquiry frankly failed in its ambit. It did not, unfortunately, cover organised crime. It did not reveal and trace the movements of crime from Queensland into New South Wales. Organised crime, as I said, knows no boundaries. The inquiry did not pursue it and did not chase the money trail into the drug rackets of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> When I listened to and read the evidence of some of the people who appeared before Fitzgerald, all suggesting that their ill-gotten gains came from simple governmental corruption or prostitution-and they all ran a million miles away from any suggestion of drugs-my hair prickled, quite frankly, because I do not believe it. We tend to forget the Costigan inquiry. We tend to forget that that royal commission pointed at Queensland as being the home of drug money. Noosa was identified by Costigan as being the place where the ill-gotten gains of the major drug dealers ended up going mostly. There was not a mention of that in the Fitzgerald inquiry. I was invited on several programs as Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority to make comments on Fitzgerald. But when I gave those viewpoints to the people from the various channels before going on the program, they all ran away from them. They did not want such comments at that time about Fitzgerald. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I found sad about the Fitzgerald inquiry was that people were not named. What is the use of having a royal commission with privilege unless you point the bone? And the bone was not pointed by Fitzgerald clearly enough, often enough and obviously enough. In fact, it was the only royal commission in Australia that we can think of where the royal commissioner concerned did not point the bone. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing I was disappointed with and which I believe is worth criticising is that we know where corruption comes from in Queensland. It comes from the Cabinet, from within the Cabinet, from around the Cabinet and Sir Robert Sparkes. </PARA>

I think it is important that when we talk about law and justice at the Federal level we take note of what occurs in State parliaments and of matters of corruption. The fact that members of the Opposition do not want to debate these matters in this House proves again their softness, their lack of care. Who introduced the Proceeds of Crime Bill, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Bill, the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill? Which has been the most aggressive parliament in Australia's history in regard to its attack on organised crime? Who established the National Crime Authority? Who has opposed many of the measures that we have introduced? It is the conservatives. When we get around to company law, trying to bring to justice for their misdeeds some company directors, it is the conservatives who oppose the necessary regulations and controls. When we try to get a national law on companies, who opposes it? It is the conservatives. They are the soft people on crime. They are soft on regulation to prevent the misuse of power by government, by companies and in criminal areas. When we introduce these measures they oppose them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality that Mr Fitzgerald discloses so clearly is that, by themselves, convention and tradition do not prevent the creation of the hydra-headed monster of organised crime and corruption. The prevention of organised crime requires the sort of people who cannot be bought. It requires the sort of people who believe that morality and ethics stand above pocket. It requires political parties that believe that morality and ethics in politics stand above campaign funds. One thing Fitzgerald clearly demonstrated was that one can buy a political party lock, stock and barrel, and it can be headed by Sir Robert Sparkes who can manipulate a political system from outside a parliament. It can be bought by delivering brown paper packages full of cash to the office of a Premier of a State which then goes somewhere into a company called Kaldeal. It can be manipulated by political favours, by making money payments to a Premier. Australians have not yet woken up to the monster that is in Queensland. I do not think Australians are quite clear about just how corruption can extend right through a system, from police to education to unions--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no problem about that. The honourable member can talk to me about Victoria any time he likes and I will tell him what we did about organised crime down there. We cleaned it right out. I again come back to the matters raised by Mr Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald says in his report that he has only scratched the surface of Queensland. He says that he did not have time to get into the depth of corruption in Queensland. Yet the people who presided over this still have their hands in the bickie tin; they still have the capacity to appoint the people to make the inquiries for them under terms of reference which they, the people with their hands in the bickie tin, dictate. That is the fault of Fitzgerald; that is the wrongness of the Fitzgerald report. The people who are responsible are still in a position to dictate the terms of any reference, to appoint the people, and in fact to do nothing about the real problems in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies quite properly pointed out that this is an omnibus Bill; and it does cover many aspects. As I said earlier, one thing that it again clearly shows to Australians is that this Government is determined to do all in its power to attack crime and to do all in its power to ensure that the machinery of government, the machinery of police, and the machinery of justice are geared up to operate, wherever possible, to strike down organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in the past, and I say again, that I have some concerns about telephone communications interception. It is, as the honourable member for Menzies said, a powerful weapon that impedes the individual rights of people. When the honourable member spoke he drew my attention to clause 44, and I must confess that I then read the Bill, because I respect the views of the honourable gentleman. Now that I have had a good look at it-and I have not yet heard the terms of the amendment-I am not sure whether he has got it right. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to be a designated technical officer under clause 44 or under section 55 of the principal Act, the person must be a member of the staff referred to in section 16 of the Australian Federal Police Act. A person can become a designated officer only with the approval in writing of the Commissioner of Police. There are two things there: firstly, the person must be a member of staff referred to in section 16 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and, secondly, he or she must be approved in writing by a commissioner of police to be a person of the class who can be a designated technical officer. Is the honourable member suggesting that that creates a wide class of person or a class of person who may not be subjected to control, who may not be subjected to control of a police commissioner, who may not be subjected to secrecy, or who may not be subjected to discipline? I did not hear him make those suggestions, but frankly I have not yet heard an argument as to why that particular section needs an amendment. I asked, by way of interjection: `How would you describe them?'. The honourable member suggested that in his amendment he would, in fact, give some detail of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will listen with interest because, as I said, I do respect the honourable gentleman's views. For many years he was my Federal member of parliament-mind you, I voted consistently against him; nevertheless, he kept winning-and he is a man I respect and a man of principle. I tell the honourable gentleman that I will listen with interest, but to date he has not convinced me, quite frankly, by the speech he made and has given me no reason why I should change my mind or any reason why his amendment should even be put up. I await with interest the honourable gentleman's amendment and further debate on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We could be forgiven for being amused by the reference of the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) to events in Queensland, particularly the creation of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct and its aftermath. I repeat for the honourable member for McEwen, because he seems to be hard of hearing, that we could be forgiven for being amused by his remarks. He referred disparagingly to the fact that the Government up there may set terms of reference and thereby control any future inquiry that may or may not be required. What he failed to do was give credit to Premier Ahern for, firstly, creating the Fitzgerald inquiry and, secondly, giving the inquirer the necessary resources to do the job and expose to the view of the public those matters which appear to be so wrong in the State of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the honourable gentleman were sincere in his expressed concern, I would have expected him to say that probably we could be doing similar things in the States of Western Australia and Victoria, where maybe there is not the type of corruption to which he has referred in Queensland, which was examined by Fitzgerald, but where a form of corruption in the conduct and process of government is taking place and has occurred without parallel and on a massive scale not experienced in this country before. There is more than one form of corruption. I notice that in his usual involved fashion the honourable member for McEwen is not in his seat and probably is not listening. If he were sincere he would like to see that process extended to not only New South Wales, as the Premier, Mr Greiner, has done, but also those States where there is more than casual evidence of a corruption of the process of government which warrants a thorough inquiry under terms of reference at least as generous as those that Premier Ahern gave to Fitzgerald. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in this omnibus Bill is a proposal to amend the Privacy Act 1988. Given the Government's record with inaccurately drafted or thought through legislation, it comes as no great surprise that a fundamental change is now required to legislation passed as recently as last year. That law established the office of Privacy Commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) effective from January 1989. It now seems that the Government deems it necessary for the staff of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to be the delegates of the Privacy Commissioner in certain circumstances. Complaints to the Privacy Commissioner are intended to be referable to the Ombudsman's staff. So too will it be possible to get the assistance of the Ombudsman's staff to assist a person formulating a complaint about an act or practice which could be an infringement of an individual's privacy and in breach of the principal Act. Although it is a stated intention that delegation may be authorised in those parts of Australia where there is no office of the HREOC, it appears that there will be nothing to prevent the Privacy Commissioner delegating, regardless of the existence of an office of the HREOC. That may not be all that objectionable, but it is, if not unintended, an unstated consequence of what is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments go further than I have so far indicated in at least one important respect. Section 99 of the principal Act is to be changed. Before amendment, as it presently stands, section 99 enables the Commissioner to delegate to a member of the HREOC any powers given under the Act with one exception of prime importance. The amendment now intended will expose the Ombudsman's staff to the same delegated duties as already attach to the staff of the HREOC. In practical terms, all this means is that the Privacy Commissioner may in future draw on the resources of both the HREOC and the Ombudsman, whereas at the moment that access to staff is limited to the HREOC. The proposed changes beg the question: Does the Privacy Commissioner have, or have the prospect of getting, sufficient resources to do his important work? It would seem not. If not, can the Government be said to have a commitment to the office it created by legislation only last year? Again, it would seem not. Remember if you will, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Government was brought screaming, as it were, to the point where it had to legislate to protect the privacy of individuals following the revelation of some notorious examples of abuses by both government agencies and others. Such protection was also a precondition demanded by the coalition before acceptance of the then proposed tax file numbers legislation. In fact, it is probably fair to say that tax file number legislation would not have been passed by the Parliament if concurrent privacy laws-those privacy laws embodied in the principal Act-were not also in place. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me back to my earlier reference to the amendment proposed to section 99 in the principal Act, the Privacy Act 1988. I have already pointed out that there was one exception to the catch-all delegation proposal. That exception stipulated exclusion, and continues to exclude, the possibility of delegation to anyone of the duties of the Privacy Commissioner concerning either the issue of the tax file number guidelines or determinations under section 52 of the principal Act. My colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) will be pleased to know that. He will be pleased because he has an outstanding reference before the Privacy Commissioner. Interestingly, he referred the same matter to the Ombudsman, the same officeholder whose staff may in future be coopted to help the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter referred to the Privacy Commissioner by the honourable member for Moreton concerned the very questionable activities of the Statistician and his conduct of the notorious household expenditure survey. That very recent experience raises some interesting possibilities if these amendments are passed. Whereas it has been possible to refer to each of the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner the same matter, albeit with different emphasis and even objectives, that might be practical in future. Think of the possibilities. With the passage of these amendments we could see a classic case of conflict of interest between the personnel of the office of the Ombudsman and those of the Privacy Commissioner. There appears to be nothing in the Act as it is to be amended which will prevent the Privacy Commissioner delegating to staff of the Ombudsman a responsibility to act in a matter referred to each. In such a case, can the same staff be involved without compromising the intentions and provisions of separate legislation, or will reference to one preclude the same matter being referred to the other despite reasons being different? Only one thing is certain: the explanations given for these amendments do not provide the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Given a working relationship to be established between the offices of the Privacy Commissioner and the Ombudsman, one could abandon for all time any hope that reference to one about conduct or a possible breach by the other would be worth while. Future allegations to the Ombudsman about a breach of duty by the Privacy Commissioner's staff would not be seen-I emphasise the word `seen'-to afford the prospect of justice because there is an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest. It might even transpire in some cases that a particular reference to the Ombudsman against the Commissioner could be similar to or the same as one the Commissioner has already delegated to the Ombudsman. Then again, the converse could arise. There could be a claim that the Ombudsman has breached the Privacy Act. These are very real possibilities. It is not going too far to speculate that such scenarios are inevitable given this Government's unparalleled record for intrusion into the everday affairs of individuals. It is bad enough that the office of the Privacy Commissioner is a mere appendage to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That fact begs the question as to how he will handle an allegation of a breach of the Privacy Act against the HREOC. Having handled one, will his involvement be objective? Will any ensuing findings be seen to be those of an independent arbiter? I doubt it. Who would not doubt it?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at another possibility that can arise under the principal Act as it now stands. Section 36 provides that an individual may complain to the Privacy Commissioner about an act or practice that may be an interference with his or her privacy and that staff of the HREOC are required to assist that person in formulating the complaint. What is to happen if that complaint is against the HREOC? There is plenty of scope in the work of the HREOC for one to arise. Is it to prepare the case against itself? Remembering that the Privacy Commissioner and his office are an integral part of the HREOC, will he launch himself into the fray without fear or favour? Even if he does with complete conviction, objectivity and abandon, will any outcome or findings not favourable to the complainant be taken seriously? The questions answer themselves. It is equally obvious that both the offices of the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner will be diminished by this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> A further aspect should be canvassed. It is also about the Privacy Commissioner's proposed ability to delegate his responsibilities to the Commonwealth Ombudsman in centres where there is no office of the HREOC. To be able to do so effectively either there has to be an excess of capacity in the particular office of the Ombudsman or that office will need additional staff to cope with the extra work. If there is an excess of capacity now, surely staff in that Ombudsman's office should have been reduced. If present capacity in an affected office of the Ombudsman does not exceed the demands being made of it now, additional staff will be needed in that office to do the bidding of the Privacy Commissioner. That being the case, why not simply attach any extra staff needed to the Commissioner's office? That surely is the sensible and straightforward thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as might conceivably be the case, infrequent or irregular references are anticipated and deemed justification for a part-timer to be supplied by the Ombudsman, a more sensible arrangement would involve the Commissioner's staff travelling, as required, to deal with claims. It would be cheaper; it would preserve the integrity and independence of and distance between the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner. Of course, it would not avoid the likelihood of a future conflict of interest between the Privacy Commissioner and the HREOC. The more one thinks about it, the more illogical is the location of the office of the Privacy Commissioner within and subordinate to the HREOC. It could be worse, I suppose: the Privacy Commissioner could be part of the Australian Taxation Office and answerable to the Commissioner. Heaven forbid! It should not even be joked about because this Government might just do that. After all, it was the coalition that insisted on the safeguards in the principal Act as a condition of its grudging toleration of the tax file number legislation. The Government had to be dragged to the post, as it were. That is not news, of course. It is not surprising either, because this Government, in a whole host of proposals, ranging from a Bill of rights-accurately described at the time as a Bill of wrongs-to failed or abandoned referendums, has shown scant regard for the freedoms of individuals. It is little wonder that the quality of thought in amendments it now proposes to the Privacy Act 1988 is poor and inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great potential, and almost an inevitability, that, under the principal Act as it now stands, a conflict of interest will arise at some time in the future between the HREOC and the Privacy Commissioner. These amendments set the stage for a new conflict of interest-a conflict of interest between the Privacy Commissioner and the Ombudsman. I repeat that, if the Ombudsman has excess capacity in his officers to be able to meet these requirements, those staff should be redeployed elsewhere. If he does not, and new staff are needed, those new people should be attached to the office of the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as I have indicated, an infrequent or part time need can be established, that can be handled by the Privacy Commissioner sending his troops out into the field to the point where they have to deal with, prepare, consider, or otherwise manage a particular complaint. We need to divorce now the Privacy Commissioner from the HREOC. We also need, I suggest-and these amendments will have the opposite effect-to keep separate from the office of the Ombudsman the activities of the Privacy Commissioner. If that is all too much to ask, we should at least wait for some evidence of demand for these arrangements for the need to delegate in the absence of any information which would suggest that there is an established need. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one has convinced us that the Minister's second reading speech, the explanatory memoranda or, indeed, the Bill of amendment itself establishes a need to make this provision. Surely it would be better to put the Privacy Commissioner on a truly independent footing by divorcing any relationship between his office and that of the HREOC, in the first place, and by putting these amendments on the backburner, at least for the time being. There is no demonstrated need for these measures, certainly in the information that has been provided to us in the Opposition. I would very seriously suggest that the matter be allowed to lapse, as far as it offends against the principles to which I have referred in my remarks, until there is better evidence of a particular need along the lines now proposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am informed that the instruction referred to by the honourable member is an internal working document, copied to certain ex-service organisations as a courtesy. As such, it is not something I would be asked to approve. It advises departmental officers of amendments to legislation passed during the autumn sittings. Paragraph 5, to which the honourable member refers, is consistent with the amendments passed by the Parliament on 15 June 1989. Paragraph 4 clearly indicates that the amendment is to take effect from 1 January 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I stated in the debate on that Bill in the House on 11 May 1989, the inclusion of this amendment was merely to reinforce the original intention of the legislation and thus ensure that British Commonwealth veterans are eligible for service pensions on no more generous standards than those applicable to veterans of the Australian Defence Force. The effect of postponing the date of this amendment does not in any way change the intent. As the departmental instruction states, no-one who is currently entitled to receive a service pension will lose that entitlement as a result of the campaign medals amendment. There is no intention to withdraw the departmental instruction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is now debating amendments to the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill. It is an omnibus Bill covering a number of pieces of legislation under the control of the Attorney-General. Before going on to the specific provisions, I might just canvass some of the matters which have been raised in the debate by the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). Firstly, this Bill's most substantive provisions relate to changes as far as the interception of telecommunications is concerned. This was the case both in creating some new offences under the Commonwealth Crimes Act concerning the manufacture, offering for sale and advertising for sale of call-switching devices and telephone interception devices and in adding the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption as one of those bodies which can have access to telephone interceptions when the need arises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In doing this the Government is touching on two things. It is ensuring that telephone interceptions are used in a very limited way and that devices which can be used for this purpose are not freely available to the general public and to those who possibly have criminal intent or intent to invade privacy: so it is ensuring the rights of the individual on the one hand. But on the other hand is trying to tackle that delicate balance of extending the necessary powers to authorities and commissions charged with the responsibility of inquiring into crime in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as the honourable member for McEwen pointed out, in Queensland the Fitzgerald inquiry and now the Fitzgerald report detailed probably the most extensive system of criminal involvement and interplay with the political system certainly in this nation's history and one would imagine on an extent almost unsurpassed in the Western democracies. It certainly is frightening to think how far that corruption and malpractice could extend. That is why it is very necessary that this Parliament and the various parliaments of the Australian States have to put into place powers and responsibilities, and this seems to have an immediate effect as far as--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Humphreys" NAMEID="FH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FH4">Mr Humphreys</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are turning the lights off.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. But it is very important that those powers be put into place because what we saw in Queensland was a government which simply refused to open its eyes to the existence of a problem. The most charitable interpretation which was always put on this refusal over the years by those who wished to defend the National Party in that State was that Queensland simply was immune from these sorts of things. Because Queensland was being run by good Christian gentlemen then corruption, double-dealing, prostitution, drug dealing and illicit gambling simply would not occur there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course any suggestion of putting checks and balances into the parliamentary system such as a public accounts committee or various other mechanisms of parliamentary scrutiny was frowned upon. The idea of having pecuniary interest registers or anything of that nature was completely rejected. Any suggestions to give the police adequate powers for the actual operation of the police force were objected to not only by the police themselves-quite obviously, as events have turned out, that sort of lead was coming from the top-but also by the political system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is still amazing to see some members of the Opposition, such as the honourable member for Curtin, trying to defend the indefensible. There is no defence for what has happened in Queensland in a system perpetrated by the Queensland Government. That cannot be defended. Even the most cursory reading of the Fitzgerald report-and one really would have to be on another planet not to have got some sort of feeling as to what was happening in Queensland-must lead one to the conclusion that the Queensland Government presided over a systematic extension of corruption throughout that State. That simply has no parallel in any of the other Australian States. Honourable members opposite might try to throw mud and say that these things exist elsewhere. But they do not exist under a corrupt electoral system and under a parliamentary system which has been neutered. That is the peculiar and unique situation which is Queensland. By all means give credit to the current Government-the Ahern Government-for allowing the committee to proceed, but do not be fooled by it. Consider its record in terms of implementing Fitzgerald's recommendations and its very poor record of making the immediate changes suggested by Fitzgerald. Then one will come to see the reality of that Government's commitment to changing the system which led to corruption flourishing in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point to which the honourable member for Curtin took particular umbrage was the idea that the Privacy Commission was going to be linked with the Office of Parliamentary Commissioner. He maintained that inevitably this would lead to conflict between the two offices. I find that to be a legitimate argument in principle but in practice clearly the Office of Ombudsman and that of the Privacy Commission have a lot in common. Both are charged with the responsibility of inquiring into the conduct of government and government departments. Certainly, given the economies the Government must impose-supported by the Opposition, one would assume; indeed, if one believed the Opposition's rhetoric they would be vastly extended by the Opposition-it is hardly consistent to say, `We think extra resources should be given to the Privacy Commission and the Commission should not be linked with the Ombudsman', and to say in the same breath, `If we ever got into government we would abolish the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, anyway. We would get rid of all the safeguards and commissions which the Government has set up'. It is a slightly inconsistent argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the honourable member for Curtin well if he is seriously arguing that the Privacy Commissioner should be given more resources and if that is going to be the policy of his party at the next election, but let us at least give it some time to see whether there are any problems with what this Bill is proposing. To me, it makes common sense that the general public should have access to the Privacy Commission. Since the Ombudsman's Office and resources are already available, to link the two, at least in the initial stages, is a very commonsense move on behalf of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The rest of the legislation is largely non-controversial. As I have mentioned, one of the more important provisions is the creation of two new offences under the Commonwealth Crimes Act regarding switching devices and telephone interception devices. Both of these devices will be prohibited, both in terms of manufacture and sale and offering for sale. That should effectively be another link in the armour of protecting individual privacy and ensuring that unlawful use of telecommunications interception is not widely experienced throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One point the Caucus legal and administrative committee had some difficulty with was the question of the level of imputed knowledge about these offences. I am pleased to see that it was resolved. I pay tribute in that respect to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who forcibly argued that what the Government meant by imputed knowledge should be clearly set out. That is the case with the Bill now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been further amendments in the telecommunications field, in particular amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act of 1979. The first allows civilian technicians to assist the Australian Federal Police in interceptions where that assistance is required, although caution must always be exercised in regard to the range of people who could have access to potentially sensitive information. It obviously makes sense that, in cases where specialised and technical assistance is required, that assistance is available to the Australian Federal Police. I do not believe the sorts of concerns that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) outlined will arise, given both the safeguards that are built into this Bill and also the wider controls over access to information gained in interceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I also pointed out, a couple more exemptions have been added to the list where intercepted material can be given in evidence. One allows Telecom Australia to put forward evidence of an amount of a telephone bill obtained by way of technical interception. That obviously makes a bit of sense in proving how much a telephone bill is. The other one is pursuant to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act where Australia, in terms of its international relations with other countries, can allow certain evidence to be put before a magistrate in proceedings involving criminal matters in foreign countries. Again, the same sorts of controls over that are built into this legislation and the broader legislation which covers the giving of such evidence. I do not believe that should be of any great concern to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> A final matter which I would like to touch on is the extension of reference appeals to the Federal Court of Australia. This is a sensible extension inasmuch as it does not in any way jeopardise the position of the accused person who was found not guilty at a trial. It does allow a particular point of law to be determined. There are safeguards built in so that the identity of the individual who was acquitted shall not be disclosed through the process of this appeal. It does allow the law on a particular point to be clarified and that makes good sense. </PARA>
<PARA> On the whole the legislation is simply an extension of the Government's control and concern in the area of telephone intercepts and touches on other broad areas under the Attorney-General's control, none of which are particularly controversial, and as such I believe the legislation should have the support of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Other than the one amendment the Opposition will be proposing, we on this side of the House foresee no great problems with the Bill as it will further assist the efforts of various government agencies in dealing with crime, particularly organised crime, in a more expeditious manner. The one obvious criticism, of course, is that a number of the matters addressed in this Bill should have been dealt with long ago. This Bill contains numerous amendments of a policy nature and also makes minor technical amendments to legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the time available to me I intend to address only what I consider to be some of the more pertinent issues. Part 3 of the Bill which deals with the amendment to the Crimes Act 1914 is certainly welcome. In essence, the clause proscribes unauthorised call-switching devices and unauthorised interception devices. As the Attorney-General mentioned in his second reading speech, call-switching devices are used to defeat attempts to trace telephone calls. It is a fact that use of unauthorised call switching devices has already been detected by people involved in the commission of betting offences. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that illegal bookmaking is a major problem in this country and further given that organised crime long ago realised the profits to be made in illegal bookmaking, the Government has been very slow in moving to legislate against their use. Simply speaking, when people turn their minds to it, these unauthorised call switching devices could and indeed may have much wider benefits for those involved in organised crime. The usefulness of such unauthorised devices-devices that frustrate the efforts of law enforcement agencies-is really restricted only by the imagination of the criminal involved. A sad fact, however, is that this Government has quite demonstrably been very slow to act against organised crime generally, yet there are now clear indications that organised crime is not only becoming more technologically sophisticated but also growing, despite the efforts of specialist agencies such as the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the best example of the growth of organised crime in recent times has been the huge influx of the Chinese triads into this country. In a few short years the triads have come to dominate the heroin trade into and within Australia. Coupled with this fact has been the exploitation by the triads of the very loosely policed business migration program run by the Government's Department of Immigration, Local Government, and Ethnic Affairs. In fact, abuse of Australia's migration system as a whole is now so endemic that members not only of the Chinese triads but also of the Japanese Yakusa are able to come and go at will and unhindered. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 of the Bill also addresses a strange anomaly within the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 which prohibits the unauthorised interception of telecommunications but does not prohibit the actual devices by which unauthorised interception may be made. The amendment to the Crimes Act 1914 which this Bill will effect will henceforth make it an offence to manufacture, advertise, offer for sale, sell or possess a device by which a telecommunications interception may be effected. As the Attorney-General would be well aware, there have been numerous occasions when Telecom technicians have found unauthorised telecommunications interception devices, particularly inside the junction pillars that Telecom Australia has located on various street corners around this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, this tightening up of existing legislation could perhaps have been done at a much earlier stage. I am given to understand that such devices are still available at many electronics shops and I would hope that all such retail outlets still selling these items will be notified, if they have not been already, of these changes to the law. Additionally, I would hope that the Government will take into account the possibility that many of the thousands of electronics buffs around Australia may have some of these devices tucked away in their workshops, not because they harbour a desire to intercept someone's telephone calls but simply because, like all buffs of a particular subject matter, they squirrel away anything that has a bearing on their subject of interest. It would be a travesty if one or more of these enthusiasts were to end up facing criminal proceedings because they were not aware that the law had been changed and that possession of such a device had-once this Bill is passed-become an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to part 8 of the Bill-the amendment of the Customs Act 1901. This amendment obviously reflects some concern that a possible interpretation by the courts of `premises' may be challenged in relation to the situation of listening devices if it has not already been. Certainly as far as interpretation of the law is concerned, this amendment, in that it more clearly defines what a premise is as regards the law, will tighten up any loophole that may provide a legal avenue of escape for an alleged offender. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Part 11 of the Bill, the amendments of the Privacy Act 1988. Whilst I applaud the apparent cost-effectiveness of the amendments and the more convenient access they will provide to individuals wishing to approach the Privacy Commissioner, I ask the Attorney-General whether he can tell the House what effect this will have on the workload of the various Ombudsman's offices around Australia. If the impact will be sufficient to detract from the Ombudsman's own existing workload, this will weaken the Ombudsman's effectiveness, which will in turn be detrimental to the overall public interest. In that particular respect I share the concerns already expressed in this debate by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). Notwithstanding the particular reservations about this legislation which I have addressed and, of course, foreshadowing support for the amendment which will be moved ultimately by our own shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies, the Opposition on balance supports the Bill the Government has brought before the House today. In my view there has been unwarranted procrastination in dealing with a variety of matters covered by the Government's legislation, but it is overall a responsible Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was and let me observe now that at that time probably the most private thing about the Privacy Commissioner was where he was. The trouble was finding him, because there had been very little publicity in relation to the establishment of the office. Eventually we did find it as a part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin made reference to the household expenditure survey which ran from 1988-89. He raised concerns about any complaint being lodged with the Ombudsman and investigated by the Ombudsman in relation to the Privacy Commission perhaps creating some form of later conflict. The Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) will remember the household survey quite well. The records indicate that he, very wisely, expressed the view at the time that it should be tabled in the Parliament. That aspect is stated in the Ombudsman's report and I appreciate the fact that he actually supported the view that I held at the time, despite the protestations which, strangely, continue from the Australian Statistician. I believe he is still writing to some of the lawyers that advised us asking for them to recant and to change their original opinion. It is quite incredible. The man will not leave the bone alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to my use of the instrumentalities which exist, namely the Ombudsman's Office and the Human Rights Commission, I want to state that last year I had cause and reason to lodge my complaints with both instrumentalities. They were lodged with both the Human Rights Commission and the Ombudsman. Now I personally have absolutely no argument with the Human Rights Commission's various State offices being recipients and even investigators of complaints that might be lodged before the Privacy Commissioner. But I do object most strongly to the independence of the Ombudsman being eroded by virtue of his being another agency whereby a person could lodge a complaint. I do not mind the Ombudsman receiving a complaint if he has offices all around Australia. I have no argument with his being a receiver. But I do have grave concerns about his being an investigator, because there could well be occasions when one might wish to challenge an opinion expressed by the Privacy Commission or Human Rights Commission or, alternatively, take up the same issue with the Ombudsman. I really do believe that the Attorney-General inadvertently, accidentally and innocently-nonetheless he is doing it-is compromising these two separate and entirely different agencies. They are venues for members of the public-and, indeed, in some circumstances members of the Parliament-to take cases to for some kind of guidance. </PARA>
<PARA> I well recognise that the Ombudsman's word is not necessarily the final word and that things can be pursued at a later time in the courts. But it is an accessible and convenient administrative framework within financial reach. It enables people to go to a government agency and say, for example, as I and many members of the public did, that the household expenditure survey was an illegal survey because it had not been tabled in the Parliament. That was the cause of a thorough investigation by the Ombudsman. It does not mean that I agree with all of his conclusions, and I am quite sure the Australian Statistician did not agree either. There was something nice in it for both of us, and there was something in it that neither of us really liked. But that is the way it goes in this world and one rolls with the punches and moves on to the next issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I just commend to the Attorney-General that very minor amendment to allow the Ombudsman's Office to be a recipient of complaints but not an investigator of complaints. If a complaint is received in Darwin or some place like that, surely it can be handled by a nearby Human Rights Commission office or go back to Sydney, where the Privacy Commissioner is in fact based. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister to consider the observations of both the honourable member for Curtin and myself. I notice that the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), probably regrets the fact that he overlooked this important aspect, and I am sure we have his total agreement in the approach we are taking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank all honourable members for their contributions. I want to make some brief comments about matters that seem to have monopolised the debate. How are we going to overcome the problem, which the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) quite intelligently did not raise, as to what will happen if somebody were to complain about the Privacy Commissioner to the Ombudsman? Of course, they can do that, and we would not want to inhibit that. There might also be a complaint about the Ombudsman to the Privacy Commissioner. There is the power to do that; we are talking about the rights of people. It cannot be said that there is a conflict of interest because they have an opportunity to investigate issues on behalf of people. If it is very obvious that the complaint is about themselves, they are not going to investigate it; it would be left to the Privacy Commissioner to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which I do not want to dwell on but which it is the Opposition's policy to abolish, does not have offices in all the States. It does not have offices in South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria, et cetera. So it has to rely, as it often does, on the State administrations to come into arrangements to investigate matters relating to the rights of people. It has never created any problem, nor will this create any problem. The reason for this is to give the people a chance to have matters, as it says, `prepared'. Honourable members will notice that the proposal is that they would get assistance in the preparation of their complaints and in the investigation of their complaints, but the determination would be made by the Privacy Commissioner. That has to be understood, and the honourable member for Menzies did understand it; that is why he did not raise it. That is the issue that has to be made clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies did raise a point that has got what one would call some kick in the case. He said, `What is the idea of bringing in here an amendment on telephone interception which would allow the police to be assisted by classes of persons?'. That is a reasonable question to ask, but then he proposed an amendment which I cannot accept, because he proposes to omit `classes of persons'. That definition is worrying him. It is important that, when we are dealing with interception, we have people who might have different skills. These people would be members of the Australian Federal Police, but they would not be police as such. They would have the technical capacity to assist in interception but they would be under the obligations and all the normal requirements of members of the Australian Federal Police. There is a reference in the Bill to section 16 of the Australian Federal Police Act. This is not a new matter. The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 contains the following amendment which was introduced in 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Police, or a member of the Australian Federal Police in relation to whom an appointment . . . is in force, may approve in writing members of the Australian Federal Police, or classes of members of the Australian Federal Police, to exercise the authority conferred by warrants or classes of warrants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they are not necessarily police officers. They are classes. The other people-about whom the honourable member makes the point-are also members of the Australian Federal Police. I cannot accept the amendment because they would be within the control of the Australian Federal Police; they would not be outside it. They would not be police as such. They would be technical officers, but employed by the police and they would be referred to as being in that class.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think honourable members generally welcome the amendments. There has been some criticism on matters of delay and things of that nature. I do not know that those criticisms are valid, but I am not going to argue against them. The issue of resources has again been raised in the privacy area. The Privacy Commissioner would make additional resources available to the Ombudsman if there were concern about that. The amendment that I wish to move later, and which I will address then, relates to the fact that clause 31 of the Bill proposes that the issue of giving assistance in terms of preparation and investigation of privacy complaints could be carried out by members of the staff of the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman himself said that that is a little bit too wide. My amendment proposes that this will apply only where there is a delegation by the Privacy Commissioner. This would confine such an activity and I think the amendment would make the Bill more effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to a couple of other minor matters. When reading my second reading speech back in May, I foreshadowed that there may have been a request from the Norfolk Island authorities who were concerned that section 11 of the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act would override a particular provision of the Legislative Assembly's Privileges Act of 1967. We have been subsequently advised by the administration of the Northern Territory that there would be no inconsistency between the two provisions and, accordingly, the Norfolk Island authorities have withdrawn their request. I am just advising the House of that. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an error in the second reading speech in respect of clause 25 which I am told related to a matter that the honourable member for Menzies properly raised. The second reading speech referred to the ability `to prohibit evidence being given in Australia for use in civil or criminal proceedings'. The reference to `civil or criminal proceedings' was in error and should have been to civil and commercial proceedings. I express my apologies to the House and I thank the honourable member of Menzies for bringing it to our attention. For the record, I should refer to one other matter. A correction in the explanatory memorandum, which has been tabled, relates to the various clauses that needed some technical amendment. The correction has been circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> This omnibus Bill produces some effective law reform. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) is worried about criminal penetration, as the whole world is. I would not want it to go unnoticed that we spend a lot of time and a lot of resources and, in fact, introduce a lot of new law in order to do something about combating criminal activity. I do not know that we are failing; I would not accept that. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that we need to be ever vigilant. We do require good law enforcement officers and we do require good intelligence. I think we have a lot of mechanisms in place that relate to that. We have the National Crime Authority, we have mutual assistance treaties which did not exist before, and we have extradition treaties which did not exist before. They now number 40. In fact, one of the busiest aspects of my Department at present is that dealing with extradition. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards at the international conventions on narcotics control, there is understanding that there has to be a lot of coordination between countries. Criminals travel fast and their money travels even faster. We have already got the confiscation of assets in and we are getting results because of that. Nevertheless, the issue will always require a continual effort, and I do not think we are going to be behind anybody else in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation we have in place is very effective indeed. But we do need the personnel to run those pieces of legislation. That relates to the National Crime Authority, it relates to all police forces and, without getting back into Queensland-which I think is not really the issue in front of us-the question is how to attract people to law enforcement agencies, and do they have other skills. At the present time I am encouraging the Australian Federal Police, through my colleague Senator Tate, to recruit on a contract basis people who have other skills and are able to look at the balance sheets and talk about where money moves. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the Crown's cash transaction position in place, and we are now getting good cooperation from the banks in the giving of information, though this matter is the subject of some minor amendments I have to introduce soon. This relates certainly to tax evasion but it is also very beneficial because it is clear that the sorts of people that the honourable member refers to deal basically in very substantial amounts of cash. I do not think the legislation is defective at all. The new head of the National Crime Authority is very talented and is very interested in the pursuit of criminal behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me pay a tribute to members of my own profession who give up their careers at the Bar to take on these positions for two or three years and then have to go back to the Bar, having lost most of their practice in the meantime. They suffer a pecuniary penalty by so doing. The honourable member for Menzies would know something of that. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 44, page 15, lines 14 and 15, omit ``, or classes of persons,''. </PARA>
<PARA>The substance of this amendment, as I have already explained, is to omit the words `or classes of persons' from the description of those designated technical officers who are going to assist members of the Australian Federal Police to carry out telephone interceptions. As I said in the second reading debate when I foreshadowed this amendment, the concern is that quite extensive powers are being given to the people who will assist the officers of the Australian Federal Police in carrying out this very significant activity, namely, telephone interceptions. As I have said, the people who will be giving the assistance are not just carrying the lunch box, they are in fact installing the equipment. They are undertaking a very significant task. Not only are they installing the equipment; they are maintaining it, testing it and using it. Presumably, that means they are listening in. They are also responsible for the removal of the equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention is that the Commissioner of Police declare people who are to be designated technical officers for the purpose of carrying out this function. It should be noted-this takes it one step further-that it is not just a case of the Commissioner of Police knowing the classes of persons who are going to be designated to carry out this function; it is the Commissioner of Police, or someone who has already been given approval to carry out that function of the Commissioner of Police. Therefore, it is already one step removed. As I said, the Commissioner of Police or a person who is an approving officer will have the power to declare these persons to be designated technical officers. We should be cautious when we get to that stage, and we should be doubly cautious, I believe, when it is not merely persons-that is, named and individual persons-who are going to be given this considerable power, but classes of persons. Presumably, there will not be hundreds or dozens of them. I imagine that comparatively few persons, albeit hard working, will be involved. If that is the case, can they not be identified by name?</PARA>

But if one declares a class, people will wander into and out of this function like a nomadic tribe because they will be part of a declared class. Correct me if I am wrong, but the class that will be designated will be a class such as all persons of a particular grading, or all persons of a particular rank, classification or technical grouping. It will involve all persons employed who come within that description. Their names will not be designated. That really seems to us to be too broad. Even if only for an excess of caution, it would seem appropriate to take out the words `or classes of persons'. It will not do any harm. It will not cause a heavy burden of additional work, because there must surely be comparatively few of these people who will be carrying out this function.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to help my opponent the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), but I am advised that his amendment really does not help us. The expression `classes of persons' certainly creates an issue as to whether there will be an unknown number. They certainly will not be named, but they will not be unknown. The clause states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commissioner of Police or a person who is an approving officer under subsection (3), may, in writing, declare persons, or classes of persons, to be designated technical officers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are very small in number, I understand. Proposed new subsection (5) states:</PARA>
<PARA>A reference in subsection (4) to the provision of technical assistance-</PARA>
<PARA>the emphasis is on the words `technical assistance'-</PARA>
<PARA>includes a reference to the doing of any act in connection with . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then refers to installation, maintenance and removal. I understand that these officers will not do the actual installation, maintenance or removal but will be giving the police advice as to what to do in this technical capacity because the police would not have the technical capacity. In other words, they would be supervising. That is why I am saying that these people are public servants-I had better get that bit right-in the police force, not actual police officers. I correct what I said earlier. The definition is compatible with the earlier definition in the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act-which has already been approved by the Parliament-where we see again that:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner of Police, or a member of the Australian Federal Police in relation to whom an appointment under subsection (3) is in force, may approve in writing members of the Australian Federal police, or classes of members of the Australian Federal Police . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable gentleman feels that there is some unknown group out there that nobody has any control over. I do not see any problem. They are a group designated by the Commissioner of Police. Bear in mind that the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Act states that the Commissioner of Police-not only the Commissioner himself-may appoint in writing a member of the Australian Federal Police to be an approving officer for the purpose of doing something in respect of authority under a warrant. This applies not only to the Commissioner but to a person under him. We have that chain of command. The Commissioner or somebody approved by him will authorise this group. They will certainly be technical officers, but the police themselves will be doing the actual installation. Whilst I can understand the honourable gentleman's view, I think there is an adequate safeguard there, rather than going to the point of our having to name these people, who will change from time to time in the normal course of employment. I do not think it creates any weakness in the adequate protection of the rights of individuals who feel that their particular privacy or other matters may be interfered with. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) as an old Postmaster-General-not Attorney-General-that the situation is very clear when one has technical complaints about one's phone. Technical officers put intercepts in to see how it works. They do it all the time through the exchange-not that I would want to make a long speech about it here. But there has always been a capacity, in a technical sense, to work out how a person's line may be malfunctioning. Basically it is that same skill that is going to be used to guarantee that the particular equipment that might be used in this situation functions properly. It is not a new matter from the point of view of technical assistance. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, in presenting last year's Budget I said that Australia was on the way to a systematic restructuring of its economy, making it more dynamic and more able to compete in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight, I can report that we are further down the road of that fundamental restructuring than we were a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA> That is because the past year has seen the consolidation of the most significant investment phase since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> And it is investment which is the key to a successful fight back on the trade front. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have had our set-backs and still have a long way to go-a generation of neglect cannot quickly be put right. </PARA>
<PARA> We are under no illusion that there have been disappointments. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year inflation was too high. </PARA>
<PARA> And the balance of payments did not fall as we expected, leading to higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been the price we paid for the massive modernisation of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge before us now is to get the best from this stronger economic structure. </PARA>
<PARA> To turn it against our trade and inflation problems-the only way we can secure sustainably lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, tonight's Budget takes up this challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> It declares a record surplus-the third Budget surplus in a row. </PARA>
<PARA> Real Government spending is cut for the fourth year in succession, to its lowest share in 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It tackles Australia's savings problem-the proper way, with a far-sighted restructuring of retirement incomes policy to encourage today's working Australians to save for their retirement through superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> And as we promised in April, the Budget fully funds the largest tax cut and family package in our history. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, it is a Budget without gimmicks-without resort to quick fixes.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a Budget which puts the nation's interests first. </PARA>
<PARA>THE BUDGET OUTCOME</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, a year ago I forecast a Budget surplus of $5 1/2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The result was even better, close to $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>The Budget I bring down tonight will deliver a surplus of $9.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> A massive deposit in the savings account of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> What a contrast with the situation left to us by the Liberals in 1983!</PARA>
<PARA> Then Australia's Budget was in the red by a record $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, it is in the black by $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> That is prudent Government the Labor way. </PARA>
<PARA> In six years we conquered the largest and most profligate fiscal deficit in the nation's history, reducing it to zero-we have now produced a surplus of the same enormous dimension. </PARA>
<PARA> And the Government has refunded more in tax cuts than if we had fully indexed the tax scales for inflation since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Of special importance, this year's Commonwealth surplus will more than offset the borrowing by all state and local Governments in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement is forecast to be in surplus by 1.2 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> Every cent of the Commonwealth's $9 billion surplus will be used to pay back debt. </PARA>
<PARA> This will mean that over a four-year span total Commonwealth debt to GDP will have been reduced by half. </PARA>
<PARA>SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, in recent times there has been a lot of talk about measures to boost domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Higher national savings are undoubtedly part and parcel of overcoming our balance of payments problems. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one basic reason why we have moved the Budget so heavily into surplus, to increase public savings and to pay off debt. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a distinction to be made between good and bad schemes intended to stimulate private savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not about to grasp half-baked ideas on savings simply to satisfy some passing fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, our approach over six years has been to plan and pursue a structured and certain path, cutting tax rates and extending the benefit of superannuation savings to the whole workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> The task before us now is to plan for early next century when the large post-war ``baby boom'' generation will be reaching retirement age. </PARA>
<PARA> This year about 13 per cent of the population is of pensionable age-that will rise to around 25 per cent by the year 2030. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, tonight I am announcing a comprehensive reform of the retirement income policies of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> A detailed statement is being simultaneously released by my colleague, the Minister for Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> Our goal is to encourage those now in the prime of their working lives to provide a higher standard of living for themselves in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> We will do that by maintaining and improving the age pension and by providing better opportunities and incentives to save for retirement through superannuation-to supplement rather than to diminish the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> A key feature of this package is a far-reaching plan to integrate the taxation and social security income testing systems. </PARA>
<PARA> It builds on the April Statement change which exempted the pension income test free area entirely from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> That change alone ensures that 80 per cent of all age pensioners will be totally excluded from any requirement to pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I announce that the tax-free income area for pensioners will in future be indexed to keep pace with the cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that, the Government tonight commits itself to an even more far-reaching reform. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1995 all age and service pensioners-that is both full rate and part rate pensioners-will be totally removed from the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, all age and service pensioners will be subject only to the social security income test-they will not have to pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This will make it much more rewarding for retirees to have an additional source of income to the pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The message to today's working Australians is that saving for your retirement will be rewarded, not penalised. </PARA>
<PARA> A whole range of complementary changes will be implemented to make superannuation more worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> Chief among these are effective rules to ensure that superannuation paid on behalf of employees is not lost to them when they change jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the requirements to preserve these superannuation payments until people actually retire will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit on tax deductions self-employed people can claim for putting aside superannuation will be increased, and in future, other workers on low or modest incomes with relatively small employer-funded superannuation will be able to top-up those funds and claim tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the maximum permissible superannuation benefit available to low and middle-income workers is to be dramatically increased. </PARA>
<PARA> But to add further momentum to private provision in retirement and provide an extra boost to national savings, the Government will consider as part of the wage system for next financial year the gradual introduction of a further 3 per cent award for occupational superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, these historic reforms confirm superannuation as the Government's preferred savings vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> Over time this policy will be central to the national imperative to lift savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Already the shift in superannuation savings since 1983 has been remarkable, especially since superannuation was made available to the entire workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year superannuation assets grew by $15 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> That increase in a single year was about the same size as the total assets of superannuation funds when this Government came to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Today total assets stand at $105 billion-larger than Australia's net overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Our reforms will build dramatically on that base. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of present trends, by the turn of the century more than $60 billion a year will be flowing into superannuation funds-a massive injection to the nation's savings pool. </PARA>
<PARA> A savings program which will really enhance national savings and not a gimmick which would grotesquely distort the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In this way the retirement incomes policy is a strategy for coming decades, not just coming years. </PARA>
<PARA> But, Madam Speaker, I stress that the maintenance of an adequate age pension system will remain the essential element underpinning our retirement incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party's long-standing commitment to an age pension of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings will be put beyond any shadow of a doubt in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Next April the normal indexation increase will lift the single rate pension by about $9 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I am announcing that over and above that rise, the pension will be increased by $4 a fortnight, a total rise of $13. </PARA>
<PARA> From April 1990, the return of the after-tax purchase price of annuities will be freed from the social security income test. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, from November this year age pensioners will be able to borrow up to $40,000 against the value of their home without having this extra money counted in the social security income test. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners who do not own their own homes are also to be further assisted. </PARA>
<PARA> From this December basic rental assistance will be increased from $15 to $20 per week, with two further $5 rises to follow next year. </PARA>
<PARA> That will mean that from September 1990 rent assistance of up to $30 a week will be provided for pensioners without children, rising to $40 per week for families with three or more children. </PARA>
<PARA> For aged pensioners the measures announced during this year will cost over $700 million, while the full-year cost of all social security measures will be $1.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>OUTLAYS</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, I now turn to the outlays side of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989-90, outlays or Commonwealth spending will represent 23.7 per cent of the economy, the lowest level since 1973-74. </PARA>
<PARA> A fall of 6 percentage points of GDP in six years. </PARA>
<PARA> The forward estimates, now published in the Budget documents, point to further decline. </PARA>
<PARA> That is, three years from now Labor will have succeeded in reducing Commonwealth Government spending to the levels of the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> This restraint enables us to be responsive to changing circumstances and to improve the effectiveness and fairness of government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made a smaller public sector a better public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Better targeting those in need and being more generous to those who are most deserving. </PARA>
<PARA> Need I say, Madam Speaker, we reject completely the notion that Australia will somehow be a better place by walking away from the community's collective responsibility to assist the least well off. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because of this better management of public finances that we have also been able to address other high priority areas in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> These have included the Prime Minister's environment statement, his re-commitment to a multi-cultural Australia and the initiatives outlined to enhance our scientific effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight, Madam Speaker, in a further re-evaluation of priorities the Government is announcing a number of new initiatives to advance its social justice objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is to assist the most needy experiencing difficulties with rent and mortgage repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will provide an extra $15 million to be distributed under the existing Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme administered by State Housing Authorities on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> A National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy is to be established, drawing together a number of hitherto separate programs, to tackle the severe educational disadvantage of this group. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure is estimated at $89 million in 1990-an increase of $34 million on 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Employment Service will be revamped to provide even more help for those having difficulties in the labour market, including the older unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments to the single unemployed aged between 60 and 64 and out of work for six months or more will be aligned with the single age pension rate and increased by $17 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> Another initiative deals with one of our most disturbing social issues-that of homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA> We have developed a comprehensive strategy to address their needs at a cost of $24 million in both this year and next: further details are outlined in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the health and community services area the Government has also committed additional funds to high priority areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The comprehensive AIDS strategy, designed to limit the advance of the disease will receive an additional $7 million this year, rising to $14 million in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next two years the Government will be providing an additional $44 million to encourage participation and excellence in sport which plays such a vital role in the collective life of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>REVENUE</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the revenue side of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> This year revenue as a share of the economy is estimated at 26.2 per cent, the same level as last year and 1.5 percentage points lower than in 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also the same level that obtained under the last two Liberal Budgets before this Government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as importantly, Madam Speaker, the Government has reformed the Australian taxation system, making it both fairer and more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I announce further changes. </PARA>
<PARA> First to the company tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Under current arrangements company tax is collected with much greater lags than taxes paid by individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of these delays companies enjoy an interest free loan from the Government for up to two years. </PARA>
<PARA> We have decided to narrow this concessional arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> This will bring forward $885 million in revenue this year but, more significantly, will generate an ongoing saving in public debt interest of about $330 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Deferral of tax payments also arises with monthly remittances of PAYE tax withheld by employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that, from 1 December 1989, the 800 or so largest employers, with annual remittances exceeding $5 million, will be required to make payments twice a month rather than once. </PARA>
<PARA> This will bring forward $550 million of revenue and will further reduce public debt interest by $70 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist long-term business planning, the seven-year carry forward of losses is to be removed, allowing unlimited carry forward of losses incurred in 1989-90 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales tax on small business will be reduced by substantially increasing the manufacturers' exemption from $12,000 to $50,000; aids to manufacture provisions are also being extended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also undertaken a major review of the taxation treatment of Life Offices. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 January 1990, expenses incurred by life insurance companies in gaining the investment component of premium income will be tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to exempt from tax non-profit sports and games clubs, such as pony and fishing clubs. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, community service organisations such as Lions and Rotary clubs will be exempted from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also relieve some 130,000 taxpayers from paying quarterly provisional tax by raising the threshold to $8,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, the Government's relentless war on tax avoidance will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I am announcing tonight further anti-avoidance measures in the areas of capital gains tax, dividend selection schemes and share-based financing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is proud of its tax reforms and will continue to pursue the objective of a fair and reasonable taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> . </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND POLICY</PARA>
<PARA> I return now to economic conditions and policy. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I referred to the surge of business investment which last year grew by a massive 15 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> But at the same time as companies were spending heavily on investment goods, private spending elsewhere in the economy was also rising strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect was that domestic demand in Australia grew too fast, spilling over into imports, diverting export goods to the local market, and rekindling inflationary pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me underline that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Last financial year national spending increased by nearly 8 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet gross domestic product-the measure of everything we produce in Australia-grew by under 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That big gap-spending at 8 per cent and production at 4 per cent-sums up our trade problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a gap which must be closed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short term that can only be done by bringing that high demand down to a more realistic level. </PARA>
<PARA> This is where interest rates have played an appropriate role. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also why the Government has continued with tight budgetary and wages policies. </PARA>
<PARA> But moderating demand is only half the story. </PARA>
<PARA> The other half is lifting our local supply of goods and services-our production. </PARA>
<PARA> This involves more investment but spread more evenly over time. </PARA>
<PARA> It involves more entrepreneurial management. </PARA>
<PARA> It involves better work practices and greater skills in the workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> And it involves more efficiency in our economic structure-being even smarter in the way we get things done. </PARA>
<PARA> These are reasons why the Government welcomes the recent Industrial Relations Commission decision, completing the framework for the most far-reaching overhaul of industrial awards since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, wages policy has also been fundamental to our economic success. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the past six years the Government's unique Accord with the Australian workforce has delivered unprecedented wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> There are now 1.5 million more Australians in jobs than there were six years ago-a phenomenal figure and one of this Labor Government's proudest achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment rate has fallen from 11 per cent to 6 per cent, its lowest level for 8 years. </PARA>
<PARA> At this very moment the Accord is protecting the employment gains of the past six years from the ravages of a wage explosion. </PARA>
<PARA> It has enabled the Government to negotiate a wage/tax trade off to protect investment and to fend off recession. </PARA>
<PARA> In the period immediately ahead the award restructuring process will bring about a much more adaptable and flexible labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> Those historic changes build upon the other economic reforms that this Government has aggressively pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> A modern financial system, a fairer tax system, reduced trade barriers and better education and training systems. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently these far-reaching reforms have extended to the waterfront and the communications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, as the only Government in Australia's post-war history that has attempted such structural changes to the economy, we are well aware of the need to press on with reform. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end we have decided to restructure the existing Industries Assistance Commission, greatly broadening its charter to act as a catalyst for dynamic change in industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting these changes, the expanded body will be renamed the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I am announcing details of these changes, together with a major two-year work program for the Commission, in a separate statement. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC PROSPECTS</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, I now turn to Australia's economic prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I have said before it is clear that in the past year the major preoccupation of policy was with an economy which was too buoyant. </PARA>
<PARA> The fallout from that was higher than expected prices and greater than forecast imports. </PARA>
<PARA> But during the course of the current year we expect this momentum to moderate in response to past tightening of policies. </PARA>
<PARA> So in the period ahead we plan for a necessary slowdown in spending. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I stress this does not mean a recessed economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is production, not spending, that generates jobs and spending has a long way to fall before it reaches our production otential. </PARA>
<PARA> Vital business investment will still stay strong with growth in the plant and equipment component expected to remain robust. </PARA>
<PARA> This will ensure the economy maintains sufficient momentum for growth in gross domestic product of 2 3/4 per cent and employment growth of the same magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA> We are confident of achieving the transition to a more sustainable growth path without destroying activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, the pattern of moderating demand will mean that many key aggregates will be lower in the second half of the financial year than in the first. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the case with inflation and the balance of payments, where recent momentum will carry on for a time. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, while the increase in the CPI is expected to be little changed at around 7 1/2 per cent for the year as a whole, it will be running noticeably below that in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to secure that lower inflation trend. </PARA>
<PARA> As a community we must reduce inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> With demand slowing, the growth of imports will also slow, and quite sharply as the year progresses. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, for the full year the current account deficit is forecast to be equivalent to about 5 per cent of GDP, only a slight improvement on last year.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, however, by the second half of the year the deficit will be running a good deal below that, as the much weaker trend in imports and the pickup in exports emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> But to stabilise our international debt the current account deficit will have to continue to be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The full force of this Government's resolve will be directed to this end. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, the substantial Budget surplus, the forecast slowing in demand and the expected improvement in the balance of payments, establish a framework for lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I stress that rates cannot and should not fall until it is economically responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is not prepared to countenance a premature fall in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> When the time is right, we are confident that the economic fundamentals will produce a sustainable fall. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> Madam Speaker, as a result of the Government's economic policies Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving. </PARA>
<PARA> This will occur because the Government has kept sight on its objectives and not been diverted by superficial solutions to fundamental problems. </PARA>
<PARA> It has never sought to minimise its responsibilities or shy away from the issues of substance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people have responded to these realities by adopting a highly responsible attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> They have quite sensibly rejected sham solutions to the country's difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> They are looking for value and consistency. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, Madam Speaker, they are looking for the meat rather than the feathers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget will fulfill that national purpose. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1989-90 totalling $6,318.8m. Of this amount, $2,987.3m was authorised by the Supply Act (No. 2) 1989-90: the balance of $3,331.5m will be authorised by this Bill. The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital expenditure and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not been approved previously. Provision is also made for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. An amount of $140m is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, the same as was provided in the Supply Act (No. 2) 1989-90. Details of the proposed expenditures are set out in schedule 4 to the Bill, the main features of which were outlined in the Budget Speech. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-For the information of honourable members I present a paper entitled Better Incomes: Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This statement is the most comprehensive policy on retirement income in Australia's history. It has been developed through wide and extensive consultation with all interested groups. The issues are well known and the solutions are generally agreed, even though there may be some differences about details. In this statement we step beyond the short term to a policy about the long term future of Australia and our retired people. This Government's retirement incomes policy is built on the firm foundation of social security, taxation and wages policy over the last six years. Without the reconstruction of the social security and taxation systems of the last six years it would not have been possible to develop or adopt a policy that is fair, adequate, secure and sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> In tandem with the Government's economic strategy, this policy addresses, in a fundamental way, the level of national savings. Savings for retirement is long term and not directed to short-term consumption. It helps ensure sustained economic growth and reduces our dependence on overseas borrowing. This retirement income policy is a policy to deliver better incomes for those retired now and those who will retire in the future. It is a fair, adequate, secure and sustainable policy. It is a policy about better incomes now and into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA> Retirement issues affect everyone, one way or another, throughout their lives. The policy is fair to everyone. It is fair to people currently retired. For people dependent on the age pension it provides a real sustainable increase in incomes. The Government is committed to the age pension system. For the first time it will be integrated with private retirement savings. The interaction of private savings particularly through superannuation, pensions and tax will be reformed in three steps. Firstly, by 1990 the pension income test free area will be 100 per cent tax free. Secondly, from 1991 the social security-and tax-income free areas will be indexed. Thirdly, from 1995 the tax and social security systems will be better integrated, so that no age or service pensioner, full rate or part rate, will pay income tax. At that time the present withdrawal rates will be substantially reduced to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This policy statement also marks an historic new fair deal for women in retirement income. Changes in the superannuation system will mean that, for the first time ever, women who have time out of the work force or who work part time will have access to superannuation. Wages policy and superannuation policy will mean that the number of women covered by superannuation will rapidly increase. This Government established award based superannuation as part of wages policy. Award based superannuation is the best and fairest means of providing superannuation to the majority of the work force. The Government supports the principle of the extension of award based superannuation. It is through award based superannuation that most women will get the opportunity to benefit from superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Superannuation changes will mean that in the future widows will be entitled to far better reversionary benefits on the death of their husbands. Over time, retiring couples are far more likely to take an annuity with the security of an adequate reversionary benefit for the widow when her husband dies. </PARA>
<PARA> Couples will have the opportunity to make sure that women are not left widowed without adequate income. The policy is also fair to the many thousands of women widowed before they could benefit from these changes. It enables these women to use the equity in their homes to supplement their income without affecting their pension-and provides substantial increases for those who do not own their home but pay private rent. The Government rejects the argument that fairness requires a decision to lift the age pension age for women. We will monitor the progress of women's access to superannuation and the labour market before consideration of any change to the age pension age for women. </PARA>
<PARA> Our retirement income policy is all about better incomes-better incomes for all in retirement. This policy statement reaffirms our firm commitment to the age pension system and to tax assisted superannuation. In April 1990 we will not only meet, but exceed Labor's longstanding commitment to an age pension of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We will maintain the value of the pension through indexation in line with the consumer price index-at the earliest possible date after publication of CPI figures-and we commit ourselves to further increases in the age pension, over time. </PARA>
<PARA> Income needs of people who have not had the opportunity to save during their working lives will be met under this policy. Adequate retirement income is much broader than an adequate pension. On top of the age pension, rent assistance reforms mean that in over just 10 months-from December 1989 to September 1990-we will double rent assistance for age and service pensioners, from $15 to $30 per week. For the first time ever rent assistance will be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> This policy also contains a package of measures that will make annuities a far more attractive option for people as they retire. The package includes changes in the superannuation system to reasonable benefit rules, lifting the maximum level of reversionary benefits for widows and freeing up arrangements for smaller funds to provide annuities. In the social security system the bias against annuities in the income test will be removed. This policy means that superannuation and other savings can now be used effectively as a source of retirement income-lifting the levels of retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, retirement income is not a short term matter. Young people starting off on 40 years of a working life need to be able to save for their retirement with security. This statement includes a program for changes well into the next century. For the first time ever Australia's workers can plan for retirement on a secure footing. That secure footing includes the guarantee of indexation of every component of the age pension system. The basic pension is indexed. Assets test limits are indexed. After the substantial increases in rates, rent assistance will be indexed from March 1991. From 1991 the tax free income test free area will be indexed. </PARA>
<PARA> All child payments are automatically adjusted for inflation. People who have retired and those who will retire in the future now have the security of knowing that inflation will not erode the adequacy of any part of the age pension system. Retired people also need access to reliable information about social security and tax rules. This policy includes provision for advisory and information services so that retired people can have the security of access to reliable information about how best to manage their retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly this policy is sustainable. Like every element of the Government's social policies, the retirement income changes in this statement will be fully funded on introduction. The changes mean that as time goes by more and more people will retire with better access to superannuation and other private income. Because we have reconstructed the social security system over the last six years and because we have built a fair superannuation system we can now integrate private retirement savings, the public pension and the tax system. Through these steps as a community we will be able to make the change to provide better incomes in retirement into the next century not simply for those Australians for the next decade or so but for all Australians into the future. We can have for the first time in this country's history a balanced retirement income system operating on the twin pillars of our age pension system effectively linked and integrated with annuities and superannuation-a genuine and sustainable retirement income system. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the statement to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement just made by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) is significant in a number of respects. Firstly, it does contain some worthwhile changes to the system, and I give him full compliment for that. However, it is interesting to note that in the very first sentence of his statement he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the first comprehensive policy on retirement income in Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA>I think I should put on the record that in fact the first comprehensive policy on retirement income in Australia's history was announced by the coalition parties in November 1988. I should also put on record that many of the benefits, many of the worthwhile elements of this package, were in fact contained in that document. I am pleased, and the Opposition is delighted, that in the interests of the welfare of the Australian people the Government has seen fit to absorb our proposals in its Budget arrangements tonight. It is a good thing for Australians, especially in areas such as retirement income, that it is possible for both sides of the House to agree on the long-term objectives of such a policy. As the Minister quite rightly points out, it has to be a policy for the long term. But it would have been nice, I think, and appropriate for a man who claims to have some statesmanlike qualities on occasions, for him to have perhaps given some credit to the work of the Opposition in this particular role. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy predated the Cass Social Security Review report; it predated the reports put out by the Life Insurance Federation of Australia and various organisations in the life insurance and superannuation industry. We believed then, and we believe now, that with an ageing population there are few, if any, more significant issues on the public agenda of this nation than the protection of our aged, both now and in the future. It has been a matter of great regret to us that over the last seven years and seven Budgets of the Hawke Labor Government and Keating as Treasurer we have seen time after time changes being introduced which were at best ad hoc and which at worst introduced into the retirement income formula the most dangerous word of all-and that was doubt: doubt on the stability of policy; doubt on people's capacity to plan and save over 30 or 40 years of their lives; and doubt as to what in fact the end benefits would be. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was there that doubt? It was simply because, within six months of this Government being elected to power, it made some fundamental changes in the tax mix of superannuation. It said then that that would be the beginning and the end of the exercise. In April of last year we saw another set of fundamental changes which in fact negatived all those that had been introduced a few years before. Again we were told by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on that occasion-and I can paraphrase his words because they are indelibly branded on my mind-that the people of Australia could plan with confidence in their future because now the ball was in the right park and there would be no further change. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we see again, in the next Budget, a further set of changes. While, as I have said, there has been some step forward-and I would be the last person to deny that fact-it is a very sad day for Australia when the pensioners of this country, the retirees, and those who are nearing retirement are once again faced with a whole set of changes. And they wonder when the next set will be. In the highly unlikely event that this Government is returned, I presume we will see yet another few then. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also made the observation that, in tandem with the Government's economic strategy, this policy addresses in a fundamental way the level of national savings. I wonder how many people will see that statement in the context of some 18 per cent interest rate on housing and 7 per cent inflation, which, as the Government has acknowledged in the Budget introduced in this House tonight, it is not its objective to reduce. Effectively, the Government has said it cannot help the problem. What has now been done-rightly in the short term; I emphasise that short term-is that the Government has said to the pensioners of Australia and to those on low incomes who are dependent on the welfare system, `We are going to index everything'. For all intents and purposes, that is what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads carefully the 1989-90 Budget information document put out by the Minister for Social Security, one finds the most interesting thing-that most of the changes he is introducing will not affect the next financial year and some will not affect the financial year after that. Goodness gracious me, we find that in fact the changes go right through to 1995 when, we are told, in those grandiose tones used by both the Treasurer and now the Minister for Social Security, all pensioners, whether full pensioners or part pensioners, will be fully integrated into the tax system, which is something I happen to support. But he goes on to say that they will not have to pay any tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble is this: there will be an awful lot of pensioners out there tonight who will say, `Goodness gracious me, am I going to live that long?'. Why is it, if these policy objectives are so wonderful, that it will take six years before they are introduced? I asked some of my colleagues who have great knowledge in such matters whether they recalled any government ever in Australia's history having the effrontery to come into this House in the context of a Budget and say, `We are making commitments six years down the track'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we are not fools. The people of Australia are not fools. The obvious reason the Government goes so far ahead is that it can make those sorts of commitments knowing full well that the likelihood of its ever having to be absolutely required to follow them through is extremely low. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) will not be in this chamber, probably the Minister will not be here-he will have retired to better pastures-and probably half the Parliament will not be here either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that people will not believe governments that make commitments six years down the road. On the record of the Government's social security policy, on the record of the Government's policy in relation to superannuation, the Government is lucky to be able to last 12 months without completely unscrambling its policy. To start with a conception that the Government has introduced a lower tax mix for retirement income in Australia is an absolute falsehood. What the Government has done is to increase tax on superannuation over the last six, nearly seven, years by some 1,000 per cent. That is the record of this Government. That is the reality and that is again what the Government will be tested on in the final analysis by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that rent assistance has been increased. For people living in Sydney who are totally dependent on the pension, it is perfectly obvious that the current arrangements were not satisfactory. But I am concerned that I do not know why the Government takes such a narrow approach to this issue when the realities are that there is a supply and demand problem which is forcing up the cost of rents. What that simply means is that, by giving subsidies for higher rental payments, all the Government will effectively be doing will be increasing the level of rent, and not necessarily increasing the level of supply of cheap rental accommodation. That is one of the problems that have to be faced by this Government. I regret to say that the statement made by the Minister tonight gives us absolutely no reason to presume that anything will be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have seen in other areas of the policy announced tonight, the superannuation area in particular, how the Government has utilised a number of our new proposals. Again, I think this is a compliment to us. We put it on the public record and the Government has seen fit to support our policy. We commend the Government for having had the intelligence to do precisely that. The point is made, however, that the policy is to be fair to everyone. I suppose it can be said that in many respects fairness is very much in the eye of the beholder. But I am more than surprised that when I read the statement and accompanying documents-and I still have not, I might add, read the document from the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner which may give some light to the subject because I have not received the document yet, regrettably-they bring out some very interesting points. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point I want to make is this: Of the increase in expenditure in the social security budget of some $1.7 billion, no less than $700m is in fact being spread in the retirement area. As I said, much of that in fact is on the never-never principle, right through to 1995. But it should be noted that under the taxation arrangements of this Government since June of last year the Government has been taking from the pockets and from the funds of the 1.6 million Australians who have superannuation, between $900m and $1,000m in additional tax. That is the record of the Government. So in two Budgets the Government is getting about $2 billion tax out of long-term savings the need for which we heard the Treasurer tonight speaking about so eloquently. So the Government has taken out $2,000m in tax and has made a miserable contribution on the never-never principle of a mere $700m. Again the Australian taxpayers are not fools. The people who belong to superannuation schemes are not fools. They are going to do their own analyses and they are going to wonder why this Government talks so big about the need for savings when in fact it attacks and it screws the very last dollar it possibly can out of the very people whom it claims on this occasion to be trying to support. Consequently talk about real sustainable increases in incomes coming from a Government which over seven years has done beautifully at reducing people's real income is, to put it mildly, rather far fetched. But those are the words in the Minister's statement; that is what he expects people to believe, and it is my duty, and the duty of my colleagues, to absolutely nail him to the wall and to let people see him for what he really is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer made a point about equality. Everyone is going to have access to superannuation. Let us look at the role of women in relation to superannuation. Many thousands of words have been uttered in this chamber on all sides about the gross inequity which we have had in the superannuation system for far too long, inequity which has been biased principally against women. Their level of coverage is extremely low. But we are told by the Minister, `Don't worry about that. Women who have time out of the work force or who work part time will have access to superannuation'. Now I was fascinated to read that. I thought, `Great. This is again one of the Liberal-National Party proposals which the Government has taken up and this is tremendous'. So I looked through all the documentation for the words `retirement savings account', which of course was the very mechanism, the vehicle which we put forward as the means by which women who have broken careers would be able to do this, so that over a period they would be able to sustain their retirement benefits and get a decent level of retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA> When I read the background documents I get all this hyperbole, bureaucratic nonsense and socialist jingo about the terrors of offering those sorts of packages to women who have husbands who can afford to fund their superannuation. That should not be permitted! That is a terrible thing! So the Government has come up with this extraordinary proposal that you can be covered provided you only stay out of the work force for two years. If the Government had done its sums on this, and regrettably it clearly has not, it would have found one interesting thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Most women in the child-bearing ages tend to bunch up their children in the sense that they tend to have children reasonably close together. If the Government is going to lock them out of long-term retirement savings on the basis that if they stay out for more than two years they are neutralised, it has absolutely killed the very objective of its policy, which I thought, from the language here, was to give women fair access to superannuation in the Australian system. We did not make that mistake. We said that women who are in employment with superannuation and who leave for family reasons with the intention of going back into the work force should have the right to be covered for those years. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that most women will probably stay out of the work force for between three and five years, and not two years. That is all the Government has offered them. What the Government has effectively done, therefore, is once again put a major log jam in the way of the people having children in this country. Now people are going to say, `I am going to lose my superannuation if I have children. I am not going to have it long enough if I want to stay at home with those kids for the first couple of years of their lives'. The Government has not achieved a worthwhile policy objective by going down the route it has. If it had taken retirement savings accounts and the broader concept that we put forward, the whole situation would have been far more sensible. To talk about a fairer policy for many thousands of women is nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-One of the major achievements of the Hawke Labor Government has been to improve the situation and future prospects of young Australians. This Government has put in place a solid foundation for the future for Australia's young people. Since 1983 the Government has implemented a wide range of reforms which have radically altered the nature of assistance provided to young people and the ways in which that assistance is delivered. Our aim has been to encourage young people to greater participation in education and training. We wanted to work in partnership with young people and their parents to make sure that our young people had better educational opportunities, adequate income support and better job prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our achievements have been considerable. When we came to office in 1983 unemployment among young people was the highest ever recorded with almost one in three out of work. Since then this Government has halved the numbers of young unemployed. There were 141,200 teenagers looking for a job in 1983. Today there are 72,300, an improvement of over 50 per cent. There were 147,500 20-to 24-year-olds looking for a job. Today there are 78,100, again a 50 per cent improvement. At the end of the 1982 school year only 36 per cent of students continued on to year 12. At the end of 1988, 58 per cent were staying at school to year 12. This is a record high level of retention. </PARA>
<PARA> We have achieved a major overhaul of our youth income support arrangements. Austudy pay rates, for example, for 16-and 17-year-olds have more than doubled since 1985. The Job Search allowance has encouraged young people into labour market programs and the young homeless allowances was introduced in 1986 as a first step in assisting young homeless people. Opportunities in higher education have been increased significantly. Since 1983 we have created an additional 46,000 higher education places and by 1991 an additional 49,000 will be available. </PARA>
<PARA> The numbers of apprentices have risen by over 50 per cent to 54,000 annually and 32,000 young people have benefited from the Australian traineeship system. Under the supported accommodation assistance program we have provided support for up to 2,000 young people every night with accommodation, counselling and information. We have established youth access centres to provide a comprehensive information, advice and referral service for young people. These improvements in the lives and future prospects of young Australians have been achieved because the Hawke Labor Government has developed and put in place the most comprehensive, the most progressive and the most successful strategy for young people in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a strategy and that is the key to this Government's approach to the problems and needs of young Australians. In the last year before we came to office 80,000 jobs held by teenagers disappeared, and 288,000 young Australians had unemployment as their only occupation. The Government's strategy has halved this number. A disgraceful 36 per cent of school students stayed on until year 12 in 1983, and the Government strategy has increased this retention to a record of nearly 58 per cent, as I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> When we came to office we set in train a period of consultation and review of the impact of our policies for young Australians, underpinned by this Government's commitment to improving the quality of life for all Australians. Following this the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced in 1985 the Government's strategy for young people. The major objectives of the strategy have been to provide all young people with an appropriate combination of a full secondary education, structured training or post-secondary education opportunities, and appropriate income support where necessary. Since then the Government has continued to modify and revise its youth strategy in light of the community's and young people's views and ideas, and in response to the changing economic circumstances that confront young people. </PARA>
<PARA> The driving force behind these changes has been the Government's determination to meet the economic challenges that face Australia. The guiding principle of these changes has been the Hawke Labor Government's unswerving commitment to social justice for all Australians. The four main aims of our social justice strategy are: a fair distribution of economic resources; equal access to essential services such as housing, health care and education; equal rights in civil, legal and industrial affairs; and the opportunity for participation by all in personal development, community life and decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> Social justice under Labor is a clear statement that achieving a just and equitable society need not be at odds with taking the hard economic decisions necessary for Australia's future. It is young Australians who will have the task of carrying forward critical economic and social reforms. It is young Australians who have benefited and will continue to benefit from those reforms. In October 1988, in line with our commitment to social justice, together with my colleague the Minister for Social Security and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Social Justice (Mr Howe) I announced a major review of the Government's youth strategy from a social justice perspective. In announcing this review the Government recognised that social justice cannot be achieved by a single program by the simple measure of dollars spent or by a simple statistical measure of poverty. An example of the strength of those initiatives is clear in terms of how we will respond to the needs of homeless young people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, Our Homeless Children, is a timely reminder of the pressing need to assist young people who do not have access to stable and secure accommodation. In line with key recommendations of the report, the Government will be placing major priority on further expanding the supply of secure accommodation for young people so that they can escape homelessness or dependence on short term crisis accommodation. This will involve shifting the balance of service delivery away from the present concentration on crisis accommodation towards longer term, more secure accommodation provision and related support for young people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will increase the number of medium and long term beds available, and improve the adequacy and accessibility of income support for homeless young people. Such improvements will not, however, create undue incentives for young people to leave home or school. We will expand mediation services to assist families stay together, provide innovative health services which will address the particular health problems that flow from homelessness, expand the number of youth access centres that will act as referral and co-ordination points for services directed to meet the needs of homeless young people and, most importantly, provide access to employment and training opportunities that will provide homeless young people with the ability to establish independent and stable living arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> A key element of the Government's approach to meeting the needs of homeless young people will be to seek a cooperative approach from State and from Territory governments. This is in line with the shared responsibility between all levels of government in providing the necessary services. The youth initiatives announced tonight by the Treasurer extend and refine the Government's existing youth strategy. Budget Related Paper No. 9, Towards Social Justice for Young Australians, fully explains those initiatives. An outline of our achievements up until now is contained in the companion booklet, the Federal Government's strategy for young Australians-the Youth Book. Mr Deputy Speaker, I table a copy of the Youth Book. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's youth strategy illustrates our continued commitment to meeting the needs of Australia's young people. It is guided by our determination to achieve a just and equitable society. We have a clear vision of what assistance young people need as they make their transition to full participation in the social and economic life of the community. We have a coherent strategy to provide that assistance. We are prepared to listen to young people and the community and modify that strategy in light of changing circumstances. Government alone cannot change community attitudes to disadvantaged young people. </PARA>
<PARA> We need the support and cooperation of the whole of the Australian community. To be serious about turning the ideal of social justice for Australian youth into reality we must approach the task in a systematic and coordinated way. We believe that if we do not get things right for people when they are young, we as a community pay the penalty personally, socially and economically. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government's record in the youth area stands by itself. The birthright of every Australian should be to have a secure, caring childhood, enabling the child to develop his or her talents to the fullest. Such an achievement is the vision of this Government. I am sure that every Australian shares this Government's belief that there can be no more important task than providing a secure future for our young people. The youth social justice strategy is about achieving this-the foundation for all our futures. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Will the Minister identify each Senior Executive Service or equivalent position within the Minister's department or authorities responsible to him which has been reclassified since 1 July 1988 and to which the occupant has been reappointed, indicating in each case (a) resultant increases in salary and other entitlements and (b) whether or not reappointment followed normal selection procedures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) 2 X Assistant Director Level 2 Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. (a) $5055 salary increase (b) normal SES selection.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been three reclassification of SES equivalent positions in the Joint Coal Board (JCB) since 1 July 1988. Pursuant to the Coal Industry Acts of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales, the remuneration of JCB staff is the responsibility of the Board. It is not the practice of either Government to disclose details of JCB staff remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to primary industry statutory marketing authorities (SMAs) in my Portfolio, these bodies have responsibility for setting the terms and conditions of employment, including remuneration, of staff through their enabling legislation. The SMAs are industry funded bodies and are fully accountable to the producers who provide their funds. As they operate in a commercial and competitive environment, it is not appropriate to publicly disclose details of remuneration. In carrying out their responsibilities, however, the SMAs are cognisant of the need to ensure that decisions related to staffing are consistent with general wages and industrial relations policies.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Reclassifications referred to in (1) are not inconsistent with the national wage fixing principles as all positions are classified on the basis of their work value. Officers who occupy these positions are selected on the basis of assessed efficiency.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The term ``defence export'' is normally used in a generic sense and does not have a commonly accepted legal or statutory meaning. This may explain the apparent discrepancies between the various figures referred to by the honourable member:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Mr Cooksey explained his estimate of Australian defence exports on page 254 of his Review of Australia's Defence Exports and Defence Industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the estimated $40 million worth of defence exports referred to on page 89 of the 1987 Policy Information Paper on The Defence of Australia is based on the value of approvals in 1986 for exports subject to Schedule 13b of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) there is no reference to $200 million in my press release of 14 June 1988 announcing the Government's revised defence export policy;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the $11,998 million referred to by the honourable member may relate to export returns collected by the Australian Customs Service and collated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) If a ``defence export'' is defined as an export which is subject to Schedule 13b of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, then offsets do not necessarily constitute defence exports. Offsets which comprise both civil and Defence elements also include activities such as technology transfer to Australia which foster capabilities for production and enhanced international competitiveness resulting in future exports of defence goods. These exports may or may not be subject to Schedule 13b of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) During the period 14 June 1988-11 March 1989 Defence officials took 12 days on average to process applications for export of items subject to Schedule 13b of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. In the same period the total value of export applications approved on this basis was $11.75 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No: the detailed information about Australian industry plans and overseas markets required to estimate 1989-90 defence exports is not available.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) The Government is studying all of the recommendations contained in the report. Delays in the federal and ACT courts are not as serious as in New South Wales, though the Government is nevertheless taking steps to tackle the delays that do exist. Although provision is made for jury trials in the Federal Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, jury trials have never been conducted in the Federal Court and are no longer conducted in civil cases in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has referred issues similar to those covered by the report, including the abolition of some committal hearings, for consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in an Inquiry into the Costs of Justice. The Government will be making a submission to the Inquiry and will await the results of the Inquiry before finalising its attitude as to whether similar changes should be made in federal or Territory jurisdictions.</PARA>
