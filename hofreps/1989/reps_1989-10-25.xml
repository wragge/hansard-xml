<PARA> That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent notice of motion No. 1, private members' business, given for Wednesday, 25 October 1989, relating to the air pilots dispute, being called on forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition introduces this motion because of the present disaster that is Australia's domestic aviation system. Despite the Government's pronouncements and those of the airlines that 62 per cent capacity is operating, clearly that is not true. We believe that there has been a fundamental breach of the two-airline agreement dated 28 May 1981 and the schedule to the airline agreement which approved it. The Airlines Agreement Act designates Ansett and Australian as the major operators of airline services in Australia for the transport of passengers. Section 6 (1) (a) of the schedule to the Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA>The parties shall take all reasonable action within their powers to ensure that the Commission and the Company are the only two operators which provide scheduled passenger air services over trunk routes within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the reason that we want to suspend standing orders relates to section 6 (1) (d) of that schedule, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Without derogating from the objectives of sub-clause (1) (a), the parties acknowledge that nothing in this agreement shall preclude the Commonwealth, the Minister or the Secretary from permitting a passenger operator to develop specialised scheduled passenger air services over trunk routes of a nature which in the opinion of the Minister are not adequately provided for either by the Commission or the Company and for which after receiving a request in writing from the Minister neither the Commission nor the Company has, within a reasonable time, provided a service to the satisfaction of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The agreement may not expressly cover the situation that one of the companies may decide to give up an airline business or to go into some other business, but it is obvious that the Act and the agreement mean that the companies are bound to provide adequate air services. Even if this is not the case, there is an express provision under section 6 (1) (d) which would enable the Minister to take action under the confines of that section. Our legal advice is that there is no escape route for a company, such as a force majeure or some other excuse, for not providing a service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has two options available to it under the agreement. The first is to cancel the agreement, if a breach of a fundamental obligation can be established. Clearly the failure to provide scheduled air services would satisfy that condition. The prospect of a 50 per cent service-and we do not agree that that level has been reached, even after two months of the dispute-appears to be within that obligation. Secondly, the Minister could act under the express powers of section 6 (1) (d), which seems to be clearly available in the circumstances. Our advice is that the application of this section is not limited in any way, such as a justifiable inability to provide the service. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that a responsible government and Minister, acting in accordance with the national interest, and not being motivated by extraneous considerations, such as the present Government is, would take steps to enable other operators to enter the vacuum left by the two airlines in failing to take reasonable steps to ensure they can deliver the airline services which they have agreed to provide, and for which they have reaped great rewards from the Australian travelling public for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that it is a misuse of legal rights that the airlines are allowed to take their present course. Under the circumstances, the airlines would have a very great gall to take legal proceedings against the Commonwealth, to restrain it from taking whatever action was necessary to restore proper airline services for the nation. We believe that the national interest is very much at stake. Our principal export industry, tourism, also our biggest earner of foreign exchange, is in deep trouble. That industry is being destroyed in the major destinations of north Queensland, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania. There are great difficulties in the other capital cities, and the flow-on effect to the service and primary industries is being very much felt. People are losing their businesses and all they own while this stupid dispute continues. Many small businesses will never recover. More than 15,000 people have already lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The airlines now both admit that they cannot get full services back before Easter of next year. While the Sydney to Melbourne sector is being serviced, most other routes have less than adequate services. Some have virtually no services at all. There have been no services to speak of from Adelaide to Perth, from Perth to north Queensland or from Adelaide to Brisbane during the dispute. Those people who have tried to book airline seats know the impossible situation that exists. Airline reservation systems take ages to answer the phone. There is no guarantee of seats and no guarantee of flights. There are delays in connections and there are no seats on demand. Tourists are just not travelling. The country is bleeding. The Government now has an opportunity to open up the skies to other carriers that may be able to provide scheduled services in their own right. It is clear that adequate services are just not being provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Random checks on what is normally operating establish the inadequacies of the present situation. Last Tuesday, 17 October, the domestic airlines provided two services from Perth to the eastern States. Normally there are 11 services. In terms of seats available, that represented 20.74 per cent of capacity. Out of Cairns on recent weekends, there was about 23 per cent seat capacity. Normally there are 17 flights per day. Now, there is a likelihood at best of four or five flights using military and civilian aircraft-some in the very early hours of the morning. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example I cite last Monday's domestic services from Melbourne. On the Melbourne to Adelaide run there was 31 per cent seat capacity. The seat capacity from Melbourne to Hobart was 46 per cent. From Melbourne to Launceston it was 11.5 per cent. The seat capacity from Melbourne to Brisbane was 12.5 per cent, and from Melbourne to Canberra it was 32 per cent. Whilst Sydney and Melbourne are retaining some services, how many flights have run on the crucial tourist routes such as from Perth to Alice Springs and Cairns, from Cairns to Darwin and from Adelaide to Perth? The answer is nil. There is no resemblance between the timetables and what flies. </PARA>
<PARA> Any similarity between the forward schedules that used to be published in newspapers and what actually flies is purely coincidental. There are constant flight delays and nobody would accept that any type of reasonable service currently exists. We have been told constantly that airlines are carrying 62 per cent seat capacity. Australian Airlines is even saying that it will have 80 per cent seat capacity next month. Is that figure genuine? The Opposition believes that the airlines have failed to meet their obligations for providing services. Therefore, the Government should be responsive under the Act and should allow new players into the game. They may not all be full airlines, but there are carriers that could provide some scheduled services. I believe also that there are prospective players who can accelerate their efforts to enter the Australian airline business. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures that I have cited do not include the international carriers. There is a reason for this. On two occasions I have been told by airline reservations staff that the airlines are `not selling those seats now as we have enough of our own'. That has been confirmed to me by two international airlines. As part of opening up the system, the Opposition believes that the Government should allow full interlining to continue in order to ease the burden and should allow travel agents and the public direct access to those international carriers, because they can provide more seating capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Termination of the agreement would allow some overseas charter operators to come to Australia in their own right and to provide scheduled services until such time as the Australian carriers are back to full operation and new Australian operators are also in service. Of course, safety would be maintained at all times. The cost of the pilots dispute is enormous. The cost to tourism and business is outrageous. The personal cost to Australian families is being felt in many ways, especially in times of personal tragedy. Australia does not have adequate air services. The Opposition believes that, in the national interest, the Government should now cancel the two-airline agreement and allow more operators into our air routes. The Government has the power to do that. It must act now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. Let me state very bluntly what we are putting in this motion. We are saying to the two airlines, Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia, that if they cannot deliver the goods they should close up shop and let someone else in who can deliver the goods. This is exactly what the Government should be saying to the two airlines after 11 weeks of this protracted dispute. It should be saying clearly to the two airlines, `We gave you a closed shop but only so long as you provided regular air services. You are not doing that now; so nick off and give someone else a go'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of this becomes very clear from a reading of the two airlines agreement. It all follows logically from two clauses of the agreement. The first point is that under the agreement only the two major airlines are allowed to operate domestic passenger services over trunk routes throughout Australia. That is made very clear in clause 6 (1) (a) of the agreement, which I paraphrase as follows: the parties shall take all reasonable action within their powers to ensure that Australian Airlines and Ansett are the only two operators which provide scheduled domestic passenger air services over trunk routes within Australia. That clause means that Australian Airlines and Ansett, while they provide services and only while they provide services, are in and all other operators are locked out. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point which is also very clear from the agreement is that if Australian Airlines and Ansett do not operate services over a trunk route, the Government can allow another operator in. That appears very clearly in clause 6 (1) (d), which the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has already read out. These two things are exactly what we would expect the agreement to provide. But what we have now is a situation where on any test Australian and Ansett are not providing services over the trunk routes of Australia. Even if we accept their own case, they are not providing the full services-the services they contracted to provide; the services they promised to provide. Of course the honourable member for Fadden has shown that they are providing even fewer services than they claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the two airlines are right-let us assume for a moment that they are-they are not providing the services they committed themselves to provide and therefore are in breach of the two airlines agreement. That breach is a fundamental breach, a substantial breach and a breach which is sustained and prolonged. As my colleague has already pointed out, there is no clause in the agreement for what is known as force majeure; there is no excuse for giving the two airlines a let-out, if that is what they want to rely on, and saying they are not at fault for the dispute, its prolonged nature and the resulting breach of agreement. In any case, the airlines are clearly in deliberate breach of the agreement because their refusal to negotiate with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has obviously prolonged the breach. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this being so, the Government has two courses open to it. The first course is to give a notice under clause 6 (1) (d) and let other operators in. In other words, the Government can say to the two airlines, `We gave you this closed shop. You have not delivered; so we give you notice that the whole agreement is coming to an end and we are letting other operators in'. Alternatively-and this is what the Government should do-it can rescind the agreement. It should do exactly that, for the two airlines have given away their right to have the exclusive right to operate domestic trunk services. If the Government has an ounce of responsibility left it will do this; it will take the first decent step it has taken during this whole dispute and rescind the two airlines agreement, thus taking a positive step towards restoring full air services for the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will reject this motion on several grounds. The first and most important ground is that it is yet another example of the axis which has been drawn by the Opposition front bench with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in order to deprive Australian citizens of their services. The second reason we will reject it is for the cant and hypocrisy that it represents. Nothing could be more hypocritical in this place than to see the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), stand up at this box as a member of the Government that brought in the two airlines agreement in its latest form over the opposition of all of us who were on the Opposition front bench at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition set in train this lock-in. If we are looking for the first causes of the current airline dispute, they go back to the two airlines agreement, which permitted the growth of the sort of featherbedding that the domestic airlines are trying to deal with in the totally unreasonable demands of the Pilots Federation. If the Opposition is looking for first causes, it should go back beyond the decision by the pilots earlier this year to enter into a confrontation with the airlines. The pilots had the political power and the industrial muscle to be able to do that because of the previous Government's arrangements. Those arrangements were set in place when this Opposition was in government. We are now struggling with the industrial consequences of that. Indeed, the airlines are struggling with the industrial consequences of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members should not get up here with their easy, facile, bush lawyers' talk about doing this or that with the two airlines agreement. I had the responsibility of administering the two airlines agreement for a couple of years, during which time I was trying to press some of its edges. Let me tell the House that it is not quite the easy, open-ended thing the Opposition is talking about, particularly when the trunk routes are being flown by the airlines, as they are. That is hypocritical nonsense. </PARA>

The difference between the honourable member and me is that I have had some experience in administering the Act, which he has not. He will never administer an Act of the Commonwealth. He has not had the experience in the past and he will not have it in the future. That is the end of that matter. He knows nothing about it, as he knows nothing about the subjects for which he has found himself responsible from time to time as an Opposition frontbencher. This is part of the axis which had developed between the Opposition and the Federation of Air Pilots to disrupt services to the people of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since this dispute began, the Opposition has sought to undermine every effort by the Government to provide services to the travelling public. The bleeding hearts opposite come in here and tell us that they are concerned about what is happening to the flying public of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These same bleeding hearts had the Opposition's defence spokesman, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), put out a press release a week or so ago in which he said that it was time the Government took the Royal Australian Air Force off the routes, that it was time the Government pulled the RAAF out of providing services to the public. Opposition members are in here today telling us that they want the public served. Yet their spokesman on defence is putting out press releases saying that the Opposition does not want the public served. What sort of cant and hypocrisy is that? The Opposition said originally that it supported the RAAF coming in, but now it does not support the RAAF coming in. Who is the RAAF supporting? It is flying people out of Cairns. It is flying people out of Western Australia. It is flying people out of the Northern Territory. It is covering those routes that the Opposition has been talking about, but now it opposes the RAAF covering those routes. That is the first thing that might well be said about the cant and hypocrisy that underlines this motion and the reason we will not support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has gone down the road of supporting the Federation of Air Pilots on its bogus claims on safety. It ill becomes the Opposition spokesman to get up and prate about that. As was revealed in the Senate Estimates Committee, when this matter was considered in some considerable detail, the Opposition's premature support for those bogus safety claims was thoroughly exposed. But its support did not come from a concern about safety; it came from a concern to back the Federation of Air Pilots in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes that matter a point further. Let us just look a little more deeply at the question of safety and at the lies and nonsense being told by the Federation of Air Pilots on that issue and many other issues. On the one hand, the Federation, which the Opposition backs, claims that it supports safety; on the other hand, it is prepared to harass pilots in briefing rooms and as they enter air terminals to fly the aircraft. What hypocrisy by the Federation and by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The question then is: What services are being provided by the airlines? The airlines are getting their aircraft into the air, which is a matter the Opposition hates, opposes and does not want, and they are also now bringing in leased aircraft. Australian Airlines announced the other day that four charter aircraft are already being used. It has taken a lease on five more late series 737-300s, two later series 757s and a 727. The airlines are bringing capacity into this country as they confront the tough and difficult situation of trying to get what is now effectively a restructuring of their airlines and to get people back to work. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that this was the sort of thing the Opposition was most interested in with regard to its industrial policy. When employers decided that they will take on their employees in major restructuring-albeit in this situation an unprovoked restructuring, because the airlines had no intention of confronting the situation they now confront-one would have thought there would be a bit of guts, a bit of backbone, a bit of backing from the Opposition, but there has not been. What we see in the Opposition is people incapable of holding a policy line in their heads and understanding the significance of it. We see people totally incapable of holding a policy line in their heads and sticking to it. The Opposition has found itself in a situation where common sense would have dictated solid backing for the Government and the airlines in this regard and some sort of statement on the part of the Opposition that this is the way it intends going about doing it. The moment something like this comes up, albeit a creation in the first instance of its own legislation, off the Opposition goes, running for the doctor. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only does the Opposition do that, but also it goes through the process of supporting the lies and calumnies told by the executive members of the Federation in order to keep their troops in line. It is quite obvious to the Opposition-and this is one of the reasons that we see these motions coming up now-that the executive of the Federation of Air Pilots is finding it harder and harder to hold its members in line. They are obliged to go to more and more extreme tactics to hold their members in line. The Federation of Air Pilots says, `It is a problem, we cannot hold our members in line. Who do we go to to help us in our hour of need as we can no longer hold our airline pilots in line? We go to the good old Federal Opposition'. They are going around at their meetings saying, `Do not worry, wait until the next election. We will work very hard to elect the Opposition, the people with whom we have formed an axis, because they are going to direct Australian Airlines to pick up all the old pilots. So let us get the Opposition into office as quickly as possible'. The Opposition is a reliable supporter of the Federation executive against the interests of the travelling public, the airlines and the pilots themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> This is yet another example of the Opposition's policy. It is not motivated by any genuine concern for the travelling public. The whole crisis is a product of its own administration of aviation policy. It is the act of the Opposition that is being talked about in here. We as a House ought not to support this sort of hypocrisy. We ought to have a sense of dignity about ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Judicial and Statutory Officers Remuneration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989, which proposes some increases in the salaries of Federal judges and others in judicial and quasi-judicial situations in the Federal structure. We support the Bill because Federal judges' salaries have been falling behind and there is a case for increasing them. As the second reading speech makes plain, the matter has been before the Remuneration Tribunal, which proposed very large increases indeed-increases so large that the Government felt that the community would not support increases of that size in judicial salaries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, as my colleague reminds me, the proposed increases were about 80 per cent, which was very much on the high side. For that reason, the matter went back to the Remuneration Tribunal, which did the job again and came back with other recommendations. It is those recommendations in substance, with some amendments, I think, which are incorporated in this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the legislation, because the salaries of Federal judges have been falling behind and there is a case for having them increased. In the past several reasons have been advanced as to why judges should, to put it bluntly, have reasonably high salaries. Although it is important not to exaggerate it, the fact is that, without judges receiving reasonable salaries, governments would not be able to attract the best people to the Bench. I emphasise that it is important not to exaggerate that argument, because there are other reasons why judicial office is attractive to practising lawyers. There are, of course, reasons other than money which deter successful practitioners in the law from taking judicial positions that are offered to them. Nevertheless, putting that all in balance and all in context and giving reasonable weight to it, one is still left with the conclusion that, without reasonable salaries being paid to judges, governments will not be able to attract the best people to the Bench. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, when we come to the Federal sphere, we find that there have been two recent resignations of Federal Court judges-Mr Justice Fitzgerald, as he then was, and Mr Justice Jackson. One would not, of course, seek to inquire into the reasons for their early retirements. One really would have to reach the conclusion that the comparatively low salaries and the absence of any increase in those salaries when judges expected them to be increased probably contributed to their early retirement. That, I think, is unfortunate, because they were both regarded as extremely good judges and, of course, both are regarded as extremely highly qualified and competent practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point which I think illustrates this is the fact that it is now common knowledge-at least at the Victorian Bar, being the branch of the profession with which I am most familiar-that many leading practitioners will not in fact accept appointment to the Bench; many good, competent people simply will not now accept appointment and do not regard a judicial position as being part of their expected or desired career path. Once again, it must be emphasised that this is not solely because of money; it is not solely because of the salaries. Nevertheless, again putting it into some balance and some context, one is, I believe, left with the conclusion that the level of current salaries, both Federal and State, is one of the reasons why many leading practitioners do not regard judicial office as a position to which they aspire. For those reasons, the thrust of the Bill must be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe there is a case for increasing Federal judicial and quasi-judicial salaries and allowances. No doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have noticed that, in terms of allowances, overnight allowances and such like, judges seem to do much better than members of parliament. I do not know why this is so. It has always been a mystery to me. Perhaps it is expected that when judges are on circuit, they will stay in posher establishments than we are expected to stay in. Perhaps they eat more, or perhaps their food is more expensive. I do not know what the reason is. But for whatever the reason, they in fact receive quite considerable allowances which are higher than ours. I hope that one day I will find the reason for that. For years I have been searching in vain, but I live in hope. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that should be made is that Family Court judges are now to be paid the same as Federal Court judges. One of the reasons advanced in support of this is that the jurisdiction of Family Court judges has been increased as they have taken up part of the jurisdiction which was previously confined to Federal Court judges. In other words, to put it bluntly, Family Court judges now do some of the work of Federal Court judges and therefore it is accepted that they deserve parity in their pay. I think the best thing to do about that is to accept it and accept the justification for it, because life as a Family Court judge is not a bed of roses. I can assure honourable members that life as a Family Court judge is a hard one. The problems which Family Court judges face are probably more trying and testing in a personal sense than the problems and difficulties faced by judges of other courts. Parity of salary, which we are now to see, is some recognition of the burdens of office which are carried by Family Court judges. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one other matter I want to refer to, although there are Government amendments to the Bill which it may be necessary to say something about at a later stage. I can now inform the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) that, having seen those amendments, we will be supporting them. I can understand the reasons that will be advanced for them. Leaving that aside, the other matter to which I wish to refer is this: high judicial salaries should have, one can reasonably hope, one result, among others-that is, that judges act as judges and confine themselves to judicial office; that they keep out of politics and government. I do not think that that is entirely judges' fault by any means, but in recent years there have been some very disturbing trends in some aspects of the judicial culture in Australia and it is related to this point. </PARA>
<PARA> The most serious of these, I believe, is the confusion of the judicial function which has been generated by having judges preside over royal commissions and sitting on tribunals and other bodies of an essentially political or governmental nature. That practice has grown over recent years. It is a bad practice and it should be stopped. The Supreme Court of the State of Victoria does not engage in that practice. Its judges will not sit on royal commissions, and should not sit on royal commissions. The last one who sat on a royal commission was a judge who presided over the Royal Commission into Communism-not the Petrov royal commission but the earlier one into communism. The very mention of the fact that that was the subject of the royal commission would, I think, convince you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is an undesirable situation in which to put a judge, because essentially he must come to conclusions, if he is to carry out his terms of reference and comply with them, about people's political activities, government and the functions of government, which are the proper province of elected governments and not the proper province of judges who are not elected but whose function is to resolve disputes between citizens impartially. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been very disturbing for me to see over the years the growing practice of governments asking judges to do their dirty work for them, because in substance that is what it is on many occasions. Governments ask judges to do this for them to give an air of respectability to their activities which would otherwise not be there. In other words, the commission or the government activity, even if it is a complete set-up from beginning to end, looks much more respectable when a judge presides over it than it would otherwise. The result-and this is the point of the whole thing-is that quite often it leads to an express or implied clash between governments and judges when judges take, as they are often forced to do, essentially political decisions. Therefore, the standing of the judiciary is diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the best illustration of that which is available to me at the moment is a charming report in the Melbourne Age of 25 September 1989 under the heading `Judge and minister clash over human rights record'. It is a report of some activities that took place at a Human Rights Congress in Melbourne at which Mr Justice Einfeld, the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, who is of course a judge of the Federal Court, made some contributions. He relieved himself of the observation that Australia's treatment of Aborigines had reached the proportions of genocide, if you please. Whether that is right or wrong, that is essentially a political judgment. It is not a judicial function to reach conclusions of that sort. He went on to say that the attitudes of many white Australians to the bulk of black Australians were `to put it simply, at least elitist if not racist'. Those are very strong words indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, said, in my view quite rightly, that those views expressed by Mr Justice Einfeld-a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, as well as being the President of this outfit-were distorted. I do not think it is appropriate, and it does not contribute much to the debate, for me or anyone else to go into some competition to assess who was right and who was wrong. I know where I would put my money, but the point about it is not so much that; the point is that we have a clash. As the headline says, `Judge and minister clash over human rights record'. Mr Justice Einfeld is being held out on this occasion not as President of the Human Rights Commission but as a judge. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unhealthy for our governmental system, the Federal Court and the judiciary in general to have that sort of slanging match going on between a judge and a Minister. It is doubly bad, of course, because the judge, having been appointed to this position, is virtually obliged to come down from the bench and get into hand to hand combat on these essentially political and judgmental matters which are the province of the Human Rights Commission and which are not the province of courts, including the court of which he is a member. That is a healthy illustration of this very unfortunate trend. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance-I make no criticism at all of any of the individuals involved, and I emphasise that-when we have Mr Justice Helsham involved in the Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests, thereafter one cannot but reflect on the fact that he was the judge who held that particular opinion or view about a contentious matter of the environment in this country, whether he is right or wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Stewart, who is still described as Mr Justice Stewart-hot from the National Crime Authority, now into the Resource Assessment Commission-presumably will be expressing views about the development of resources in this country, where there will be enormous controversy, debate and differences of opinion. I ask whether it is healthy for a judge to be involved in that sort of activity. I give the answer: no, it is not. It leads, in some extreme cases, to some very silly things being said. For instance, when it was announced the other day that Mr Justice Lee was to preside over the royal commission concerning a former police officer, Mr Blackburn, the ABC News said that a `prosecuting judge', Mr Justice Lee, was to preside over these proceedings. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that he would be unhappy with that description. One could go on all day about these things, but once we depart from sound basic principles, we get into trouble, in this area as in most other areas. Of course, governments do achieve their objectives by having judges preside over royal commissions, especially when it is the government itself which is in trouble, because if the government is cleared-and it may well be cleared because it is right on the facts and the merits-it can always say, when it is challenged, `Yes, but this conclusion was reached by a real live judge, so it must be right.' It might be right according to the judge, but it may also be wrong politically and a decision that is rejected by the people when they have a chance to vote on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I have made the point, without going on at length about it, but I come back to the basic point that judicial salaries should be high, in keeping with the sorts of principles we apply to all wage fixing these days-and, of course, there is contention about that. We are left with the conclusion that judicial salaries should be high. One of the consequences of that should be that judges remain as judges and that governments allow them to remain as judges and allow them to perform their proper judicial function. I take an example which might make the point clearer. No-one, to my knowledge, has ever cast the slightest aspersion over the Supreme Court of Victoria or its judges. One reason for that is that the court has always kept itself at arm's length from governments, royal commissions, tribunals, or any ramshackle outfits invented by governments to get themselves off the hook, to have an inquiry into things, to give an air of independence and objectivity about things. The Supreme Court of Victoria has never touched that, certainly not since 1949, and that is one reason why that court has never been the subject of any besmirchment or suggestion of impropriety in any shape or form, and I think that is a good thing. Unfortunately, when we have the practice of individual judges of the courts taking up quasi-political and quasi-government positions, the court from which the judge comes suffers because there is a reflection on the court, no matter what the judge does. I believe that the judiciary as a whole suffers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the Bill. We believe that there is a case for increasing salaries and allowances. Judges have been very concerned about their salaries; some of them have even approached members of parliament in airport lounges and such, saying, `It really is outrageous that our salaries are not increased.'. After I agree with them, I remind them that the salaries, before they were increased, were double our salaries. I remind them of that before they go off on their overnight stay on a higher allowance than we receive. Nevertheless, we come here voluntarily, knowing what the salary is, and we have to bear that. Judges cannot speak for themselves in public debate, and it must be said on their behalf that judicial salaries have, in the Federal sphere, fallen behind those in the State spheres, and fallen behind those that could reasonably be expected. I trust that the judges will be satisfied with this, at least for the time being, and that those receiving the salary increases will be happy that the Parliament has acknowledged that there is a case for bringing them up to the State levels and increasing those salaries. We support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) for yielding to me for these brief minutes. I refer to the comments of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), the esteemed shadow Attorney-General and Queen's Counsel, and point out to him that people can and do classify judges philosophically. When appointments are made to the High Court of Australia, people often make assessments that the new appointee is a centralist or federalist at heart. Whilst I believe that the members of the High Court make their judgments with integrity and honesty, they cannot shake off their basic direction of thinking; their thinking train is there. Governments often carefully select appointees to the High Court because they know that a certain individual thinks in a certain way, or they reject individuals on the same ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the case that the shadow Attorney-General made in relation to judges taking roles in royal commissions and the like, one of the great problems of governments is that people have little trust in governments of any political persuasion. I say to the honourable member for Menzies: whether it be the Liberal Party in power or the Labor Party in power, there is still a basic distrust of governments. I recognise the desirability of judges keeping away from controversy. However, there will be occasions when a person who is seen to have no particular axe to grind one way or the other can bring to a judgment not only respectability but also a degree of impartiality. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Liberal Party when in government appointed judges. I remember very clearly the royal commission that was held in 1978, during which I spent three or four days appearing under the torchlight of Mr Tom Hughes, QC, and others. Being questioned in that way was an experience I would not recommend to anybody as a pastime. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies is a lawyer, and I can well understand some of those judges sidling up to him in airports and other places. However, the point he did not make during his speech was that the Remuneration Tribunal recommended an 80 per cent increase in judges' salaries and, on review, that has now settled down to a level of 30 per cent. It must be to the chagrin of the pilots that this Parliament today is unanimously supporting a 30 per cent increase in salary for judges when at the same time the Government is saying no to the pilots. I do not intend to become political on this issue. The point is that, in comparison with the income of the better lawyers and barristers, judges' salaries are low. </PARA>
<PARA> Out there in the community lawyers and barristers with ability are saying, `Why would I want to become a judge for 100 grand or 120 grand a year when out here in the community I can earn, say, a quarter of a million dollars, half a million dollars or even more a year?'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever a sacrifice were made, it was made by the honourable member for Menzies, Neil Brown, QC, and the honourable member for North Sydney, John Spender, QC, who sit in this House on 55 grand a year. As the honourable member for Menzies said, he made that choice, as indeed do barristers or solicitors who accept the invitation to become judges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem confronting society today is that fewer and fewer people of great ability are willing to go onto the Bench. That situation can be corrected by increasing the salary levels of judges to put their salary levels closer to the level of income of successful lawyers and barristers. However, that approach does not come to grips with the problem that confronts the ordinary man. Unless one is a pensioner who is entitled to legal aid, unless one is a Christopher Skase of a week ago, a Bond of a couple of months ago, or a person who can charge legal costs up to a successful company, the price of justice today is beyond the ordinary person. It is beyond middle Australia. The middle Australian either has to be driven by a belief that he is prepared to lose everything in the pursuit of what he sees as justice or he has to walk away from the judicial system. It is a continuing crime that that is the way in which the pursuit of justice has been allowed not only to continue but also to accelerate over the years. That is why Queen's Counsel and barristers are earning huge six-figure sums and why, in comparison, the salaries of their brother judges are infinitely less than they could be earning outside. </PARA>
<PARA> Because I believe that this time next year the shadow Minister will be the Attorney-General, I make a plea to him to recognise that one of the greatest challenges facing governments today is to work to put justice back within the financial reach of the average Mr and Mrs Australia. At present, people who are either poor or rich can afford justice but it is outside the reach of the middle Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those observations only because this Bill is before the House. I repeat that the level of salary increase averages around 30 per cent, which is in line with the figure for another group at the moment. In reply to the shadow Minister's comment about why judges need additional allowances to those paid to politicians, I suggest that it is probably another way of getting around the problem that was alluded to. Giving them a little more on the side may make up some of the difference that exists between the remuneration of judges and that of their brothers at the Bar or even in private practice as solicitors in some instances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I should correct some of the figures that were mentioned by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron). He spoke about a 30 per cent salary increase for judges and linked that with the pilots' claim. If one looks at the figures one notes that, for instance, prior to this legislation, the Chief Justice of the High Court was receiving $134,000. His salary will rise to $160,000. On my quick calculations, that is more like 17 per cent, not 30 per cent. The present salary for judges of the Federal Court is $103,000, which will rise to $124,000, an increase of about 19 per cent. I believe that the honourable member for Moreton will find that his claim of a 30 per cent increase is not correct. In fact, we are talking about increases of between 17 per cent and 20 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) said, the Remuneration Tribunal originally recommended increases of 80 per cent, which certainly was not acceptable to this Government. The Government has a policy of wages restraint. It has current wage fixing guidelines within which it requires people to work. As members of parliament we have been bound to work within those guidelines. I know what that is like because, back in 1984, as a State member of parliament I was earning approximately $69,000 a year. Admittedly, I was the Leader of the Opposition. However, when I became a member of this House I was earning something like $43,000 a year. I believe that people have a misunderstanding about our salaries, and it is important to correct that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the point made by both speakers from the Opposition that there has been a need to sort out the remuneration for judges at the Federal level. A comparison of judges throughout the nation reveals that the Supreme Court judges of the various States have been giving the lead in high salaries. Regrettably, Queensland has certainly led the march. Whilst the remuneration for judges at the Federal level is now being lifted, I note that Queensland has again leapt ahead. To take up the point made by the honourable member for Menzies, if we are going to keep Federal judges in line with their State counterparts, we are going to have to raise their salaries again. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an important point here, namely, that we must attract the best legal minds to the Bench. I know that claims are made that being a judge has a particular status, that it has advantages outside dollars. However, we still need to ensure, when judges are appointed to the Federal Court, the Family Court, indeed, to any other court, that the best legal minds are appointed. When one considers the salaries that top silks earn at the Bar, one finds that they are earning in excess of $250,000 per year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the honourable member's point. I shall mention some of the other figures I have pulled out. Some of the senior partners in major legal firms in Sydney and Melbourne are earning $400,000 a year. Look at the senior executives of some firms. I know Mr Elliott has just increased his wages to $1.5m, but many of his middle management people are earning $200,000 and $300,000. Yet we are saying to the Chief Justice of this nation that he shall earn only $160,000. So something is wrong in those links and comparisons. Obviously we do not want remuneration to be a deterrent to judges, so this Bill is warranted. No-one likes to see major increases outside of what the ordinary people are getting, but it is certainly warranted here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take up another point made by the honourable member for Menzies. He questioned whether it was healthy for judges to be involved in social and community issues. I believe that is what he was saying. I take his point, bearing in mind the examples he gave, but I suggest that there are advantages in judges speaking out on issues. I recently came across a case that was brought to court by the Trade Practices Commission involving Gary Scott Stevenson. He was fined $68,000 for business practices that contravened the Trade Practices Act. He was one of those fellows involved in the blowing industry. For those who do not understand that, it involves advertising agencies, publishers and others sorting out deals on the telephone. They `blow' the person. They will ring up and make out that some firm has taken an advertisement. They will not ask whether the firm still wants the advertisement but instead use the smart tactic of reading through the advertisement they have, often taken out of the yellow pages. They will ask the young lass or whoever has answered the phone whether they have the correct spelling of the firm's name, whether they have the correct phone numbers and so on. They then proceed to print a magazine with that advertisement on it, sending the bill to that firm for an advertisement they have never authorised.</PARA>
<PARA> Gary Scott Stevenson has been involved in these types of practices. He was fined $68,000, but I doubt whether a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of one per cent of people in this country knew about it. Had the judge at the time made more of the fact that this fellow has rorted the system, that he was out there ripping off hundreds of small business people and had gathered himself tens of thousands of dollars in profit because of the unscrupulous practices that he was involved in, maybe we would not have these two publications I will refer to on the market today. I refer to the publications Design and Focus. Whilst I take the point of the honourable member for Menzies that there can be a question mark over statements made by judges when it comes to human rights and environmental issues because of the enormous status and weight given to their comments, I personally believe there is value in judges speaking out firmly on some of the matters that come before them. This fellow Stevenson ought to have been paraded in the media as the rogue that he is in the hope that no more business people would get caught. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some of the examples that I have here. These publications are produced by a group called Hilton Publications, sometimes flying under the name Esquire Publications. The address of Hilton Publications is 695 Burke Road, Camberwell, Victoria; the address of Esquire Publications is Forest Hill, Victoria. I note that the honourable member for Menzies is smiling. I hope that it is not in his electorate. Eight of these operations are owned by a fellow called Alex McKenzie. One of these magazines is called Focus, and it has on it that it is a journal of trade and industry. The one I have is volume 8, No. 2, of March 1989. The other one is Design, and it is said to be a journal of trade and commerce. The one I have is volume 8, No. 2, April 1989. These magazines charge $205-in one case $206, although that might have been a computer error-for small advertisements. They get eight advertisements to the A4 page. I have measured them; they are 8.5 centimetres by 6 centimetres. The publications contain 36 pages. But they are phoney magazines. For instance, whilst it is claimed that Focus is widely distributed among industry and commerce, departments and trade unions, when I rang Alex McKenzie he admitted that he produced only 1,000 to 1,500 copies. It is nothing more than a moneymaking rip-off. They are full of advertisements. There is page after page of advertisements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I remind the honourable member for Capricornia that we are discussing the Judicial and Statutory Officers Remuneration Legislation Amendment Bill and, whilst what he is saying is related to the issue before the House, I think we are getting a little too far away from the Bill. The honourable member might bear those comments in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek your forbearance on this, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point made by the honourable member for Menzies was a valuable one. It is a valid point that judges have to be extremely careful, but I am taking a countering position in this debate on the measure before the House because I believe, as I shall prove, there are times when judges ought to speak out. To demonstrate that to the House I need to present these examples. So, with your concurrence, I shall just proceed a little longer to demonstrate the problems with magazines such as Focus and Design. For instance. Focus has 36 pages but there are 19 1/4 pages of advertisements. Design also has 36 pages, and apart from the front page and the contents page there are 22 pages of advertisements. As I said, these are supposed to be journals of trade and commerce. In an issue I have here, nine of the last 11 pages are advertisements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But let us look at the articles to demonstrate why judges need to expose these operations. One article-remember that this is a trade and commerce magazine-is called `The Arrival of the First Fleet in the Great Southland'. What interest that would have to the leaders of trade and commerce I do not know. Another article is labelled `Speech Notes for National Farmers Federation President Mr Ian McLachlan addressing the Annual Conference of the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association-2nd May 1987'. But the article appeared in volume 8, No. 2, of April 1989. An article in Focus, which is a magazine for trade and industry, covers guidelines for the Australian driver new to driving in an unnamed Middle East country. Another one has no title and no author. Another is headed `Meteorological Co-operation in Europe'. The one that really got my attention is the final story in Design. It is headed `The Bushranging Days'. I would suggest that that is a most fitting story to appear in what has to be the best bushranging magazine that I have come across in a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> My point is that there is a need for these types of people to be exposed, and when we have a fellow like Gary Scott Stevenson coming before a judge and being fined $68,000 it is my personal opinion that whilst it can be unhealthy, as the honourable member for Menzies says, to get too involved in social and community issues there is a time and a place for judges to speak out. I see the need for judges to get tough not only in terms of penalties and fines that they impose but also in issuing public warnings. Hundreds of small business people right across this nation are getting caught up with these rogues, these bogus publishers, and the Trade Practices Commission can do little about it. As you would be aware, sir, if I were to say to anyone, `Here is a biro and I want $100,000 for it' and some person wanted to give me that, that is legal. If I said it had been used by the Duke of Edinburgh, that is a different matter. I would have misrepresented. These fellows simply produce magazines saying that they are journals of trade and commerce. There is little we can do about it unless we teach the community to beware. I believe there is a role for the judges to ensure that these types of people are exposed. They have a special role. Whilst it may be on an edge as to how far judges should go in what they say, I believe they ought to make comment, they ought to give public warnings, and in that way they will expose the rogues and the public will be warned. I believe that the community would be a far better place. </PARA>
<PARA> On the specific measures of the Bill, I believe that judges earn the money that we pay them. There is a need for Federal judges, who represent this nation in the courts, to be paid reasonable remuneration. It is an awkward situation for us to find that our Chief Justice, for instance, could be paid less than a Supreme Court judge in one of the States or a judge of the Federal Court. We will need to constantly monitor this position. Whilst maintaining the Government's wage restraints, we must ensure that low remuneration is not a deterrent to the best legal minds in this country going to the Bench. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no disagreement about the Judicial and Statutory Officers Remuneration Legislation Amendment Bill. Much has been said on the Bill with which I agree, so I shall confine myself to a few points. One of the points I wish to make is one that has not been made, and that is that the question of judges' salaries has been treated by this Government as a political football. Those words are not mine; they are the words of the Chief Justice, Sir Anthony Mason, used in an address on the state of the Australian judicature in August this year. In his address he pointed out the problems that the erosion of salaries had brought to judicial recruitment. He referred to the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal in 1988 to the effect that there should be an 80 per cent increase in judges' salaries, and to the Government's decision on that. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After the Tribunal made its initial recommendation last November, judicial salary increases became a political football. The media carried reports of negotiation between the Government and the A.C.T.U.-</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian Council of Trade Unions!-</PARA>
<PARA> What has happened in relation to the handling of judicial salaries may have encouraged others; it did nothing to encourage the judges. The unhappy story is not calculated to inspire the Australian Judiciary with confidence in the present procedures for determining judicial remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Sir Anthony Mason said. I remind the House that about a year or so later after the first determination we are now dealing with something which should have been dealt with urgently because the erosion in judges' salaries has directly affected the capacity to recruit to the Bench and the capacity to keep judges on the Bench. That is a point that is made also by Sir Ninian Stephen, himself a former justice of the High Court of Australia. Earlier this year when he spoke of the evil of the erosion of judicial salaries he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The evil of this erosion of judicial salaries will continue as a threat to judicial independence so long as sporadic and partial correction of the process of erosion is left to depend upon the very arms of government of which the judiciary should be independent-it being dependent upon the executive for effective initiation and upon the legislature for implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>What have we had here? We had the Remuneration Tribunal making a recommendation. That was not accepted by the Executive of this Government. Why was it not accepted? It was not accepted because it did not fit in with the accord and with the ACTU. We have the grotesque situation of the matter then getting into the hands of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) as though what we had with the original determination by the Remuneration Tribunal was an ambit claim made by the airline pilots. In fact, it was a determination which pointed out that there had been a substantial erosion of judges' salaries over the years and that there were good reasons for increasing those salaries. Amongst other things it pointed to the greater complexity of work in courts these days-something that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) would know something about, as do I. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a Bill a year later to increase the salaries to the levels that have been referred to. In the meantime it is paradoxical to note that the New South Wales Government recruited to the position of Independent Commissioner Against Corruption a lawyer who is to be paid far more than the Chief Justice of this country. He is to be paid $175,000. It is no wonder that it is difficult to recruit at all levels, State and Federal, to the judiciary. If we speak to people whose job it is to recruit we will know just how hard it is. I do not think that the levels should be back to the levels they were at the time the High Court was first formed. In those days a justice of the High Court got #3,000, which was somewhere around 80 times average weekly earnings, and in those days politicians got about #400, which was somewhere around 10 times average weekly earnings. We have all, for various reasons, gone backwards. No doubt, that is perfectly right. However, given the level of salaries in other areas such as in legal firms, given the very large amounts that can be made at the Bar when a good Queen's Counsel-not an outstanding Queen's Counsel, not one of the high fliers-can earn around $500,000 a year, it is not surprising that it is difficult to recruit. It is imperative that we get the best people for the Bench. The reason for that is simple: the quality of justice depends on the quality of the judiciary and unless we get the best lawyers going onto the Bench the quality of justice will suffer and that means individuals suffer, because individuals are the people who make up the great bulk of the work that goes before courts, not vast corporations although they have their very big cases. The daily grind of litigation is made up of individual Australians trying to get justice out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take up something that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) said when he spoke about the high price of justice. He is, of course, perfectly right. It was once said that justice is open to everyone like the doors of the Ritz Hotel in London. We thought that with legal aid and with more modern means of dealing with cases those days were behind us. In fact, they are not. I have one piece of advice to give to anybody who is thinking of litigating and who is not very wealthy or backed by a very wealthy organisation: `Do not litigate. You cannot afford it'. To go to court these days for a case involving, for example, $100,000 or $200,000 may cost you on your side alone daily legal fees-paid up front, not after the event-of $5,000 to $8,000. For a case that goes for five days, as a not too complex case over a contract could easily go, the figures are obvious. It does not pay to litigate. It can be a terrifying experience to be caught up in the system because if one is an average person who is borne down by the cost of litigation one is also ground down by the delays of the courts. In this country we have a system of justice which is limping along and which denies entry to the average Australian because the average Australian, unless backed by a wealthy organisation or fortunate enough to get legal aid, cannot afford the price of entry. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with what the honourable member for Menzies said on the subject of royal commissions. On this different subject I point to the procedure that is involved in royal commissions. A commissioner is appointed. His terms of reference are given to him. He discharges his terms of reference through hearings, through the examination of evidence and through listening to submissions and arriving at a decision. That decision is recorded characteristically in a lengthy report which is brought back to Parliament. If it is a subject of political concern, it is debated here. We have had those debates in this chamber where judges have been criticised because they came to a decision which was politically unpopular. That is the point the honourable member for Menzies makes. It is a very important one because judges then get brought in, whether they like it or not, to the political arena. As that happens, so their authority and independence is devalued. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be cases of a completely non-political kind-for example, an inquiry into a criminal matter where it is thought that justice was not originally done-where it might be appropriate to have a judge conduct the inquiry. I have my doubts about that because there are many practising lawyers who could do it. But, save for those very special cases, judges should stay completely outside areas of the kind the honourable member for Menzies referred to. He mentioned Mr Justice Einfeld speaking about genocide. The truth is that a judge is no better qualified and is sometimes less well qualified, because of the constrained way in which he must live as a judge, to make social judgments and these value judgments than are other people. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been made plain, we support what has been said. We support the increases of judges' salaries. I welcome the fact that a determination is now going to be made rather than a recommendation, so that it will then be up to Parliament to disallow a determination made by the Remuneration Tribunal. If we are going to have a system of justice in this country that we can be proud of, we need to have the best quality lawyers as judges, with that additional and essential ingredient of humility and concern for justice. We need to have a system that the ordinary Australian can enter without fear that costs and time and the wear of being involved in the judicial process will be destructive of his life. At the moment we do not have that system. </PARA>

I welcome the support of the Opposition for the Judicial and Statutory Officers Remuneration Legislation Amendment Bill. I welcome the support that has been indicated for the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the House will be aware, the Bill implements increases in remuneration for the members of the Federal judiciary. The Government rejected substantial salary increases recommended for the Federal judiciary in the Remuneration Tribunal's 1988 review. At that time the Government asked the members of the Tribunal to prepare a special report on appropriate remuneration for the judiciary in the current wage fixing context. The report recommended that an inequity in remuneration between Federal and State court judges be rectified by the granting of a 16 per cent increase, that the August 1988 national wage increases of 3 per cent and $10 a week be applied, and that expenses of office allowance be absorbed into salaries. The Government announced on 13 July this year its acceptance of those recommendations and its intention to legislate to implement them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill adjusts travelling allowances in accordance with the recommendations in the 1988 review. The increases in the remuneration are to apply from 1 March 1989, consistent with the Tribunal's special report. The Bill also implements the Government's decision to equate the remuneration of judges of the Family Court with that of the Federal Court. There is no longer any justification for them to be paid lower levels of remuneration, especially as the Federal Court is now able to refer certain matters to the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal will be empowered in the future to determine judicial remuneration rather than make recommendations, as at present, in respect of judges and judicial officeholders. This will bring the setting of judicial remuneration into line with the setting of remuneration for all other officers within the Tribunal's jurisdiction except Ministers. As is the case for these other officers, determinations will be subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament. I have asked the members of the Tribunal to undertake a further examination of judicial salaries in light of the August 1989 national wage case decision. This review will also assess the appropriateness of the relativities of remuneration between Federal Court judges and a number of statutory officeholders. </PARA>
<PARA> To respond to a few of the matters raised by honourable members who participated in the debate, a question was raised about the level of increases for judges being proposed by the Government and supported by this House compared with the claim by the pilots for a 30 per cent wage increase without any productivity improvement and without any acceptance of arbitration or undertaking to work within the national wage case guidelines. The increases in the judicial remuneration were recommended by the members of an independent tribunal and are consistent with national wage case principles. It is against these principles that claims for wage increases for members of the general work force are assessed. The national wage principles provide for the resolution of inequities existing where employees performing similar work are paid dissimilar rates of pay without good reason. That was the anomalies and inequities proposal that was put, in addition to the other national wage increase factors, in respect of the increases now being legislated for the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the pilots have sought to pursue their claims ouside the framework of the independent Industrial Relations Commission. If the pilots believe that they have a genuine claim, they could have pursued that claim within the Commission and have it tested against the national wage fixing principles. The fact is that they have resolutely refused to accept arbitration or to work within the national wage case guidelines, as do almost all other wage and salary earners in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) raised the problem of attracting suitable counsel to the judiciary. The increases that are being provided will go some way towards attracting suitable counsel to the judiciary. The increases that are being provided will go some way towards attracting the best possible people to the Bench and to retaining those people. On the whole, the increases are fairly substantial. The balance between the need for continued restraint and the maintenance of adequate salaries for the Federal judiciary will be kept under review by the Remuneration Tribunal. As I mentioned earlier, a further examination of judicial remuneration will be undertaken by the Tribunal in light of the August 1989 national wage case decision. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not tenable for judicial remuneration to be raised to the level received by many senior members of the Bar, as pointed out by the honourable member for Menzies; nor is it necessary to do so as remuneration is but one factor relevant to those who seek judicial office. Nevertheless, the increases resulting from this Bill will assist in narrowing the gap. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by bringing to the attention of the House the fact that since the Bill was introduced I have received constitutional advice which has necessitated amendments to the Bill. I have also taken the opportunity to make some other technical amendments. I will be dealing with those matters at the committee stage. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of the three pieces of legislation being debated cognately, the first listed is the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989. Essentially it deals with the measures which will require major employers to remit pay as you earn (PAYE) tax deductions twice each month instead of monthly, as occurs at present. Changes to the conditions under which quarterly provisional tax payments are to be made are also included in the Bill. The second Bill being debated is the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 which deals with the rates applicable to various classes of income tax payer. The third Bill under discussion is the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989. Each of the Bills reflects the stated intention of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) at the time he brought down his 1989 Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not my intention to speak at length on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989, as I have raised this matter in the Parliament previously. It is regrettable that this amendment will do nothing to stop the grossing up effect on franked dividend income. To enable a better understanding of that effect it might be useful to give a simple example. As it now stands, and this has been the case since company tax imputation was adopted, a fully franked dividend of, say, $61 generates a Medicare levy impost of $1.25, or 2.049 per cent. From that illustration it can be seen that the Medicare levy is far in excess of what is commonly supposed when it comes to collections of franked dividend income. In effect, large sums are being reefed from shareholders by this Government under a pretext. Apparently, that sort of cheating by the Government is quite acceptable. One can imagine the outrage that would be expressed if it worked the other way, and that under some pretext a large body of taxpayers were able to escape their obligation to pay all or part of a tax impost. That is just one example among many of the double standards adopted by the Government and its Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 we see further evidence, if further evidence were needed, of the Government's determination to reap tax benefits as a result of its economic and fiscal mismanagement. Although it might be argued that tax relief, whenever granted and by whatever means achieved, is acceptable, there is much more to these measures than that simplistic proposition. It is necessary to recall the revenue raising and expenditure record of the previous coalition Government as it stood in the year in which it lost office and compare it to Labor's record in government. This comparison is encapsulated in the table which I now seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. It is a table extracted from the publication entitled The Taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. By the end of this financial year, after a mere seven years in government, total taxation revenue will have increased from $40.7 billion to $91.3 billion. The table clearly shows that revenue to this grasping Government has soared by a massive 123 per cent over the period of its term in office while inflation as measured by the consumer price index is likely to be in the vicinity of only 85 per cent. Exploitation of Australian taxpayers under this Labor regime by any measure has exploded. Is it any wonder that at long last a sizeable surplus is now possible?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any reasonable examination of the table brings into stark relief the consequences of inflation and associated bracket creep, even if new taxes introduced over the last seven years are eliminated from consideration for the purpose of this debate. Of course, new taxes cannot, and should not, be ignored when any examination of Labor's overall taxation record is made. To do so would be to ignore over $6.5 billion in revenue raised from new tax measures alone. Making up that mammoth impost wrought by new taxes-not increases, but new taxes-are estimated collections for the current year from the capital gains tax, the Medicare levy, the prescribed payments system, superannuation funds and fringe benefits taxes. But it is the deliberating effects of bracket creep which is worthy of special comment, given that the Bill is all about giving a fraction of the tax relief possible, if the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer had not gorged themselves on the manna extorted from Australian taxpayers by deliberately inflationary and inept fiscal management. Even so, over half of that, which would have been collected this year if tax scales and rates had remained unchanged, will be recovered as a result of wage and salary inflation and its effects in this financial year alone. That is apart from the massive amounts of additional tax paid by all taxpayers over the last six years. There will be no relief from that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's message is quite clear: we can kiss that goodbye. What is more, taxpayers can kiss about half of this year's tax cuts goodbye too, because bracket creep, which forces taxpayers to pay higher marginal rates on extra dollars earned, will mean that even more hard earned income will find its way into the already well-lined pockets of this Government. The Government will slug people even more by way of indexed excise levied on petrol and other things. It is a sad truth that these tax measures will not lead to sustainable improvements in living standards because of the effects of high interest rates, continuing high taxation and inflation. Sadly, the opposite will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the unmitigated greed of the present Government, the coalition parties intend to redistribute additional revenue gained from the consequences of inflation in the form of bracket creep back to taxpayers once the quantum is identified. We will do this on election to government because the taxpayers of Australia need a break from the endless grind of more and more taxation and less and less reward for effort. </PARA>
<PARA> In turning now to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, I remind the House that it deals with two major areas: the twice-monthly remittance of PAYE deductions and measures to do with provisional tax. The pay as you earn requirements will compel group employers with a history of annual remittances exceeding $5m to remit sums deducted from wages, salaries, commissions and the like twice each month instead of only once, as at present, and all employers with annual remittances of less than $5m. For those affected deductions made during the first 14 days of any month will be remitted not later than the twenty-first day of the same month. Deductions made from the fifteenth day of any month will have to be paid no later than the seventh day of the succeeding month. </PARA>
<PARA> For employers, the unpaid tax collectors of the Commonwealth, this will considerably erode cash flows. That will not be of any concern to the Treasurer; after all, in his Budget Speech, when discussing outrageous proposals to advance collection of company taxes even before the companies know the extent of profitability, he said that companies presently enjoy `an interest free loan from the Government' because they had not previously been required to pay 85 per cent of notional tax commencing within a couple of weeks of the end of a financial year. That is a measure of both the ignorance and arrogance of the Treasurer. So it is that he will not have considered the implications for affected employers required to remit PAYE deductions bimonthly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer and others in the Government would not be aware-or, if they are, could not care less-that most cash flow projections are based on monthly cycles. Affected employers have not received payment for the wage and salary component in goods and services sold to clients under present arrangements, let alone under those to be required. The significance for cash flows is that employers will be reduced to working to a fortnightly cycle complicated by the fact that pay days under the first and new requirement will fall on any date between the first and fourteenth day of that month. Although the unpaid tax collecting employer will know that tax will have to be remitted before the twenty-first, the amount cannot be anticipated. This uncertainty is already present with monthly remittances; it will be exacerbated by the twice-monthly requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again higher administrative costs to employers will be incurred at the mere whim of a Labor government. The costs of administration to be met by the Australian Taxation Office will also be increased. The Taxation Office will have to allocate resources and funds to police the change. When remittances are not received by the due date, follow-up will be necessary and decisions will have to be taken about the need to levy penalties. Presumably that will occur only after notices have been given or inquiries made or both. Yet there is no estimate of this increased cost to the Australian Taxation Office in the explanatory memorandum. There can be no doubt that there will be additional administrative costs to the Australian Taxation Office, yet this Government, which, when in opposition, made great play of calling for cost impact statements and which has welshed increasingly on the principle as it grows tired in government, does not even bother to tell us what the additional administration cost will be. The Government probably does not even know. </PARA>
<PARA> On its own, that might be just another example of the tiredness or laziness, if you like, of the Government. However, if we look elsewhere in the explanatory memorandum we see that the Government claims as a virtue for these measures that in one case public debt interest will be $20m less this financial year. There is some reason to doubt that figure if only because it appears to be exactly offset by interest to be incurred as a consequence of reductions in revenue expected not to be collected following one of the changes to provisional taxes. One measure is expected to reduce public debt interest by $20m this year and the other to increase it by the same amount. That appears to be too much of a coincidence. It is more likely to be the product of some creative accounting by the Government. If it is not, I will welcome the opportunity to retract if the Government tables its calculations and they are found to be reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime the claimed or estimated public debt interest component in the financial impact statement at the top of page 2 in the explanatory memorandum continues to intrigue. Remember that the financial impact statement on this occasion not only is about additional revenue or less revenue but also includes movements in the public debt interest which, because of changed public service borrowing requirements, will either fall or increase because additional or less revenue is collected as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to focus on the interest component as a separate and identified part of the projected financial impact. The financial impact statement sets out a reduction of $160m in revenue anticipated as a result of the uplift factor for the calculation of provisional tax in 1989-90, but no public debt interest figure is given. The financial impact statement does not represent the product of a tired, lazy government; it represents blatant deceit. For the year 1989-90 the gain to revenue from twice-monthly PAYE remittances is given as $550m, enabling a $20m reduction of public debt interest. When it comes to changes to payment of provisional taxes, we are not even given an estimate of how much less revenue will ensue. It will be less because we are told that the public debt interest for 1989 will as a result increase by $20m. If expressed in commercial terms, the effects of the first two changes in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 are in one case an additional $550m principal, accompanied by a saving of $20m interest, and in the second case, where we are not told the amount of principal although principal there must be, interest on that unknown amount will be an additional $20m. </PARA>
<PARA> The third measure in this Bill which will have notable financial impact and which is included also in the financial impact statement concerns provisional tax too. By reducing the amount to be added onto the assessable income of taxpayers subjected to provisional tax to 10 per cent from the present 11 or 12 per cent, the explanatory memorandum only stipulates an estimated reduction in revenue to be collected of some $160m in 1989-90. Using the formula adopted for the other and previous measures in the same Bill, there should be an estimate of the additional public debt interest. There is not. </PARA>
<PARA> So we are grappling with treble standards, not double standards. In the first case the effects on the revenue and public debt interest are given; in the second case only the effect on public debt interest is given; and in the third case only the effect on revenue is given. What sort of madness is that? This from a Treasurer who offers himself as an authority on the costings of the coalition parties' policies yet cannot get those flowing from his own legislation right, even with the vast resources of government at his command. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the financial impact statement and the other two Bills that are being debated cognately, namely, the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989, which all appear on the same page of the explanatory memorandum, listed one after another, but to which different criteria are applied. I will deal first with the Medicare changes, because they are comparatively insignificant. Revenue will be reduced by $10m, but no estimate is given of the ensuing increase in public debt interest. The daddy of them all has to do with the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2). That Bill makes changes which, we have been told on other occasions, will reduce revenue by up to $4.9 billion. That was not a slip of the tongue-$4.9 billion. That sum is not even mentioned in the financial impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have thought that the Treasurer and his Government would make sure that the Government's changes to the rates of income on which personal income tax is to be paid would be shouted loud and wide. That is very strange indeed. As Professor Julius Sumner Miller used to ask: Why is it so? Why, indeed. Could it be that, because public debt interest was quoted as part of the financial impact flowing from another Bill cognately under consideration, the estimated reduction in revenue to be collected would have to be accompanied by a concomitant figure for increased public debt interest, in order to be consistent? If the estimated reduction of up to $4.9 billion was subjected to the same test, that is, increased public debt interest calculated on the amount by which the revenue is to be reduced, a very handsome sum indeed would have to be included in the financial impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA> To make an intelligent assessment of what it might be, perhaps we should look at the first item in the accompanying financial impact statement, at the top of page 2 of the memorandum. A figure of $550m is cited as producing a change of $20m to public debt interest. If that $550m is multiplied by nine, one arrives at a figure close to the $4.9 billion mentioned. On that admittedly imprecise approach, the increase in public debt interest this year would approximate $180m. There you have it. That is another example of this Government's mad, twisted thinking-and brought about by what? It is brought about, it seems, by the selective citing in financial impact statements of a public debt interest factor applied to separate, but selected, outcomes. If a public debt interest factor is appropriate in one case, it is also relevant to all legislation, not just that chosen for special treatment. Think of the possibilities. Each and every piece of legislation brought before the Parliament which varies either expenditure or revenue has some financial impact which, if the Government lives up to its rhetoric, should properly be estimated in the accompanying explanatory memorandum. That is all that is reasonably expected. Sadly, it is not always done. </PARA>
<PARA> To go one illogical step further, because either revenue is to be less or expenditure higher, or alternatively, more revenue is to be raised or expenditure reduced, ensuing public debt interest becomes part of the equation. Although not all of it is to be the subject of legislation, but given that expenditure this year is estimated to increase by $4.625 billion, my strong recommendation to the Government is to forget this nonsense. All that is required in a financial impact statement is the net difference between the prime increase or reduction measured against what applied previously-nothing more, nothing less. We know that the Government has placed us in hock up to our eyeballs and that, because of that, less revenue or higher expenditure means the Government will have to dip into taxpayers' pockets even more to pay the interest bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I return now to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 and its provisions which relate to provisional tax. These amendments are incomprehensible. Most tax specialists would not be practising solely in the provisional tax area and most practitioners who advise on provisional tax will be quite unable to read these amendments. For example, look at paragraph 221 ycaa (1) (b) at the top of page 8 of the Bill. Bearing in mind the continued rhetoric of the Government and the thoroughly supportable call for more legible law, it is not appropriate to release more in this form without also providing very detailed accompanying examples, and perhaps even software packages, to assist in the application of the law. The capacity for the average tax agent to misapply this law will be very significant indeed. These changes to provisional taxes, to the extent that they are welcome, still leave much to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, there will be little consolation for a widow who lives in my electorate. She is living on income from $300,000 capital invested. Last year, the interest on that investment earned her $38,000. However, her total tax liability is $24,330. </PARA>

The end result is that the 63-year-old widow, whose financial circumstances I have outlined, will probably be unable to keep her capital intact, because this year at least she will have to make do with $13,000.

<PARA> I now move to the amendment which has been circulated in my name. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that the Government's record high tax burden has inflicted considerable pain on Australians, who face little incentive to work, to invest and to save.'. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to that amendment, I turn again to the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989. Although we in the coalition parties recognise the need for tax relief, we have also consistently maintained that unfunded tax cuts are irresponsible. They undoubtedly and measurably fuel demand. That is readily evidenced by data published on economic activity in recent months. Despite the current record high interest rates, data shows that import growth, employment and retail sales continued to grow. In short, the unfunded tax cuts have sabotaged the Government's only policy response to our chronic economic problems. That response is high interest rates. Australians continue to suffer under high interest rates while they receive some short-lived relief in the form of unfunded tax cuts which are quickly chewed up by high interest rates and inflation. Despite these tax cuts, the Government remains the highest taxing government in postwar history, and I refer the House to the table that I have already had incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the Government's policy of unfunded tax cuts, the Opposition's recently released Economic Action Plan includes funded tax relief aimed specifically at families. Working families have borne the brunt of the burden of the Government's economic mismanagement. They have been ignored for too long. The Opposition's tax initiatives recognise the additional costs facing taxpayers with children and the costs facing working parents in terms of child-care. We have also eased the income testing of the dependent spouse rebate to enable dependent spouses to earn income without being subjected to extreme penalties. In stark contrast to the Government's policy, our tax relief measures are fully funded by expenditure cuts. The result is that the Opposition has a tighter fiscal policy than the Government. We have outlays to gross domestic product scheduled to be at the lowest level for 25 years and the largest Budget surplus since comparable measures have been kept. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment I have moved is also relevant to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989. The changes to PAYE remittances will have the effect of bringing forward revenue from 1990-91 to 1989-90. We have described this-quite properly, in my view-as an example of the Treasurer's `innovative accounting', designed to magnify the size of the Budget surplus in this financial year. These changes mean that large businesses are being penalised to obtain an apparent increase in the Government's surplus. However, the Government's stated objective of reducing the frequency of PAYE remittances from small businesses is welcomed, as it has been a source of continuing concern to the small business community and should result in more financial flexibility for these enterprises. I commend the amendment to the House in the terms expressed. </PARA>

The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said a lot about the Economic Action Plan document and what it means for the future and families. He said a lot about the taxation system. He said that a coalition government would repeal many of the initiatives enacted by the Government. I will turn to those matters in a moment. First I want to remind the House, briefly, of a couple of the issues that have been raised in the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989 deals with the twice-monthly remittance of pay as you earn (PAYE) tax instalment deductions, quarterly provisional tax and provisional tax itself. The Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) deals with the income tax rates for the 1989-90 financial year and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989 imposes the Medicare levy for 1989-90. With respect to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, the Government has considered the options and has determined that the twice-monthly PAYE remittance is an appropriate amendment to the policy settings that the Government has on the collection of tax. The honourable member for Curtin said that the Government has provided little tax relief. Because PAYE taxpayers are the ones most affected by the measures before us, let me remind the honourable member what the Government has done in terms of tax relief. In 1983 the mob on the other side was in government. When the former Government lost office this country was left with a top marginal tax rate of 60c in the dollar and a bottom marginal tax rate of about 30c in the dollar. Under this Government the top marginal rate is going to be 47c and the bottom marginal rate 21c. Those are just the marginal tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, the stark differences between the philosophies of honourable members on this side of the House and those of honourable members opposite are more aptly demonstrated by the Government's commitment to removing the rorts in the system that have operated for so long and, additionally, to seek some advantage for the people of Australia-ordinary PAYE taxpayers-who do not play the share markets and get major capital gains and who do not have free lunches and big cars being driven around for them by chauffeurs. The fringe benefits tax was able to fix that up. We recognised the need to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we seen with economic action man on the other side with the Economic Action Plan? He has walked away from the fringe benefits tax. Under his policy it will stay. What about the capital gains tax? Do honourable members remember that well-worn phrase, `lock, stock and barrel'? It is not a firm of solicitors and it is long gone because the capital gains tax is also retained in this Economic Action Plan from the economic action man opposite. Where is there any reference in that document and in the contribution of the honourable member for Curtin to the major problems facing the economy-that is, the debt and interest rates? They are not mentioned in the Economic Action Plan. The Opposition's non-consideration, non-mention and non-determination in the Economic Action Plan document of any alternatives is tantamount to endorsing this Government's economic policies. As I said when it was released, the document is an absolute sham. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us talk about PAYE taxpayers-those people who have tax taken out of their pay because they are part of a fair and equitable system. My honourable friend from Curtin said that there has been no tax relief for those poor people and that this miserable Government has increased its tax over a long period. I agree with him that revenue collected by the Government from PAYE taxpayers particularly has increased. It has increased because an additional 1.6 million people have a job and are now paying income tax, many for the first time ever. Since this Government came to office in 1983 an additional 1.6 million people have a job. Who could ever forget the 750,000 people-I think that was the number-who were consigned to the unemployment scrap heap in the last 12 months of the former Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Who was the economic adviser back then who told the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) what he should do? It was none other than the present shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the person who has developed some new-found sympathy for PAYE taxpayers. He is the person who drives a Ferrari, has a restaurant in Sydney, has bought property in Bowral and is looking to buy something in Canberra. He now has new-found sympathy for PAYE taxpayers. He sends people in here today, because he has not an opportunity to do so, to try to convince the people of Australia that the Opposition's policy is to offer them tax relief-a flatter, two-tiered system. When asked what it means the honourable member for Wentworth says, `We will tell you when we get into government. Trust us'. We trusted those opposite in 1983 and the people of Australia trusted them before that. What did they get for their trust? They got 10.5 per cent unemployment and an inflation rate of 10 per cent-plus. Many millions of people were put out of work and the Medicare system did not exist. Two million people were not covered by any form of health insurance. One of the Bills before us today seeks to fix the Medicare levy for 1989-90. </PARA>

When asked who will cover those people who, in the past, were unable to insure themselves, the Opposition says, `Don't worry about it. Trust us. We will look after those people'. We heard that before and nothing came from it. When the honourable member for Wentworth looked after the Opposition's economic policies, as an adviser, he had a miserable record.

He is the sort of struggling battler out there-he would not know a PAYE taxpayer if he fell over one-who will benefit from these policies. The honourable member for Curtin made comments about taking money back because other charges have been levied. I have already referred to the tax scales that will operate as a result of the legislation before us. Let me give some examples a bit closer to home. In New South Wales, we have the mates of the Opposition-a Liberal coalition-in government. In May this year, when consideration was given to the wage-tax trade-off and its subsequent implementation on 1 July, this Government clearly identified tax and wage concessions to the workers of Australia, the PAYE taxpayers. What did the Liberal Party and its friends in the National Party in New South Wales do? They put up charges for gas and electricity. They introduced an $80 levy to clean up the mess of Sydney's beach pollution, which was imposed on the people around New South Wales who did not contribute to it anyway. In one fell swoop, the Liberals and their friends in New South Wales, who were given tax relief and wage increases by this Government, through a responsible system under the accord, have taken them back; totally wiped them out. These are the people who say that they are concerned about the families, about the PAYE taxpayers, and about giving them a fair deal. The sham of what is in the Economic Action Plan has been quickly seen through by the people whom the Opposition thought it would affect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the basic things the Government has done, which cannot be ridiculed or faulted, is the creation of 1.5 million or 1.6 million new jobs. Surely the greatest benefit for any family is to have somebody in a job, but, no, that is not what the Opposition is about. It is about watering down the capital gains tax and giving back a little bit more to the people who play the stock markets. Except for the crash two years ago and the recent hiccup, the people who play the stock markets have not done too badly out of it. But the Opposition says that we should not worry about them, those who are the haves, giving and redistributing down the line. In this country we have a clear and concise differentiation between the policies of the Government and its philosophical underpinnings, and those of the Opposition. As usual, the Opposition is looking after the rich people, not worrying about redistributing down, because under its policy it will redistribute revenue back up. </PARA>

The attitude is, `We will bring them back into line, kick them to death, and take it from there.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin talked about the highest taxing, biggest spending government argument that the Opposition always runs, but he avoided mentioning that Australia is the fourth lowest taxing country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); fourth out of 23. Why do honourable members opposite not tell that to the people of Australia? Why do they not say that compared to all the Western nations about which they like to talk when they mention inflation rates and trading partners Australia has the fourth lowest taxing regime of any OECD country? Why do they never get up and be honest with the people of Australia? Because they know it is true. As far as the Opposition is concerned it is the old adage of never let the facts get in the way of a good story. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills before the House this afternoon for consideration go to the very heart and essence of what the Government is concerned about. It is concerned about fairness, equity and the redistribution of income, so that everybody has a fair and reasonable standard of living. It does not give electoral bribes. The Government is concerned to ensure that the existing legislation is fixed where necessary. If there is a need to review income tax rates or Medicare levies from time to time, the Government does so. As has been pointed out, in the case of income tax marginal rates we have reviewed but we have reviewed them downwards. The Medicare levy has been stable since 1986 and it is picking up people who were never covered by any form of health insurance. The hidden agenda for the Opposition is to scrap Medicare and go back into the private world. It will privatise child-care or anything else it can get its hands on to make a profit, a one-off fire sale as usual that achieves very little. The Opposition has a hidden agenda, and the people should recognise that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on at length about these Bills and point out again the contrast between the Government and what has been proposed by the action man in the Economic Action Plan. It is absolute nonsense and the people of Australia have seen through it. The legislation before us deals with PAYE tax and provisional tax, as well as setting the rates for income tax collections this year, and the Medicare levy amendment. They are all worthy of support. The Government rejects the Opposition's amendment, and I commend each and every one of the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill, the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill propose changes to our income tax system. Unfortunately, each of the Bills provides only cosmetic changes to an increasingly complex and burdensome system. It is burdensome not only in the financial liabilities it imposes on individuals and families but also in its administrative requirements. Evidence of this administrative maze was really confirmed by the Commissioner of Taxation in a speech he gave on 26 May this year to the Australian Society of Accountants, when he noted that 65 to 70 per cent of income tax returns are lodged by tax agents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So complex has the system become that an increasing number of average Australians find it necessary, in order that they can be charged only the appropriate level of taxation, to pay a fee to have their tax return completed. There was a day when the system was simpler and many people were able, with confidence, to complete their own tax returns, knowing that they were paying what was due and were not being charged any more than was their fair liability. It is time for reform. Despite all the protestations of the Treasurer and the henchmen behind him, the reform has not been completed. Many of the actions of the present Government have caused problems and brought about the need for real reform. We must restore incentives for Australians to work harder and to exercise initiative and enterprise. This can be done only by abolishing the current five-step income tax system and introducing a flatter, simpler system such as the two-step rates structure that the next Liberal-National Party government is committed to introduce in its first term in government. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr WILSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an interesting matter, and I will come to that question later in my speech. We have indicated that we will not go on doing each year what the honourable member's Government has done every year, which is to take more in real terms from individual taxpayers because of the effect of bracket creep. Every now and again the Government gives back some bracket creep, in an ad hoc way, but in fact it fails to fully return bracket creep to Australian taxpayers. To begin with, we should determine how the cost of government should be shared amongst Australian taxpayers. Most Australians would agree that tax should be shared according to the principle of capacity to pay. How then does one measure a taxpayer's capacity to pay?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the present Government, capacity to pay is determined by the level of a taxpayer's income and by that test alone. Inadequate allowance is made for the cost that is borne by taxpayers of supporting dependants, whether the dependants are their spouses, children, adult student children, other family members, or even friends. The relief that is now available is much less than that provided to those who are dependent upon the public sector. Similarly, tax liability is not adjusted to allow for the costs of taxpayers who discharge their own or their dependants' social expenditures, which would otherwise be discharged by the public sector. For example, taxpayers who choose to educate their children at an independent school face a double cost of educating their own children and paying part of the cost of educating other people's children in the state system. The same double cost is imposed on taxpayers who choose to take out private health insurance or to provide a retirement income for themselves or for their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> If tax liability is truly to reflect the principle of capacity to pay, it must be adjusted to adequately compensate for the cost of maintaining dependants and the cost of undertaking private social expenditure which, if not undertaken privately, would be borne by the general body of taxpayers. That adjustment could be achieved by making tax credits available to those taxpayers. The amount of the tax credit should be equivalent to the cost that would otherwise have been borne by the public sector. For example, taxpayers who support dependent children should receive tax credits that are equal to the allowance that is received by children who are dependent upon the public sector. Taxpayers who educate their children in the private education system should receive a tax credit that is equal to the public sector cost of educating those same children. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic and tax policy of the Liberal and National parties, which was released earlier this month, outlines a series of child tax rebates that recognise the increased costs to families of bringing up children. Those tax rebates are a step in the right direction towards achieving a capacity to pay tax system. I would like to see a future Liberal-National Party government merge all payments for children into a single tax rebate or tax credit that would be cashable by the principal carer of the children to the extent that it would not be utilised in exempting that care-giver from tax that would otherwise be payable. In the long run, I would like those rebates or credits to be increased to the amount of government support for children who are dependent upon the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, family allowances are regarded by many people as a welfare expenditure. Paid to some, they are truly categorised and correctly categorised as such. However, for the majority they are wrongly categorised, being treated as welfare payments. In the majority of cases, either the tax liability of the recipient of the allowances or the tax liability of her family is greater than the family allowance that she receives. That is an example of the lack of integration between our social security system and our tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The social security system should be divided into two different sections: the one that pays out truly welfare payments, and the other that makes allowances to people who themselves or through their families pay tax that is greater than the allowance that they receive. Indeed, if one became very sophisticated in this approach, one should do it not only on a year-by-year accounting basis but also on a life cycle basis and should regard the tax social security system as being a life cycle adjustment between the times when people can afford to pay tax to provide them and ensure that they have the resources when they need to meet the costs of providing for their retirement incomes, looking after children and so on. Rather than treating the family allowance as a welfare payment, we should consider it as a capacity to pay tax rebate for credit that acknowledges the costs of supporting dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> A Liberal-National Party government will increase the threshold for the dependent spouse rebate and decrease the rate at which it is withdrawn. That will increase the number of taxpayers who are entitled to claim a dependent spouse rebate for their spouses. In time we should consider making that spouse rebate fully cashable for those families who would like it that way so that it can be paid as a tax refund or a tax credit to the dependent spouse. That would reduce the dependency of spouses on their partners by providing them with a degree of personal economic independence to which I believe each individual is entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the tax system that should be reformed is the measurement of tax expenditures by the Department of the Treasury. Currently in Australia, the individual is the unit upon which income tax liability is assessed. The tax free threshold is not considered as a tax expenditure. Because the individual is the tax unit, modifications in tax liability because of dependent care responsibilities are treated as tax expenditures. In the tax expenditure statement of 1988, when referring to the inclusion as a tax expenditure of the modifications in tax liability because of dependent care responsibilities, the Treasury noted:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . this is not to say that such provisions are not defensible design features of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>Those defensible design features should be incorporated in the benchmark tax structure. It is anomalous that tax exemptions on the subsistence level income for a taxpayer are considered as part of the benchmark tax structure but tax exemptions on the subsistence level income for a taxpayer's dependants are not considered as part of that same benchmark tax structure. To be consistent, either they both should be included in the benchmark tax structure and thus not be considered as tax expenditures or they should both be excluded from the benchmark tax structure and therefore be considered as tax expenditures. I personally support the approach of including the capacity to pay principles in the benchmark tax structure. If that were to be the case, because of dependent care responsibilities, those modifications in the tax liability of an individual taxpayer would not be treated as tax expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> Another insidious problem that has plagued our present tax system is the effect of bracket creep on an individual taxpayer. Bracket creep occurs when increases in a taxpayer's income force that taxpayer into a higher marginal tax range because there has been a failure to index the tax thresholds. In 1982-83, taxpayers on average earnings of $17,630 in the dollars of that year would have paid $4,038 in income tax, or 22.9 per cent of their income. Using the 1989-90 Budget forecast for wages growth of 7 per cent, average annual earnings for this period will be $28,216. The tax payable under the new Keating tax formula would be $6,813. Thus, for 1989-90 taxpayers on average annual earnings will pay not 22.9 per cent of their income but 24.1 per cent of their income in tax. The tax burden on such individuals has been increased by 5.2 per cent since 1982-83, which was the last year of the Fraser Liberal Government. Similarly, this year, taxpayers on average annual earnings who have a dependent spouse and two dependent children will pay an estimated 16 per cent of their income in tax, compared with only 14.1 per cent in 1982-83. The tax burden on such families has been increased by Labor by 13.5 per cent during the lifetime of its government. </PARA>
<PARA> The two examples I have just described are evidence that the tax cuts given by the Labor Government have not compensated taxpayers for the erosion of their incomes due to bracket creep, yet the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when announcing the July round of tax cuts in the April 1989 economic statement had the gall to claim that the new tax structure `more than offsets what is known as fiscal drag or bracket creep'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, personal income taxpayers will now be paying less than if we had indexed the tax scales for inflation since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know that statistics can be used selectively to tell almost any story. Clearly the Treasurer has misled the Australian people with his outrageous claim. It appears he has massaged the data, to tell a story he would like the public to hear and believe, rather than given a fair representation of how bracket creep under his administration has affected the typical taxpayer on average annual earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties have not shirked tough decisions in the area of bracket creep. We have announced that we will not allow Labor's bracket creep tax grab to continue. The next Liberal-National Party government will commit itself to forgoing the increase in revenue because of bracket creep. It is estimated that over the period 1982-83 to 1989-90 the real level of income tax collected from individuals will have increased by 3.2 per cent as a consequence of bracket creep. In dollar terms this is substantially in excess of $1 billion additional revenue collected because of the present Government's failure to adjust fully for bracket creep. It has given ad hoc relief, but in giving that relief it has been most unfair to average working Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the current tax system which is in need of reform is the Medicare levy. Today we have before us the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill which seeks to increase the threshold from which the 1.25 per cent levy is to be imposed. The Bill provides me with an opportunity to draw to the attention of the House the deceptiveness involved in the imposition of the Medicare levy. Indeed, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) in his speech to the House said the Government had held the Medicare levy at 1.25 per cent. So what? What does the Medicare levy mean? It means very little. It is really part of the overall tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians believe that the services provided under Medicare-that is, the 85 per cent of the schedule fee for medical services and public hospital accommodation-are paid for with the revenue collected from the Medicare levy, but they are wrong. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Using the data contained in Budget Statement No. 1 it can be shown that the Medicare levy in fact pays approximately one-third of the cost of the services provided under Medicare. The remaining cost of providing the services under Medicare is met from general revenue. The Government has chosen to provide a public health care system; now let it be honest about its costs. If the Government were to set the Medicare levy so that it fully funded the Medicare system, it would need almost three times the current levy of 1.25 per cent-that is, a levy of approximately 3.5 per cent. If we did it on a revenue neutral basis and were honest with the Australian people and the users of the health care system, we would have a 3.5 per cent Medicare levy and the general tax structure rates would be 2.25 per cent lower than they currently are. But they need to be brought much lower still, and I am sure they will be reduced as a Liberal-National Party government moves to a two-step rate structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of the Medicare levy is Labor's devious way of disguising the true costs of the provision of Medicare. Today I have drawn the attention of the House to the urgent need for reform of the tax system. The next Liberal government is committed to providing a flatter tax system with two rates; to introducing child tax rebates and child-care rebates; to increasing the eligibility threshold for the dependent spouse rebate and reducing the withdrawal rate; to increasing the tax free threshold for superannuants; to introducing tax reductions for those who take out retirement savings accounts and are entering the work force for the first time or are casual, part time, itinerant employees; and to abolishing Labor's capital gains tax and replacing it with a speculative gains tax which taxes capital gains on a sliding scale over five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes such as these have my enthusiastic support, and in particular I would like to see the proceeds arising from bracket creep used to implement a two-step rate structure. My view is that the tax free threshold should be lifted from $5,100 so that it is well clear of the amount paid to age and other pensioners. I would suggest that the tax free threshold should be of the order of one-third of average weekly earnings. If that were done and the opening marginal rate of tax were set at 30c in the dollar, that rate should be continued until the level of income reached is equal to average weekly earnings. In other words, there will be no tax payable up to, in today's dollars, about $8,400, with 30c in the dollar being payable from $8,400 up to about $25,000. Some may say that means we increase the 21c rate to 30c but the fact is that if we lifted the threshold, everyone would pay less tax than they do now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my opinion the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) is a decent fellow and his contributions in this place are generally very thoughtful. But it is surprising to see such inconsistency from him in this debate on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill. At the end of his speech he made a particular point, and if that is the philosophy he endorses I find it inconceivable that he can endorse the removal of a capital gains tax. As we all understand, capital gains are in fact gains in the same way that income or rental or dividends, or any other source of income, is income. Exempting it from taxation, as the Opposition suggests, would distort totally the taxation system and take away a great deal of its fairness. I believe the honourable member has a coherent philosophical approach to economic policy matters. His problem is that his philosophy is not the same as the Opposition's, so from time to time he finds himself in conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been waiting for the Economic Action Plan, as the document is called, from the Opposition for some time. I must say it has been a bit like waiting for Godot.

It does not have a philosophical base to it, and it does not target that extra money. It does not, as the Opposition said it would do, cut fiscal policy. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said yesterday, it is like going up a lift in the Empire State Building, shoving a brick on the top and saying, `Look what we have done'. All of that building has been built by us; all of the changes in outlays and the structural changes that have occurred in our budgetary situation have been created by this Government.

At that time pharmacists were hit with a 40 per cent reduction in real terms. Under this Government, and the Tribunal, there has been an increase in real terms of 40 per cent compared with the consumer price index and basically with average weekly earnings. That is fairly pertinent in the current area.</PARA>
<PARA> When we look at pharmacy profits, as distinct from pharmacists' remuneration as paid by the Government for dispensing medication, we see a quite similar situation. It is quite clear from Pharmacy Guild figures that pharmacy profits have gone up quite dramatically. All that the Tribunal has done has been to look at the real costs of dispensing medication and to bring down a fee. The Government is prepared--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking here about a relatively simple matter. The Government is trying to solve the issue by having negotiations with the Guild. At the moment the Guild does not seem to want to negotiate. The Guild's so-called fall-back position is basically to get, over and above the PBRT decision, another $126m. The Government's offer goes back to the point of its offer in May when it said that it wanted to go to the Tribunal with a joint submission for $41m. The expert panel of pharmacists which advises me has given me a very good set of recommendations which will be taken to the Government for decision. I hope that when pharmacists see the results of those determinations and the way in which they would be able to be involved in their industry in terms of the development of a profession fee, the structure of the industry and matters such as the essential pharmacy allowance, we will see much more reason than this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Part of the problem is that the individual pharmacist has not been given good information by the Guild over the years. Very few understand the reality of the PBRT process or, at this stage, the Government's position. At a time when the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is increasing in cost rapidly-obviously that is not due simply and solely to remuneration to pharmacists; it is also driven by other issues-we have to bear in mind what many pharmacists and their representatives are saying to government is the political way to solve this issue. It has become a political issue because of the denial of the PBRT process. They say that the way to solve it is to terrorise people, to frighten them into believing that they will not be able to get their medications, and to say that the pharmacies will be closed. Pharmacies would have been most likely to close when the Opposition parties were in government, cutting back in real terms their remuneration. But they did not. The growth in the number of pharmacies over the last couple of years clearly shows that has not been the case.</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that if pharmacists really want to settle this issue, if they really care for their customers or patients, they will not use them as political pawns. They will not tell them that the drugs will not be available. They will not tell them that they will charge more for them. If they were honest, they would say that they want their remuneration beefed up by making the Government increase charges to pensioners, increase charges to other people, or remove medications. We will not do that. The Government will not make the patient pay for what pharmacists want over and above community expectations in wage areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of a report in the Sydney Morning Herald which points out a proposal for an extension of fee relief to the private sector. The heading of the article is: `Libs' child care policy: Mark III'. The proposal comes from the shadow Minister for child-care, the honourable member for Dawson. It provides us with a previously unheard-of and previously uncosted major element in the Opposition's child-care policy; that is, the extension of fee relief to the private sector. We have to get the picture clear, if we can, of what is happening on the other side. First we have what we were told was Opposition child-care policy mark 1, revealed by the Leader of the Opposition two weeks ago. The Sydney Morning Herald this morning called that policy irresponsible and irresponsible it is because it sacrifices the proper economic management of this country for an irresponsible, ill-targeted bribe which will not produce a single new child-care centre. In the Economic Action Plan and in the proposal mark 1 there was no mention whatsoever of the extension of fee relief to the private sector. When we got plan mark 2-what I call the Connolly child-care policy, which was revealed this week and which I notice the Sydney Morning Herald editorial describes as both intelligent and responsible-it contained just the opposite. It said that the fee relief would be cut to stop people getting both fee relief and the rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Leader of the Opposition rebuked the honourable member for Bradfield for discussing the Opposition's plans to privatise the system and its inability to go ahead with 30,000 new child-care places; but when he reprimanded the honourable member for Bradfield he made no mention of the proposal to extend fee relief either. He said to the journalists, `Do not listen to the honourable member for Bradfield. The person who is responsible for child-care policy is the honourable member for Dawson. Ask him about the child-care policy'.</PARA>
<PARA> Apparently that is what happened. They asked the honourable member for Dawson and he produced an entirely new promise, one we had not heard of before and one which certainly has not been costed. I will come to the cost of it in a moment. He said that not only would the Opposition give the rebate to all and sundry, regardless of need-that is, maintain the bribe-but also it would extend fee relief to commercial child-care centres. Then he said, `It will not cost any more because everyone who is eligible for fee relief has already got a place in the public sector and therefore we did not have to cost it'.</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who knows anything at all about child-care knows that, despite all our efforts, there remains-and we have admitted it-a significant unmet need amongst middle income and low income families. There is no way that extension of fee relief to the private sector would not have significant costs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bradfield interrupts because he was making this point very clearly himself. He was saying that the Opposition would drive middle income people out of the public centres because so many people need these services. It is balderdash to suggest that this extension will not involve a very significant additional cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition now has to answer some questions. Which is the Opposition's child-care policy? Is it the irresponsible bribe that he announced two weeks ago? Is it mark 2, that is, the more logical and coherent version of the honourable member for Bradfield, or is it mark 3, the even more irresponsible and even more expensive plan announced last night by the honourable member for Dawson? If the shadow Minister for community services and aged care is right, the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition are wrong in their sums. How many extra hundreds of millions will it cost to extend a fee relief system to the private sector? Or is the Leader of the Opposition going to say, as he said to the honourable member for Bradfield, that the honourable member for Dawson has got it wrong, that he simply made it all up, as did the honourable member for Bradfield?</PARA>
<PARA> People will expect an answer from the Opposition. Are the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer right and, therefore, is their figuring right, or is the honourable member for Dawson right because he will destroy their figuring altogether? Yesterday my colleague the Treasurer said that the Opposition was simply adding a brick to his Empire State Building. With the proposal from the honourable member for Dawson the brick has been knocked off and he has begun to cut down the surplus.</PARA>

<PARA> I now come to the two points that were raised by the honourable member for Menzies. When Mr Ross was first employed all the security, police, character and pecuniary interest declaration checks were satisfactory and that was reported to me. That included at the time the usual Australian Security Intelligence Organisation investigations and checks. The pecuniary interest declaration he provided at the time, which the honourable member has questioned me about, was in order. He did not declare any pecuniary interest with regard to interests in this consultancy or any other consultancy. Those pecuniary interest forms were regularly updated. A copy of a form submitted by Mr Ross not long before he resigned from my employment late in 1987 was located and drawn to the attention of the Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA> I have undertaken every reasonable action to ensure that this matter is thoroughly and expeditiously investigated. I do not feel that I am able to comment beyond this point in view of the investigations and the inquiry which are under way and which may or may not include Federal Police criminal charges. I conclude by saying that I resent any implication in the question or by the Leader of the Opposition or by any honourable member opposite that I have acted in any way improperly or that I have not taken the required action since I first heard of this matter. I reassure the House once again that all through the time that this individual was employed by me I had no understanding or knowledge whatsoever of any actions mentioned before the Commission as being undertaken by this person. The pecuniary interest forms were in order and all of the relevant checks were undertaken when he first accepted employment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague has already articulated well the implications in relation to fiscal policy of such a commitment. What is surprising about such a commitment is that just two weeks after the Opposition has detailed its policy in relation to child-care a plank, which is not part of the policy and is uncosted but which would have very large costs to the Budget and to fiscal policy, is now being committed on behalf of the Opposition by the relevant shadow Minister, the honourable member for Dawson, who two days ago was so nominated as being the relevant shadow Minister by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition has been saying that there is a need to get the weight off monetary policy and on to the other instruments of policy. But as I said in the House yesterday, and I repeat today, fiscal policy would be weaker under the Opposition. The surplus would be $700m lower than it is now under its policies and, with the policy articulated by the honourable member for Dawson, it would be substantially more than $700m lower. So the Opposition will now have a substantially weaker fiscal policy than the Government. If fiscal policy is weaker, therefore, the weight has to go on the other two policy instruments-monetary policy and wages policy. If wages policy is about enterprise bargaining, and in times of growth and particularly strong demand--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then the strength of that demand will mean that in a position of enterprise bargaining aggregate wage levels would rise. So not only would the weight not go onto wages, but there would be even more weight onto monetary policy. That is exactly what the Opposition basically intends as its sole one-dimensional policy instrument-monetary policy. It would, as it has shown here today-the Joye Boys of Australian politics-make a bigger promise whenever there is a problem. The Opposition does not even stick to the discipline which it imposed upon itself as late as two weeks ago. It would make a bigger promise and then leave the weight on interest rates so that under the Opposition we would watch interest rates move to their high twenties as the Opposition crushes the economy into a recession. I noticed today what the Australian Financial Review has had to say about the Opposition in relation to the capital gains tax. The final paragraph says:</PARA></TALK.START>

Or is it the Leader of the Opposition's announced policy that the extra 30,000 places would be built, fee relief maintained and an extra $20 rebate?

The business community stayed at home and left its money at home. That is why by 1980 we had an enormous structural weakness in the current account, with a deficit of 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Despite the fact that we had a commodities boom, a mineral boom and a coal boom, by 1980 the current account deficit was already 6 per cent of GDP because there had been no investment in the rest of the economy for 15 years, as is eloquently borne out in the components of GDP chart published in the Budget by the Treasury. The fact is that we are re-equipping the economy. Despite the re-equipment, the current account figure will be coming in at the forecast rate. That is why we have had no question today about the current account deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>

One thing will not happen: we will not use monetary policy as it would be used by a coalition government-to burn the face of Australian industry, to burn activity out of the economy, to lower wages and inflation. We will not have a Thatcher mark 1 monetarist policy under which there would need to be interest rates of 25 to 30 per cent to do the job. That is the prospect under the coalition's Economic Action Plan. The highest interest rates in our history were presided over by Treasurer Howard. The highest interest rates ever would be presided over by a coalition government if it implemented its present policy in relation to fiscal and wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by making this point: today's current account figure simply proves once more that Australia is re-equipping itself, that the business community is still rebuilding the capital stocks so disastrously run down under our predecessors over two decades.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. It refers to an issue that is undoubtedly of some sensitivity as far as the Opposition is concerned, that is, the question of indexation. Perhaps the greatest single deficiency in terms of family assistance in this country has been the lack of indexation of the various payments and rebates that are made available to Australian families. This was clearly demonstrated during the period of the Fraser Government when, based on the advice of John Stone and the present honourable member for Wentworth, the Government gave families minuscule leftovers at the end of the Budget process. Not one single family payment during that period was indexed. Arising from the work of the Social Security Review, this Government has delivered fundamental and fair reforms to family assistance measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the April economic statement our reforms culminated in substantial increases in family allowance rates, new benchmarks of adequacy for payments for low income families and, for the first time ever, the indexation of family payments, particularly family allowance. That indexation will lead to further increases in family payments in January. On the tax side of the equation, the Government also increased the dependent spouse and sole parent rebates and will index these every year in accordance with increases in the consumer price index. The Australian Institute of Family Studies, in commenting on these changes, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the decision of the Government to annually adjust all family-related payments in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price Index, is the most significant long term reform of the tax package. This is because it will prevent erosion of the real value of benefits such as payments for pensioner and beneficiary children, Family Allowance, the Dependent Spouse Rebate and the Sole Parent Rebate, which were important contributors to falling family incomes, particularly in the latter part of the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA>I make this point because yesterday the honourable member for Wentworth interjected, `What more do you want in addition to bracket creep?'. That comment betrays that the honourable member for Wentworth has no understanding of the process of family reform. When he talks about the child rebates wiped out by the Fraser Government, and some reintroduction of a rebate, the fact that he fails to understand the importance of indexation simply means that he is not on the path of any significant reform. It is all very well to come into this Parliament, cite figures, talk about what may or may not be possible and talk about aggregates, hoping that one will never be subject to any detailed analysis; but in relation to any significant reform in terms of income transfers for families, nothing is more important than the question of indexation.</PARA>
<PARA> The most significant aspect of the Opposition's economic planning statement is the fact that it neglects and avoids that issue and therefore opens the way-in the event of a coalition government-to dismantling the whole system of family allowance payments, particularly the direct transfer to families, to the carers, and, above all else, indexation of those payments. We will hear nothing but silence from the Opposition when it comes to indexation of family payments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The market's judgment about the decision was that the exchange rate went up; so the market, which rates Australia every day, just overlooked it, because there was no new information. The fact is that the Commonwealth has no net overseas debt. What we had with Moody's was not a rating of the Commonwealth's debt, because the Commonwealth could wipe out its overseas currency debt with less than one year's Budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just referring to Moody's first. It said that it was rating the Commonwealth's debt, but the Commonwealth had no net debt and has no net debt. Its outstanding overseas debt could be wiped out with one year's Budget surplus. That remains the position. When I have commissioned the Treasury to try to recover debt, the premium we would have to pay to return the debt to Australia-to get the debt back-is not worth paying. We have to wait until it expires because the market puts such a high premium on Australian securities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are now in a position where I have had discussions with the Australian banks about how we will run the prime asset ratios without treasury bonds. The Commonwealth is removing not only its overseas debt but its total debt. The debate now concerns how we can run the banking system without treasury bonds. In this climate Moody's downgraded Australia on the basis of some risk that our sovereign debt would not be repaid. It was a demonstrable nonsense. Standard and Poor's decided, because it believed that Moody's is rating Australia rather than Australian sovereign debt, that it had no recourse but to do what Moody's had done.

When he told me who I was having as my room-mate I suggested that there was some incompatibility and asked whether he could make a better offer. He said, `I am being opposed for Whip. Will you vote for me?'. I have got a lot stronger since, but I said, `Yes'. I must say that he won by one vote.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the maximum rate of the levy that may be imposed under the Grape Research Levy Act 1986, which imposes a levy on fresh and dried grapes and grape juice delivered to wineries and other processing establishments. Dried grapes which are leviable under the Dried Fruits Levy Act 1971 are exempt. Levy is payable by grapegrowers and by winemakers who grow their own grapes. The proceeds of the levy represent the grapegrowers' contribution to the financing of research on winegrapes and other processed grapes. The Commonwealth matches industry expenditure under the program. A grape and wine research council established under the Rural Industries Research Act 1985 administers the grape research program. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the maximum rate of the levy under the Grape Research Levy Act is 50c per tonne. The operative rate of the levy was increased to this level with effect from 1 January 1989. This amendment will provide flexibility for the levy to be increased in future, but only if industry so requests. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1988, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to matching rural industry research expenditures up to a ceiling of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production (GVP) of the industry concerned. Subsequently, the Winegrape Growers Council of Australia requested that the maximum rate of the grape research levy be increased to $2 per tonne to enable a phased increase in grape industry research funding. This Bill implements that request, which was supported by each of the nationally representative winemaker organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise that this Bill does not increase the operative rate of levy currently paid by grapegrowers. Increases in operative rates will continue to be set by regulation under the Grape Research Levy Act. There is a specific legislative requirement for industry to be consulted before such increases are implemented. Increasing the maximum rate of the grape research levy will not in itself have a direct impact on government expenditure. The extent to which outlays for grape research increase in the future will depend upon the level of levy increases implemented over time within the higher maximum rate. Growers' funds provided by this levy and matching Commonwealth contributions have placed grape research on a secure long term financial basis. An initial relatively modest expenditure program of about $270,000 in 1987-88 will increase to a budgeted level of $522,000 in the current year. This Bill will facilitate further development of the program commensurate with growers' willingness to contribute additional funds for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to restructure the levy which funds the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The new levy arrangements will improve equity in levy contributions between small, medium and large winemakers and provide increased funding for the Corporation. This Bill is part of a package of measures to promote further development of the wine industry. An associated Bill amends the Grape Research Levy Act to introduce a higher maximum levy rate, and a third Bill amends the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act to implement a program to enable wine labelling claims to be verified. </PARA>
<PARA> The Wine Grapes Levy Act 1979 imposes a levy on fresh and dried grapes and grape juice used in the manufacture of wine. The levy has two components-a marketing amount to finance the promotional and regulatory activities of the Corporation, and a research amount which provides industry funding for wine research. The levy is payable by winery proprietors using the equivalent of 20 tonnes or more of fresh grapes per year in winemaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The current marketing component of the levy is a flat rate of $4 per tonne of prescribed goods with a cap of $20,000 on levy payments per levy payer. This levy structure has resulted in a disproportionate burden of corporation funding falling upon smaller and medium-sized wineries and considerable potential levy income from larger wineries has been forgone. For example, a proprietor of a winery crushing 5,000 tonnes of grapes pays $4 per tonne or $20,000, but a proprietor of a winery crushing 80,000 tonnes of grapes also pays $20,000 because of the $20,000 levy ceiling. A further weakness in the present levy system is that, because of the levy ceiling, corporate amalgamations have the potential to significantly reduce levy revenue over time. Amendments proposed in this Bill address these issues by abolishing the levy ceiling, introducing a tiered levy system and reducing the threshold tonnage below which levy is not payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the structure proposed, the levy to fund the Corporation will consist of a flat amount of $200 for each levy payer plus an additional amount depending on the tonnage of grapes used in winemaking. To calculate this additional amount a sliding scale of levy rates will be used. Progressively lower rates will apply as tonnage crushed increases. The maximum rates and initial operative rates of the levy are set out in clause 6 of the Bill. At present proprietors of wineries crushing less than 20 tonnes of prescribed goods per year are exempt from both the marketing and research components of the levy. This Bill proposes to reduce that exemption threshold from 20 tonnes to 10 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy will continue to be payable on fresh and dried grapes and grape juice used in winemaking. Provision will remain for the operative rates of levy to be changed by regulation. In respect of the marketing component, this will occur only after consideration of any recommendation made to the Minister by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The Corporation must first submit its recommendation to an annual general meeting of the industry and advise the Minister of the voting on any relevant resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes provided for in this Bill were requested and are strongly supported by the wine industry. A motion recommending the changes was approved by an 84 per cent majority of votes cast at the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation annual general meeting in February this year. The proposal to reduce the exemption threshold from 20 tonnes to 10 tonnes in respect of the research component of the levy has the support of each of the three national winemaker organisations. It will retain consistency in the exemption level for each component of the levy. The levy changes proposed will also provide substantially increased funding for the Corporation. In 1990-91 estimated levy income will be about $1.16m compared with approximately $750,000 in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1987-88 the Corporation has incurred significant deficits financed through reductions in its reserves. The Corporation has budgeted for a further deficit of about $176,000 in the current year. The increase in levy receipts expected from the changes being implemented this Bill should arrest the erosion of Corporation reserves and be sufficient to cover increased program expenditure by 1990-91. The Corporation was reconstituted in 1986 to improve its accountability to industry and to enable it to operate more effectively and efficiently. The strong industry support for an increase in the level of its funding for the Corporation reflects industry confidence in the Corporation and the programs it has implemented and intends to implement for the industry's benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has allocated a high proportion of its resources towards encouraging and servicing, through its export promotion and inspection arrangements, the rapid increase in exports which has occurred in recent years. The value of exports of Australian wine has increased more than fivefold from $20.5m in 1985-86 to $113m in 1988-89. Exports in the current year are expected to be worth $133m. </PARA>
<PARA> The wine industry, supported by the Corporation, is working hard to further increase awareness of the quality and value of our wines and to protect the reputation of the industry as a supplier of consistently reliable products. In addition to its promotional programs the Corporation has implemented a compliance monitoring program under which wine samples are analysed for non-permissible additives. Introduction of a label integrity program will further enhance consumer confidence in Australian wine. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding changes embodied in this Bill will enable the Corporation to maintain these and other programs from a more secure financial base. The Bill contains appropriate transitional provisions for implementation of the new levy rates from 1 January 1990, which is midway through the normal levy year. This has been done so that the new levy system can apply to the 1990 grape harvest, thereby making additional funding available to the Corporation as soon as possible. The existing levy will apply until 31 December 1989, but a winery proprietor's maximum levy liability in 1989-90 will be limited to what he or she would have incurred had the new levy rates applied throughout 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments will have no net effect on Government expenditure. The levy which funds the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation is paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and an equal amount is appropriated from the Fund for a payment to the Corporation. The revised levy has no additional cost implications for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy as levy collection costs are fully recouped from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative basis for implementation of a wine label integrity program by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. It also makes amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 consequential on amendment of the Wine Grapes Levy Act provided for in an accompanying Bill. In addition this Bill amends penalties in the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The wine label integrity program will require wine manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims of the vintage, variety or region or origin of wine and to make those records and the stocks to which they relate available for audit upon request by the Corporation. The purpose of auditing is to help to ensure truth in labelling, thereby increasing consumer confidence in the reliability of wine label claims and enhancing the reputation for quality and value of Australian wine in domestic and export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The label integrity program has been devised and developed by the Corporation at the request of the wine industry. It has the support of each of the three national winemaker organisations and was recommended for adoption by a substantial majority of votes cast at the Corporation's annual general meeting in February 1989. The Wine and Grape Industry Advisory Council, comprising representatives of winemakers and grapegrowers, considers that the program will contribute to meeting the need for regular systematic monitoring of compliance with wine labelling requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for legislation by the Commonwealth arises from concern within the wine industry, the Corporation and the Government to protect our reputation for producing sound, good quality wines with accurate product description on labels. Exports of Australian wine have grown from $20.5m in 1985-86 to $113m in 1988-89 and are expected to reach $133m in 1989-90. Continued export expansion is now a key to the industry's future growth and prosperity and protecting the reputation of our wines is essential to achievement of that objective. The Australian wine industry also holds a 97 per cent share of the domestic market for wine. I believe Australian consumers will welcome the implementation of a label integrity program as a further initiative by the wine industry to enhance consumer respect for the local product. </PARA>
<PARA> The price which winemakers can obtain for premium wines may invite spurious labelling claims by any producer who has little respect for accuracy in product descriptions. Experience overseas has shown that, in the event of fraudulent winemaking practices and product description by the irresponsible few, export customers tend to avoid wine from all producers of the country affected. Australia's winemakers wish to pre-empt any such damage to their industry, by implementing their own program of industry self-regulation. Knowledge that a system is in place to facilitate detection of breaches should be a strong deterrent to any potential transgressors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that all wine manufacturers engaged in the manufacture of wine for commercial purposes be required to keep a record of the vintage, variety, region of origin, source of supply and quantity of grape products received for use in making wine. This will enable the Corporation to trace a wine back to the point where grapes from which it was produced were first harvested or juice was first processed. Wine manufacturers who sell or dispose of their wine without any claim as to its vintage, variety or region or origin need not maintain any further records in respect of such wine. For example wine manufacturers who sell their wine as claret, burgundy, moselle or chablis, once they have made records of their intake of grape products, can dispense with further record keeping. </PARA>
<PARA> Wine manufacturers who make claims about the vintage, variety or region of origin of a particular wine will need to keep records relating to the production, sales and disposal of all such wines, thereby establishing an `audit trail'. This will enable verification of claims made by wine manufacturers about the pedigree of the wine and enable the Corporation to determine whether or not more wine described as being of a particular variety-say chardonnay-is being sold than could possibly be produced from the available grape supply. Relevant clauses in part 3 of the Bill take account of typical transactions occurring in the wine industry-which include blending of wines, sale of wine to other wineries, transfer of wine between the producing arm and marketing arm of related companies, winemaking under contract, relabelling of wines without labels and cellar door sales. The clauses in each case impose obligations on wine manufacturers to keep records, not on grapegrowers or bottling firms. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for record keeping arises from a circumstance believed to be unique to the wine industry-that there is no known technical means of assessing a wine to determine its vintage, variety or region of origin. For most other primary products, it is possible to verify contents by technical means-for example by species testing or by other analysis of the physical or chemical characteristics of the product. </PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of normal commercial practice most winemakers already maintain the records they will be required by this Bill to keep. Where winemakers do not already maintain intake, production, sales and disposal records, the Corporation will assist them to establish simple and appropriate record keeping procedures. The Corporation will be providing a guide to wineries on the requirements of this Bill and will be visiting wineries to further explain the requirements of the label integrity program and to ensure that producers are familiar with the record-keeping requirements appropriate to their particular operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Labelling requirements concerning vintage, variety and region of origin are enshrined in food laws administered by State and Territory governments. This Bill does not change existing food laws or introduce new labelling requirements; nor does it encroach upon the authority and responsibilities of the States and Territories for administering those laws. In consultations, these governments have indicated that they would welcome the assistance of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation in monitoring compliance with wine labelling aspects of food laws. Evidence of any apparent breaches detected by the Corporation will be brought to the attention of the States and Territories for appropriate action, or action may be brought under the consumer deception provisions of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The wine industry does not seek through the label integrity program to emulate the European appellation system. There are no attempts to limit the types of grapes which can be grown in a specific region, to limit the yield which can be obtained from a vineyard or to prescribe certain methods of production. All that is required is that winemakers who make labelling claims of vintage, variety or region of origin, maintain the records necessary to substantiate the claims. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains appropriate provisions necessary for effective administration of the program. These include standard provisions relating to the powers of inspectors, access to premises and the gathering of evidence of label offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequential amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 contained in part 2 of the Bill will maintain the existing arrangements concerning voting rights at annual general meetings of the Corporation, payment to the Corporation of levy money collected by the Commonwealth and refunds of any overpayments back to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The updated penalty rates specified in the schedule to the Bill relate to offences against provisions concerning the coverage of grape products, provision of information to the Corporation, export of grape products and offences against regulations made pursuant to the principal Act. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1989 which is now before the House contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Firstly, schedule one, operative on and from 1 January 1988, allows continued duty free treatment of ethyl hexanol. Schedule two operates on and from 1 July 1988 and provides a free rate of duty for rye grass seed and certain gasoline and other oils. This rate was previously applied by the Customs Tariff (Rates Alteration) Act 1988. Schedule three contains a minor amendment to subheading 9616.10 to align it with the international harmonised system. It will operate on and from 14 October 1988. Schedule four, operative on and from 1 March 1989, provides for the accelerated liberalisation of trade in textiles, clothing and footwear goods of New Zealand origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule five, operative on and from 1 July 1989, contains further changes under the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA) to remove tariff and quota restrictions on apparel from New Zealand and achieve free trade access a year earlier than originally proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> It also contains amendments to take account of changes in the names of a number of countries or places which qualify for preferential treatment. It includes amending to give effect to the Government's decision on the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries. These changes allow duty free entry to certain mining and agricultural equipment not normally made in Australia. In addition, schedule five includes a reduction in the rate of duty on soda ash to compensate for the effect of changes to the customs valuation system made on 1 July 1989. This reduction follows a report by the Industries Assistance Commission and subsequent discussions with the industries concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule six operates on and from 1 August 1989. It provides quota free and duty free access for certain ski boots and cross country ski footwear. It also implements a free rate of duty for certain fabric woven from PVC coated polyester, and woven cut corduroy. Schedules seven and eight contain amendments to correct industry assistance anomalies resulting from the introduction of the harmonised tariff. Schedule seven, operative on and from 12 October 1989, provides a free rate of duty for certain cast coated paper and paperboard. Schedule eight amendments will operate from seven days after this Bill receives royal assent. The goods covered in this schedule include machines for working metal, knives and cutting blades for woodchipping machines, plywood, sensitised papers and certain machines containing a computer controller. </PARA>
<PARA> Also contained in schedule eight are amendments to extend the provisions of the Australian System of Tariff Preferences (ASTP) to Poland and Hungary. Far-reaching reforms in the political and economic spheres are in train in both these countries. The Government attaches priority to the coordinated action being taken by Western industrialised countries to give support and encouragement to these changes. Our action is consistent with measures already adopted or being adopted in various other countries such as the United States of America, Japan and New Zealand. Finally, in schedule nine, which is to operate on and from 1 January 1990, is an amendment to item 19 in schedule four as a consequence of changes proposed by the Customs and Excise Legislation Bill (No. 4) 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the amendments to the textiles, clothing and footwear arrangements contained in this Bill are considered to be negligible. The revenue impact of changes to the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries is expected to be virtually nil as the equipment concerned is not manufactured in Australia in the normal course of business. The amendments relating to soda ash involve no Budget outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision of ASTP status to Poland and Hungary can be expected to result in some increase in imports though this is unlikely to have any significant impact on domestic markets. Imports in 1988-89 were approximately $31m from Poland and $28m from Hungary. Customs revenue forgone as a result of the application of developing rates is expected to be approximately $1m in respect of Poland and $0.7m for Hungary. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to assess the net financial impact of the proposed tariff changes to correct tariff anomalies. Some will have the effect of reducing or removing import duty; others will increase duty or permit reinstatement of bounty. However, the measures proposed will generally only restore the position which applied before 1 January 1988 and are not likely to result in any substantial change to revenue or outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in an explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921, to incorporate into that Act an excise tariff proposal tabled in this Parliament during the last sittings and to effect a minor technical amendment to take account of the fact that the Australian Capital Territory has attained self-government. </PARA>
<PARA>Liquefied Petroleum Gas</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The excise duty for naturally occurring LPG is adjusted six-monthly on 1 April and 1 October each year in accordance with the Government's LPG excise policy announced in April 1980. The excise rate is calculated as 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 a tonne. The realised price is based on the weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sales of LPG during the immediately preceding six months. Under the petroleum excise arrangements introduced from 1 July 1987, LPG produced from onshore fields is exempt from excise, so the excise now applies only to offshore fields-that is, Bass Strait. No excise is payable on refinery-produced LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill will amend the excise rate, with effect from 1 April 1989, from $6.25 a kilometre to a rate of free. The decrease reflects the fact that the excise threshold of $147 a tonne has not been reached on average over the immediately preceding six months. </PARA>
<PARA>Minor Technical Amendment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has also been taken to effect a minor technical amendment to item 10 (a) of the schedule to the Act. This amendment concerns the treatment under the Act of government business enterprises established by the Australian Capital Territory Government now that the Territory has attained self-government and is explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA> The Government will not raise any revenue from excise on naturally occurring LPG for the six months from 1 April 1989.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I began to speak on this legislation prior to the luncheon break, the debate had developed into a wide ranging one. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) spoke before me. I said that he was a very decent fellow but that, unfortunately, his philosophical views did not necessarily coincide with those of the coalition. For that reason from time to time he runs into difficulties with his Party. In this country we hope to pursue a decent, necessary policy in respect of taxation revenue and in respect of expenditure. I commented that the document released last week by the Liberal and National parties, Economic Action Plan, mentions the looming crisis, and indeed there is great concern about our foreign debt situation and the structure of Australia's economy. I think that is a reasonable point for the Opposition to make in the document. However, we were disappointed with its response because it was puny. It talked about saving from expenditure, about cutting the unemployment benefit, in a rather spurious way, to a number of people who would be in need, about a number of other savings in areas such as education, Aboriginal affairs and foreign aid, and about spending that money in another way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose one could debate the morality of the child-care rebate and its application and the subsidy for children. But the issue that really gives an indication as to where the Opposition is heading is that which relates to the tax on capital. Clearly, it is our concern that we need a decent taxation system which is fair to all. To seek to remove the tax on capital gains, which was introduced by this Government and is now an accepted part of the landscape, is a dishonest act. It is an act which perhaps will gain some political capital outside this place, but in terms of producing a fairer tax system, directing our taxation system towards a level playing field where everyone is treated equally, it is certainly a step backwards. It is very interesting to note the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review, and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) pointed it out in Question Time today. The editorial as it relates to the Opposition's policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> By putting it on the agenda-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the capital gains tax-</PARA>
<PARA>the Opposition has created a political issue by proposing a weak and philosophically unconvincing proposition. Its policy response, instead of showing some fiscal spine, lacks any philosophic coherence and will harm revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>My concern is that if one looks at a tax on capital gains--(Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> Now that many of my colleagues are here in the House, perhaps they would like me to point out to all those who are listening, including those schoolchildren in the gallery, that the tactic of the Opposition is one of spoiling and destroying. Essentially, what we are hoping for and have tried to do over our time in government is to create a taxation system that is fair for all. The old adage in tax-and all accountants would know it-is income is income is income. If one gains income from selling a capital asset and one has to pay tax on the income, it is just the same as any income received from a dividend, interest, wages, rents or profits. It is a profit on the sale. One is not taxed on the nominal profit; one is taxed on the real profit. So it is a fair tax. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest that those who have wealth should have the opportunity to make income without a tax liability as against those who do not have any wealth is absurd, unfair and preposterous. All on this side of the House understand that very well. Unfortunately for members of the Opposition, most of them understand it very well, too. They understand that it is not fair. It is not fair that a person can gain income in that way and not be taxed with a tax liability that might be as much as 47c in the dollar. That could become zero if the Leader of the Opposition were successful-God forbid-in becoming Prime Minister. People have to understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we came to government the greatest growth industry in Australia was tax avoidance. Why was the tax avoidance industry flourishing? Why was everybody into bottom of the harbour schemes? Why was that possible during the 1970s and 1980s? It was possible because there was no capital gains tax. One was able to defer profits into capital, realise the capital gain and incur no tax liability. That is not a possibility that is open to anybody unless he happens to have considerable wealth. It is not possible for the pensioner in my electorate to have access to that sort of scheme. It is not possible for the person struggling to buy his own house. It is possible for those who deal in the share market in a very substantial way and for people who are wealthy to take advantage of that in a whole lot of ways. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we find in the Economic Action Plan? We find the abolition of capital gains tax and its replacement with a speculative gains tax, with a five-year phase-out resulting in a loss to revenue next year of $450m. Even accepting the Opposition's figures, that is a substantial amount. Again, the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review suggests that the total capital gains liability is about $25 billion. What is going to happen if the Opposition is successful in instituting this policy? We are going to find a mass of people rushing to realise their capital gains over a short period. An inefficiency in the taxation system will be created. There will be a distortion in investment that locks in those capital gains for the next six months. If the Opposition is successful, people will rush out and realise their capital gains and there will be a distortion of the way people plan their future because of the five-year phase-out time. This is not a system that in any way increases the equity of the taxation system. It is not a proposal that in any way increases the efficiency of the system. It creates a distortion. It opens up for all the friends of those on the other side opportunities for avoiding their taxation responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Sturt is a decent fellow. During the debate I must have asked him half a dozen times, `What about this?'. He would not respond because he knows very clearly that this is unfair, that it is a rort. There will be a loss to revenue at a time when we are looking for fiscal restraint, at a time when the hairy-chested members of the Opposition are saying that there must be more substantial fiscal restraint, that we must cut down on expenditure. There are two ways in which a Budget surplus can be created. It can be created by increasing Budget revenue, by holding one's revenue base, or by cutting outlays. Indeed, as I said before, it was like waiting for Godot. As we know, Godot never came. We were waiting, waiting, waiting for the Opposition's fiscal response. We find that the Opposition's response said, `We will take $2.5m from here, give it back there, and there is no change to fiscal policy'. If there will be no change to fiscal policy under the policy of the Opposition, where is the adjustment going to lie? Is it going to be in interest rates, in monetary policy, or will it be in the area of wages? The suggestion is that the wages area is where the Opposition will make its mark. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer suggested yesterday, it is absurd to suggest that if enterprise bargaining is the way to go a group like the pilots will take the view, `There is a Liberal Government in Canberra. We will only ask for 5 per cent instead of 30 per cent'. Of course they will ask for 30 per cent. The position will be the same as it always has been with those opposite-appeasement, and the Opposition will pay it and it will flow through. Then where will the Opposition stand? That is what the Opposition has always done, and it knows it. How can the Opposition justify abolishing capital gains tax, which is eminently fair? How are capital gains any different from other income? It is eminently fair, and the Opposition knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> Other issues related to provisional tax are included in this legislation. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) mentioned the tear-jerking case of the widow in his electorate who only had $300,000 to invest. She had to pay provisional tax on her investment of $300,000. That was on top of her house and everything else she owned. Of course, the honourable member for Curtin comes from the leafy suburbs of Perth, where people have those sorts of substantial assets. I do not have any difficulty with her having to pay provisional tax. Provisional tax does not have to be paid for the first time in the year that the income is earned. There is a one-off impost, when the payment is substantial, but from then on it is a fair and reasonable way in which tax is levied. It means that people have to pay their share. Why is that a problem? In respect of provisional tax, we have increased the threshold so that fewer people have to make quarterly payments. We have made it easier and more efficient for them. Where is the difficulty? In respect of this legislation, there is no difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill contains the Medicare levy amendment, which continues, until such time as there is a change, the 1.25 per cent levy on income. Within this legislation there are also some increases in the threshold at which one has to pay the levy. It sets in concrete the fact that we have said that we will not increase the levy and that the levy is an important part of our social program. The honourable member for Curtin said that we were being deceitful and dishonest and that we should say to people that the Medicare levy does not cover all the costs of providing health care. That is right; we have never denied that. That is the case. What is dishonest is the Opposition suggesting that it will put in place private health insurance which in some way will cover all that cost. All it will be doing is shifting from public expenditure into private expenditure, putting a requirement on people to take out private insurance, which will be much more substantial than the Medicare levy. Why did the Opposition not say when it was in government and we had a private health insurance scheme--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Five of them over seven years, just as we now have the fifth shadow Minister for community services and health in the six years of this Government. The Opposition cannot get its act together. Just as it had a health insurance scheme that included private health insurance, why did it never make it clear to people that that did not fully cover the costs of their health care? It was heavily subsidised. When a patient got a cheque from the Hospital Benefits Fund or whoever paid it to him, there was a significant subsidy in that from the government; there always has been. We did not have a private health scheme then; we had one subsidised by the Government. Similarly, at the moment the chemists are subsidised by way of public expenditure. They are asking for more and more, and are being supported in their claim by the Opposition. If we are to be responsible about the way in which money is spent in this country, let us consider the way in which that expenditure occurs and let us be sensible about public funding. Let us not take the open cheque book approach, the approach that lets it go like crazy. There must be a considerable amount of fiscal restraint. One must restrain the way in which expenditure occurs. We have a history of doing that-a history of fairness-and that is what we stand for.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting this legislation. The Opposition does not oppose these three Bills-the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989, the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 and the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989. I point out to the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) that the Opposition has a very good capital gains tax policy in its tax package which, of course, is a brilliant package. The Government has no policy on tax, other than to increase taxation continually and to send this country to rack and ruin. Today's balance of payments figures continue to highlight that fact. Moody's Investors Service and the other credit rating agencies continue to downgrade our credit rating. Of course, this builds up and has an excessive effect on the standard of living of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These new taxation measures do nothing but lower our standard of living. I point out to the honourable member for Perth that I do not believe there should be a capital gains tax. It is amazing that there is a hue and cry in this country when those from other nations wish to invest here. It is amazing that people do not want Japanese capital to be invested here, yet we are not allowed to invest our own capital without it being taxed. It is amazing that the big corporations in Australia have record levels of overseas capital investment. Their capital is leaving this country at record rates. This year, $15 billion was invested overseas by Australian companies. As we are such a young nation-we are only 200 years old-why should we not have a system whereby we can invest, make some money and create some capital? Without capital, we will get nowhere. That has been shown under the present Government, because we are going nowhere under it. It is going round and round in circles. It has a tax policy that is driving interest rates through the roof. Interest rates are at the 22 to 23 per cent level. Companies such as the Bond Corporation are going bankrupt. We see that Skase is on the skids. Any decent company that has been prepared to invest some capital-Skase invested in tourism in Queensland-is now bankrupt because of the high interest rate regime under the present Government. As someone who is in business, I cannot wait to see it go out of office. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully support the capital gains tax arrangement that the Opposition has put in place, although it is something that probably should be abolished as time goes by. There is nothing that we need more in this nation than continuing amounts of capital to create work and exports. How on earth will we be able to improve our balance of payments situation if we do not create more exports? Last month we saw a record balance of payments figure of $2.5 billion. The figure announced today was $1.7 billion, which is a billion dollars higher than it was at the same time last year. </PARA>
<PARA> We met with representatives of the National Farmers Federation at lunchtime today. They told us in no uncertain terms that the people of this nation are in for more shocks. If the balance of payments figure is not brought down, we will have to pay more taxation. That is what these Bills are all about-more taxes. Unfortunately, we hear that the wheat crop will be well down this year because of the dry weather, so we will not achieve the big income figure from that area that we expected. The wool market has fallen on its nose. The Australian Wool Corporation has nearly a million bales of wool in stock. The Chinese and the Russians have stopped buying wool. The amount of money we are receiving from beef sales is falling. The Americans are taking more of our beef market in Japan. The Koreans closed the market for a time. We are having greater difficulty in building our exports and balancing imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we continue to import because people are not encouraged to invest capital and thus create exports. I think it is an absolute nonsense that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that his Government would not introduce a capital gains tax. He told us that on national television two or three times, yet he turned around and introduced one. Although the family home was exempted, that is a distortion in the tax system. If one wants to argue about fairness in the tax system, as the honourable member for Perth did, one should take note of that distortion. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Bills we are debating is the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1989. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has introduced a new pay as you earn system whereby companies with annual PAYE remittances exceeding $5m a year will be required to remit twice monthly tax instalment deductions made from wages and salaries. It is of no help to businesses to tell them that they must work out and submit twice monthly tax instalment deductions. They have enough to do, even on a yearly basis, without having to perform these tasks twice a month. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were introduced to help the Treasurer to boost his surplus. It brings forward the collection of about half a billion dollars in PAYE tax from companies in this financial year. The whole Budget was toffied up by the Treasurer so that he could stand up in this House and announce a record surplus. His reason for doing so is beyond my imagination. I cannot see why we need the enormous surpluses that those on both sides of the House-the Opposition and the Government-are talking about. We are not in government yet, but we will be after the next election. I cannot see why we need these enormous surpluses. It just amounts to more taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all right if the funds are being used to pay off some of the debt that Government members have created. But they create a massive debt and then turn around and tax the people to death in order to pay it back. What sort of management of the economy is that? Some smaller companies are exempt from this change to the PAYE collections system. Large businesses will be penalised. As I mentioned, it is being introduced to increase the Government's surplus. The Government's stated objective is to reduce the frequency of PAYE remittances for small business. Obviously, small business welcomes this. However, the collection of tax has been made harder and harder, and companies are expected to submit collection quicker and quicker. We are practically paying it per day in order to keep the Treasury out of economic difficulties as it sucks in more and more revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 imposes rates of income tax payable by individuals and other tax units for the 1989-90 financial year. These are unfunded tax cuts. Hopefully, some tax reduction is involved in this amendment to the Income Tax Act. The third piece of legislation we are debating is the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1989. The basic rate of Medicare levy continues to be 1.25 per cent of our total personal tax payments. It is interesting that one component of our medical well-being, the chemists, are meeting at Parliament House today to protest about the Government's iniquitous measures. The Government has made it more and more difficult for the chemists to operate. It has basically socialised the chemists and then turned around and put the screws on them, yet it wonders why they cannot perform and serve the public. Unfortunately, I notice that my doctor friend the honourable member for Perth has left the chamber. The Government has done the same thing to the medical profession. Members of that profession scream every now and again that they are not getting enough out of the system. I think the chemists have a good argument in their favour. It is up to the Government to continue to pay them a fair dispensing fee. In actual fact, they are agents of the Government. They dispense free medicine to the people. Many needy people rely on these medicines, although there is a lot of abuse of the system. I would like to think that the Government could clean up some of the abuses. I would like to take the chance to congratulate Mr Russell Cooper on his election as Premier of Queensland. He is the member for Roma, in my electorate. Queensland is the lowest taxing State in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He can talk all right. It is amazing how business continues to go to Queensland because it is the lowest taxing State. Queensland was the first State to abolish death duties. The capital gains tax introduced by this Federal Government is only a form of death duty. As soon as people transfer capital from one person or company to another they will be taxed. It is a death duty in disguise. The National Party in Queensland was forward looking enough to abolish death duties. An enormous number of people still come up to Queensland to establish businesses and live, under the National Party Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People go to Queensland to retire. Unfortunately, we all have to die somewhere. Most people go to the sunshine State to retire. Queensland exports for July-the latest figures I have-were valued at $793m, which was a slight fall. Queensland accounted for 19.8 per cent of Australia's exports in June. I wish to highlight the fact that those exports are all taxed, so they all add to the wealth of this nation. Our imports were $341m in the same month, which was down somewhat: Queensland accounts for 8.2 per cent of Australia's imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Queensland is a developing State. Unfortunately, we have to pay some of these new taxes that have been imposed. The coalition's policy on abolishing the coal tax is very welcome, particularly in my electorate. This Government imposes $52m in tax on the open cut coalmines at Blackwater in my electorate. They are the only mines forced to pay this iniquitous tax. The Opposition's policy is to abolish that tax after the next election. I am sure that more companies will then be prepared to invest there. It is amazing how business, when restraints are taken away from them, are prepared to invest their money, to get on with the job and create some jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wants to stop mining and development. A company tried to get a goldmine going in Kakadu the other day and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) was the only bloke with enough guts to get up publicly and say that he supported it. I would like to support him 100 per cent. He is the only person on the Government's front bench with any commonsense at all when it comes to resource issues-or most issues, actually. At least he is prepared to get up and tell the people of this nation what he thinks should be done. There should be mining there. The mine in question is not even in Kakadu National Park. A lot of nonsense is written in the newspapers about mining in the park. This mine is not in the park; it was never in the park. It should be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> We had an announcement today that Australia's balance of payments deficit is $1.7 billion-that is debt, not credit. Yet this Government sits back and makes a green announcement, just prior to the election, about not being able to create another mine. This is like the uranium mine policy: it is a disaster for the nation. Slowly but surely, we are daily going bankrupt. We should encourage miners from around the world to come here and use our resources. Areas like Kakadu can be mined and rehabilitated. I worked there years ago. There are lumps of minerals all over the place. There are outcrops of mineral all over the Kakadu area. If someone knocked half a dozen off we would not even know they had gone. But here is a potential mine with $1 billion worth of natural resources in it. We are desperate for income to improve the balance of payments and we have to slug the Australian people through new taxation Bills because we are not able to mine and develop these resources. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot have it both ways. We hand out $20 billion or $30 billion in social security payments. To do all that we have to earn some income. We have to earn some wealth first in order to do that. I strongly support the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy for his stance on mining in the Northern Territory. It is the best thing I have heard from a Minister of this Government for a long time. Those on this side of the House give him full support, and I am sure the Australian people do too. We have long gone past the day where we can selectively decide not to mine here or develop there. We have to develop sensibly. There is no reason why that cannot be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland is one of the leading tourist States. Tourism is helping our balance of payments and it is keeping our taxation down by earning overseas revenue, which helps us lift our standard of living-or at least hold it. Under this Government our standard of living has fallen continually, as the figures tell us. We have a fantastic tourist industry, built up over a number of years, which has been encouraged by the abolition of death duties and capital gains taxes in Queensland under Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the very good National Party Government in that State. We have seen a boom in tourism, with $5 billion being invested last year. What do we see now? We see an airline strike sponsored by this Government. It is an absolute disgrace. We are being told now that the airlines will not be back in the air until some time after Easter next year. It is an absolute abomination. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding), who is at the table, should know. He should tell me when the pilots will go back to work. He is a member of the Government. He is the tourism Minister. He should tell me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As usual, we have heard a scintillating speech from the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron). I am one of the people in this Parliament who will miss him after the next election. I was on his side. I always thought he was a decent sort of bloke. I cannot understand why the good folks up in Queensland tossed him out. I will miss him. Today's was one of his better speeches. He started off with capital gains and ended up with the pilots, ranging over everything in between. It was very entertaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I want to focus on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. In particular, I want to look at the current debate, which I am sure will continue when my friend and colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) announces the Opposition's health policy for the next election. The debate has been raging in Australia for quite some time, and I would like to pick up some of the main points as I see them. The people who talk about private insurance always have in the back of their minds-even though they may not say it-that the private sector can do many things more efficiently than the public sector. In many cases I would agree. There is no doubt about that. In any market oriented delivery of services or goods I think the private sector is more efficient. But we must understand that health insurance is not one of those industries, if I can call it that, that are private enterprise industries. When one considers health insurance vis-a-vis the rest of the private sector, two major characteristics are lacking. The first, of course, is that private health insurance funds have never been able to make a profit. In fact, it is written into the legislation that they cannot make a profit. The profit motive is just not there. A profit is not permitted to be made. The second thing, of course, is something called the community rating principle, which really means that a health insurance fund, in its charges, cannot differentiate between the users of the service. That is, the same amount is charged to someone who is fit, healthy and young as is charged to someone who is old and who uses those services quite a bit. It can be seen that those two characteristics in particular make health insurance different from the private sector-very much different. Because it is so heavily regulated in those terms, it cannot be compared with the rest of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> From there one goes to the efficiency of health insurance. When the efficiency of health insurance is being considered, the distinction really has to be made between health insurance and health delivery. I am not talking about the delivery of health services, although I will refer to that later. I am now talking about the efficiency of the health insurance system. The purpose of health insurance, of course, is to share the risks-that is, to pool resources and share the risks that we all face: at some time or other we might have to undergo medical treatment. I suggest to the House that the way in which the efficiency of health insurance is measured is to look at how much of that insurance money goes to paying medical bills. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems self-evident to me that the less that is spent on administration, the more efficient health insurance is. For example, under the Canadian Medicare scheme, 2c of every dollar is spent on administration. In Australia, Medicare spends 4c of every dollar on administration. The private insurance systems, when they existed, were spending 14c of every dollar. They are not my figures or the Government's figures; they are from the Consumer Health Forum. It can be seen that at present Medicare spends 4c in every dollar compared with 14c in every dollar that was spent by the private funds. In terms of getting the insurance dollar to where it is supposed to be, that is very much more efficient in terms of paying medical bills. However, one cannot insure if the costs are unknown. The simple fact is-I will return to this a little later-that health insurance in Australia, under any system, private or public, has never been comprehensive enough to pay the doctor's bill. All it has ever done is got within spitting distance, really, of some doctors' bills, and never got anywhere near some others. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation also recommits the Government to collecting 1.25c of Medicare levy. That has not increased, but in terms of paying, in terms of the cost of health insurance for Australians, it can be seen that it is very equitable in that the more money a person earns, the more money he pays. It is very progressive in that way. People on low incomes are exempted altogether. The cost of health insurance is not a burden on the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the health insurance matters that really should be considered is accessibility. Studies show that the Canadian experience is that where charges in excess of the schedule fee occur, accessibility, particularly for people on low incomes, is very much inhibited. Charging more than the schedule fee really means that people on low incomes do not have equal access to many of those services. One needs to look at some examples to really appreciate just what happens when significant charges over and above the schedule fee are made. I have a couple of examples here. The first relates to item No. 514, for which the schedule fee is $74. The anaesthetist charged $135, or 182 per cent above the schedule fee. How would a person feel if he had a rather major operation such as heart surgery for which the schedule fee was $745 and he received a bill for $2,000, which is $1,300 over and above the schedule fee? The person would not be feeling too good when he got out of hospital-not from a financial point of view; I would hope that the operation was a success. That represents a charge which is a massive 268 per cent above the schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that there is absolutely no restriction on what can be charged-usually by specialists; I am not having a go at general practitioners, because by and large they are the people who are sticking to the schedule fee and are bulk billing. Another example relates to item No. 8598, rhinoplasty. The schedule fee was $555. The charge was $2,000, which is 360 per cent above the schedule fee. I will not continue with that, but I think that serves to illustrate that when specialists charge above the schedule fee to the extent that they have, they not only impose a very significant financial burden on their patients but also knock back accessibility, because no-one on low income could afford to pay over and above the schedule fee. It is not as though Medicare underinsures. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example, I will detail Medicare-only incomes for selected occupations; that is, only what Medicare pays. These specialists can obtain income from four to five other areas. An obstetrician received $219,000 from Medicare; a dermatologist, $231,000; an anaesthetist, $118,000; a plastic surgeon-the one who charged $2,000 for a $555 operation-$210,000; an ophthalmologist, $244,000. If the House looks at those amounts, it will see that those specialists are not underpaid. I have to say that those figures are gross figures and that the costs of running the practices have to come out of them. However, at a minimum, $30,000 could be added to most of those incomes, even if they never exceeded the schedule fee. Medicare does not underinsure, but certain specialists overcharge. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite recently we heard the old re-run about long waiting lists. I point out to the House the efficiency of our hospitals. The issue of long waiting lists is one of those things that are trumped up by some doctors in particular to try to make out that Medicare is failing. When the efficiency of our hospitals is considered, it will be seen that 3 1/2 million Australians go through our hospitals every year-the highest per capita number in the world. Per capita, there are more Australians in hospital than any other race on the face of the earth. It is a staggering 218 out of every 1,000. It is not public servants or politicians who put people into hospitals; it is the medical profession itself. There are more private hospital beds now than ever before. If there are long waiting lists and if private enterprise is being considered, it seems to me that, if private enterprise was working efficiently, it would move in and say, `We will provide those beds and we will do it at a cost which is less than what the public sector can do it for.' But private enterprise does not do that. The question that really has to be asked is: How efficient is the private sector? It seems to me that, in an instance such as that, it is not being very efficient at all, because certainly, if it was good enough, it would take up the slack. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned also about an article which contained comments by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Tangney in last Saturday's West Australian. The article is headed, `Hospital Crisis Claimed'. I am not all that worried about what the shadow Minister has to say, but Dr Jones, the Western Australian President of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), said this:</PARA>
<PARA> The swing away from private insurance is putting massive pressure on public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at waiting lists. If honourable members really want to have a look at the AMA's role in waiting lists, they have only to look at the Sun-Herald of 16 October last year, which carried an article about the rebel surgeons, as they were called, who went back into the public system under the $12m that the Greiner Government gave them. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The return of the rebel surgeons-who quit the public hospitals in the 1984 doctors' strike-is aimed at reducing the hospital waiting list of 40,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Health Department secretary Michael Rosser predicted the waiting list would be cut by 10,000 within a year of the surgeons' return. </PARA>
<PARA>One really has to ask oneself whether the AMA is all that concerned about waiting lists when it can go on strike in the way that it has, and the Health Department secretary reckons that the waiting list can be slashed by 10,000 because these blokes have gone back to work. I raise that as background to this argument about waiting lists. Of course, it is a complete furphy because, as I have said before, we have never shifted more people through our hospitals than are being shifted now. It amounts to some 3.5 million Australians every year. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that when Dr Jones talks about the number of people who are eligible for private insurance he knows that in Western Australia, in December 1983, 443,000 people, representing 32.3 per cent of Western Australians, had private hospital insurance. That was before Medicare was introduced. The latest figure shows that 621,000, or 39.2 per cent of people in Western Australia, now have private hospital coverage. We have seen a massive increase in the number of people who can go to a private hospital because they have insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have to consider in this whole debate, when we throw up figures about the number of people with private insurance, is the number of people who can go to a private hospital because they have insurance. The figures, which have been supplied by the Health Insurance Commission, are accurate. The best thing one can say about Dr Jones's comments is that they are scaremongering. The worst thing one can say about them is that he is lying. It is simply not true that waiting lists in Western Australia or in any other State are due to the lack of people having private insurance. The facts do not support the argument. At present more people in Australia have private hospital coverage than was the case before Medicare was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do so many people who are privately insured go into public hospitals? I have been told that 46 per cent of people in public hospitals are privately insured. Although they could go into a private hospital they choose to go into a public hospital. According to the literature that is about nowadays, many people do so because they have more faith in public hospitals, because public hospitals are better resourced. I know that a significant number of doctors would rather work in the private hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to my appearance on a show on 6PR in Perth last week I received a phone call to the effect that Dr Jones-I do not know whether this is true, but I would like him to refute it, if he can-has a vested interest in private hospitals because he is a director of the Markalinga hospital chain, one of the three biggest in Australia. I am told that it owns the Mount Hospital. There is nothing wrong with that. I do not criticise him for being a director of a private hospital. However, if he takes part in public debate he should make that fact known. Vested interests should be known by people listening to the argument. As I have said, the facts do not support his argument. </PARA>
<PARA> When one compares private health insurance with public health insurance one should look at a country that has a private health insurance system, such as the United States of America. One should compare such a country with Australia which at present has a public system. Currently the United States spends just under 12 per cent of its gross domestic product on its health system. Australia spends 7 1/2 per cent. If Australia were to spend at the same rate as America does we would spend $15 billion more on health care than we do. I am not saying that any private system in Australia has ever spent at that rate, but it makes an interesting comparison when one looks at private insurance versus public insurance. I know, from articles that I have read and from what people have told me, that if any country is looking around to see whether it can improve its health insurance system, it is America. The Americans are looking very closely at the Canadian system. Senator Eddie Kennedy is leading the charge in his State to try to move to a public system. As I said at the outset, when one considers health insurance one should look at a system which cuts down on the cost of administration. It has been proved in Australia and in Canada that in terms of medical insurance public systems are much more efficient than private systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing with private systems-and we have had a number in this country-is that not everyone is insured. Also, everybody pays the same rate. Therefore, people on low incomes are very much at a disadvantage compared with those on high incomes. I do not think that even my friend from Tangney would look at the AMA's medicover proposal. It is really medimadness. Who could sell such a proposal? One of the features of the proposal, which was floated quite recently but then dropped out of sight-I have not heard about it since and I do not think we will hear about it again-was that the system would be compulsory and privately run. People would have to be in it, but it would be run by private organisations. Another feature was that each organisation had to charge the same rate. So even if one believes that there may be some efficiencies in private health insurance, the AMA's stipulation was that efficiencies in one organisation cannot be passed on to those who pay the insurance; that is out. Private systems suffer from that restriction on the way they are run when compared with other privately run organisations in the economy. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

It was more than just parliamentary jargon because, outside of party lines, we are friends and, in a broader sense, colleagues.

Cryptically, he is known in the health portfolio as the doctors' friend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the only problems I can identify in terms of the honourable member for Canning is that he has an ideological bent against one of the helping and caring professions of the country. He wastes a lot of his time, like his colleague the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett), in the popular sport, at least on Labor Party benches, of doctor bashing. It is matched only by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), who has now invented a new sport of pharmacy bashing. But I leave that to one side. I hope that the honourable member is not going to leave the chamber, because I would like him to hear some of the points I want to make in response to his arguments about the efficiency of the health insurance industry, the number of people who are privately insured and the United States of America health model. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the opportunity to debate the Bill only because of the Opposition's success when we were considering the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1987. At that time the Government attempted to legislate for automatic increases in the Medicare levy which would have taken this Bill off the parliamentary agenda on an annual basis. Thankfully, the Australian Democrats supported the Opposition in the Senate, and we have put the Government in the proper position of having to relegislate on an annual basis for the levy. The Government has done that, and we do not oppose the Bill or the Government relegislating for the 1.25 per cent Medicare levy or the amendments that will change the income levels under which that levy impacts. When we come to the order of the day arising out of the cognate debate, I will move a second reading amendment in relation to the Bill, and my contribution is predicated on the moving of that amendment. I will move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>`whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern that despite its increasing cost Medicare is delivering a lower level of health care, particularly to the poor and needy;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which will rob the community of high quality pharmaceutical services;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls upon the Government to ensure that all Australians receive the high quality, affordable health care to which they are entitled'. </PARA>
<PARA>Having foreshadowed that I will be moving that second reading amendment, I return to the first point which is that this House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) expresses its concern that despite its increasing cost Medicare is delivering a lower level of health care, particularly to the poor and the needy;</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the cost because since the Government has been in power there has been a veritable cost explosion. In 1983-84, the year prior to the introduction of Medicare-I draw all figures from the relevant Budget Papers-the Commonwealth's total outlays on health were $4.3 billion. In the year that Medicare was introduced, that jumped to $6.1 billion, and we have now arrived at the position where in the last Budget we are spending just short of $11.8 billion. This explosion of costs cannot be explained away, or even understood, by the increase of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA> If I can convert the explosion of costs into percentages, in 1982-83 we were spending 6.9 per cent of total Budget outlays through the health portfolio and, now that we are spending just short of $11.8 billion dollars, that has jumped dramatically to 13.6 per cent of total government outlays. As I am the shadow Minister for health, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that I have had several opportunities, and I will continue to have opportunities, to talk about Medicare and its deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> In earlier speeches I have talked about the financial unsustainability of Medicare. Without repeating all of the contributions I have made, I reiterate one rhetorical question. For that amount of money, we expect that we would have the best, you beaut, bolted down, shut tight, health system one could ever hope to find. The sad reality is that we do not. We are spending $11.8 billion of taxpayers' money-because that is what it is; the Government does not have any money of its own; it can spend only what it raises by taxes or borrowings, and borrowings in turn have to be repaid by taxes-and one would think we would have the best system known to man or woman. Regrettably, we have far from it. </PARA>
<PARA> The single biggest indicator of the deficiencies of the current health system, presided over as it is by Medicare, is public hospital waiting lists. People in the health care professions-health care administrators and State government officials-reliably and conservatively state that approximately 100,000 people around the country are now languishing on public hospital waiting lists awaiting surgery of one kind or another. We are told that it is elective surgery, it is not life threatening surgery, so they can wait for it, and obviously there will never always be a bed for everyone who wants one just when he wants it. To tell aged people that a hip replacement, upon which they are totally dependent for their mobility, is something that they can wait for, is not something that I would be prepared to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I get another contribution from the honourable member for Phillip-I understand her anxiety to maximise her speaking opportunities in this place by interjecting during my contribution, because after the next election she will not be here-I invite her to keep quiet while I continue my remarks. I would not want to tell someone that a hip replacement was something that he could wait for, and certainly I do not want to live in a society that says, `Just languish and wait in the queue, in an immobile state, until we come up with a public hospital bed for you'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would not want to tell aged people who are waiting for cataract operations, upon which their sight is totally dependent, to wait in the queue. I would not want to tell the parents of a young person injured in a road accident that that person will have to languish in the casualty department, or perhaps we could ring around to see whether another hospital could fit that person in. That is the reality in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Canning said, as he always does when we identify deficiencies in the system-he did not dispute that this was not the case-that it was the doctors' fault. I have news for him. I spend almost all of my non-parliamentary time visiting health care sites and public and private hospitals around the country. The reason I speak with such gravity and confidence on this point is that the people who are in the front of the queue telling me about this waiting list problem are not doctors but public hospital administrators, who have to preside over this crisis, and they simply do not know what to do because the beds are not available. That is the first point. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that public hospital waiting lists are an example that we do not have the best system possible. Because the Government has been faced with a cost blow-out, and throughout its entire period of office has been ideologically unwilling to face up to that central core cost blow-out due to Medicare, it has been trying to curb and curtail costs at the margin. That is why, in almost every Budget or economic statement, we get changes to the medical benefits schedule, whether it is to cut back on pathology, as it did in 1986, to cut back on a whole series of items, as it did in the May mini-Budget in 1987, to constantly attack doctors' incomes, or-to bring us right up to date-to try to save money on the pharmaceuticals benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the second part of our proposed amendment, which condemns the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, in a debate during which we are talking about Medicare, is that the two issues are intimately related. Because the Government is unwilling ideologically and politically to face up to the central core problem, it is desperately trying to curtail costs at the margin and to pick any identifiable area in the health portfolio where it can save money. For the Government to admit that there is anything wrong with the public hospital system or with Medicare would be to admit that the Government got it wrong during its period of office. The Government is not prepared to make that admission late in its electoral cycle. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is terrific for many people as long as they do not get sick and, importantly, as long as they do not require a public hospital bed. The honourable member for Canning, during his contribution, ignoring all of the deficiencies of Medicare, made the point that we have to stay with a public health insurance system because it is far more efficient and because public health insurance systems spend far less of their moneys on administration and, therefore, are more efficient. It is true that public health insurance systems spend less on administration than do private health funds. However, if I were the administrator of a private health fund, if I had compulsory contributions from the entire Australian community, if I did not have to advertise to get contributors and if I did not have to go out into the marketplace to compete against other health funds that were also advertising for contributors, I could save a hell of a lot of money too on my administration costs. </PARA>
<PARA> If the compulsory income tax arrangements under which the Medicare levy is garnisheed from the Australian community were removed and if compulsory income tax from which the majority of health expenditure derives were removed-despite what honourable members might think or hope, the Medicare levy has never fully funded the system. I can recall that back in 1984, we were promised that the Medicare levy, which was then one per cent, would largely fund the system; but it never did. Although the Medicare levy is now at 1.25 per cent, it raises only 22 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays on health. The majority, 78 per cent, comes out of general consolidated revenue that is paid for by our taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the honourable member for Canning is in his office listening to me. The point that I am making in response to his contribution is that he does not recognise the absolute rolled gold competitive advantage that Medicare has because of its compulsory contributor base and the fact that it does not, in any administrative sense, have to go out and collect the money. The Australian Taxation Office does that for it. I could put aside my ideological perspective on health and say, `Yes, let us have a totally public system', if I could be guaranteed that a totally public system would meet all the needs. However, it already falls far short of the community's needs. The cruellist irony is that the people whom a public health insurance system should be looking after, namely, the aged and the disadvantaged, are the very people who are being pushed further and further to the end of those public hospital waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole problem relates to the drop-out rate or the lack of uptake of private health insurance. The honourable member for Canning, for whom I have affection and respect, really is asking us to read too much into what he says when he simply cites gross numbers of people who have private insurance in this country. For the country's sake, I hope that, as our population grows, there will be more people than before. Even year 2 students can understand that if there are more people, there are more people. I hope also that, if there are more people, more people will be privately insured than there were before. </PARA>
<PARA> A consideration of the percentages of people who are privately insured reveals a completely different understanding of the problem. Prior to the introduction of Medicare, 61.5 per cent of the population was privately insured. That figure is now just above 45 per cent of the population. Therein lies the root of the problem. Medicare as we know it is unsustainable. Even with the money that we now spend, we cannot meet all of the demands and needs in the community. Because the Government cannot keep pace with the outlays that are required, it is desperately trying to save money. There will never be enough public moneys. The whole imbalance in the health-care system is the big drop in the numbers of people who are privately insured. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party has not approached this problem from some ideological binge from the Right. People such as the honourable member for Canning and those who populate organisations such as the Consumer Health Forum of Australia raise the great bogey of the American health system. Perhaps the private doctors association might hanker for an American type environment, but the Liberal and National parties certainly do not. We have never, ever talked about tearing about Medicare and going to a totally private, risk-rated system in which large percentages of the population are underinsured. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Liberal and National parties may be many things, but we are not slow learners. One of the things that the Liberal Party has learnt from Medibank and Medicare is that never again in this country must we ever allow people to be uninsured, as occurred during the Liberal Party's last period of government. It made a mistake on that point. Never again should we allow people to be underinsured, as occurred during the Liberal Party's last period in government. However, if the Government believes that it is possible to have a totally public health-care system with people continually dropping out of private health insurance, it must think again. The Medicare system is sending the country broke and is delivering a lesser quality of service. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the solution? It is staring us in the face. It is simply to return to a better balance between public and private health insurance. It is not to tear up Medicare or to run off and try to graft the American model onto the Australian system. Indeed, it is not to look at any international example. The solution is to return to what used to work well in this country, but with the improvements that I have mentioned, namely, everybody being insured at a comprehensive level for both medical and hospital treatment. That is the thrust of Liberal Party policy, which is well known and will be taken to the next election. The Liberal Party will retain and improve Medicare. At the end of the day, Medicare will focus on the aged and disadvantaged, who are the very people who should be looked after at a better level than they are being looked after at the moment. For the rest of Australians-and I include you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and me in that-they will be encouraged to go back to private health insurance or to stay in private health insurance with the assistance of a taxation rebate. If that sensible, balanced policy is implemented, the right mix between publicly and privately funding the system will be achieved, together with the third point of this proposed amendment. All Australians will receive high quality, affordable health care to which they are entitled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been extremely difficult for me to sit here and remain silent during that contribution by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). I have had a lot of trouble restraining myself. Now I have a chance to speak up, and I assure the honourable member for Tangney that I will be back here well and truly after the next election and I will be saying these very same things. The shadow Minister for health said that the Liberal Party supports the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill; in other words, that it supports the Medicare levy. He said, `We have never, ever, ever'-I believe that is the number of times he used the word ever-`said that we will abolish Medicare'. That is like Fraser saying that he would never abolish Medibank; he was not game to abolish it. The Opposition parties are not game to tell the Australian public that they will abolish Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me remind honourable members of what the honourable member for Tangney has been saying about Medicare and the levy. On 3 September during the Face to Face program, the honourable member for Tangney said, `Medicare will be retained'. Honourable members will hear that said bet- ween now and the election. The honourable member went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by the abolition of the separate Medicare levy and by the offering of a taxation rebate to assist people to pay their private health insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether that is what the honourable member is going to tell the electorate. In an article in a magazine called The Australian Private Doctor of January-February 1989, headed `Opposition will end Medicare', the honourable member for Tangney promised a group of health professionals that in power he would abolish Medicare while encouraging Australians to reinsure themselves with private health funds. In this address to doctors and professionals from the country's top medico-political organisations, the hon- ourable member revealed that the poor and needy would be cashed up by the Government so they could secure their own private health insurance. That is what the honourable member told the private doctors. But I am sure he has told the public today and the Parliament something quite different. In a press release on 21 September he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Medicare is unsustainable-</PARA>
<PARA>he said that a minute ago-</PARA>
<PARA>in its present form and must be changed in order to protect the health care interests of pensioners and other low income earners . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at what Medicare has been doing as we discuss this Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, and let us see what it has done for the pensioners and other low income earners. This Bill-supported by the Opposition, despite its promises to abolish the Medicare levy-implements the annual increase in the threshold above which the Medicare levy is imposed. The levy remains unchanged at 1.25 per cent but the threshold is raised from $9,560 to $10,330. For people with a spouse or dependants, it is raised from $16,110 to $17,400. The Bill maintains the basic fairness of Medicare. That is the best aspect of Medicare-it is fair. The better off people are, the more they pay proportionately. Those who earn very little pay no levy. It protects those people at the bottom of the income scale-those people who could not afford medical insurance under the Liberals; the two million Australians who had no health insurance before Medicare was introduced. As Helen Szoke, the co-ordinator of the Health Issues Centre, said, that is two million reasons for Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare has been one of the successful programs initiated by this Government. That is why it was so hard to sit here and restrain myself while the honourable member for Tangney said what he said. And to think that he is going to go out and say those things in public! Medicare has been successful in many ways. As shown by a survey in August this year, 71 per cent of Australians support Medicare, and that support is growing. It has grown by 4 per cent since 1988. In fact, most people would like to see the scope of Medicare extended to cover dental and optical expenses. Now the Opposition, because of that public support, is going to go out and pretend to the public that it will keep it. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare has been successful, too, in containing costs. These are facts that should be put to the shadow Minister. In the ANU Reporter of September 1989 there was a report on a working paper of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health-the NCEPH. It was a paper by Dr John Deeble, senior research fellow at that centre. He concludes that Australia's record in controlling health care costs has been remarkable. The Reporter says that this conclusion arose from the analysis of the performance of Medicare-it is an analysis, not something that someone has just plucked out of the air and tried to kid the public with-in the light of the proposals of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) for an alternative scheme called Medicover which would replace the present public insurance system with a private one. Dr Deeble says:</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare has achieved universal coverage for medical and hospital care with simplicity, equity and very low administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The ANU Reporter article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>On the medical side, costs have been remarkably close to estimates-for the five years to 1988-89, cumulative expenditure was only 1 per cent over budget. No other demand-driven government program has approached this level of stability, let alone a new program-</PARA>
<PARA>with all the problems that that creates-</PARA>
<PARA> The underlying rate of growth in doctors' services was about 3.4 per cent per person per annum which, while relatively high, was almost exactly the same rate as for the preceding 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a one-off increase of about 3 per cent in total medical services use in the first two years of Medicare as previously uninsured people became covered-</PARA>
<PARA>the two million we are talking about-</PARA>
<PARA> However, this was anticipated-</PARA>
<PARA>because Medicare was a properly thought out program-</PARA>
<PARA>and was a very small effect for such a major program. </PARA>
<PARA>The additional cost to the nation was only about $120m annually on present prices, most of which appears to have gone to previously uninsured people. In Australia alone, of almost all developed countries, health care costs as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) remained virtually constant from 1978 to 1988, at about 7.9 per cent. That is the system that the honourable member opposite talks about as being unsustainable in its present form. This point has been made very often but has been totally dismissed by the shadow Minister. In the United States of America, by comparison, the proportion rose from about 9 per cent to 11.4 per cent and in Canada, which has a system similar to Australia's, health took about 8.4 per cent of GDP in 1984 and it is almost certainly more costly now. Dr Deeble concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> Given the introduction of universal insurance in that time, Australia's record is probably superior to that of any other country. </PARA>

(Quorum formed)</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This might be an appropriate moment to repeat what I was able to reveal to the House a moment ago-that is, to those who were here. The shadow Minister is telling the public and has told the House that the Opposition, when in government, will retain Medicare. However, according to an article entitled `Opposition will end Medicare' in the magazine, Australian Private Doctor, the shadow Minister promised a group of health professionals that in power he will abolish Medicare. In the chamber today he has supported the Medicare levy, but on the Face to Face program he said that Medicare would be retained-the Opposition always has to say that in any public forum-but with the abolition of the separate Medicare levy. I do not mind repeating that. I can assure honourable members opposite that I will repeat it many times between now and the election. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking about the scare campaign orchestrated by Opposition members and certain doctors. That campaign encouraged hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Australian pensioners to take out private insurance. Why? So they would be able to go into the private hospitals to have the hip replacements which the honourable member opposite was nearly in tears about. They could not get them in public hospitals because the doctors were not there to do the operations. Every time members opposite talk about our not delivering a health care system, perhaps somebody ought to remind them that Medicare is a health insurance system. Doctors deliver health care. Hospitals deliver health care. We do not administer the hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Where there are problems in the program-the extent to which the problems of access occur is always exaggerated-they must be due to difficulties with health care delivery. We do not deliver health care. Doctors deliver health care when they feel so inclined, but they want to provide it most in their private hospitals, so they tell pensioners to go out and get privately insured. It is true that there are particular problems with excessive waiting times. In the Australian Capital Territory, for example, in areas such as orthopaedic surgery there is a shortage of specialists willing to work in the public hospital system and to treat Medicare patients. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a bit sick and tired of this scare campaign, orchestrated by people who want the people in their hospitals in private schemes. Do honourable members remember the advertisements in the scare campaign which showed the empty bed in the bare ward, saying, `This is what you get on Medicare'? Do honourable members remember those magazines from which we were able to quote years ago that said the doctors sent articles to general practitioners saying that they must explain to their patients the difference between `government' doctors and `real' doctors? I invite honourable members opposite to tell the number of Australian people who are now supporting Medicare what help they get from government doctors. We will get all that again; it is still going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The campaign continues with the AMA earlier this year calling for a dismantling of Medicare. The Opposition is telling the AMA one thing and the public another with respect to what it will do with Medicare. Honourable members opposite say they will retain it for only the aged and the poor. They say that the rest of us, those who can afford it, should have private health insurance. Here they go again-two classes. The people who will be on welfare will also include those in the welfare child-care concept of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and eventually, as I keep saying, we would even have welfare education. The Opposition wants two classes. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Fraser Government came to power, the Liberals promised to maintain Medibank because the public wanted it. As soon as they were elected to government, they started to dismantle it. Back in the Fraser years there were five health schemes-about the same number of schemes as the Opposition has had shadow health Ministers. How many health schemes would we have if ever honourable members opposite got into power and how many uninsured would there be? Do the Opposition and the AMA wish us to go the same way as the United States where health care costs are growing astronomically and have reached the stage where even the Chairman of Chrysler Corporation-I have always wanted to quote him-is talking about the merits of national health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> A report commissioned by the Consumers Health Forum of Australia Incorporated quite clearly shows the consequences of deregulating the health care market and allowing health care costs to be subject to market forces with health professionals determining costs. In the United States the business sector is now calling upon the United States Government to look at ways of controlling health care costs because of the crippling subsidies many employers are paying for employees. In fact, many see merit in emulating Australia's Medicare system. They agree that there are distinct economic advantages to a single provider under a national universally tax funded health care system, not possible under the current US system with its fragmented private sector which cannot control provider costs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is appropriate, after those comments, that I now refer to the Goat Fibre Levy Bill 1989 and the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Bill 1989. I commend this legislation and those involved in the goat fibre industry in Australia. The purpose of these Bills, which result from an initiative of those people, is to introduce a levy, to be collected on the sale of goat fibre, for research to assist the development of the industry. It was two years ago that the industry first made the request. The industry comprises three sectors: the mohair, cashmere and cashgora sectors. The industry is growing quickly and has the potential to be a major agricultural and export industry for Australia within the foreseeable future. At present, the export sales amount to about $10m and this will rapidly increase over the years ahead. In addition to the income from the fibre there is the income from goat meat and hides, and there is an industry in the export of live goats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The goat industry in the broader term-the keeping of goats for fibre or for meat-has a valuable role to play in the land management of this country because goats are very capable grazers of pasture to which other forms of livestock, sheep and cattle, may not be so attracted. This includes a number of weeds and other less desirable species of plants. So there is a very valuable role for this animal and for this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has recognised that it needs to improve the quality of the fibre. Therefore, this legislation introduces a levy of 1 1/2 per cent to be paid on the gross value of sales of goat fibre to commence on 1 January next year, and a maximum of 5 per cent is allowed for in the legislation. The Federal Government, under its rural research arrangements, will match that levy on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of the industry, as it matches the levies of other primary industries. Initially, the industry levy is expected to raise $150,000 in a full year, with an additional $50,000 from the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the goat fibre industry organisations, such as the Angora Mohair Breeders Association, are to be commended on the scale of the levy that they have requested. Because the figure I cited of $150,000 is not a huge amount at this stage, it disguises the very significant percentage of the value of production that the industry is prepared to commit of its own income. It is probably the highest in percentage terms, or matches the highest, of any of the 19 or 20 other agricultural industries that are presently involved in these cooperative dollar for dollar research arrangements with the Government. In total levy terms it would rank with wool and meat-at the top of what any rural industry is prepared to commit. The Government target for rural industry is 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. The goat fibre industry from day one will be committing three times the maximum that the Government is using as the target for other agricultural industries. A number of these agricultural industries are on only 0.2 per cent or 0.3 per cent of the gross value of production. So that indicates the commitment by the industry. I am advised that, in addition, the industry will be imposing a voluntary levy of 2 per cent of the value of sales for promotion. At least, that is the case for the angora breeders for angora mohair. So there is this very significant contribution by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has looked at this legislation, as it looks at other legislation, and it has made a number of recommendations critical of the legislation. One recommendation, which perhaps does not sound very serious, is the question of the definition of a goat's fibre-selling broker. The Senate Committee noted that the definition in the legislation refers to a `goat's fibre-selling broker' and that the provision should be drafted so as not to contemplate a goat authorising a broker to sell its own fibre! So perhaps the drafters of this legislation should take into account that although acknowledging that the goat is a very intelligent animal, a goat is probably not quite up to determining its own broker for the selling of its fibre. The Senate may wish to look at that when this legislation reaches the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more serious note, I refer to another point that the Senate Committee makes in relation to subclause 3 (1) of the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Bill, which is the definition of `magistrate' to include justice of the peace. I quote from the Committee report:</PARA>
<PARA>The definition of magistrate in the Bill includes a `justice of the peace', who is enabled to issue a warrant for an authorised person to enter premises pursuant to the provision of clause 12 of the legislation. The Committee does not accept that a justice of the peace should be enabled to issue a search warrant. The view of the Committee is that justices of the peace are not judicial officers, and that the issue of search warrants should be confined to judicial officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision is brought to the attention of the Senate in that it may breach principle 1 (a) (i) and trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>I draw the attention of the Government to the recommendations of the Senate Committee. The Opposition, in supporting this legislation, will not be moving any of the amendments which may be considered appropriate by that Senate Committee. But if the Government does not answer those comments made by the Senate Committee and comply with them where appropriate with amendments, either here or in the Senate, then the coalition parties will have to consider pursuing amendments in the Senate. I say that in a constructive way. If there is an adequate explanation as to why there is no need to accept any of those Senate Committee recommendations, then it is important for it to be put forward so that we in the Opposition can allow the legislation through the Senate without moving amendments. I will be interested to hear the definition of a goat's fibre-selling broker. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to the plans of the angora mohair breeders for developing their section of the total industry as quickly as possible. Australian mohair production is about 900,000 kilograms a year. That is about 4 per cent or 5 per cent of world production. South Africa is the world's leading producer with about 45 per cent of total production. South Africa's fibre quality is also the best. Australian mohair, or angora goat fibre, suffers from kemp and its fleece weight is under half that of South Africa's. Therefore, the development of the genetic excellence of our goats' fibre is a long way behind that of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are restricted in Australia to improving on the genetic material of the animals that we have here now, this improvement will take 30 to 40 years. The best way to improve any livestock breed, whether it is sheep, cattle or goats, is to obtain the best genetic material available in the world, either by importing live animals or, where for disease reasons or other reasons that is not practical, by semen or embryos. The best way to develop the potential of this important industry is by obtaining the best genetic material that is available so that it becomes a major export industry in the future. Therefore, this industry wants to-and correctly wants to-import genetic material from South Africa. It has only been possible to import any genetic material from South Africa since June of this year, when South Africa removed the embargo that it had in place on export of these goats. This follows the Zimbabwe tactic, as I would call it, which happened recently, in which there was some South African material smuggled out through Zimbabwe, and it is now being developed for the future benefit of the industry in New Zealand and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Angora Mohair Breeders Association has formed a company to legally and openly import 100 embryos from South Africa, as they are now available, which will eventually result in about 6,000 genetically superior pure bred goats being distributed through the national flock. The Association believes that there is no future in trying to repeat the Zimbabwe tactic or to import from Zimbabwe because of the quality of the inferior goats. There are also other disease problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Coincidentally, our maximum security quarantine station on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands will have space available in 1991, which would allow the implanting of those embryos into parent stock and the upgrading of the breed using this superior genetic material to begin. If the Angora Mohair Breeders Association is not able to obtain approval in the near future for those embryos from South Africa, I am advised that there will be no space on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands for another two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a problem, in that the Federal Government has restrictions on trade with South Africa. I hope that the Government takes a sensible approach to determining this application, because we are not talking about significant and ongoing trade with South Africa. We are talking about trade worth several million dollars in a one-off operation. The trade would not advantage South Africa to any great degree, but it would dramatically advantage Australia by assisting this very important industry. Australia has the ability to become the world's leading producer and exporter of goat fibre. I notice that the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) is at the table. I sincerely suggest to him that the goat fibre industry must be one of the most important sunrise industries in this country. It could earn Australia not just millions of dollars but hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the export of goat fibre. Australia has the right climate and the right amount of area. It has appropriate management skills-there are related skills in sheep and goat husbandry-to ensure a successful industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my remarks I indicate again the Opposition's support for the legislation. A coalition government is in favour of allowing Angora Mohair Breeders of Australia Ltd to import embryos from South Africa. I hope that commonsense prevails and that this Government approves that application in order to guarantee the maximum development of this most important industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy to do so but the shadow Minister did talk for a fair degree of time about trade sanctions against South Africa. I was responding that Australian farmers are not concerned so much about that; they are concerned that the coalition policy will devastate rural families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Goat Fibre Levy Bill 1989 is supported by the industry and comes to this House at the request of the industry. It should be noted that most legislation and a vast majority of regulations that are passed by this House are a result of industry pressures and requests to implement such legislation. When I hear constant attacks by the Opposition about over-regulation, I often wonder why it tends to forget that the regulations and the controls exist because industry wants those measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The goat fibre industry, as the shadow Minister said, comprises mohair, cashmere and cashgore fibre production. In my electorate there is another breed-the only ones in Australia-which produces another form of animal fibre, the South American alpaca. The Halpin family, Geoff and his wife, now have a small breeding stock of alpacas on their farm at Seymour. The alpaca is not part of the goat family; it is a member of the camelidae family. It produces about a 28 micron wool which is very similar to angora in its softness. It produces a very soft and beautiful fibre. I hope that this small herd, this initial breeding stock that the Halpins have managed to import, mostly from the United States, represents the commencement of yet another successful Australian animal fibre industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The goat fibre industry in this country began at the turn of the century when there was considerable interest in the angora goat for mohair production. Unfortunately, after the industry's commencement in this country, the price of mohair fell and many of the herds were dispersed or simply released into the wild. This country has many problems with feral animals, and those original angora herds formed the basis of the large herds of feral goats in Australia. Anyone from the western plains of New South Wales-for example, in the Paroo country, in the Murrumbidgee valley areas-will be aware that there are enormous numbers of feral goats causing great damage to agriculture. Those goats are rapidly being trapped because there is now a major market for goat meat. Many of those feral goats form the basis of a valuable goat meat exporting business. They are now being trapped, grain fed, fattened up and exported. It is still a pity that those goats are feral. The damage that they do is irreparable. We will never get rid of all of them from our outback areas. We will always have a feral goat problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1970s interest in goat fibre again rose with the expansion of the angora goat population. During the 1980s the cashmere industry has developed. One positive aspect of the development of this industry is that goats can be used to complement the grazing of sheep and cattle. In regard to whole farm planning, one can now have a mixture of sheep and goats in mixed grazing areas, which improves the utilisation of pasture. The goats can be used to control weeds, thus reducing the need for costly chemicals. The use of goats has the added advantage of avoiding chemical pollution and toxicity problems. This is one of the exciting things about the goat fibre industry. Because so many farmers have adopted whole planned management systems, one can now integrate in a mixed grazing area a variety of fibre producing animals which will complement each other, assist with environmental controls and reduce the amount of toxic chemicals and other herbicides that farmers need to use to control noxious weeds introduced by Europeans into this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is frightening to think about the damage caused by white people to this country and its effect on our agricultural productivity. In my electorate most of the noxious weed problems relate to introduced species. The Cape broom is being found in parts of my electorate. It is in bloom now. If one drives around the hill areas of my electorate one sees the Cape broom flowering everywhere. It is starting to become devastating in Victoria. I wonder about the irresponsibility of our forefathers, and that of some people today. Recently, I travelled through a wilderness area in Thailand-although there is not much wilderness area left. An Australian tourist in our group reached out, pulled up some plants and put them in a bag. As I thought she wanted to take them back to Australia, I made myself known to her and suggested that if I saw her at the airport I would advise the Australian Customs Service of what she was up to and ensure that she was properly punished for trying to introduce yet another unknown plant species into Australia, with the attendant quarantine risks. I wonder how many Australians really understand when they travel overseas the potential damage they can cause our major export earners, our rural sector, by taking a very careless approach to introducing foreign plants and untested plants in quarantine areas in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have strayed from the main aspects of the Bill. The industry has expanded very rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s. As the shadow Minister said, whilst Australia produces only 6 per cent of the world's mohair and less than one per cent of the world's cashmere, there is enormous potential to improve that yield. Australian farmers deserve a pat on the back for their innovative approach and the fact that they are not frightened to venture into new areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The products of goat fibre are high-class in the textile area. The fibres are very specialist fibres and go into high-price and high-cost textile production. I hope and wish that at the same time as the industry develops in Australia the oncosting, the value added component of goat fibre, will be produced in this country rather than transferred overseas, as is still the case with our major animal fibre wool. We all know the story. The wool suit that I am wearing is made from Australian wool. The wool value is probably about 5 per cent of its total cost. The rest of the value is added by other countries before we bring the stuff back in again. I make a plea to Australian industry not to let this country become just a source of raw material. We should, as a nation, start taking advantage of the increase in goat fibre production and start doing the value added production in this country. By shipping off the raw wool and then having to buy back textiles we lose the value added component. We all know that this is one of the great problems in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> At present goat fibre research is funded from a variety of voluntary levies, gifts and ad hoc allocations. The mohair industry operates a voluntary research fund which has been largely financed by the mohair breeders of Australasia through members and voluntary contributions. The cashmere industry has deducted its own levy from cashmere sales for the purpose of cashmere research projects. In addition, the Australian Special Rural Research Fund has funded both industry-sponsored and other research which has benefited the goat fibre industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The national goat fibre workshop was convened in December 1988. It brought together goat fibre organisations to discuss key issues such as marketing, research and promotion. As a result of that this legislation is now before the House. There is widespread industry support and recognition. This sort of approach to an industry is very much a Government initiative-very much a part of the Government's response to what is occurring in our rural industries. Since March 1983 the Government has been implementing a consistent five-point plan. It has been maximising the competitiveness of the sector through general economic policy and maximising the returns to farmers through active trade policy and reforms of the marketing systems and institutions. The reform of these marketing institutions and systems has always been opposed by the Opposition. We have always been attacked when we have managed to reform industry groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Who on this side of the House can forget the anguished squeals, groans and moans and great outpourings of quasi-concern from the Opposition when there was a plan to restructure the dairy industry? I recall, as a member of the Prime Minister's country task force, wandering around the countryside with the shadow Minister who was telling farmers what was going to happen to them-what a disaster the Kerin plan was and how their marketing systems would be destroyed. Three or four years down the track, if someone says to a dairy farmer in Victoria, `The Kerin plan is going to be abolished', he will have a good fight on his hands. This is the tragedy of most of the changes that have occurred in rural sectors in marketing and systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Who can forget the shadow Minister's remarks in relation to wheat deregulation? He was going to resign and walk out of this place on the issue of wheat deregulation. Now he issues a policy on behalf of the Opposition which supports wheat deregulation. We on this side of the House get just a little confused as to where the National Party stands on any issue. That is a fairly typical reaction. Country people are not quite sure where the National Party stands on any issue either. I was fascinated to see that recent research showed that five out of six farmers will vote for the Government next time around because they are really quite confused about where the Opposition is going in terms of rural policies. </PARA>

<PARA> I wonder how many times the shadow Minister for primary industry has supported the application of a person to become a justice of the peace. I guarantee that in his electorate he has put a lot of effort into getting certain of his constituents appointed as justices of the peace. Justices of the peace are unquestionably, unarguably, historically and factually judicial officers. In most States in Australia they still sit as magistrates and have the power to issue warrants of arrest and grant bail. Even in Victoria, despite the fact that the Victorian Government has got them off the benches, these days they still have power regarding bail applications, which constitutes, ipso facto, a judicial function. I am rather puzzled by the honourable gentleman's concern about the Senate. I would suggest to him that the Senate should have a look at the position of a justice of the peace because, unarguably, a justice of the peace is a judicial figure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise to support the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) in this consideration of the Goat Fibre Levy Amendment Bill. I indicate to the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) that I reiterate the support of the honourable member for Murray and the Opposition for the legislation currently before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since pre-biblical times goats have been the subject of derision and scorn-good humoured derision and scorn though it has frequently been. Goats have been characterised as all that was stupid and unreasonable. I rise with some discomfort because I recognise that this measure of derision and scorn has also been aimed from time to time at those of us who practise the delicate art of politics. It is of some concern to me that the honourable member for McEwen failed to recognise that the Opposition supports the legislation. The Opposition has not been critical of the Government. The honourable member for Murray, in his comments about South Africa and the import of embryos, was referring to a matter that directly affects the goat industry and was therefore being relevant. The honourable member for McEwen had a great deal of audacity when he discussed justices of the peace, the dairy industry and the wheat industry after he had challenged the relevance of the remarks of the honourable member for Murray. </PARA>
<PARA> In my experience in this House the Opposition has, on the vast majority of occasions, supported the Government when legislation was fair and reasonable, sought after by industry and in the national interest. It does nothing for the image of parliamentarians for the cooperation that exists between the Opposition and the Government to be treated with nothing more than a characteristically supercilious outburst from the honourable member for McEwen. </PARA>
<PARA> The goat industry in Australia has played a key role in Australia's historic development, a role that has been frequently overlooked. I acknowledge that the honourable member for McEwen referred to the growth that we have seen in the cashmere industry and to the fact that in the mid-1800s the cashmere industry was seen as a possible industry in Australia and failed. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, as a nation, our link with the goat industry goes back even further. Goats were amongst the animals brought out on the First Fleet. They were on the ships in the First Fleet so that the people would have a source of milk on the journey out. The early settlers who were involved in either railway construction or mining attempts used goats as a source of milk, cream, butter and meat to sustain themselves. So much a part of the Australian community and so much a part of the sustenance of the Australian community had the goat become that by the late nineteenth century the sport of goat racing had become popular among our early settlers. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move on to the remarks of the honourable member for McEwen, who indicated that a cashmere industry had been attempted in this country in 1832 but had failed, and that both cashmere and angora herds had been introduced into Australia and, because of the failure of the industry, many of them were set free. Some of them escaped and became a part of the herds of wild goats that were then emerging and were subsequently to become Australian feral goats and do some damage to our environment. It is not surprising that goats have damaged our environment. After all, they are a browsing animal. They are not very discriminating about the sort of feed that appeals to them. As a result of their presence in the environment, as we all know, there has been a breakdown in Australia's native shrubs. Rodents and marsupials that would also have been occupying that low grazing level of the Australian environment have been displaced by expanding goat herds. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be acknowledged that, although goats played a role in making milk, meat and cheese available to our early settlers, those same feral goat herds that then took over the Australian environment have now become the foundation of the Australian goat industry. Firstly, the feral goat herds were the foundation for what was an expanding meat industry as people rounded up and slaughtered feral goats in order to supply an export meat market. Subsequently, these feral goat herds have become the foundation for a now expanding Australian cashmere and angora industry because they have become a part of the breeding stock for the Australian cashmere and angora industry. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the angora industry exists to supply the mohair market. An expanding and popular mohair market has put a demand on Australian goat stocks, and so feral goats have been used to supplement those stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the cashmere pelt industry is seen as offering further opportunities for expansion, and the feral goat herds have provided a supplement to what was an almost non-existent cashmere industry in Australia. Over the last two decades we have seen a rapid increase in the numbers of goats being bred for mohair and cashmere production particularly. It is not surprising that, as a result of a fall in prices in both the mohair and the cashmere industries, over the last few years we have seen a fall in the number of goats being used for cashmere or mohair production. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fortunate enough to have in my electorate not only the President of the South Australian Goat Breeders Association but also the Senior Vice-President of the Australian Goat Breeders Association, Mr Dale Morphett. Mr Morphett, a farmer at Kadina who uses goats as a part of his total farm management, has indicated to me that, whereas in South Australia five years ago 300 people were involved in the goat industry, that number has fallen to 180 to 200 people who are members of the South Australian Goat Breeders Association. Australia-wide, people have moved out of the cashmere and angora industry as the price has fallen. In fact, Mr Morphett indicated to me that the Goat Breeders Association, which once boasted over 2,500 members throughout Australia, now has a membership closer to 2,200. </PARA>
<PARA> The glamour industry of cashmere pelts and mohair fibre has seen a fall in prices as Australian wool prices have risen. It seems that as wool prices go up cashmere and mohair prices tend to fall, and as goat fibre prices rise so wool prices tend to fall. The goat fibre industry goes through peaks and troughs which tend to characterise it. As I have indicated by the statistics I have presented to the House, these peaks and troughs tended to weed out those people who came into the industry hoping, if you will pardon the pun, Mr Deputy Speaker, simply for a quick buck. </PARA>
<PARA> As both the honourable member for Murray and the honourable member for McEwen have indicated, the industry agrees with the legislation before the House. In fact, the industry has shown a real desire to improve not only the quality of our breeding stock but also, consequently and subsequently, the quality of the fibre produced from those stock. The honourable member for Murray has quite rightly pointed to an additional step that the Government can contemplate in order to assist the industry, that is, the import of South African embryos to allow the industry to breed an even higher quality of both mohair and cashmere goats. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that under the current arrangements all mohair produced in Australia is sent to Bradford in England for processing. The levy arrangements currently before the House provide us with an opportunity to boost research funds for the goat industry. This boost in research funds and what might be confidently predicted as the consequent increase in the quality of mohair and angora pelts available could well lead not only to an increase in Australia's export earnings but also to the very real possibility of a value-added industry being created in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has indicated that it is prepared with this legislation, as with other rural legislation, to back the Australian goat industry dollar for dollar up to 0.5 per cent of its total production. This is consistent with the Government's approach to other primary industries. It is anticipated that the industry will of its own volition raise $150,000 as a result of this legislation-$150,000 for rural research which will be supplemented by about $50,000 from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I want to make just two points. What has been seen as an environmentally hazardous industry, that is, the feral goat industry in Australia, need not in fact be environmentally hazardous at all. The honourable member for Murray has alluded to this. There is no escaping the damage that feral goats have done and are doing to the environment, but there is also no escaping the reality that market pressure has made it possible for farmers to hunt and slaughter these goats and so create an industry. The significant thing is that a controlled and managed goat industry plays a key role in ensuring that the Australian farming environment is even more sensitive than it was prior to the establishment of the goat industry. After all, as the honourable member for Murray has pointed out, goats can play a key role in allowing farmers to exercise pasture management that is not possible simply with sheep and cattle grazing. Goats are largely non-discriminate grazers and allow the farmers effectively to control weeds that would otherwise be difficult to control. So the goat industry need not be an environmentally insensitive industry. The feral goat industry may very likely be eliminated by the attraction of goat meat. A controlled goat industry would allow farmers to exercise even more sensitive pasture control than has been possible with the grazing of cattle and sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by picking up the point made by the honourable member for Murray, and that is, Australian mohair breeders have formed their own company in a desperate effort to attract into Australia the genetic material they need from South Africa. Australian mohair breeders and goat breeders in total have shown that they belong to an industry committed to improving the genetic make-up of their industry and the quality of the pelts that will be harvested. They have shown that because they are prepared, through this legislation, to contribute up to three times the maximum being contributed to research and development by other primary industries in Australia. The goat industry has shown that it is committed to a more effective, more productive industry. If the Government is similarly committed it will do something about the importation of embryos from South Africa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak in favour of the Goat Fibre Levy Bill and the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Bill which are being debated cognately. The Bills represent a fresh and innovative approach to a small industry that I believe has untold potential. I compliment the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) on his remarks and also the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) who, in a bipartisan speech in this House, put forward some very rational and sound propositions in favour of agriculture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also pay tribute to my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for the outstanding contribution that he has made on behalf of goat producers not only in his electorate but throughout Australia. We can recall that after repeated representations by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro on the industry's behalf a national goat fibre workshop was convened in December 1988. Another gentleman, Mr Bruce Turner, also had a part to play in the formulation of policy. He is no longer in Canberra. I thank him for his contribution and optimism regarding this industry which, as I have said, has untold potential. </PARA>
<PARA> The various grower organisations recognise the benefits of a coordinated research program involving all goat fibre organisations. The goat fibre organisation has three sectors-mohair, cashmere and cashgora. As previous speakers have said, over several years the industry has shown a willingness to involve itself in research activities. It is pleasing that in agriculture today almost everybody recognises the need for research as opposed to an earlier recognition by manufacturers alone. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the limited size of the industry has placed the level of research funding on a shaky footing. The industry requested the Federal Government to enact legislation to collect a statutory levy of 1.5 per cent on the gross value of sales of goat fibre, which is among the highest of any Australian agricultural industry. The maximum rate for this research will be 5 per cent of the value of fibre sales. The research capabilities in this industry include animal production, fibre harvesting, marketing, economics and harvesting. </PARA>
<PARA> The goat industry is export oriented and earnings are expected to be about $10m in 1989. The levy will take effect on 1 January 1990 and will be paid into the Australian Special Rural Research Fund. The research scheme will have clearly identified goals to be set out in a five-year strategic plan to be developed in consultation with the industry. The Federal Government will match the industry dollar for dollar up to a limit of 0.5 per cent of the average annual gross value of production of goat fibre. The initial Commonwealth contribution will be $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Research in all Australian industries is particularly important to ensure that we maintain our world-class reputation. Our primary producers are performing a formative role in showing industries the value of research, and that is great. However, by world standards Australia's research and development expenditure is quite low. All industries would do well to study and follow the example being set in the goat industry. The real lesson is that if our goat fibre industry is willing to have a go, the challenge is on for all industries to devote their energies to the research task. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to note what the honourable member for Wakefield said regarding the processing of our products in England. He was right when he said that what we need to do is value-add those commodities in Australia. Looking at goat fibre earnings, which are currently small, and at the massive potential that exists if they were run on a parallel with wool, one does not have to be a genius to recognise the massive potential that exists there. Australian fashion designers can hold their own with anyone in the world. We produce the basic requirements in Australia. Through Bills such as those before us and research and development we can be better placed to value-add these products in Australia. I do not believe that a Cardin or St Laurent shirt is better than what we can make in Australia. If we put our mind to it, we can match the world. Honourable members on both sides of the House realise that that is what we have to do. While the legislation may not catch the newspaper headlines, because of the toing-and-froing that so often occurs in the House, it has more far-reaching ramifications than many people realise. On that basis, I commend the two Bills to the House and congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) for, once again, playing a great part in agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Goat Fibre Levy Bill is to fix a levy and the purpose of the Goat Fibre Levy Collection Bill is to collect it. There are many goat producers and a number of studs in the electorate of Maranoa. These days most country shows have goats on display which are judged. Some very fine animals are being bred. Many thousands of wild goats still run mainly to the west of Roma, at Mitchell and further west. I do not believe that they have done a great deal of damage to the environment. The wild goat actually lives on top feed. It does not eat a great deal of grass. Usually wild goats run with sheep and eat the trees. They climb half way up trees and eat a lot of roughage. Goats have always eaten anything they are given, from tins to bottles to bits of paper or whatever. That is why they have been able to survive around the world. Goats have spread throughout the world. I am not sure of their native area. In the early days they came to Australia from South Africa, and now they are being domesticated and bred, particularly by small farmers on the subdivisions that have been created in rural Australia. Many people use them for milking. Of course some people shear them and sell the mohair. Each goat produces about 2 kilograms of mohair which sells for about $10 a kilo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fashion industry is on the down for producers as far as price is concerned. However, the industry has seen sense. Ken Slater, the President of the Goat Breeders Association, was in South Australia at the time, but I spoke to Mrs Karen Slater at her property at Boort, which is in the electorate of Murray in Victoria, about the problems facing the industry. These days there is a lot of international competition. There are fibres such as wool, cotton and nylon, a synthetic fibre, and a lot of money is spent on research and development. The idea is that a levy will be placed on producers in this industry. Most of the money will be put into research and development. The industry is worth about $10m a year to Australia in exports. It hopes, initially, to spend about $50,000 to $100,000 on research. As time goes by, no doubt it will lift the levy somewhat. When the price of the product lifts, the levy will be lifted and more money will be spent in that area. I have much pleasure in supporting the two pieces of legislation. I hope that all the goat producers in my area will continue to produce the fibre and earn some export income for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is designed to correct some deficiencies in two previous Bills. The first amendment relates to deficiencies in the Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill, which established the company called AIDC Ltd, to which I will refer later, and the second amendment is to the Bounty (Ships) Act, to expand the maximum size of bountiable vessels constructed or modified in Australia from 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes. Ship bounties are expected to peak at $33m in 1991 and thereafter to decline gradually as they are phased down to 10 per cent of eligible costs between 1991 and 1993 and 5 per cent of eligible costs between 1993 and 1995. When the bounties are phased out, the measure is unlikely to have much effect on decisions to build other unspecified vessels in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, there are minor amendments to the Designs Act and the Trade Marks Act and amendments to some administrative provisions in the Patents Act. The amendments will allow advances to administrative practice brought about by computerisation and will update penalties. The Opposition is not opposing the legislation, but those two areas strike me as being minor. </PARA>
<PARA> I direct my attention to the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the saga of the Australian Government's first sally into privatisation. I am particularly pleased to see in the House the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), who is a great supporter of privatisation! He has made it well known that he opposes privatisation at every turn, yet tonight he is supporting a Bill that will enable the first privatisation of a government enterprise to go on to the stock market. In the Government's first privatisation Bill it has managed, completely inaccurately, to draw the legislation at the bottom line. As a consequence of that, a prospectus has been issued for the float of AIDC Ltd which includes legislation that is wrong. Tonight the Government is amending the legislation to put into proper order its first effort at floating a company in Australia. That is quite an effort; not bad! One would have thought that the Government would have got it right at its first try, but it bombed out. Not only did it manage to bomb out on the legislation in the background to the float when the float took place but also the shares are now valued at less than what it placed them at. Firstly, the legislation was incorrect, and, secondly, when the shares were put out to the public, a few sales were made at a price above the offer price-now the value is well under that. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is: Who bought the shares? Does that ring a bell? The Japanese institutions bought them. The Government has done particularly well at its first effort at privatisation. I am pleased to see the Minister here; he is a great supporter of it all. He will be able to take those points down and use them the next time he talks about privatisation to members of the right wing faction in New South Wales. He might be able to tell them something about it; because they got it wrong. You, Mr Speaker, might pay some attention too, as you have a particular interest in this area. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to some points in what I find an absolutely fascinating operation. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), in his second reading speech, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The reorganisation saw the bulk of the Corporation's business transferred to a new subsidiary company, AIDC Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>This was a unique way of going about selling some government assets. The Australian Industry Development Corporation has been out there for a decade or so and has had an improved record in the past five years, but it wanted some money. One or two bright sparks in the Cabinet said, `The best way to get some money is to offer some of it to the public-not all of it, just a teeny-weeny bit of it, so we don't upset the left wing of the Labor Party. We will create a new subsidiary company and we will put certain assets into it.'. The Cabinet thought about what assets would be transferred and which ones would be kept in the Corporation. The Corporation has kept the ability to do all the fundraising or, in other words, the treasury operations. That is the term used here. That means, for the simple souls of the money market, that the Corporation will keep unto itself the power to raise money for the new AIDC Ltd and generally run its financial operations. The reason is that the Corporation had a government guarantee, but AIDC Ltd did not. That was a neat little attempt to put up to the public a company which had no advantages over any of the competitor merchant banks in the field, but the source of funds was coming from the Corporation which carried a government guarantee. That has been glossed over. </PARA>
<PARA> When the `non-transferable items' were left with the Corporation, it was apparently assumed that the costs of running those non-transferable assets would be passed to AIDC Ltd. That is what is said in the Minister's second reading speech, so I can only take it as truthful:</PARA>
<PARA>While the Corporation was to remain the contracting party to such agreements it was always intended that the actual benefits and costs associated with these non-transferable assets and liabilities would be transferred to the subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Corporation would continue to own the assets, but the cost of operation and the profits would be transferred to the new company. There was no agreement. If there was, it was not in the Act or the prospectus. That is another point down the drain. This is really very smart commercial work! Everyone will think that the first time the Labor Government got into privatisation it bungled it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what other little niceties are in it. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>To reflect this position it was decided to treat these non-transferring assets and liabilities that were in substance part of the transferred business, as being assets and liabilities of the subsidiary for income tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Someone rang the bell. It was forgotten that the profits and costs of an asset owned by A could not be transferred to corporation B if it did not own the asset and there was no agreement; that is fundamental. Any clown who has read the Income Tax Assessment Act would understand that; it is quite straightforward. In the rush to genius, those two things were bungled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not stop there. In relation to the powers of the Chief Executive, I quote again from the Minister's speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Another aspect of the reorganisation was the transfer of the Corporation's staff to AIDC Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>That is understandable. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>This necessitates the broadening of the Corporation's and the Chief Executive's delegation powers to include employees of the subsidiary. The establishment of AIDC Ltd also saw the Government examine the Corporation's use of the Commonwealth guarantee.'</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Chief Executive's power. It is quite clear from page 33 of the prospectus which, quoting from the 1988 Act, states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . empower the Chief Executive of the Corporation to determine which staff of the Corporation are to be transferred to the company. This determination was made on 30 June 1989 and took effect from 1 July 1989. All staff of the Corporation other than the Chief Executive are, by force of the 1988 Act, now deemed to be employed by the company-</PARA>
<PARA>that company being the AIDC Ltd-</PARA>
<PARA>on the same terms and conditions as they were employed by the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently the amendment is necessitated because in the drafting of this legislation the powers of the boss were not transferred. I can assume only that that is the case. I draw that same conclusion when I read the prospectus. Some detail is given about the guarantee. The Minister, in his second reading speech, attempted to wash his hands of the problems with the guarantee. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>To remove the guarantee any earlier would have created an unacceptable degree of uncertainty not only for lenders to and other parties involved with the Corporation but also for the subsidiary as it tries to establish itself in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that was quite clearly an attempt to pass on to the subsidiary which was floated a Crown guarantee on debt by way of subterfuge. </PARA>
<PARA> I view these matters with concern. The prospectus is very formidable, very substantial, and it is well put together. The professional people who were associated with its production, namely, the underwriters and advisers, have quite impeccable reputations. Were's is a very respected house in Australia and so are the other associated parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I am astonished that a prospectus with that backing can be offered to the public, be accepted and floated and that legislation then comes back to Parliament to amend the original legislation to make the prospectus valid. Those shares, I remind the House, have been on the market for some time. On its first time around the track the Government put out a prospectus that was invalid in law. It is a disgrace that the legislation was not properly drafted on the first occasion. I cannot understand the taxation matter being missed. The delegation of power of the chief executive is a technical matter. Perhaps there is some reason for it, but certainly none of it relates to the taxation matter. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Liberal Party were in government, the AIDC would be sold in total. There would be no mucking around and no need for subsidiary companies. There would be no need for amendments to play around with the transfer of assets, as there has to be in this case. The simple solution would be that the shares would be offered to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government made a mess of the original float when it offered the shares at $2 on a prospectus the legislation for which subsequently had to be amended. The shares were placed on the market for $2. Since then they have been offered at $1.75 and $1.80, which is well under the issue price. That makes a subsequent share offer difficult. The Minister might think that that is great because it suits his book altogether. He might think that, if the situation becomes difficult, the shares will not be sold at all and the Government will hold onto them. The outcome of all of this is that this float has proved to be a failure on the first attempt. The Government has failed in law, it has failed in the marketplace, and it has put the company at a disadvantage and the Corporation at a disadvantage in terms of its ability to raise money in its own name after the Government guarantee is withdrawn on 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole approach to the AIDC Ltd float appears to have been totally flawed. It has put the new company at a disadvantage, it has put the privatisation program at a disadvantage, and it certainly shows negligence in relation to the Government's legislative advice when it cannot get the basic business principles of this legislation right. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the other two aspects of the Bill, I do nothing other than draw attention to them. The amendments to the Bounty (Ships) Act and to the patents legislation are of no major significance. The Opposition will not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate contrasts the approach of the Opposition and the Government to these matters. I am pleased to say that the Government has a very strong record of industry support. Unfortunately, the Opposition has done some real backflips, but none more so than in the last election in 1987. So much legislation went through the Parliament with the support of the Opposition that it was rather a shock to industry, particularly manufacturing industry, to learn that the Opposition in government would withdraw all forms of support that this Government has put in place. Indeed, this Government is pledged to continue the very useful role that the Australian Industry Development Corporation and its subsidiary have played in funding a variety of businesses that have been able to expand dramatically. It has been a very successful corporation. The point about its expansion is that not only has it allowed industries that have been beneficiaries of this lending program to expand, but also it has provided employment for people. The Government considers that to be most important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal Party in government would privatise the AIDC and sell it off lock, stock and barrel. The Opposition is sometimes embarrassed by successful government trading enterprises such as the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The Opposition made the point that, in the past, the public may have had some sympathy or support for the selling off of government assets such as the AIDC. Whilst privatisation will always be a subjective matter until it reaches the ballot box or is an issue of specific polling, the same trends that are apparent in England, where the public is very concerned when the Government sells off successful government enterprises, could occur here. I believe that the Australian public would oppose the Opposition's proposed policy of selling off this asset totally. </PARA>
<PARA> From a policy point of view, I was very pleased to be part of the process that resulted in the development of this legislation in 1988. Unlike the shadow Minister, I think it is fair enough to say that it is routine, with the legislative load of governments these days and given the unique circumstances of the original Act, that we should be dealing tonight with some very logical and worthwhile amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say just a few more words on industry policy. Not only in this particular Bill that we are dealing with is there a clear division between us and the Opposition, but there is also division in the broader spectrum of industry policy. This Government has not been afraid to intervene to develop particular programs of industry support such as the program that is mentioned in the second part of the Bill, the ship bounty program. We have intervened in a whole variety of areas. I should mention, of course, the steel plan, the car industry plan, the heavy manufacturing industry plan, developments in shipping and, more recently, the new industry arrangements for the telecommunications industry and its manufacturing operations in Australia and the partnership agreement that is in place for the information industry. All those plans are very deliberate. They have been put in place to provide a bottom line for falling employment, and to provide those industries with a clear future in this country. I believe they have been very successful. Alternatively they are to target growth areas, particularly in regard to the information industry and the telecommunications industry. </PARA>
<PARA> But the real point of my remarks is that workers employed in those industries should understand that, just as the Opposition is committed to selling off the Australian Industry Development Corporation, equally it has resolved to remove those plans and particularly to create an environment, which is theoretical and rather impractical, where tariffs are significantly and dramatically reduced. This really gets to the core of the difference. Can we, by a process of removing every item of assistance or government intervention, lead ultimately to stronger industry capable of either import replacement or export enhancement? I think the answer at this stage of our development, notwithstanding the strong growth in manufactures and services, is that we still need that government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> I fear the Opposition's policy will be to repeat what has happened in the past-unfortunately as a result of actions by both sides of the House-and oversee the removal of particular industries. Once they are removed these days there is just no chance of reviving them at some later date. The stakes are very high in broad economic terms, but they are also high for the individuals who are employed in those industries. I was interested that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Ryan, did not mention-given that his plans were to privatise these industries-what would be done with the proceeds of the sales. We should recall the remarks of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) earlier today at Question Time when he said that Australia is not a net borrower overseas and that he has taken action to explore the opportunities of retiring more overseas debt. We will have to wait patiently until the debt is due for retirement and retire it at that stage unless we want to incur, recklessly and foolishly, very heavy premature retirement cost penalties. So the Opposition may be saying that proceeds of privatisation are going to retire national debt, but we are not a net borrower and our overseas debt can be paid with one year's surplus that this Government has provided. As the shadow Minister said yesterday, the Opposition would retire our overseas debt and he would be quite happy to incur the cost penalty. </PARA>

Quite clearly he said yes, and this will be in the Hansard and the honourable member will be on the public record. I was interested to hear that the shadow Minister does not disagree with the amendments proposed to the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989 incorporated in this Bill. We are lifting the size limit of bountiable vessels constructed or modified in Australia from the existing 10,000 gross construction tonnes to 20,000 gross construction tonnes. I am pleased to say that the reason for this action is to dramatically change the competitive position of local builders. Without this bounty we would not have had the changes we have had, and local builders are now being disadvantaged by exclusion from the bounty when the opportunity arises to bid to build larger vessels, particularly for export. So I am very pleased about that, and there is continuing endorsement of the policies of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Getting back to the repayment of debt that is seen by the Opposition as being so important, we should remind people, that, whilst there has been a real increase in our level of overseas debt, the Commonwealth surplus means that domestically-notwithstanding the borrowings of States and their statutory authorities-the public is not a net borrower in the Australian market. Sixty per cent of our overseas debt is private. I would have thought that the Opposition would have been pleased to see the internationalisation of Australian industry, to see that Australian industry is buying overseas assets and that we are now starting to see a dividend stream from overseas of something like $2.5 billion, which frankly just was not there before. But that is not so. The Opposition, regrettably, has continued to attempt to intimidate the Australian public by failing to point out the composition of the overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first opportunity that I have had to comment on the proposals of the Opposition. I was really surprised that it did not advocate a greater net cut in public expenditure. Whilst its new policy is to cut public expenditure by targeting the poor, it is actually paying it out. On its own figures, it suggests that there is only a $140m change. If we are looking at trying to do the right thing for Australian industry and creating the environment for the Australian Industry Development Corporation to really thrive and be able to cater for Australian industries, I think the Australian public would have expected-given all the rhetoric from the shadow Treasurer and honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson)-that the Opposition was going to make a greater impact in this area. It just reinforces that not only are those opposite going to privatise institutions like the Australian Industry Development Corporation, but also they are going to make it even more difficult for that corporation and its clients by relying on an exceptionally high interest rate policy. Certainly a higher interest rate policy is difficult, not only for home owners but also for business. That is the last thing that we need to see at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I strongly support the Bill. I have undertaken to check Hansard, which I will do. I strongly support Government enterprises like the Australian Industry Development Corporation. I believe that the public at large believes that it is doing an excellent job. The public is becoming increasingly apprehensive about governments completely privatising successful corporations. For this reason, there is a stark contrast between the approaches of the Opposition and the Government and that will be reflected on election day. The last point I make is that I hope the shadow Minister occupies the seat for some time-certainly well after the next election. The Opposition needs to have continuity in its policy in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), although I caught only the end of his remarks. I was interested when the honourable member referred to some alleged attitude towards overseas debt on the part of the coalition parties and made some excuse for it along the lines that its composition was important. Of course, its composition is important, but overseas debt, in the end, is overseas debt. The cost of that debt must be met either by paying interest in one form or another, dividends, or, probably most insidious of all, by consumers of the products made or supplied by those people who have to resort to overseas debt. Whatever the composition of the debt, Australians in one way or another-either as taxpayers or as consumers-have to meet the cost of that debt. Had the honourable member taken the time to develop his line of thought-and he had plenty of time on the clock left to do so-he might have been a little more thorough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member went on to bring out the old chestnuts. He spoke of the coalition parties in their policies and Economic Action Plan somehow targeting the poor. He made no case for that. He offered it as an off-the-cuff remark without any evidence or argument. In that sense he was following the example of his betters-who will be his betters, if he should succeed after the next election, in the shadow Ministry which his party will have to appoint. Today we heard the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) bleating along the same lines as the honourable member for Chifley. It was different in the sense that he complained of so-called `scare tactics' being adopted by pharmacists around the country in that they are attempting to point out the Minister's attitude towards them and their remuneration. On the one hand, the honourable member for Chifley complained in a way which was intended to be intimidatory and frightening and on the other hand the Minister complained that the Opposition does the same in another context. That is politics, I suppose, but it brings no credit to either gentleman or to anyone else from either side of the political fence. I will make some remarks about the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) and Senator Button. I acknowledge the comments of the honourable member for Chifley along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA> This omnibus Bill, the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), seeks to amend a range of legislation in the industry, technology and commerce portfolio. It considers changes to the AIDC, the Bounty (Ships) Act and legislation dealing with designs, patents and trademarks. The legislation gives the House an opportunity to consider the limited scope of the formerly much heralded achievements of industry policy under the Hawke Labor Government. Industry policy of this Government has been a mirage designed to cover up the glaring omissions and complete inability of the Government to handle the deep problems faced by Australian industry. Indeed, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has acknowledged his disappointment with the results of Labor Government policy. The Minister said that! The Minister said that he was unsure where Government policy could go from here. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that industry policy has undergone significant changes since the early days of this Labor Government. The early days of this Government saw an industry policy based on the provisions of the first version of the now failed accord. It promoted sectoral industry plans determined by close consultation between representatives of business, representatives of employees, and the Government. One of the problems of this approach was that, although it involved representatives, it did not for those who were directly involved in businesses. There was an isolated unreality about the whole procedure. The idea was that the sector plans would set targets and plan development of industry along with the gradual reduction in protection. The representatives had the role of protecting employment and increasing the productivity of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The models of the sectoral industry plans were the steel industry plan, the car industry plan and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry plan. The steel industry plan included significant Government support-by that I mean taxpayers' and consumers' money. As a consequence, employment in the steel industry has been reduced but efficiency has been held back by other labour market rigidities and the problems of the union-dominated coal industry. Earlier in the year, significant supply problems at Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd caused considerable difficulty for local manufacturers and users of steel products. The levels of protection in the steel industry are still high.</PARA>
<PARA> The much heralded car plan has been even less successful. It was designed to reduce the number of local manufacturers to three and reduce the number of car models available to consumers. It certainly has done that, but whether in the process it has created more competition is a lot less clear. In its 1986-87 annual report, the Industries Assistance Commission presented a damning critique of the car plan which suggested that it had done little more than reduce choice to consumers while reducing protection at such a slow rate that there would be little increase in efficiency and, therefore, little improvement in the price of cars to consumers or cars for potential export. Similar criticisms could be made of the textiles, clothing and footwear plan. It has produced an initial increase in protection before very slow reductions of protection to the industry are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of six years of Labor rule, we still have very heavily protected industries in these areas. The alternative to this sectoral approach to reducing protection would have been across the board reductions in protection to all industries. The sectoral approach has allowed vested interests in particular industries to concentrate their efforts against government attempts to reduce protection to those industries. It has not worked. Through detailed plans, it has reduced the flexibility and adaptability of industry to changing circumstances. It has helped to maintain labour market problems, and allowed the Government to ignore the wider economic problems facing all industry, such as the centralised wage fixing system, a tax system which encourages debt over savings, the mess on the waterfront and the inflationary policies which it has pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> We no longer hear of new sectoral industry plans from the Minister for Industry Technology and Commerce. He was badly burnt by the failure of the car plan. What has replaced that failed plan is ad hoc measures to suit the political needs of the Government and the demands, of course, of the ever present Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). As a consequence, the Government will spend $60m to support the old Kodak plant in the electorate of Wills. However, it cannot find the money to support the Sarich engine project elsewhere. I am not saying that either project should be supported, but the Government cannot maintain any shred of credibility in terms of its industry policy when it decides that Kodak is a winning bet for Government support when Sarich is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Its corporate policies of meetings with big unions, big business and big government have undermined the role of the Parliament and have failed to deliver policy for all Australians. The Government has become dependent on pandering to vested interests such as the trade union movement, the environmental movement, the welfare lobby, and other groups, always to the detriment of the more general interests of the majority of Australians. With industry policy, such an approach is particularly damaging. It represents a burden on taxpayers and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in this legislation and in his administration of the portfolio, gives no indication of an alternative to the industry policy which he has tried and which has failed. The Bill contains amendments to the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act which rectified deficiencies in the earlier legislation which further facilitated the corporatisation of the AIDC. The AIDC operates almost entirely in competition with the private sector in the highly competitive finance industry. The Corporation is ultimately guaranteed by the Federal Government, giving it access to reduced interest rates and a competitive advantage over private sector firms. </PARA>
<PARA> The AIDC was formed, like the Western Australia Development Corporation (WADC), the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VEDC) and equivalent bodies in other States, to promote local industry through the provision of loans and assistance to firms which might have difficulty getting finance through normal commercial channels. In the case of the WADC and the VEDC this has certainly been the case. The WADC, from my own State, made almost no profit from normal commercial trading arrangements, and used its privileged access to Government to prop up its balance sheet. The VEDC lost millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds on fruitless subsidies for firms which failed to meet the most basic financial criteria that are applied by professional lending institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The AIDC is not by any means in the league of its State-based equivalents, in terms of incompetence. The indications are that it is a profitable operation on its own merits, although not particularly so. The question then is: Why should the Federal Government own a merchant bank? It is not possible to argue that Australia has such poorly developed financial markets that the budding entrepreneur cannot find support for new projects. Indeed, honourable members opposite are often heard criticising the banks for too readily lending money to those whom they brand as speculators. There is presently a real problem finding equity investors for many small companies, but that has more to do with the economic mess created by this Government than a problem which the AIDC can rectify. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should privatise the AIDC. Privatisation will remove the competitive advantage which the AIDC has through government guarantees, and also remove the taxpayers' liability, both real and potential, for the AIDC. It will increase the efficiency of the services delivered by the AIDC and give the Corporation the independence to expand and develop its business as it sees fit. It will provide the Commonwealth with funds to help pay off some of the huge foreign debt which its policies have engendered. It will remove the impossible dilemmas facing statutory authorities which have a responsibility to be accountable to the Parliament, yet operate in a very different commercial environment which demands a degree of confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> The AIDC is perhaps the best case of a Government-owned enterprise which should be privatised. It already competes in an open market. None of the usual reasons for government involvement in industry exists to justify the continued government ownership of the AIDC. Indeed, the Government, through the Commonwealth Bank's activities, is often in competition with the Government itself through the AIDC. How preposterous! The truth of the Government's difficulties with privatisation is that some senior Ministers know it to be essential, but the back bench, a whole murder of crows, and the trade union movement will not permit the privatisation which would allow real competition and threaten the monopoly position of government services. In particular, the Commonwealth Bank and the AIDC need access to private sector funds to maintain their capital base and their market shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite have spent a lot of effort trying to dream up schemes to maintain government control of these government-owned business enterprises while gaining access to private funds. However, none of these schemes address the fundamental problem which is government ownership. As long as the Government owns a business, it cannot withdraw its capital and it cannot let that business fail. It is this basic fact that makes corporatisation a tried and failed concept. Corporatisation is at best a desirable step on the path to full privatisation of a government-owned business. It can serve to increase the competitiveness of the business when it is privatised and, therefore, to maximise the price received for privatisation by the Commonwealth. It is very valuable. Sure, it can be built up to get the best price for the benefit of taxpayers generally. In the coalition's case that benefit can be applied to reduce some of that massive overseas debt which we now do not enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill fails, by omission, to address any of the grave problems facing Australian industry and government-owned businesses. Eventually, these deficiencies will be corrected, but it is increasingly likely that it will not be this Government which introduces those changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) deals with a number of issues which relate to industry policy. These issues in themselves are not of great intrinsic importance; they are largely machinery matters that are consequential from earlier substantive decisions that have been taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to make a number of specific comments about the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC), to which a number of the amendments refer. In the course of doing that, I would like to make some comment on the contribution of the preceding speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). He posed the question why it was that the Commonwealth was owning what was in effect a merchant bank-what was the justification for government ownership of what is effectively a merchant bank? That is a reasonable question to ask in the context of quite a debate within the Australian Labor Party about the future of the AIDC. I do not think it is any great secret that the proposal to restructure the AIDC in the way it is being done-that is, by transferring the great bulk of its assets to a newly created subsidy organisation and then floating off up to 30 per cent of that to the private sector-was quite a controversial decision in the context of the overall privatisation debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to have a sensible debate about that, it is necessary to address some broader issues relating to the whole thrust of industry policy as it is evolving. The honourable member for Curtin expressed opposition to the Government's broad approach to industry policy, its emphasis on sectoral plans and so forth. He talked about the steel industry plan and the motor industry plan and pointed to what he claimed were deficiencies in the outcomes from those plans. Nobody pretends that everything has been absolutely rosy. Certainly, if the question were asked whether those industries would have been better off with or without the sectoral plans that have been implemented, I do not think there is much doubt that the answer would be that we have come out with more competition and viability in the long term industry sectors as a result of the application of the Government's plans than would have been the case in their absence. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest that the clearest example of that is the steel industry plan. In 1982 it was becoming widely accepted that there was no future for the steel industry in Australia. In fact, there was a general mood of pessimism pervading the steel industry in particular. What we have seen as a result of the application of the steel industry plan is a massive program of investment which exceeded the targets that were set out in the original steel industry plan. As a consequence, we have ended up with a major modernisation of plant and equipment and the development of an industry which is actually capable of sustaining itself and of competing on world markets and which has enjoyed a considerable degree of success in establishing a number of overseas markets for specialised products, particularly coated steels. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the scenario confronting that industry in 1982. There is simply no comparison with what it now faces. To suggest that that sectoral plan has not been highly successful is absurd. That is not to say that there are not problems and that there is not room for considerable further improvement. But again I go back to the issue of whether that sector would have been better with or without the industry plan. I do not think there is any serious doubt about that. One could make comments about the other plans, but I do not intend to take much time talking about that in the context of this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I prefer to talk about the AIDC's role and return to the issue of why there should be a government owned merchant bank. It seems to me that the key issue here is the time horizons of those in Australia who are responsible for controlling or who have the capacity to control major flows of investment funds. I do not think there is a great deal of dispute amongst those who comment on Australian industry and economic policy that the relatively short time horizons of Australia's capital markets represent a major problem in terms of the long term restructuring of Australian industry. I have spoken to a whole variety of people about that, including senior figures in the major institutions which control some of the large pools of investment funds. There is not a huge amount of argument from those quarters that Australian industry and those who make the major investment decisions about where funds are going to go in Australia have time horizons which are too short. That is a strong contrast with those countries which have developed economically successfully-for example, Japan, whose financial systems and industrial structures reward long term thinking and long term concentration on development of new products, new processes and maximising market share rather than short term profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there would be wide agreement that a shift in culture in Australia in that direction is desirable. There is also fairly wide agreement that there is a degree of market failure in the Australian capital market in its tendency to undervalue relatively long term and risky types of investment. If one accepts that there is a degree of market failure there, then there is an issue of how that might be addressed. The AIDC, as a government owned merchant bank, in effect, is an institution which is capable to some extent of addressing that problem. One could argue that it needs to be rather more substantial than it is and that its ability to influence the development of Australian industry structure is inherently rather slight because of its current size. I think that is probably a true proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that one of the criticisms I would make of governments of all persuasions in recent years is the failure to adequately support the capital base of AIDC. That an organisation such as the AIDC, whose funding should be the result of long term planning and long term decisions, is constantly severely squeezed as a result of relatively short term macro-economic concerns is a major problem in the way that our budgetary processes operate and in the way we lump together expenditures of a capital and recurrent nature which, in economic terms, are very different and have quite distinct consequences. As a result of that, a number of government business enterprises, including the AIDC, I would suggest, have not been adequately supported in terms of needed injections to their capital base. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, how to strengthen the AIDC's capital base lies at the heart of the proposals to restructure the AIDC. The argument has been that, under current macro-economic circumstances, it is inappropriate for governments, directly from Budget outlays, to fund the necessary capital injections for the AIDC. The argument is that, if the AIDC is to be able to adequately fulfil its industry restructure role and adequately get involved in relatively risky types of equity investments, it needs a stronger gearing ratio than it now has and that involves major injections of new capital. If those injections of new capital are to come from Budget outlays, which it is said is unfeasible under current economic circumstances, then they have to be funded by selling equity to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> This restructuring plan is an attempt to do that without cutting across the grain of the Labor Party's objection to privatisation by the establishment of a subsidiary organisation: maintain the parent company in 100 per cent government ownership, create a subsidiary, transfer just about all the assets of the AIDC to that subsidiary, and then float off 30 per cent of that. In that way, one maintains 100 per cent government ownership with the parent organisation, but a subsidiary is created which is capable of raising funds from the private sector. That is the argument. </PARA>
<PARA> One fundamental contention in terms of budgetary accounting conventions is that it makes no sense to say, on the one hand, that it is okay and perfectly responsible economically to float off a 30 per cent equity, yet on the other hand to say that to float off an equivalent amount in additional government borrowings or bonds over and above what would have otherwise been required is somehow irresponsible. There is absolutely no economic sense in that. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, that point has been conceded in the last few days in the debate about the Opposition's economic package, a significant part of which it seeks to fund by sales of assets. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has correctly pointed out, to fund any part of the Opposition's package by selling assets or equity in government enterprises is, in economic terms, no different from selling an equivalent amount of government bonds. The point that the Treasurer has made is equally applicable in this case. I do not think that the fundamental rationale for that type of restructuring basically holds water. </PARA>
<PARA> One must ask: What is the consequence of selling equity to the private sector? There is a view that by selling equity to the private sector the AIDC will become more responsive to market forces. In that sense it will become in its behaviour more like a conventional merchant bank. To me, there is a real argument about whether that is a good thing. In my view the case for retaining the AIDC in public ownership is precisely in order to have an institution which will behave other than as a conventional merchant bank. As I outlined earlier, one of the major economic problems we face in Australia is the fact that our capital markets have short time horizons, that the markets, left to themselves, will not put adequate levels of investment into those industries which are essential to Australia's economic restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> The AIDC, despite whatever criticisms have been made of it, has already played an important role in that restructuring process. One could refer to its role in the heavy engineering plan and its envisaged role in the textile, clothing and footwear plan as facilitating that process of structural change in specific industry sectors. I believe there is a need for such an institution, and a need for such an institution to be, to a considerable extent, insulated from the short term pressures of the market. I would like to express very strongly my view that the AIDC needs to be retained as an essentially government owned enterprise. The arguments for privatisation put forward by the Opposition do not hold water. There is a need for an institution of this type which will be a relatively flexible instrument for government intervention-so that the government can take out equity, and provide various forms of intervention in the economy. Without that, structural change does not have much prospect of success. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context the Australian Council of Trade Unions in its Australia Reconstructed document actually envisages a much larger role for the AIDC in the longer term. It put forward a proposal for a national development fund which seeks to channel 20 per cent of the future earnings of superannuation funds and to make them available to a certain extent for the purpose of industry development and industry policy. In putting forward that proposal it envisaged a significant role for the AIDC in terms of managing and operating that national development fund. That is a proposal which has not been taken up by the Government or by any party as yet, but I think that over the longer term there is an increasing recognition of whether the sort of role that the superannuation funds are playing is adequate in facilitating the process of economic restructuring. A huge amount of funds will accumulate in those superannuation funds over the next few decades. That, to me, is one of the really crucial issues of economic policy that we face at the moment. I think there will be a lot more concern about and a lot more interest in giving thought to how those superannuation funds are to be utilised. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for an institution like the AIDC, perhaps with a changed structure, but there needs to be some organisation which is capable of directing and managing those funds in the interests of industry development purposes. That will be one of the major industry development issues with which we will have to contend in the next few years. Having said that, I reiterate that the legislation does not have a huge amount of intrinsic significance, but I thought I would take the opportunity to make a few observations of a more general nature. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. I apologise for not being present earlier to hear the speech by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who led for the Opposition. The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 is essentially intended to tidy up certain pieces of portfolio legislation within the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Its passage will allow for more efficient operation of the Trade Marks and Designs Offices. It will ensure that the business re-organisation of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) will be tax neutral and that the Commonwealth guarantee is removed with the least dislocation to the AIDC's operations. The amendments with regard to ships bounty are to encourage local industry, which now has the capacity to produce competitively, with an appropriate level of bounty payments, larger vessels than was previously the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The AIDC amendments drew some criticism from the honourable member for Ryan, but neither the legislation nor the prospectus was wrong. The $2 per share issue price reflected the true value of the company. It is true that, since the issue, the shares have fallen below the original price of $2, but this fall is in line with the general downward trend in the stock market. It represents the free play of market forces. The vast majority of the shareholding in AIDC Ltd is with large financial institutions which have invested for the longer term, not for short term speculative gain. In regard to the transfer of the business to AIDC Ltd, there is a legal agreement between the Corporation and AIDC Ltd which is mentioned both in legislation and in the prospectus. Also, the prospectus made it clear that AIDC Ltd would not be guaranteed by the Commonwealth. That was made quite explicit. The establishment of AIDC Ltd has resulted in an extra $50m being made available for Australian industrial development. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, however, with its policy of privatisation, would see an increase in Consolidated Revenue, but at the cost of retarding our industrial development. Under a privatisation policy AIDC's investment portfolio would change. It would lose its unique characteristic of being dedicated to industry development. If a privatised AIDC existed it would become yet another merchant bank engaging in many unproductive and speculative activities. I take the point of the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) that one of the great difficulties we have had in recent years has been that of trying to induce the banking sector to take risks for the long term. That is precisely the reason that the AIDC exists-to create that opportunity where there is an element of risk, as there is with a lot of industrial development, but where AIDC is able to provide a pool of patient money. That has been a tremendous area of neglect for us. </PARA>

To remove the guarantee any earlier would have created an unacceptable degree of uncertainty not only for lenders to and other parties involved with the Corporation but also for the subsidiary, as it must establish itself in the marketplace.

<PARA> There has been some discussion about the implications of changing the upper limit applied to bountiable ships under the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989. The Government's view is that an upper limit of 10,000 gross construction tonnes has been an appropriate limit in this decade. The average size of vessels built has been significantly less than 10,000 gross construction tonnes and only one vessel has exceeded 5,000 gross construction tonnes over the last nine years. However, in recent times Australian shipbuilders have established a competitive position in the international market and the Australian shipbuilding industry is becoming progressively more export oriented. There is now evidence that local shipbuilders can be competitive in the vessel size range of 15,000 to 20,000 gross construction tonnes. Thus the upper limit of 10,000 gross construction tonnes is no longer considered to be appropriate in this new situation. The Government proposes that shipbuilders should not be disadvantaged by exclusion from the bounty when the opportunity arises to build larger vessels. Therefore the Government seeks to increase the upper limit for bountiable vessels from 10,000 gross construction tonnes to 20,000 gross construction tonnes.

The Opposition will not oppose the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1989. It is a Budget Bill and the Opposition has made it a practice since 1983 not to oppose Budget Bills, a practice which stands in stark contrast to the attitude of the Australian Labor Party after 1975, when it repeatedly opposed Budget measures in a way that contradicted quite directly all the outrage that the Labor Party expressed during 1975.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;to the debate on the allocation of grants to Australia's very fine States. This Bill provides for general assistance to the States and is a consequence of the decisions that were taken at the Premiers Conference in May of this year. This legislation reduces by $595m the allocation of funds for the States. The Government is making a great deal out of what it describes as its responsible approach to fiscal restraint. Let me make a couple of points about that. In the first place, the Government's attitude to the issue of fiscal restraint concedes an intellectual point to the Opposition. Since at least 1983 the Opposition-and the Liberal and National parties since long before that-has been arguing that a government that spends too much of taxpayers' money will eventually buy itself enormous economic problems.

The Minister at the table was a member of the Australian Parliamentary Labor Party at the time of the 1982-83 Budget which the Labor Party claims was the great blow-out Budget. I think that the Labor Party's figures are very phoney figures but at the time of the great blow-out Budget the Labor Party argued that the Budget deficit should be extended by a further $2,000m.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of States grants is critical in this debate. Not only is it the nature of the Bill but also when one looks at States grants one looks at the whole issue of macro-economic strategy and the way funding for the States relates to that. The interesting thing about the Labor Party's approach to the whole issue of government expenditure is that in 1982 it argued for a $2 billion additional blow-out in the Budget deficit. It is important to remember that when the Labor Party argued that that Budget deficit was too expensive-and that is a point one could debate-it wanted a still bigger Budget deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill reduces funding for the States by $595m. The Government says that this is an excellent illustration of its utter commitment to budgetary restraint. But this is the only area where restraint is actually taking place. The Minister at the table, whose own budget blew out by a further $104m this year, is very proud of the fact that he has continued to pump more and more money into his own portfolio. But when we look at that initiative in the context of the overall Government strategy we see that the Government has pumped money into some areas and exercised restraint in others. It has exercised restraint in areas that do not directly affect it. Of course, above all, that includes the area of States grants. The Government knocks off between $500m and $600m to the States and says `What a wonderful record of restraint we have'. </PARA>
<PARA> If we disregard altogether funding for the States and just look at the general funding of Commonwealth programs we see that throughout the period of the Hawke Government there has been a steady growth in funding for all sorts of programs. I have used the example of the portfolio of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to illustrate the point that I am making. The Minister thinks there is something terribly good about pouring more and more money into his portfolio. The nature of Government is that if a Minister can go to his constituency and say, `Guess what, I have got more money for you', he is painted as some sort of hero. In relation to this Bill, the States grants constituency is a confused constituency. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am making a very serious point here about the issues of States grants and the Government's sole commitment to what it proudly describes as fiscal restraint. Its capacity to achieve fiscal restraint, in so far as it has succeeded at all, has resulted from reducing funding for the States through legislation such as this, as well as continually increasing the taxation burden on ordinary Australians through bracket creep and through new and more creative forms of taxation on more and more activities undertaken by Australians, particularly those involved in small business. That is the way in which the Government has managed to whittle away the Budget deficit. It has not done it by cutting back on the Commonwealth's own programs. Understandably, this is a matter that has caused a great deal of concern in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation really represents a lack of comprehension by the Government of what it needs to address in terms of appropriate policies to deal with the problems of Australia at this time. I do not think any of us should forget for a minute that this very day this country is facing one of the most fundamental economic crises of its history. On only two other occasions in Australia's history has it faced such dire economic circumstances. That was in the 1890s and in the 1930s, when every other country faced similar circumstances. The big difference between the circumstances of the 1890s and the 1930s and the circumstances of today is that in the 1890s and the 1930s the world, not just Australia, was faced with a very serious depression. In 1989 the world is not confronted with a fundamental recession. We are living through a period of very strong global economic growth. We are living through a period of very strong economic activity which is ensuring, for example, that Australian commodity prices remain at a relatively buoyant level. That was not the case in the 1980s, nor was it the case in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, the Government basically offers a strategy that is underlined in this legislation-a reduction in funding for the States-and a strategy of high interest rates. The Government offers absolutely nothing else at all. The interesting thing about that approach is that it has already been shown not to work. The Government's high interest rate strategy, a strategy that has been tried all over the world from time to time, is simply not working. One of the two reasons why it is not working is that high interest rates inflate the value of the Australian dollar beyond a level which would normally be its market value. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants to inflate the Australian dollar beyond its normal level, one of the consequences of that is to make imports cheaper and exports more expensive than would naturally be the case. The consequences are clearly not positive ones for our balance of payments. That is the reason why, after 18 months of a high interest rate strategy, our balance of payments situation has not improved, as is continually being predicted by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), but has progressively deteriorated. Although today's figures may be marginally better than those for the previous month-and, seasonally adjusted, the improvement is extremely slight-the simple fact is that the balance of payments situation for September is the worst in the history of Australia. So this is not a strategy that has proved to be enormously successful. In the context of this legislation, this reduction in States grants likewise has not been a successful contribution to our economic strategy. It has not been adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that one has to make about interest rates is that if a strategy such as reducing States grants and having high interest rates and no other is pursued, high interest rates will militate against domestic investment. In other words, they will militate against the capacity of Australian businesses, in particular, small businesses that have no capacity to borrow money in Japan, West Germany or the United States, where interest rates may be substantially lower. They have to borrow money in Australia, and they are borrowing money at rates ranging between 19 and 23 per cent. If businesses are doing that, they clearly do not have the capacity to invest in productive activity as they might be able to do if interest rates were substantially lower than they are currently. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out, the strategy of just maintaining high interest rates and doing what this legislation does-that is, simply reducing the allocation of funds to the States whilst on the other hand increasing Commonwealth spending in areas of Commonwealth programs-is a flimsy one which ultimately is not working. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House are obviously not opposed to reducing the allocation of funds to the States. We made that perfectly clear in the Economic Action Plan released a couple of weeks ago by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). We make no apology for the fact that in that plan the Leader of the Opposition announced on behalf of, and with enormous support from, all of us on this side of the House that there would be a reduction in allocations to the States of some $300m. The interesting thing about that is that it was the Labor Premiers who kicked up a bit of a fuss and said that they were disappointed with the reductions from the Commonwealth, which, by the way, are substantially larger in this legislation than the reductions proposed by the coalition in its Economic Action Plan. The Labor Premiers said that this was outrageous and terrible, and there was the usual party political badinage which I suspect no-one in the community was listening to. That was not the case from the coalition Premiers, of course, because the coalition Premiers recognise that efficiencies can always be achieved in terms of the finances of State governments. I suspect that no State government has done more in recent years to achieve savings and efficiencies than the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This side of the House offers a $300m cut in allocations to the States. We do that because we are absolutely confident that, through the introduction of greater efficiencies, particularly by the State Labor governments, that reduction will be more than made up. Perhaps one of the ways in which the States could achieve greater efficiencies is exactly the way in which we on this side of the House propose greater efficiencies at the Commonwealth level-through the practice of contracting out a large amount of work that is currently done by the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I have referred to the New South Wales Government. That Government has already shown that the practice of contracting out can lead to enormous savings and efficiencies. I suspect that if other governments, such as the Western Australian Government, which has its own problems, the Victorian Government, which has enormous problems, and the South Australian Government, which not only faces its own internal problems but also will have great problems with the people very soon, were prepared to abandon their ideological commitment to nationalisation and public enterprise, they would soon realise that they would be able to achieve enormous savings through the practice of contracting out. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noticed that the Premier of South Australia, Mr Bannon, who is also the President of the Australian Labor Party, argues that no savings could be achieved in South Australia and for the coalition to propose a $300m cut in allocations to the States is nothing short of catastrophic. He makes the argument that just about everything in South Australia would close down and the world, at least so far as South Australia is concerned, would come to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience of New South Wales is that the practice of contracting out and a greater involvement of the private sector in the provision of services to the community will in fact achieve enormous savings, and all the South Australian Government is being asked to save here is something which, if one were to take a percentage figure, is in the vicinity of $20m. That is not the figure, by the way, that Mr Bannon chooses to use; he chooses to use a grossly exaggerated figure, no doubt in order to try to achieve some sort of emotive reaction that will help him with the electoral problems which will face him, I think I am right in saying, on 9 December when we will see whether that is the consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is a very important one. It is that in Australia, where we have various levels of government-the Commonwealth Government, the State governments and local government-we need to ensure that, within that federal system, proper efficiencies are achieved. Our federal system is a system that can work extremely well and extremely efficiently, but it will only work well and it will only work efficiently if there is proper cooperation and there is a determination to avoid duplication by the Commonwealth and the States and if, at each level of government-and I include local government in this-as much private sector involvement is obtained as is humanly possibly. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously there will always be a role for the public sector. There will always be a role for government at the local government, the State government and the Commonwealth government level. But the fact is that the more private sector involvement that can be achieved and the more competitive the provision of services that can be achieved, the more will be the saving to the ordinary members of the community and the taxpayers. That is something that has been achieved in New South Wales; it is something that will be achieved at the Commonwealth level by the Peacock government after the next election; and that is something, too, that the Labor States will at least need to take by example if they do not, of course, go out and promote themselves because they have an ideological view that that should not be done. </PARA>
<PARA> This sort of legislation is really not the comprehensive approach which the Government claims it is for dealing with Australia's fundamental economic problems. What we need to deal with our fundamental economic problems is more than just cutting funding to the States and more than just pursuing a high interest rate strategy. There are a number of things that we, on this side of the House, proposed recently which will achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, as a former chairman of the Waste Watch Committee, I realise that we really have to do much more in Australia to cut out the practice of government waste and the Economic Action Plan that the coalition has put forward to reduce government waste by $2.7 billion is an extraordinarily important document in terms of identifying a commitment on this side of the House to the abolition of waste. We may take longer than one year, which the Economic Action Plan addressed, to eliminate all government waste but at least, in that first year, we have identified ways in which that waste could be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We will ensure, as we have continually pointed out, that unemployment benefits and special benefits where necessary will be paid to people in real need but will not be paid to people whose need is, to be polite about it, rather marginal. We will ensure that proper funding is provided in the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs, which is the Minister's direct responsibility, and we will ensure that proper funding is available to provide every humanitarian and compassionate assistance to the indigenous people of Australia and to give those people opportunities and choices. </PARA>
<PARA> What we will not be doing is pouring more and more money into different portfolios just for the sake of being able to rush round, as the Minister at the table does, to every lobbyist within every single portfolio of government and say, `Guess what the good news is. I have another $50m'-or $104m or whatever the figure may be-`for our particular portfolio. Isn't that terrific?'. If that were terrific I suppose the answer would be that, over the last 50 or 100 years, governments would have poured billions and billions of dollars into every portfolio because they simply took the view that money would solve every problem and it did not much matter where the money came from. The Opposition has always rejected that view. Whilst the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs does not reject that view, because he thinks that is a constructive way of running and managing an economy and a portfolio, we totally reject it. As the opinion polls increasingly show, because we reject waste, profligacy and the Government's big-spending solution to every social and human problem in society, we are being increasingly recognised as the responsible alternative to irresponsible Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition also strongly takes the view that the benefits that can be obtained from these savings will be provided to ordinary families. Those benefits not only will practically improve the living standards of the people who have struggled during the past 6 1/2 years of the Hawke Government but also will ensure that the whole institution of the family has a greater capacity to contribute to the stability of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> We have offered a great deal more than that. We have offered, in the context of income tax, the elimination of bracket creep, whereas the Labor Government has made bracket creep one of our institutions. We have the High Court of Australia, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and bracket creep. They are all institutions in our society, and the High Court is a wonderful institution. Bracket creep is one thing that the Opposition will move to eliminate. We will work towards flattening the income tax system and moving towards a two-tier tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The program offered by the Opposition represents a dramatic contrast to the program offered, inter alia, in this legislation before us. The Opposition is happy to let the legislation pass, but we will always continue to remind the States and the people of Australia that the Labor Party has offered just two panaceas-if we could call them that; it is a euphemism-to Australia's growing economic problems. One is the strategy of high interest rates, which everybody in Australia knows about; and the other is to slash funding to the States in order to reduce government spending, and hope that the States put up with the consequences of that reduction in funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not opposed to a reduction in allocations to the States, because great savings could be achieved by the States through greater efficiencies, but why does the Commonwealth not practise what it preaches? Why is it that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs does not exercise in his own portfolio the same restraints that he would expect the States to exercise? Or am I wrong and does the Minister oppose the legislation? By some sort of logical extrapolation, I suppose one could say that the Minister opposes the legislation. That is an interesting proposition. If he does not oppose the legislation and supports greater efficiencies at the State level through a smaller allocation of funds, why are his own Department and every other Commonwealth department entirely immune from that?</PARA>
<PARA> No matter what the Auditor-General or the Opposition say, and no matter what common sense tells us, apparently no efficiencies can conceivably be achieved in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; that is absolutely impossible. The State departments can achieve those efficiencies-almost every State has a Department of Aboriginal Affairs-but the Commonwealth cannot. Apparently, the Commonwealth has to remain on this high of profligacy. When I say that we do not oppose this legislation, I represent very accurately the position of the Opposition, but I remind the House that one standard is applied to the States and a completely different standard is applied at the Commonwealth level with respect to Commonwealth programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I want to make it very clear to the House that I am doing so. For your benefit, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will go through my introductory remarks again. The honourable member for Mayo during his speech ranged across a number of subjects, including the Opposition's Economic Action Plan and government expenditure, particularly in relation to the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. It is within that context that I have raised these issues. The Opposition speaker said that the coalition has an economic strategy that is encapsulated in its action plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill relates to a number of issues. In this instance it relates specifically to the Northern Territory. In the context of what the honourable member said, the Bill relates to expenditure in the area of Aboriginal affairs and the impact upon the community of the Opposition's policy, which it would introduce if it were in government, as part of an overall economic strategy, taken in conjunction with its policy of fiscal restraint on State and Territory governments. That is the context within which I am addressing the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that it is important in this debate to understand the nature of the Opposition's economic strategy and what it is all about. As the honourable member for Mayo obviously knows, although he does not like to hear it, the Opposition's economic strategy is about alienating the poor and the needy, about perpetuating disadvantage. During his contribution to the debate, the honourable member for Mayo referred to the budget of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and made extensive comments about the expenditure in that budget for this financial year. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the honourable member for Mayo said that, in the context of the Opposition's expenditure proposals for Aboriginal affairs, it would show `every humanity and compassionate approach to give these people opportunity and choices'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are seeing from the Opposition member and the Opposition generally is an inability to grasp the nettle. They are not prepared to have their Economic Action Plan debated as they seek to debate it in the context of their contribution to this debate. I repeat: what the Opposition is proposing in the area of Aboriginal affairs and the area of showing every humanity and compassion, is to cut community development support and community infrastructure programs by $22m. Only last week I announced $3.5m-worth of expenditure for community infrastructure in the Northern Territory. Let me remind the honourable member what that expenditure entailed. It entailed expenditure for sewerage, water reticulation, some housing and some other capital items. If the honourable member is saying that the Opposition's action plan, which he spoke about at length during the debate, is showing every humanity and compassionate assistance to Aboriginal people by virtue of cutting those very important infrastructure programs and community development support programs, I will go he. There is absolutely no doubt what the Opposition is on about. It will cut $100m off the Aboriginal affairs vote. The honourable member for Mayo knows it, and knows what it means. It will not show compassion or humanity, or give these people opportunities and choices. It will not do that at all. It will take away any chance of a reasonable choice for these people because it condemns them to poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to return to the fiscal policy that has been promoted by the Opposition. There has been some argument tonight from the honourable member for Mayo that the Commonwealth Government's fiscal policy has not been what it ought to have been. Let me make very clear that the reductions in payments and borrowings that are the subject of this legislation have been part of the Government's strategy to ensure that all levels of government in Australia contribute to fiscal restraint-something that is essential in order to reduce pressures on domestic demand and the current account deficit. The honourable member for Mayo, while he was here, talked about the need for State and Territory governments to show greater efficiency. He talked about them not being involved in enterprises which should otherwise be the province of private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether he has bothered to counsel the Northern Territory Government. I wonder whether he wanted to talk to the Northern Territory Government about its attitude to feeding funds into privately owned tourist resorts in the Northern Territory. I wonder whether he is aware that the Northern Territory Government is now talking of a mini-Budget because it will not be able to meet its commitments. You might be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Northern Territory Government subsidises the Darwin, Alice Springs and Yulara Sheraton hotels. The cost of subsidising the Alice Springs Sheraton blew out to $5.8m in 1988-89 of which only $2.3m was budgeted for. Debt servicing in the Northern Territory will cost taxpayers $119m in 1989-90. It is the highest per capita debt servicing level in the country. I wonder whether the previous Opposition speaker or the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has taken the trouble when formulating this Economic Action Plan to discuss with the Northern Territory Government its overall economic strategy. The Northern Territory Chief Minister has said that he does not believe, despite the massive debt servicing it has, that there should be a fixed limit for borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it very clear: The attitude adopted by the Northern Territory Government in this area is grossly irresponsible. This sort of attitude that has been perpetuated by the Opposition in this debate, especially by the previous speaker, indicates that that irresponsibility is a mirror of the irresponsibility which is being exercised by the Opposition. Not only is the Opposition saying to Aboriginal people and other people on unemployment benefits or welfare recipients that they are the ones that will take the brunt of any attack which it might visit upon them but the Opposition is also saying to the Northern Territory Government, `You do as you like. Do not worry about what you do'. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Opposition and the Northern Territory Government are not acknowledging the impact of the other aspects of this action plan on the Northern Territory economy. The Northern Territory economy survives on the basis of expenditure coming out of this place. Eighty per cent of the Northern Territory Government's budget outlays come from the Commonwealth. It relies heavily on Commonwealth Government program expenditure including in the area of Aboriginal affairs. In 1988-89 that figure was $44m. If the Opposition cuts $100m off the Aboriginal affairs budget, as it proposes if it were in government, it would have a devastating effect on pockets of the Northern Territory economy. I might remind honourable members opposite that, as a result of a study which was discussed in Alice Springs earlier this year, it was shown that the Aboriginal economy contributed one-third of the total central Australian economy. That economy is largely based on expenditure from the Commonwealth in areas which are designed as part of an overall strategy which encapsulates a social justice approach to economic development and economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> That approach talks about getting Aboriginal people, other people who are welfare recipients and unemployed people back into the work force so that they are less dependent upon the public purse. It is not an approach which is being adopted by the Opposition. In fact, the approach that the Opposition is adopting is completely to the contrary. Let me just say that the $100m in cuts the Opposition proposes to make to Aboriginal affairs expenditure will ensure that those labour market programs which this Government put in place, which seek to make Aboriginal people less reliant on the welfare system, would not work because, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said previously, those people would be in the poverty sink. By the proposals in the action plan, the Opposition will pull out the plug in that poverty sink. In no way is it responsible for the Opposition to adopt that firm approach. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the only area. The Opposition has shown that it despises rural and remote Australia. The Opposition is cutting out programs which have been in place to service rural and remote Australia. It proposes to cut out programs which have been put in place to serve rural and remote Australia-the Countrylink program, the rural education access program, the marketing skills program, the innovative rural education and training program, the rural community-based education program and the rural women's access grants program. All these programs are designed to help people who live in remote communities. What is the Opposition doing through its Economic Action Plan? It is saying that remote areas do not matter. The Northern Territory Government, by its acquiesence to this sort of approach, is suggesting to the Northern Territory community that it also agrees with that approach. It does not understand the nature of the Northern Territory economy, just as the Opposition does not understand the nature of the Australian economy. For all the rhetoric and hot air that the Opposition has come up with, it has not come up with one constructive program, nothing new which would indicate to the Australian community an interest--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In light of the contributions that have been made in this debate tonight, it is worth reminding the House that the Bill before the House is the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill and it is about time that the debate concentrated on the purposes for which the Bill was tabled. To date, the debate has, quite frankly, disgusted me. It is about time that the standard of debate was lifted and honourable members concentrated on lifting the standard of their performances in debate in the House. I intend to limit my time in this debate in order to allow my friend, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) to make his contribution, particularly in view of the now limited time we have available for this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill that we are debating tonight centres on the grants that are made by the Commonwealth Government to the States-the reimbursement of taxes that are raised by the Commonwealth Government and then redirected back to the States. The main achievement that the Government boasts of in this particular Bill is that the grants reimbursed in the 1989-90 Budget to the States have been reduced by $550m. One could question whether that is an achievement that the Commonwealth Government should, in fact, boast about. I think it could probably be compared to the other boasts that the Government makes as to the major feature of the 1989-90 Budget; that is, that it has a surplus of $9 billion. I think that we need to remind ourselves that the purpose for which taxes are raised from the taxpayers of Australia is so that those taxes can be spent on behalf of the population of Australia. It seems to me that if the Commonwealth Government has raised from the Australian people $9 billion more than it intends to spend, something is wrong with the economic management of this country. Clearly, if that has happened taxes are too high. Alternatively, if the Commonwealth Government maintains that it must have such a taxation regime, other measures of economic management must have failed. I suggest to the Commonwealth Government that it review its whole economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to concentrate particularly on the way in which the Government, not only in this financial year but also in previous financial years, has been unfair and has used grants to the States in a very cynical political exercise. This cynicism and the expediency in the way in which these grants are being used are quite apparent. I will concentrate on the way in which Tasmania, in particular, has been singled out for treatment by the Commonwealth Government over the previous years. I will quote some figures of grants that have been made to Tasmania. The House might recall public statements made by the previous Premier of Tasmania, Mr Gray, about the way in which the Hawke Government has treated Tasmania by reimbursement grants from the Commonwealth Government. Despite the treatment that has been given by the Commonwealth Government to Tasmania, Mr Gray was able to maintain a balanced Budget. He balanced his Budget every year that he was in office, despite the treatment given by the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures I shall quote are net figures for reimbursement to Tasmania, starting with the year 1985-86. In that year, Commonwealth Government reimbursement to Tasmania was $876.6m. In 1986-87 it was $890.6m, in 1987-88 it was $854.4m and in 1988-89 it was $896.6m. The increase in grants to Tasmania over those four years totalled a mere $20m, or 2.28 per cent. As all of us in this chamber would realise, that goes nowhere near the level of inflation. Clearly, there was a massive cutback by the Commonwealth in grants being made to Tasmania over the period of the Gray Government. </PARA>
<PARA> During the same four years, the increases to the other States were as follows: In South Australia it was 6.02 per cent; in Western Australia it was 13.22 per cent; in Queensland it was 13.98 per cent; in Victoria it was 11.26 per cent, and in New South Wales it was 9.81 per cent. But to Tasmania it was a miserable 2.28 per cent. Despite the real cutback that was being made to the Gray Government and to the Tasmanian people, Mr Gray managed to maintain a balanced budget. But the cynicism of the Hawke Government has come through in the current financial year. We might recall that it was Mr Gray who represented Tasmania at the most recent Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings. At the 1989 Premiers Conference the Hawke Government allowed Tasmania only about a $5m increase in dollar terms over last year. But immediately after the Loan Council meeting, Tasmania had an election. As a result of that election the Field Government came to office. The Field Government, as we all know, is a coalition between the Green Independents and the Labor Party in Tasmania. Immediately after the Field Government took office, Mr Hawke called Mr Field and said, `I will give you a special package to get you out of trouble'. He immediately offered Mr Field a $50m package over and above what had been agreed to at the 1989 Loan Council meeting. That effectively gave Tasmania an increase in grants of over 6 per cent for this year over last year. Over the previous four years it had been only 2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> So I charge the Hawke Government with sheer cynicism and with the manipulation of taxpayers' money for its own political expediency. I guess it is just another example of the Hawke Government looking after its mates. It has a history of doing that, whether it be in government or in business. The Labor Party and the Hawke Government, in particular, look after their mates. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Liberal, I am not one to ask for government handouts. This country has to get away from the mentality of looking to governments for handouts. Along with the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), I am certainly one who would advocate to the Parliament cutting back both tax raising and tax reimbursements at whatever level of government. But I remind the Hawke Government and the House that not only has the Hawke Government been cutting back on grants to Tasmania, but also it has been very seriously inhibiting our prospects of being able to develop our own economy in Tasmania. To date we have 25 per cent of the land area of Tasmania and its resources locked up in national parks that have been declared by the Hawke Government. In addition, the Hawke Government has intervened to stop the development of our natural resources. I note in particular its intervention in the Wesley Vale development project. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, we have the Hawke Government intervening to prevent the development of our private economy in Tasmania and, on the other hand, we have it cutting back on direct grants to the State from the Commonwealth coffers. I do not mind which way we go about it. If Australia, the Hawke Government, all of the Australian people and all of the other States decide that Tasmania is of such pristine beauty that it needs to be preserved for the rest of Australia in the form of a national park, that is fine, but the rest of Australia has to pay the cost. It is not fair to the people of Tasmania to stop them from developing their natural resources and at the same time to choke them off in the form of Commonwealth grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Commonwealth Government, all members of this Parliament and all Australians, `If you want Tasmania to be a national park, if you want to stop the development of our natural resources, you must pay, but do not expect the Tasmanian people to cop it from both ends'. The way in which Commonwealth grants have been manipulated by the Hawke Government has been nothing short of political cynicism, political opportunism and political expediency. I hope that by next year, by the time of the next Loan Council meeting, we will have a new government in place, a Peacock-led government, which will approach Commonwealth-State relations in a much more open and balanced way than has been the experience under the present Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is eight weeks until Christmas. I think that over that period most Australians will be looking forward with a great deal of anticipation to a time of festivity and joy. I look forward to the next eight weeks leading up to Christmas with some degree of fear and trepidation because I happen to represent the electorate of Cowper, which is a beautiful natural area on the north coast of New South Wales between Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour. It is an electorate which has its own San Andreas fault called the Pacific Highway. In the weeks leading up to Christmas we can expect probably two people to die every week on that highway. Therefore, it is with some fear and trepidation that I look forward to the next eight weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the five years to December last year there were 433 fatalities on the Pacific Highway between Hexham and the Queensland border. I know that it will come as no surprise to honourable members that I should speak on this because ever since I was elected, and even before, I have become perhaps a trifle boring on this subject. But I do not hesitate to be boring if I am going to take the line and advocate the saving of Australian lives. As I said, in the last five years 433 of our fellow Australians have died on that particular piece of highway. </PARA>
<PARA> As of now for 1989 the death toll on the Pacific Highway stands at 85. That includes the death last week of 20 people involved in that horrendous collision between a bus and a semitrailer near Grafton on the New South Wales north coast. I take this opportunity publicly to extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of those who died. I do so with the firm and total conviction that those deaths were needless. The Pacific Highway is a nineteenth century road which is trying to serve the twentieth century and, indeed, twenty-first century traffic. I have said continually-and I will continue to say it-that the road between Hexham and the Queensland border must be a four-lane, dual carriage, divided highway. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no comment about where the blame should lie for last week's very tragic accident. That is for the coroner's court. However, there is one point which is absolutely clear and obvious to anyone who looks at the situation, and that is despite all the debates about driver tiredness and driver training-for goodness sake, we need far better driver training-and whatever arguments are advanced as a cause of these accidents, it is clear and unequivocal that when we change an ordinary, narrow, two-carriage way highway into a four-lane, dual carriage, divided highway, the number of accidents reduces enormously, by something like 82 per cent. The other factors may stay the same but that is the most significant factor. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding by successive governments, State and Federal, has been inadequate over decades. The Pacific Highway is the most used highway in Australia and, as I say, there have been 433 deaths on it in the last five years and 85 deaths already this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Lyne says, the evidence is there and my heart bleeds as I know of the evidence that he is talking about. Analysts say that the death toll for the Pacific Highway is expected to be between 90 and 100 by the end of December 1989. So, realistically, we are looking at another 15 or 16 deaths between now and the end of the year. That is why I say that in the next eight weeks we can expect another two people to die every week on that highway. That is a very depressing and sad prediction. But how can the analysts be so sure? The reason is that the road itself is totally predictable. I know, as do the honourable members for Lyne (Mr Cowan), Page (Mr Ian Robinson) and Richmond (Mr Blunt), because we all drive on that highway night after night, week after week and month after month. At one time one used to find two or three semitrailers together. Recently I counted 16 semitrailers in convoy, nose to tail, charging past me. I drive from Port Macquarie, Kempsey or Wauchope four or five times a week at 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning and, quite frankly, I am not ashamed to confess that it is terrifying. Every time one travels on that highway, one is centimetres from death. The highway is a total time bomb. Quite frankly, I think we have been lucky that we have not had even more deaths.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had the horrific experience only on Friday of the long weekend in October of being quite close behind a fatal accident on the Pacific Highway near Karuah. It was not a pleasant experience. I am very pleased that the recent fatal accident was not in my electorate. It fell to the honourable member for Page to attend the accident and do what he could to help with the bodies that were laid out in a row on the side of the road. As I said, the reason for these accidents is that people who travel on the highway are only centimetres from death. Buses, trucks, semitrailers and caravans are using this road, and swimming pools, demountable school rooms and houses are being transported up and down a road that is inadequate. It is a nineteenth century road. What we have to have is a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway. All the statistics from Australia and all over the world demonstrate quite conclusively that this is the way to save lives. Frankly, to be fairly mercenary, one can save money too because the cost to society of the maiming, death and destruction is absolutely enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I was very pleased that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) agreed with the recommendations of the New South Wales Government that the Pacific Highway should become a national arterial road. A national arterial road is one which serves to increase the competitiveness of industries producing goods for export, or goods that compete with imports or is a road which will facilitate tourist travel. I would put forward the proposition that there is no other road in the whole of Australia which facilitates tourist travel more than does the Pacific Highway. I am not seeking to have this highway upgraded for my benefit or for the benefit of the people whom I represent, although we would cheerfully accept it. But that road serves Australia. It is the major artery between Geelong, Sydney, Newcastle and Brisbane. It serves the whole east coast. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that there is an allocation to the road of $118m over the next five years, but it is less than $24m a year. I have continually said to the Minister that he must accept the principle, the concept and the reality that this has to be a four-lane, dual-carriageway divided highway, to save Australian lives. </PARA>

If the sacrifice of those lives last Friday-and it should not have happened and it would not have happened on a divided highway-can achieve anything, at least, surely, we in this place can unite in a bipartisan fashion and accept that this road must be a four-lane, dual carriage way, divided highway and that there must be acceptance of a special case for special funding so that we do not spend just $24m a year. Mind you, to get the road to where I want it, it would be a 20-year program anyway, but we have got to make a greater commitment and have greater expenditure so that we do achieve a four-lane, dual carriage way, divided highway. As I said, the result that I want is in the interests of all Australians, because the great bulk of us will use that road at some time or other and, if we are lucky, we will not die on it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that we have not the time to deal with many of the important issues contained in the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. I must restrict my remarks in order to finish by 10.30 p.m. Naturally, I fully support what the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) has said. He has been most sincere in every word that he has spoken in the Parliament since becoming a member. I am sure that he has brought to the notice of the Parliament and to the people generally the responsibility of extra funding for the Pacific Highway. I will certainly give him and other members all the support that I can to see that the funding is actually provided for that particular roadway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition will not oppose the legislation before the House because it is a Budget Bill. All the details have already been worked out at the Premiers Conference. We now follow on with this legislation before the House. There are one or two things concerning the Constitution and the responsibility of the States that I would like to say. It may be that this is the opportunity to say it. Whilst I support the federal system entirely, I have been concerned for some time that the States in Australia should have their own taxing powers. They should not have to come to the Commonwealth once a year cap in hand and say to the Commonwealth, `Right, these are our responsibilities for financial spending. These are programs that we have'. We must remember that in this country it is the States that basically have the responsibility for development. There is need for a certain amount of coordination between the States and the Commonwealth in all the major funds that are spent. It is very important, and it is good to see, that there is competition between the States. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time the State Government in New South Wales, realising its indebtedness, has had to adopt certain measures in order to bring its balance sheet back to a reasonable situation. As a result, it has been forced to increase many charges. These charges, of course, fall not only on the State but also on what we recognise as the third tier of government, that is, local government, which also has to provide the services. Only recently the Premier of New South Wales approached the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for assistance in funding the cleaning up of the sewerage schemes around the metropolitan area. He was told that it was a matter that the consumer has to pay for. I suppose that is right in a way. I am saying this just to reiterate the fact that the States have a tremendous responsibility for the development of their areas. I think it is a shame that consideration cannot be given to giving back to the States their right to tax. Certainly they can tax in certain fields, which they are doing. The iniquitous payroll tax, which is unsatisfactory to business, particularly to small business and industry, is not fair and should never have come into being, but it is there and the States are at present very dependent upon it for revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to appreciate the fact that Australia is still a developing country. It will be many decades before we reach a situation similar to those of many countries in the Western world. The honourable member for Cowper has said tonight that roads are one of our greatest responsibilities. It is a decision for the States as to whether they use the railways to a greater degree or whether they use the roads for transport. I recognise that roads are perhaps the greatest problem within my electorate of Lyne. I continually get up in this chamber to make claims for additional funding for roads and bridges not only for the Pacific Highway, but also for the main arterial roads, and the rural and urban roads. </PARA>
<PARA> This country today is dependent on roads for transport. It is a major factor in retail prices and the manufacturing cost of our goods. In fact, we are told that it represents up to 15 per cent of the retail cost of most of the commodities that we buy in supermarkets. Given the responsibility our producers have in getting their goods to market, it is essential that more money be made available for the building of new roads and bridges, of major roadways and highways, as the honourable member for Cowper has said. I suppose that the Pacific Highway is one of the busiest roads, if not the busiest, in Australia today, serving a developed part of this country, and it will continue to do so because of its geographical situation and the tourist industry. That responsibility is there. </PARA>
<PARA> It disappoints me to hear the Government now say that the petrol tax is just another form of revenue for the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The motorists, in the country particularly, will not accept this because they know that the purpose of this tax is the return of moneys to fund the road costs of the Commonwealth. They will always say that the petrol tax has been imposed for that particular purpose. It is no use the Minister coming into the chamber and telling us month after month that the tax is imposed for general revenue purposes. We know that only about 5c out of the tax of about 23c on a litre of petrol is returned to the roads of the States. I make a plea not only on behalf of our councils and the States but also on behalf of the people, who recognise that our roads are inadequate and need extra funding. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said earlier, we hope to see not only the public sector but also the private sector closely involved with the development of this country. The Commonwealth, the States and local government must give every encouragement to private sector involvement. I reiterate my support for the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper and what has been said about the Pacific Highway and the need for road funding. I have said what I believe the rightful powers of the States should be in terms of our taxing responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the House do now adjourn.</PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) raised, as a matter of privilege, actions of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in connection with the 1989-90 national health survey. As I understand it, the substance of the honourable member's complaint is that misleading information was provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in relation to certain questions about women's health. The honourable member said, if I understood him correctly, that, contrary to information given to the House, certain areas of questioning in the main-compulsory-survey referred either specifically or indirectly to topics which are included in the voluntary area.</PARA>
<PARA> May cites as examples of contempt or breaches of privilege: the making of a deliberately misleading statement to the House; the presentation of false, forged or fabricated documents to a House; and conspiracy to deceive either House. In such matters, the question of intent is obviously a vital element. In a document presented to the House in May 1989 in connection with the national health survey, the ABS said that it had developed, in consultation with certain persons and agencies, a separate proposal for the collection from women respondents of information on a range of women's health issues. It appears that this has happened, so the ABS statement was not false. It could, however, be argued that there was a tendency to mislead the House because the impression may have been gained from the ABS statement not only that there would be two separate surveys but also that there would be no overlap between them. Whilst I recognise this line of thinking, the documentation available to me leads me to the view this was not the conclusion the reader should draw. In those circumstances I am unable to find that a prima facie case of contempt or breach of privilege has been made out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A recent decision of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) declared that public broadcasting stations in Australia will in future not be allowed to accept sponsorship in the way that they have in the past to generate income to run their stations. Public broadcasting in Australia has been in existence since 1972. These are largely independent, non-profit, non-commercial stations. To a large extent they complement the commercial and national broadcasting sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are 84 public broadcasting stations operating in Australia, with licences pending for another 22. Usually, sponsorship makes up about 25 per cent of the income that they use to run their operations. However, in future, because of this decision, stations will be able to mention the sponsor's name and telephone number only once. This means that because sponsors will not get a fair go for their money, they will cease to sponsor these stations. The choices left for the public broadcasting stations are to close down, drastically restrict their programs or, even worse in many aspects, ask for more government help to keep going. The Public Broadcasting Association of Australia is going to challenge this decision in the High Court. That will probably cost it $100,000 and, quite frankly, I do not like its chances. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to direct my comments tonight to Western Education Broadcasting in my electorate, a public broadcasting station with the call signal 2WEB, situated at Bourke. It operates out of an almost brand new building which cost $300,000 to erect, of which I note that $200,000 was raised privately. It has a $75,000, five-kilowatt transmitter and operates on frequency 585. It employs 12 staff. It is one of the biggest employers in Bourke and puts about $7,000 in wages into that town every week. It covers remote towns, apart from Bourke, such as Brewarrina, Byrock, Coolabah, Girilambone, Louth, Enngonia, Barringun, Fords Bridge, Yantabulla, Hungerford, Wanaaring, Weilmoringle, and towns in the electorate of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) such as Goodooga, Lightning Ridge and Walgett. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from a translator relaying Sydney Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio and some Orange ABC radio into the area, no other radio station is broadcasting into that area and there is virtually no local content whatsoever. The nearest commercial station in my electorate is 2DU Dubbo, which is almost 400 kilometres away; therefore, 2WEB is not competing with any other commercial station in the area. 2WEB is the only local station for most of that area and it derives all of its sponsorship locally from small business and community groups. If this ABT decision is applied, it will kill off this radio station. In fact, sponsorship constitutes more than 50 per cent of 2WEB's income and the rest of its income is raised locally through concerts, outside broadcasts, the sale of T-shirts and stickers, as well as government grants for specific projects. </PARA>
<PARA> 2WEB covers a vast area-about 60,000 square kilometres-which has a population of about 40,000 people. One could fit the 24 central Sydney electorates into that area 18 times over. It is an isolated area with a hot, dry climate, an area that earns export income and has few or no services. People in that area struggle to maintain a quality of life. Eighty per cent of the people in that area listen to 2WEB-it is their station- and this Government is going to make it unviable. It has local news, rural news, Aboriginal programs, education programs and community programs. It has a high percentage of Aboriginal people and it acts to unite all the people in the area and give them that feeling of oneness and a quality of life. If this decision goes ahead, that could well be ended. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) to allow the status quo or at least to allow 2WEB to go commercial. I urge the Minister to look again at this totally inappropriate ABT decision. If he will not reverse the decision, at least he should amend the legislation to allow remote area public broadcasting stations to be able to survive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) tonight when he extended his condolences to the families of those people who were killed in that horrific accident in the town of Cowper on the northern coast of New South Wales. Of course, that accident occurred on the Pacific Highway and tonight I wish to draw attention to another trouble spot on the Pacific Highway within my electorate. At the intersection of the Pacific Highway and Elizabeth Bay Road there was a double fatality at this time last year when two elderly residents of my electorate were killed in an accident with a heavy vehicle. In recent years there has been a massive increase in population in the Lake Munmorah and Chain Valley Bay area and, as a result, there has been a rapid increase in the number of people using this intersection. In addition, because of the sealing of the rutile road from Budgewoi to Lake Munmorah, people who are heading north from Toukley are increasingly using this Pacific Highway and Elizabeth Bay Road intersection and, as I have said, there was a double fatality there at this time last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent days the local residents have been campaigning for the installation of traffic lights at this intersection. Unfortunately, the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Baird, has decided that the intersection does not deserve traffic lights-he is against traffic lights on the Pacific Highway-and he is proposing to spend over $100,000 on alterations to the road and the installation of new medium strips, even though an equivalent amount of money could be used to install traffic lights; the long term solution to accidents at this black spot intersection. </PARA>
<PARA> What upsets me is that while Mr Baird says that there is no money to overcome this traffic problem at Lake Munmorah, he found $2m at the drop of a hat to overcome a problem with traffic noise in the Hornsby area simply because a few influential people living in Liberal electorates in that part of Sydney complained of some noise once the new Hornsby bypass was opened. It was no problem for Mr Baird to find $2m to overcome a traffic noise problem but there is not $100,000 to install traffic lights in the Lake Munmorah area. Several weeks ago more than 200 local residents of the Lake Munmorah area attended a public meeting and called on Mr Baird to inspect personally the intersection so that he could see for himself the danger for local residents, and in particular the school children who attend St Brendan's and the Lake Munmorah public school. </PARA>
<PARA> While speaking on the question of safety on the Pacific Highway, I also wish to make a few comments on the safety of heavy vehicles on our highways and roads at the moment. Earlier this year I made a few speeches in this House about my view that tachographs should be made compulsory for heavy vehicles so that there is a permanent record of the speed history of trucks if they are involved in an accident or picked up for speeding. There was a tragedy at Cowper last week, a near miss on the Pacific Highway yesterday and I understand that tonight there was another fatality somewhere near Bathurst and, unfortunately, another serious accident between Yass and Gunning on the Hume Highway. I believe all of this is strong evidence for the need to install tachographs so that the truck drivers know that there will be a permanent record of the speeds at which they are travelling. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) is pushing very hard and accelerating the requirement for speed limiters to be installed on trucks and heavy vehicles. I accept that that will ensure that some of the cowboys cannot exceed the 100 kilometres per hour speed limit which should apply to heavy vehicles. I believe that, in addition to the speed limiters, we need to consider the installation of tachographs. We should make it compulsory for the owners of heavy vehicles to pay that little bit of extra cost to install tachographs on heavy vehicles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what has just been said by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee). In Queensland, where the speed limit is 90 kilometres per hour, it is an absolute farce when it comes to vehicles like semitrailers and buses on highways and the speeds at which they travel. Nevertheless, I am constrained to say that the need for much greater expenditure on our roads is now becoming urgent. One of the criticisms that have been made in relation to the recent bus tragedy is that it happened on a notorious stretch of road. A bus and semitrailer both travelling at speed in opposite directions is a recipe for disaster at any time on that road, which is in urgent need of upgrading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I want to raise a matter which has been brought to my attention by a constituent of mine who is a taxation accountant. He recently received a letter from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in relation to the 1988-89 construction industry survey. I want to read part of that letter into the record. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>While the ABS has extensive lists of businesses, some do not come to our notice. Because we want the survey to be representative of all businesses in the construction industry, the ABS has obtained a list of names and postal addresses of businesses from the Australian Taxation Office. These details have been supplied to the ABS in accordance with Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> However, for a considerable number of businesses, the postal address provided is merely care of the accountant or tax agent. The purpose of this letter is to obtain more complete contact information from you for the business(es) shown on the attached list. Some of these businesses may later be included in the sample of businesses asked to supply statistical information. </PARA>
<PARA> Would you please complete the attached list by providing details of the business (not accountant's) address, contact name, telephone number and a brief description of the main business activity. Where applicable, details of any trading name or trustee company name should also be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>My constituent expressed the following concern to me in the letter I received, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The letter states that the ABS has obtained information from the Australian Taxation Office in relation to a number of my clients and requests that I supply further details in relation to those clients. </PARA>
<PARA>My constituent expresses this concern:</PARA>
<PARA> The information requested is not of a particularly sensitive nature, being related to business addresses, phone numbers and the type of activity carried on by the client. However, I am concerned that this request would be followed by further enquiries which may be more intrusive. In any case, I am not comfortable with the situation which appears to intrude upon the confidentiality of my dealings both with my clients, and with the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a telephone enquiry, I was advised that my compliance was not compulsory, and I certainly will not be answering the request unless my clients agree. Whilst I agree that it is necessary that these surveys be carried out from time to time, I consider that this method of obtaining information sets an unacceptable precedent for further encroachments on the rights of citizens. I am also alarmed that the letter requesting this information does not state that there is no basis in law for the request or that compliance is not compulsory. As compliance with most of the requests by the ABS for information is compulsory, it would be understandable if the information requested were supplied simply because of a belief that it is legally required. </PARA>
<PARA>I totally agree with the view put to me by my constituent. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) has consistently raised in this place concerns that he has about the method of approaching surveys that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has adopted. It has become heavy-handed and almost bully boy. Having read the letter from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, I agree with my constituent that it does not give any indication that the approach is made on any basis other than compulsion. The letter should state that compliance is not compulsory. Instead, it reads very officiously. I also agree with the concern expressed by my constituent about the Australian Taxation Office supplying apparently extensive information to the Australian Bureau of Statistics about businesses in Australia. It is very clear that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has an enormous list of businesses in Australia. It is now also very clear that that comes from the Australian Taxation Office. This is reprehensible and the Australian Bureau of Statistics should be pulled into line quick smart by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join with the previous speakers in respect of the recent tragic deaths on our roads. But in this adjournment speech I wish to refer to another series of tragic deaths that are occurring internationally. I want to highlight the scandalous abuses by multinational companies in the marketing of baby milk formulas. In some overseas countries companies such as Nestles are ignoring the recommendations of the World Health Organisation and the United Nations Children's Fund to refrain from dumping free supplies and samples of baby milk products in clinics and maternity hospitals. The question must be asked: Why attack the generosity of such companies? The reason is simple. It is an attempt to hook both mothers and babies to an artificial form of feeding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The medical evidence is clear: breast feeding is superior to artificial milk for at least nine out of 10 children. According to Byers in the American Journal of Epidemiology, the risk of breast cancer is higher in women who breastfeed for less than a month, and this risk decreases progressively with increased breastfeeding duration. In the 13 August 1988 issue of that eminent British medical journal, The Lancet, there was an article by Dr Davis which shows that children who are exclusively breast fed for at least six months are half as likely to develop breast cancer as are children not breast fed. When specific cancers are considered, the risk of developing lymphoma is 5.6 times higher in artificially fed compared with breast fed infants. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other studies relevant to the Third World countries show how dangerous it is for these large multinational companies to peddle these artificial milk supplies to hospitals and health authorities. In Gabon children between one and two years of age still receiving breast milk have a 29 per cent parasite infection rate while artificially fed children of the same age have a 66 per cent infection rate. If we look at the serious issue of malnutrition in Brazil, we see that 80 per cent of infants three months or older still being breast-fed have normal nutritional status, but only 43 per cent of bottle-fed infants have normal status. In southern Brazilian cities diarrhoea becomes a problem. Babies who receive no breast milk are 14.2 times more likely to die from diarrhoea than breast-fed babies. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this to do with Australia? Overseas experience has shown that some very subtle marketing techniques can be used by the multinationals to get a foot in the door at maternity hospitals. It is clear that this is happening in Australia. We must ensure that women are able to make a choice about how they are able to feed their babies and are not influenced by commercial pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned that in some isolated Aboriginal communities where access to fresh water is a problem, bottle feeding could be the prescription for death that it has proven to be in Third World countries. On an international level, Australia cannot bring pressure to bear on developing countries to protect their people from unscrupulous formula companies if we have done nothing to keep these practices out of Australia. The boycott of Nestles products by Australian consumers could be an effective way of encouraging that company to cease its notorious marketing operations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to cover a couple of subjects. Firstly, a number of honourable members have touched on the road toll. I join with them in expressing my sympathy to all those involved in the road toll, directly and indirectly, during this period of great carnage on our highways. In the most recent tragedies, this has been caused too often by heavy trucks and semitrailers. This is a matter which our shadow Minister for land transport handles very capably. I am sure that he would want me to say in this context that part of the equation is the standard of the roads, quite apart from any other factors involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As he has pointed out in a paper which I have before me, there is a direct correlation, and that relates to the question of road funding from the Federal source. Clearly, that is a matter which will be pursued on another occasion. But as a number of honourable members have raised this matter, I remind the House that, over the past six years, there has been a reduction in Federal road funding, and we are going to pay a price for that. I also remind the House that it is ironic that although we have had a very wet winter, and that put a lot of pressure on our road system, the real breakdowns in many sections of roads and highways have actually occurred as the soil underneath the bitumen surface has dried out. Weighted vehicles have caused sections of road to collapse. For example, the Riverina Highway has actually been worse during the drying-out period than during the middle of this year's extremely wet winter. These are matters which the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) will pursue. I wanted to clarify that. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, last night the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) referred to the magnificent events in Tenterfield to mark the centenary of the speech by Sir Henry Parkes in relation to the federation of this great nation. I commend all those who were involved with the ceremonies that took place in Tenterfield-the running of the very last train to Tenterfield, the re-enactment of Sir Henry Parkes's speech by Leonard Teale, the opening of the ball by the right honourable member for New England and all the related activities. I understand that it was a very successful weekend. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to highlight to the House that the focus of the build-up towards Federation during that 10-year period from 1889 to 1899 and the referendums and subsequently 1901 when Federation actually occurred moved around Australia a great deal. In 1893, at Corowa on the New South Wales-Victorian border, the first of the key meetings took place to pave the way for Federation and the referendums and the other negotiations and discussions which took place. The Corowa Shire Council and I and others have had preliminary discussions with regard to commemorating in 1993 the centenary of that first Federation meeting at Corowa. It will be an important occasion as we build towards the centenary of Federation in Australia. I am pleased that the Tenterfield commemoration was so successful. I am sure that the Corowa centenary Federation commemoration-in a town where we have had a very successful Federation festival for many years-will be equally successful in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA> Further east of Corowa is the city of Albury. I take this opportunity to comment on a magnificent booklet entitled `A Memorable Life: the Historical Ramblings of Albury's longest serving Mayor'. That is Cleaver Ernest Bunton. Few people in Australia have contributed more to the city in which they live. This incredible man was the mayor of the city for three decades, a member of local government for five decades and secretary of more than 40 organisations. He played a decisive role in breaking down many barriers across the border and between religions. He had an involvement with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, with the famous KLM aircraft incident at Albury, and the like. I take this opportunity to salute Cleaver Ernest Bunton, a man who also served in the Senate for a brief period in 1975, for the huge contribution he made to the city of Albury, the region beyond and around Albury, the State and the nation. His contribution is one that deserves acknowledgment particularly in his role as father of the great city of Albury and his key local government leadership, which has helped pave the way for Albury to become the modern city it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes I have I would like to address some criticism which has been levelled recently by various people, including members of the Opposition, at the Government's labour market programs, specifically the training programs which are being carried out through Skillshare and the Australian traineeship program and administered through jobs, education and training, Newstart and other programs. The Opposition in its recently announced policy has proposed a cut in funding for these programs and it is clear why. It thinks they are worthless. That is what the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) implied in this House yesterday and what he and other members of the Opposition have said on other occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I could recount to the House my experience of this matter in my electorate. In many factories and businesses in my electorate there is a shortage of people with certain skills. These skills include industrial sewing, dry cleaning, word processing and attendant care-attendant care being the care given to the physically and intellectually disabled people living in the community. What has the Government done about this? Through programs such as Skillshare it has put more than $1m into my electorate to train long term unemployed people in these and other skills. That has worked. People are graduating from these courses and getting jobs in the local area. Next to my office there is a Commonwealth Employment Service job club where long term unemployed people undertake three-week courses in how to apply for a job. They are given the confidence and the personal and communications skills which will enable them to apply successfully for employment. The success rate has been phenomenal. The vast majority of those taking the job club course are in permanent full time jobs within a week or two of finishing the course. The best part about these programs is that they are done as a result of close cooperation between employers, various levels of government and community groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants to cut funding for these courses. It says that the long term unemployed should be in work, but it would cut funding for the very programs which are getting them into jobs. Its policy is quite contradictory and counterproductive. The most reprehensible aspect of its attitude is that it scoffs at these courses and these people and at the qualifications they are gaining. The honourable member for Bradfield said yesterday that these qualifications are worthless, that they are not proper qualifications. They are skills which are needed in the work force and which are getting people into jobs, but according to the Opposition they are worthless. Being a trained word processor, dry cleaner or industrial sewer is worthless. How many members of the Opposition can do industrial sewing? How many of them know how to care for the physically or intellectually disabled? I doubt that any of them do. Yet they pour scorn on people who as a result of this training can do these things. </PARA>
<PARA> These people should all go to technical and further education (TAFE) colleges, says the Opposition, and get proper qualifications. It may come as news to some members of the Opposition that not all people are able to do a TAFE course or want to do a TAFE course. Why should they when our work force needs people with skills that are not necessarily taught at a TAFE college? To say that the skills I have been talking about that are imparted by Skillshare and similar courses are worthless smacks of the worst kind of intellectual snobbery. </PARA>
