<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That every abortion kills an unborn baby.</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life.</PARA>
<PARA> That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect.</PARA>
<PARA> That in 1987-88, taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million.</PARA>
<PARA> That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means as its disposal.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>International Earth Repair Action Decade</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that:</PARA>
<PARA> our total global environment is rapidly deteriorating;</PARA>
<PARA> important natural resources vital to human life and livelihood such as ozone, trees, soil and water are being depleted at an increasing and alarming rate;</PARA>
<PARA> there is an urgent need to educate all people in conservation skills and the responsible use and maintenance of natural resources;</PARA>
<PARA> the United Nations Association of Australia (the peoples' arm of the UN) has proclaimed an Australian ERA (Earth Repair Action) Decade from 1988;</PARA>
<PARA> Earth Repair Action will unite people, communities, religions and nations in the productive purpose of greening and repairing our Earth for a safer and more peaceful future.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will:</PARA>
<PARA> Propose that an International Earth Repair Action (ERA) Decade begin on World Environment Day, June 5, 1990 with FIERY, the First International Earth Repair Year, and that this be proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly. This ten-year plan will ignite the spirit of local and global cooperation to hygienically compost all presently wasted bio-degradable materials into humus to revitalise soils; grow billions of trees to replace forests lost and replenish the atmosphere; establish sustainable, economic and agricultural growth internationally, and end world hunger.</PARA>

<TITLE>Interest Rates</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully points out to the House that:</PARA>
<PARA> Huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families,</PARA>
<PARA> Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further into debt unless interest rates fall substantially.</PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the election of the Hawke-Keating Government in 1983, mortgage interest rates were 12.7% and a tax rebate system then existed to assist other home buyers.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, therefore, your petitioners request that the House require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force Australian home-seekers out of the housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Greenhouse Effect</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the President, Members of the Grand Council, Members and Supporters of the Confederation of Chivalry worldwide and the Associated Orders and Organization jointly with residents of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Confederation of Chivalry, jointly and on behalf of the undersigned petitioners are deeply concerned with the approaching climatic and environmental changes worldwide, due to past irresponsible commercial policies, in self interest of Industrial Corporations, High-Finance and consequently the majority of dependent companies, distributors, promoters and consumers as the final link in the chain and that these grave damages inflicted upon nature by man have been known to most Governments worldwide, but have been left unresolved as unpopular issues by politicians of either side and that being confronted with the so-called `Greenhouse Effect', the disintegrating Ozone Layer of the Earth's Atmosphere, the general public is expected to resolve the problems and repair the wounded Planet.</PARA>
<PARA> It is our belief, that the ever growing population of man and it's growing industries, can only escalate and shorten the time left, before dramatic changes to climate and environment will happen and that only drastic emergency-measures by each and every Nation of the World can slow down and hopefully reverse the course of disaster.</PARA>
<PARA> We further believe, that technology has advanced with a speed, dangerous to mankind, destructive to the entire living nature, educating a society to create waste, including masses of un-natural and harmful waste of plastic matter, thus destroying the resources of water and plant life, especially the remaining forests. We hold that it is not unreasonable and not impossible for the public to exercise restraint in demands of consumer commodities and that the entire industry can be directed to change without much delay. Surely, it is the ultimate of waste, loading upon the public mountains of daily newspapers, mainly for the purpose of disseminating 95% of its volume in senseless advertisements and it is a mockery to expect the public to collect the wastepaper, when only inadequate recycling facilities are available. It is much appreciated that Governments worldwide devise plans for massive re-afforestation, planning to drive forestbelts into the arid lands as well as also numerous lakes and man-made waterways, yet the implementation of emergency-laws, regarding paper in order to save trees would include a.) a ban on advertisements in all newspapers and hand-distribution of Ads in letter boxes, b.) Furthermore all liquid dairy-products to be packed in glass bottles only, c.) Companies and distributing outlets of goods should be required to save paper and customers should be asked to carry such goods in permanent carriers, such as shopping bags and baskets.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe, the alarming level of carbon-dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead and other airpolluters require immediate drastic changes by removing in the first step 2/3rd of private petrol-driven vehicles from the roads, requesting vehicle manufacturers to provide engines driven by solar energy, gas, hydrogen or electricity. Commuter services for the workforce should be restricted to electric trains, trams, buses or for short distances by the use of bicycles. That electricity is provided from hydro-electric, solar, natural gas and similar sources only and that all spray-cans are being banned.</PARA>
<PARA> By this our humble petition respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the re-afforestation, dam and lake-building programs could be executed by drawing manpower from the unemployed population, the military, weekend planting actions by organizations and family participation and schools under Government coordination and by farmers on their own land. That private tree-planting being encouraged through lower prices for seedlings and increased production of trees and shrubs in nurseries. And furthermore, that all organic waste is converted to compost for the enrichment of the soil by households and by municipalities as well.</PARA>
<PARA> That a policy of `Return to the Land' is encouraged, providing incentives for farmers and the village-life, preventing Banks from foreclosing on mortgaged properties, but providing guarantees for the future of the Rural population. Prohibiting the manufacture of any artificial, synthetic or semi-artificial food and beverages, thus relying on the natural resources of the soil and by implementing such encouraging rural policy, reducing the city-populations. Perhaps nature in its Divine Creation has given mankind a stern warning, that the natural forces of the Planet can tolerate only a certain degree of violations and abuse. It is our belief that man shall come together again in communities and in communication with each other, as such had been in time gone by, and in harmony, in care and in recognition of the entire living world. We believe that nature in itself is an eternal music, inspiring and invigorating contrary to the hard and violent sound of music manufactured in the cities as a stimulant for violence and drugs. We believe that ecology must have superiority over economy and not vice versa.</PARA>
<PARA> If we just briefly take a look at the ecological state of the World, we see the dying forests of Scandinavia, the lakes devoid of any life due to the acid-rain. The same applies to Central Europe, the Black Forest, Czechoslovakia and Poland. The lake Baikal in Russia is virtually dead and so are the majority of lakes and rivers. It is not better in North America! Drinking water, pumped from the heavy polluted rivers in Europe is endangering the health of people, while the heavy industry pumps good ground water to be used for cooling purposes in the production. The deserts are fast moving forward, destroying the remaining arable land. Hunger and poverty marks the nations of Third World Countries, being exploited more than ever! Hunger and thirst appears to be their future. Every day many Species in Wildlife disappear forever in Flora and Fauna as a result of eradication or as a result of the damaged Web of Life, yet millions of new cars are added to the roaring traffic. New fleets of jet-liners are thundering through the skies; restless builders of a giant poisonous dome around the Globe. Sealife is dying, bird-life is dying, man himself suffers already in alarming rate Birth-Deformities, Aids, Cancer and Heart-diseases. We hold in all humbleness that the picture here presented is surely not an overstatement.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the petitioners, appeal to the Government of this nation, as we do appeal to all Governments on Earth. To the Politicians and the Public; to the Media and the Manufacturers, to come to terms with plain reasons and make peace with nature. To halt the craze of want and greed. To slow down and come to senses, before it is too late,-before the ecology on earth tips over and destroys our world as it used to be. This World is our home! This nature--we are part of it! It is lent to us for just a lifetime. Man had assumed the role of a Caretaker of the Divine Creation, but has become a destroyer of the Web of Life. It is our responsibility to restore the health and wellbeing of the Planet before we must leave it to the generations to come after us.</PARA>
<PARA> We, the petitioners, an Association of numerous Orders of Knighthood, Military and Peace Organizations, Universities, Academies, ordinary members of the Confederation of Chivalry and ordinary citizens, all have pledged to partake in the Crusade of our time, the defence and Protection of Life being assembled in the World Parliament of the Confederation of Chivalry, humbly present this petition and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in presenting the Flags Amendment Bill 1989. In doing so, I want to make it clear that the purpose of the Bill is simply to protect the Australian flag. We want to ensure that the present Australian flag cannot be changed without the approval of the Australian people at a referendum. In our view, that is a necessary protection. Several previous moves by the Opposition to protect the flag by legislation have been thwarted by this Government. Last year private member's Bills were brought before this House and the Senate. At that time the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) indicated that he had no intention of trying to change the Australian flag. However, it should not be overlooked that earlier sentiment in the Labor Party was all for a new flag. It backed off this particular matter in the bicentennial year after strong protest from the Opposition and a public outcry against the flag being changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe there is no doubt that the flag, as it is, attracts a warmth, loyalty and affection from the great majority of Australians. Even those who some years ago, when debate regarding the style and content of our national flag was at its height, spoke of it in derisive terms now realise that the sentiment of the Australian community is overwhelmingly in favour of the present flag. But let us not forget that a few years ago opinion in the Labor Party was running strongly against the flag. While it has done an about-face on the issue, that does not mean that it is no longer hostile to what the flag represents; nor does it mean that the Government, when it sees an opportunity, might not strike again in a similar fashion to the techniques used to replace the national anthem. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Government has a reputation for following the Fabian style of introducing reforms by gradualism or, as the Prime Minister suggested back in 1984, `waiting for the right moment and striking hard'. What we are seeking to do is to pre-empt any such strike in relation to the Australian flag. We simply want to put beyond doubt that our present national flag, of which we are proud, cannot be changed without an affirmative vote of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, under the Flags Act 1953 the flag designated the Australian national flag can be changed only by legislation. However, the Act allows the Governor-General to `appoint such other flags and ensigns of Australia as he thinks fit'. Without consulting the people, the Government, therefore, may advise the Governor-General to appoint other flags to replace the Australian national flag for specific national purposes. For that reason, the Bill will provide for `other flags or ensigns' to be appointed by the Governor-General only by regulation, proclamation. This will ensure that the Parliament has an opportunity for review. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I just want to say that if the Government is really sincere in its stated desire not to alter the flag it will support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill read a first time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, noting (a) the efforts of the peoples of the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to become and remain independent and (b) that the USSR, under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, and Nazi Germany entered into a secret agreement on 23 August 1939 known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, one consequence of which was the occupation of the Baltic States, this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) reaffirms Australia's longstanding affinity with the aspirations of the Baltic peoples and endorses their continuing quest for self-determination and the preservation of their cultural heritage;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) welcomes the many positive reforms that have been recently initiated in the USSR under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev, and the improvements these have brought to the Baltic peoples; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls upon the Government of the USSR to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) publicly denounce the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) restore to the Baltic peoples the fundamental rights and freedoms which they seek; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) establish a mechanism whereby the Baltic peoples may peacefully and democratically exercise their sovereign right to determine their own future. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion starts off by noting two situations. First, it notes `the efforts of the peoples of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to become and remain independent'. It should be said at the outset, I believe, that we note those efforts and we support and encourage them in every way. It should also be emphasised that the most important word in that proposition is `independent'. The independence of the three Baltic states is the end objective to which we all should be working and we should be supporting all of those in and outside those three states who are working towards the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion also notes that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and Nazi Germany on 23 August 1939 entered into what has become known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It should be said without any doubt whatsoever that that was a very dark day for the three Baltic states and the people who live in them because there began their sad modern history. The events of that day resulted in the occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union. From that day has come the deportations and deaths which occurred and the separation of families. All of the sadness and human tragedy of the Baltic states in modern times have stemmed from that very dark day, 23 August 1939, when this part of Europe was carved up between two dictatorial regimes. The continued domination of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union stems directly from that outrageous pact that was entered into on 23 August 1939. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important therefore that, understanding that history, we then move to the propositions that the House is asked to support in this motion. The first is that we reaffirm Australia's longstanding affinity with the aspirations of the Baltic peoples and endorse their continuing quest for self-determination and the preservation of their cultural heritage. We have an affinity with those people and this motion endorses the quest of the people of those three states for self-determination and, as I have said, to use the only word that can accurately describe their legitimate aspirations, independence. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is appropriate to say here that the very worst thing we can do for those who presently live in the Baltic states is to remain silent. If we remain silent about their struggle we will be giving no encouragement to them to continue with their fight and their struggle. By remaining silent we will be doing nothing more than encouraging the occupying power of those three states to remain the occupying power and to continue to deny independence, freedom and liberty to the peoples of the three Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the motion acknowledges what has been happening in the Soviet Union and what has been happening in the three Baltic states themselves. It acknowledges that there have been some improvements. The motion which I originally drafted, which is on the Notice Paper under a different item, did not refer to this but in referring to these improvements it must be remembered that there have been some very disturbing events in recent days because we have seen the government-controlled media in the USSR in effect send out a warning and a message to activists in the Baltic states that, according to the USSR, things have gone too far. The movement for freedom, independence, liberty and justice, according to the apparatchiks in the Kremlin, has now gone too far. Undoubtedly this is being held out as a warning, and we must bear that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> While we acknowledge in this part of the motion that there have been some improvements, the point must be made time and time again that there now must be no drawing back from those improvements. The movement for reform must be allowed to continue and encouraged to continue. That point must be made very clearly and very firmly. Thirdly, the motion calls upon the Government of the USSR initially to denounce the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The USSR now acknowledges that it was entered into and a good starting point must be to denounce it and, secondly, to restore to the Baltic peoples the fundamental rights and freedoms which they seek. By this we mean all of the fundamental and generally accepted rights and freedoms and, above all, that most basic right of all, which is the right of self-determination, the right of independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion also calls for the Government of the USSR to establish a mechanism whereby the Baltic peoples may peacefully and democratically exercise their sovereign right to determine their own future. It is now up to the Soviet Union to put that mechanism into practice; it is its responsibility to put it into motion. Until that is done we cannot be satisfied that the Baltic states have any real prospect of achieving independence or freedom for their peoples.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the proposition that is put before the House-a proposition which can generally be put in these words: we acknowledge the very sad history in that part of Europe that stems from the dark day of 23 August 1939; we acknowledge and deplore all of the human tragedies, all of the injustices that have flowed to the people of the three Baltic states from the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact; and we call upon all freedom loving people to support the struggle for independence and freedom in the Baltic states, to support people there who are trying to achieve for themselves those basic and elementary freedoms, the liberty and justice to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> You, Mr Speaker, were present only a few days ago outside the Parliament when there was a gathering of people who support this movement. You should be given credit for your presence and for what you said on that occasion. All honourable members should support this motion in the way in which you, Mr Speaker, supported similar propositions outside the Parliament only a few days ago. By that public demonstration we can all indicate that we support the proposition expressed in this motion. Accordingly, I regard it as a very great honour to have moved this motion. I urge all honourable members to support it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to second the motion moved by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), which deals with the aspirations of self-determination of the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The terms of this motion were suggested by the Government. It is pleasing to see that it has bipartisan support. I have an abiding interest in the Baltic question, an interest which is on the one hand longstanding, dating from my childhood, but which has been revived of late; on the other hand, due to my activities since my election and due to a visit I made to the Soviet Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a typical Australian child growing up in the 1950s in suburban Adelaide every week or two I saw a new child appear in our classroom. These children spoke not a word of English and wore what we considered odd clothes and ate odd food. They had names such as Janis, Biruta and Kirsty. They were always well behaved, conscientious and artistic. Our parents and our teachers told us that they were Balts. As I grew up with them in school, university and then the teaching profession, I came to know more about their background, why they and their families had come to Australia, and their tragic personal and national history. </PARA>
<PARA> I always feel a bit reluctant to lump the three nationalities-Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians-together under the Baltic label. I know that they are three very distinct ethnic groups, culturally and linguistically. But they have two things in common-first, their subjugation under the Stalinist and succeeding Soviet regimes and, as a consequence of this, their desire, sincerely and passionately felt, to have their respective nations returned to a state of political self-determination. The other characteristic they share is their sorrow at the loss of so many family members and friends who were killed or deported during the Stalinist years. </PARA>
<PARA> This desire for independence has not diminished over the years. If anything it has grown, not only amongst the Baltic peoples and Baltic nations, but amongst the Baltic people who came to Australia as political refugees in the 1940s and 1950s. Since my election to Parliament I have had the opportunity to attend, in my own right and as the representative of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), a number of Baltic functions in Adelaide-anniversaries of the declaration of the respective republics, concerts, sporting events and so on. The enthusiasm with which these people seek to maintain their culture and adhere fervently to their aspirations of independence never fail to impress and move me. </PARA>
<PARA> In June and July this year I spent 10 days in the Soviet Union as part of an Australian Labor Party delegation to that nation. We had talks with many people at all levels of the Soviet Government and the Communist Party and we were impressed, or perhaps I should say surprised, by the frank and honest manner in which our hosts discussed the current situation in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the progress of glasnost and perestroika. There was frank admission of past mistakes, of present difficulties and of hopes and fears for the future. The question of the nationalities arose frequently and was linked frequently to the Congress of Peoples Deputies in which all Soviet ethnic groups, including the Baltic peoples, have a new-found voice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet leadership, aware that it has handled certain national uprisings in the past with too heavy a hand, has permitted an unprecedented freedom of debate on the question of the independence of various national groups. There is no doubt, too, that the Soviet Union is in the process of rewriting history; rewriting it with an eye to the truth rather than to dogma, and this is admitted quite freely. In May or June this year the standard examination in history which is compulsory for all graduating secondary students in the Soviet Union was abruptly cancelled due to a state of complete confusion amongst students and teachers. What was right-the official history that they had learned during the Brezhnev years or the radically revised history they were seeing daily on television and in magazines and newspapers which turned previously accepted facts on their heads, and where the goodies had suddenly become baddies, and the baddies goodies? Over the northern summer the school history books are being rewritten. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to follow developments in the reappraisal of the history of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 which the honourable member for Menzies has made reference to, whereby under Nazi-Soviet agreement the three Baltic republics eventually were annexed to the Soviet Union. In June this year President Gorbachev, in response to allegations by Baltic deputies, that Moscow had falsified history in its account of these events of 1939, agreed that a commission should be set up to establish whether Moscow forcibly annexed the Baltic republics in accordance with that pact. As far as I know, the final findings of that commission have not been made public, but there appears to be some reluctance among Soviet historians to adopt the Baltic line. One historian on the commission, Mr Mikhail Semryaga, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The secret protocols said the Balts were in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. But what does that mean? It does not mean they were obliged to become part of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> However, another historian, Mr Alexander Chubarin, has rather cautiously, I must say, put another colour on it. He said that historians were reconsidering the standard view-that is, the standard Soviet view-that the Balts viewed their entrance to the Soviet Union `with euphoria'. But there is no doubt about the Baltic view of these events. Last week the Lithuanian Parliament declared that Moscow's annexation of the republic in 1940 was invalid and this was the first official challenge to the legitimacy of Soviet rule in Lithuania or in any of the Baltic republics. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that there is general unity of purpose amongst the Baltic peoples. This was demonstrated last week by the human chain of 600,000 or so people which stretched across the three republics as a manifestation of their desire for independence. There is, however, some division of how independence should be achieved and especially whether there should be total secession from the Soviet Union. There are also a plethora of nationalist and internationalist groups within the republics with differing agendas. There is disagreement on the wisdom of complete autonomy and doubts about the economic viability of each of the states going it alone while, in Western Europe, much larger and more developed and more sophisticated economies find that it is in their best interests to band together in a common market or an economic community. However, there is overwhelming agreement that the outcome, whatever it is, must be on Baltic terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I have great sympathy for the aspirations to self-determination of the Baltic people. Also, largely as a result of my visit there, I have great hopes for the future of the Soviet Union as a whole and for the future of the globe now that one of its major players is undergoing unprecedented economic and political upheaval for the better. I do not know to what extent the effects of Baltic and other nationalist independence movements will threaten or jeopardise the success of the reforms being undertaken in the Soviet Union, and thereby threaten its own move towards freedom, democracy and economic viability. I would like to think that the two trends are compatible. In connection with this, I conclude by quoting a British journalist, John Lloyd, who wrote the following article in New Statesman and Society of 25 November last year:</PARA>
<PARA> We in Britain are familiar enough, or should be, with the depth and force of nationalist and religious feelings: we have observed it, a few have participated in it, in Northern Ireland for some 20 years. Most of us have, or should have, weaned ourselves off the belief that there is a simple `solution', or that the nature of the problem resides in a one-dimensional model of repression which, once removed, would result in a relatively swift rectification of the dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union now faces problems much more diverse, and probably more explosive, than those of Northern Ireland. It is impossible not to feel for the liberated consciousnesses of the republican movements (especially, of course, when they are `Euro-friendly', as in the Baltic). </PARA>
<PARA> But we cannot have it both ways. We may want to see a greater degree of devolution from Moscow and more autonomy for the republics. But if we want Gorbachev to succeed in his stated aims, we cannot at the same time want what the real nationalists want-independence for their states-since no general secretary could withstand the loss of parts of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>There is the dilemma. But the fact remains that this motion supports the independence of the Baltic republics, and I have great pleasure in seconding the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second occasion on which I have had the opportunity to be associated with a proposed resolution to be passed by this Parliament, unanimously, I hope, which puts a bipartisan approach. It puts before the Parliament a view that the Government and the Opposition can both accept. I make that point very strongly because I think that, while there is this bipartisan approach, there are elements of view which we in the Opposition hold which the Government has not been prepared to accept. I will come to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very gratifying for those of us who have supported the Baltic cause over a long period that the Government has come to this view. I was in the Parliament at the time when the former Whitlam Government gave de jure recognition to the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union. It was a matter of great consternation, particularly amongst the Baltic communities, that the Whitlam Government took that view. They welcomed, of course, what I think was the Fraser Government's first act after its election in 1975, to reverse that decision of the Whitlam Government. So we have come a long way from that decision of the Whitlam Government. The Hawke Government has willingly and fulsomely supported the Baltic resolution that was previously passed by this House, and the motion that is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) made clear, the motion that we are considering is not the one that he first proposed, which can be found on the Notice Paper as Notice No. 9. A careful reading of it will reveal two significant changes. The honourable member's original motion called for the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to accede to the widely expressed wishes of the Baltic people for justice, independence and self-determination. But it also, in seeking renunciation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and its consequences, sought the restoration of full unfettered self-determination for the Baltic peoples. What we find is that in the motion that we are supporting, of course, in terms of calling for action we are now asking the Government not to ask the Soviet Union to give that unfettered self-determination for the Baltic people. We have simply noted it as one of the objectives in the preamble, but not in terms of action that we are seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of the motion that is different is the statement in paragraph 2 which welcomes the many positive reforms that have recently been initiated in the USSR under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and the improvements that these have brought about to the Baltic peoples. I have no problem in acknowledging that there has been significant change wrought under Gorbachev. I have had the opportunity, like the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey), who spoke before me, to visit the Soviet Union. I visited under the auspices of a parliamentary delegation, the delegation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and I had the opportunity of visiting Lithuania in particular, and there I was able to take up a number of human rights cases involving Lithuanians who had been persecuted for their desire to pursue genuine freedom of expression and view for people in the Baltic States. I had the opportunity of seeing the quest, I think which was visibly supported within the Communist Party as well as amongst people generally, for independence, not only on economic matters but broadly within the framework of the Soviet Union. The members of that parliamentary delegation when they returned to Australia were very encouraged and said `We are cautiously optimistic that the changes that are occurring in the Soviet Union will be significant and long term'. </PARA>
<PARA> But the reality is another matter and it is not reflected in the motion that we have compromised on. I am alarmed-I make this point very strongly-at what has been happening in the last few days. In the Australian of this week I found the fullest report of the warning by the Soviet leadership, put in its strongest terms, to the three Baltic republics demanding autonomy, and the Kremlin, it quotes, says that it is being `pushed to the abyss' by the nationalists. I just read the article:</PARA>
<PARA> ``The situation in the Baltic republics (Estonia; Latvia and Lithuania) is a cause of growing worry,'' the Central Committee of the Communist Party said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``These developments affect the vital interests of all the Soviet people, of all of our socialist country. The republics face the threat of a veritable civil conflict, of mass confrontation in the streets. </PARA>
<PARA> ``A serious danger is threatening the people of the Baltic Republics. They must be made aware of the abyss toward which nationalist leaders are pushing them.''</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say that what was happening there was:</PARA>
<PARA>Directly linked with the separatist line that has been pursued in the past months with growing persistence and aggressiveness by certain forces in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Central Committee called for ``urgent measures to cleanse the perestroika process (initiated by President Gorbachev) in these republics of extremism and destructive and harmful tendencies''. </PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA>`Nationalist extremist groups have taken advantage of democracy and openness, and have gradually begun to introduce an unhealthy aspect into the development of events'' the committee said. </PARA>
<PARA> ``The anti-socialist and anti-Soviet nature of their projects became evident very soon. Organisations resembling political formations of the bourgeois period and the time of Nazi occupation sprang up. </PARA>
<PARA> `Intimidation, deception, disinformation and even moral terror and defamation of all who disagreed became routine'. </PARA>
<PARA>These matters are of grave concern to me and I believe that they would be of concern to all members of parliament. We are being told that, notwithstanding the terms of this motion in which we welcome the positive reforms initiated in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, under Gorbachev we are seeing that freedom has limits. I think that we, as members of parliament, concerned about the plight of the Baltic people, need to keep this point very much in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the motion so that we can have a bipartisan view-I hope it will be passed today-but we ought to be very conscious of the changes, not only those identified by the honourable member for Hawker but also those we have seen in the last few days in the attitude that the Soviet Union is exhibiting on this very important question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) that we on this side of the House are concerned about the remarks to which he has drawn the attention of the House. Indeed, it is not our intention to bury those sorts of remarks, and I hope that that is not what the honourable member for Dundas was trying to refer to, as they are not in the motion. As has been stated, on 23 August, the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the secret protocol known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, was celebrated, so to speak. The pact saw incorporated the independent Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia into the Soviet Union. The first part of the motion before the House takes note of that and the fact that the pact was signed under the leadership of Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler on 23 August 1939. It should also be noted that the motion reaffirms Australia's longstanding affinity with the aspirations of the Baltic people and endorses their continuing quest for self-determination and preservation of their culture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been pointed out during the debate, the three states in question are quite separate. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey) pointed out quite succinctly that they differ not only in culture and history but also in language and religious matters. They have had a sorry history in the last 50 years, although I do not have time to go into that this morning. We on this side of the House-the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) has also pointed this out-are encouraged by recent events and we hope that they continue. Of particular encouragement were the recent Soviet press reports foreshadowing official Soviet recognition for the first time of the existence of the secret protocol, and we trust that, in the very near future, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is publicly denounced by the Soviet leadership. Similarly, we saw the Soviet parliamentary endorsement in July of the fundamental principles behind the draft legislation according a significant measure of economic independence to Estonia and Latvia, which would result in those republics being able to control the use and management of local resources. As I have already stated, I and everyone on this side of the House are concerned at the remarks emanating from certain sections of the Soviet Communist Party in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just digress for a minute. I have just come back from a trip of in excess of three weeks in eastern Europe. I spent time in Yugoslavia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia and had numerous discussions on the situation in Poland, the Ukraine and the Baltic states. There is a thread of commonality going right through all these nations and significant changes are taking place, although at a different pace from country to country. Notwithstanding the concerns of the last couple of days, I think we all have to understand that the pace of change will have to be `steady as she goes', as long as it keeps progressing in all the states. Finally, we on this side fully support the motion before the House and I hope that there is unanimous support for it when it is put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) accepts responsibility for its contribution to development of the existing social milieu within the Australian Public Service (APS) which has been variously described in Public Service Commission reports as ``toxic, fear-based, pathological, repressive, reactive, paternalistic and neurotic'' to the extent that some APS departments are seen as presenting the same manic depressive mental disorder symptoms which individuals present;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) acknowledges that the manner in which Parliament seeks to maintain principles of fairness, impartiality, probity and public accountability is too often characterised by the use of its powers to seek punishment of those who are seen to have made mistakes, regardless of any consideration of risks involved, rather than to acknowledge and reward success;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) notes that this hyper-critical approach is at variance with contemporary personnel management practices; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) acknowledges the serious efforts currently being made to implement improved management practices in the public sector and resolves to follow that lead by hencewith adopting a co-operative and constructive approach to its management of the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a growing air of expectation and uncertainty in the Australian Public Service today. Government policy initiatives in the area of public sector reforms are finally being taken seriously. Expectations are high as the winds of change gather momentum. Consequently, those public sector managers who are yet to sense the direction of the winds of change are feeling uneasy. Some years ago the Hawke Government introduced a policy of progressive budget cuts for Commonwealth departments, in line with its general macro-economic strategies. At the same time the Government made moves towards program budgeting concepts and indicated its intention that departments were expected to respond to this new found freedom by implementing substantial efficiency reforms and by precise targeting of Commonwealth expenditures to the areas most in need. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early stages of these reforms the means by which these objectives were to be achieved were left up to departments themselves. Many responded in kind to the budget cuts by simply projecting them uniformly across all departmental activities. In line with the old principles of equity, every division, branch and section suffered equally. To some extent this move could be likened to the corporate paranoid response characteristic of large organisations faced with unwelcome prospects of change. Instead of more of the same, as there had been in the past, there would now be progressively less of the same-but it would be the same, nonetheless. This response was hardly surprising from a Public Service that has been variously described as toxic, fear-based, pathological, repressive, reactive, paternalistic and neurotic, to the extent that some departments are seen as presenting manic depressive mental disorder symptoms. That strong language is not my language; it is language appearing in various reports commissioned by the Public Service Commission and the occasional papers that are produced as a result of that process. </PARA>
<PARA> Just why the Australian Public Service is like that is a consequence of historical development throughout a lengthy period where due process carried far more weight than outcomes. Certainly, the Federal Parliament has contributed to the development of the jackboot, head-kicking management style that is still commonplace in the public sector. Too often the manner in which Parliament seeks to maintain principles of fairness, impartiality, probity and public accountability is characterised by the use of its powers to seek punishment of those who are seen to have made mistakes, regardless of any consideration of risks involved and at the expense of acknowledging and rewarding success. Any poor soul who has had the dubious privilege of facing the sharp end of a parliamentary committee of inquiry would readily agree with those sentiments. In the adversarial environment of the parliamentary chambers the concept of ministerial responsibility is occasionally abused in the same vein. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not entirely surprising, given that fault in public servants, through the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, is sheeted home on their ministerial supervisors. So if it is possible for a parliamentarian to expose some area of fault in the Public Service, inevitably the clamour comes up for the Minister to resign. The process is accordingly dominated by the exercise of seeking fault rather than seeking out those opportunities to reward properly with praise initiatives which are successful. One of the prominent writers on Public Service management methodology, John Baker, in his booklet entitled Some Private Sector Models for New Directions in Public Sector Human Management, has noted this conundrum. I think in some of his writing he has observed that, to give an example, a public servant may succeed in eight tasks yet fail once. The score should be plus six, but in fact the one failure only is remembered, so he has a score of minus one. So it is rational, in a cynical sense, to do nothing, to take no risk because the worst he or she can get is a score of zero; he or she will not be recorded as having made an error. </PARA>
<PARA> With the prospect of greater public awareness through live media coverage of parliamentary inquiries and processes, it may be that some fundamental reforms to parliamentary processes will herald the final stages of public sector management changes. This is unlikely to happen, however, until a suitable alternative forum for the selection of ministerial material is developed. Meanwhile the executive arm of the present Government has managed to put some fairly impressive runs on the board in terms of dealing with the more intractable problems facing the nation. Along the way the Hawke Ministry has developed a sense of common purpose and, for the time being, mutual trust with the Public Service. It might be argued that Ministers have a ready opportunity to do this because they can easily control large areas of Commonwealth expenditure directed towards a common client base for both government and the Public Service. In these areas the Public Service is not directly threatened and is thus more likely to respond positively to requests for new policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> There is perhaps some evidence that this success will now feed its way through the administrative reform of the Public Service itself. Nevertheless, it must be accepted that the nature of the reforms expected of the public sector are quite unlike anything to be faced by the public sector manager. In the private sector the name of the game is generally increased market share, profit and the like. The dismal science of economics tells us that this type of activity fits well with basic human nature. People can be expected to do this sort of thing without any special training. In the private sector one can also resort to the fairly basic technique of offering more money to attract needed resources. In the contracting public sector environment the name of the game is, however, quite the opposite. Public servants are essentially being asked to be more creative, innovative, entrepreneurial and to work harder towards the ultimate objective of doing themselves out of a job. In many cases they are also obliged to accept lower salaries than their private sector counterparts for this privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> The dilemma faced by public sector managers has been to find some mechanism to encourage staff to respond to the invitation of self-destruct in a positive way. It is not surprising that the Australian Public Service has taken some little time to deal with the problem but a solution does seem to be beginning to evolve. </PARA>
<PARA> At the heart of the new-found strategy is the growing realisation that public servants are in most respects fairly normal human beings. That is not a sentiment that is likely to find much favour with the Australian public at large. For reasons of personal safety it is also not the sort of proposition that one might put with any conviction at the local watering hole on a Friday night. Nevertheless, if one is prepared to be open-minded enough to accept the possibility that there might be a grain of truth to this proposition, then the prospect of radical change could well arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Numerous psychological studies have shown that normal people like to do a good job and they especially like to be told they are doing a good job. Eighty-five per cent of all people believe that they are of above average ability. Normal people tend to perform better when they are praised and respond positively to people who praise them. This is true even when they are on the receiving end knowing full well that the praise is false. Criticism, on the other hand, has the opposite effect. Good people managers know this and use it to their advantage. Effective managers also know that most believe that they are of above average ability in most things. This may sound absurd but it is true that people believe it about themselves. It is also true that enlightening people to the basic absurdity of these widely held beliefs is not something that is likely to persuade them. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing all this in mind, the new program budgeting regime of accounting provides opportunities to identify parts of a public sector operation that, in some senses, can be seen as potentially profit making or at the very least capable of self-funding. Activities that are less amenable to this type of analysis can also be lumped into the general category of a statutory responsibility and therefore exempted from further considerations of efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past a high proportion of the extensive managerial talent to be found in the Public Service has been directed towards competing for basic resources such as pens, paper, chairs, desks and the like. By linking the notional profit elements of favoured parts of departmental operations back to allocated mechanisms for these highly prized items one can introduce an effective reward system. It does not matter that the items dispensed have little more intrinsic value than a gold star or a rubber stamp on the hand, but it does matter a great deal when some people have ready-made opportunities to amass more prizes than others. </PARA>
<PARA> By using these simple techniques the effective manager can acknowledge and reward the achievements of people and in so doing encourage them to do whatever it is that they are doing well. In this way the prediction of profit potential tends to become self-fulfilling. Those people who are unwilling or unable to adapt to the new regime will tend to fall victim to the various retirement and retrenchment options available, and therefore take themselves out of the game. The more far-sighted of the successful people might then seek to market these newly recognised skills in the private sector, but that is of course a process of interchange between public and private sectors which is in the process of being developed. </PARA>
<PARA> The main difficulty with this inevitable result is that the process of change does not seem to require any objective assessment of overall economic efficiency in the final outcome. It may be that the resource reallocation mechanism guarantees greater efficiency in some way that is not obvious to myself. Still, there remain plenty of people who are less than convinced by the efficiency arguments, but so long as the marketing approach to management change continues to command public acceptance people will embrace it; so there is not a great deal of point in further resistance. Dare one suggest, however, that faced with the twin barrels of existential irrelevancy the notion of public service might grow to flourish well beyond its present limited domain. No doubt the money or the gun approach of the economic rationalists will decide the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I have noted some of the developments in Public Service management and pointed to concerns that I have in terms of the way in which the managerial environment in the Public Service has been unresponsive to social conditions and has bred a pathological and fear-based managerial style. I think Parliament does have a responsibility to make sure that it does not contribute towards poor performance in the public sector. I think we all have our own examples of instances where Parliament has gone past what is proper in terms of examining the conduct of Public Service departments. I think of the shameful pursuit in the Senate of officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs last year as just one such example-an example that could only be seen as an attempt to hunt down those who were being painted as guilty before any offences against them were demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a plea for the Parliament to avoid its responsibility in scrutinising and inspecting the Public Service nor to resile from its responsibility to criticise wrongdoing. But it is a plea for the Parliament to balance that responsibility with an awareness that the Public Service is made up of ordinary human beings, people who do respond to praise as well as criticism. It is not enough simply to engage in the negative processes of attack; it is also very important to recognise success and to reward it. We must, obviously, get away from the situation where many tasks being achieved successfully are disregarded and one task being performed poorly is regarded as the measure of the public servant without being weighed against the many successes. Ultimately, people are the primary asset of any organisation, and people are the primary asset of government. A people-centred approach is not a soft approach, not an altruistic approach, but is an approach based on a hard-nosed economic principle that we will only succeed by developing good management techniques applied with good sense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is a classic example of attitudes which are fundamentally undermining the accountability of government in Australia today. It presents us with bizarre propositions which are themselves contradictory and demonstrates the dangers of the approach to the public sector which has been pursued by the Australian Labor Party in office. I intend to demonstrate that it is this Government's abdication of responsibility and the effective abandonment of the time-honoured practice of ministerial responsibility which has made public servants the subject of political focus. More disturbingly, underlying this motion is the idea that somehow the Parliament and taxpayers of Australia exist solely to provide a living for the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In presenting this motion the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) displays a complete misunderstanding of the role of government in civil society and the role of democratic institutions as a check on the power exercised through the Public Service. To the extent that this motion calls for closer identification between the interests of public servants and this Parliament, it has ominous Orwellian overtones. The mover's desire that government employees should be one big happy and cooperative family under the constructive supervision of the big brother Parliament is reminiscent of the memorable canteen scenes in the film version of 1984. This is consistent with his collective motion that a government department can have the symptoms of a manic depressive, as expressed by the honourable member in his notice of motion. One of the greatest dangers is that civil servants become so happy with the activities of one government in office that they will use their positions to try to ensure that that government remains in power. With a growing list of failures of this Government it is essential for the well-being of our country that that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Public Service cannot be considered without also deliberating on the role of government. Whilst it is undoubtedly true that government employees perform many vital functions in Australia today, it is not self-evident that all of these functions should be performed under the auspices of government. To suggest that many functions undertaken by the public sector could be better performed by private individuals and firms is not to attack the public sector but to defend the ability, enterprise, independence and other qualities of which most Australians are capable. The public sector comes into disrepute when it interferes in the lives and businesses of Australians. When government steps beyond the limits of that narrow consensus about what governments should do it condemns those whom it employs to act on its behalf to the enmity and distrust of many other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate truth is that, generally speaking, the Public Service is not highly regarded by many people in the community. It does, however, rate above politicians. People base their judgment of the Public Service on their experience with public servants as they perform their duties or on the anecdotal evidence of others who interact with the Public Service. This is not an indictment of those individuals who happen to work for the Commonwealth but of those governments which have asked them to perform tasks which are neither desired nor needed to further the interests of individual Australians. These problems are not helped by the burden of taxation which this Government, in particular, imposed on taxpayers who rightly feel that they have paid with their own effort for what salary and prosperity is enjoyed by public employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Success in the public sector is almost impossible to judge or measure, but I think that in the minds of most Australians the most successful Public Service is a nearly invisible one which neither touches their lives nor their pockets more than is absolutely necessary. Rewards for public employees are seen as a cost or punishment for taxpayers. To the extent that this Parliament, the members in it, and the decisions we make, are not respected by the people who pay for government through taxation, the people who administer those decisions will not be respected. That respect has been gravely undermined by the Labor Party in government. Desperate for power, Labor has seen the Public Service as its tool for achieving that end and rewarding those who have helped it along the way. It is true that individual public servants should not, in the normal course of events, be the subject of criticism in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Westminster system of ministerial government is designed so that the person who is ultimately responsible for a government department is a member of the Parliament. It is the role of that Minister not to protect but to take responsibility for the action of those public servants who are part of the department which he or she oversees. The legitimacy of all that this Parliament does rests on the principle that Ministers of the Crown administer the decisions of the Parliament and, in turn, are accountable to it-the Parliament. This Government, under its Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), has gravely undermined the practice of ministerial responsibility. It has used the system of portfolio and junior Ministers to ensure that neither takes responsibility for either their own actions or those of their departments, while avoiding scrutiny of their actions through the forums of parliament. If, as the honourable member for Denison seems to suggest in his motion, the Parliament seeks to use its powers to discipline public employees-I reject any such notion-then it can only be because the responsible Minister has evaded his or her responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Public employees are, in the first instance, responsible to their Minister. The procedure of Senate Estimates committees, to which the honourable member for Denison referred, allows the Parliament to scrutinise the performance and statements of the Government and its Ministers, rather than the performance of individual public servants. Unfortunately, under the present Government public servants are more likely to be rewarded for protecting from scrutiny the failings of their Minister than for performing their duties in the interests of the country. I remind the House that Mr Charles Perkins served as the fall guy for two failed Ministers who refused to accept responsibility for the manifest failings in the management of Aboriginal affairs. He was not a victim of parliamentary scrutiny but of a desire to hide mistakes by the Government. When it is convenient Hawke Government Ministers have been all too willing to hide behind senior public officials and departmental advice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Statistician was forced to take a major public role in defending the Government's failure to table the notorious household expenditure survey because the Treasurer (Mr Keating) thought that such a requirement was beneath him. The Commissioner of Taxation has become the public advocate of the Government's approach to the collection of taxation, again taking on a role that the Minister avoids. In doing so the Commissioner has brought his own office into disrepute. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has blamed and hidden behind anyone who crossed his path to avoid responsibility for the Medicare muddle. The Prime Minister, more than any of his colleagues, has become a master at evading responsibility for everything which goes wrong and claiming credit for the slightest success. This is in commendable but stark contrast to the performances of Senator Walsh and Senator Button who have both been remarkably candid in admitting mistakes and failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Many commentators have been critical of politicising the Public Service and public agencies, particularly under State and Federal Labor governments. Similarly, there is an extensive literature which talks about a new class of those who are wholly dependent on the public purse for their livelihood, status and success. The Labor Party in government has compounded this by seeking to merge its political interests with the personal interests of many who work in the public sector. By offering the promise of more power through new programs, more staff, greater autonomy and more money, Labor has rewarded public sector employees for doing its bidding rather than being impartial administrators according to the rule of law. Through the appointment of political candidates to public office, the scrutiny of the actions of those office-holders has become essential. </PARA>
<PARA> A classic example of the need for parliamentary scrutiny of politicised public office has been the destruction of accountability by the Western Australian Labor Government. In a damning report, the Burt commission found that some government agencies had become so distant from those to whom they should be responsible that they refused to answer questions put to them by the commission. Two former senior government employees who had close ties with the Labor Party have been charged in connection with `Western Australia Inc.' deals. On too many occasions government agencies seem to have become the vehicles for the support of private interests and the political interests of the Labor Party. Only the most rigorous parliamentary and public scrutiny can provide some protection from this so-called cooperative and constructive approach to blurring the distinction between the Executive, the legislature, the Public Service, political parties and private interests, which has become known as a corporatist form of government. The Western Australian Labor Government has, by its actions, put a slur on all government employees and fundamentally undermined confidence in the impartiality of the public sector in that State. I might add that many of the same criticisms could be levelled at past governments in New South Wales and Victoria, under Labor, as well as in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> It is highly desirable that the principles of fairness, impartiality, probity and public accountability are restored as an integral part of the Public Service, to be rewarded with the respect that such high standards deserve. Instead, Labor Ministers have abdicated responsibility, encouraging public servants to become involved in political debate. They have played favourites with those in the Public Service seen as allies. They want all power but no responsibility. They have moved towards the formation of their own nomenclature for the privileged who benefit wonderfully from the party in power at the expense of those who are excluded. Those are the real reasons why some are not happy in the Public Service and many are not happy with the Public Service. The honourable member for Denison suggested in his motion that the fundamentals on which our democracy is based are out of touch with contemporary personnel management practices. If that is the case, it should not be democracy which is compromised. I urge rejection of the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to speak on the matter of private business and I compliment the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) on proposing it. There has been much debate in this country over the future of the public sector, particularly its ongoing role in the economic process. The debate has centred on the notion of privatisation of government business entities such as Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd, the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom Australia and Australia Post. One approach has been to assume, as an almost self-evident statement, that the private sector is inherently more efficient in the delivery of services and the production of goods than the Public Service. I hold to no such notion. However, I do acknowledge the relevance of this debate and the need to ensure that both the public and private sectors in Australia lift their game if our nation is to overcome the economic challenges and provide all Australians with an increasing standard of living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the Government has not adopted wholesale privatisation, it is fair to recognise the move to corporatisation not only of business entities but also of the broader Public Service. Responsibility for the efficient operation of individual government departments has devolved principally to the management of each department. Gone is the Public Service Board and the centralised control of the day to day operations which the Board symbolised. In its place has come departmental corporate plans, mission statements, objectives and goals. In this way the public sector has mirrored the developments in the private sector which have followed some clearly identifiable trends. These trends include a focus on cost cutting and efficiency; lots of mergers and reorganisation of activity; and new attitudes and emphasis within organisations on how to manage and use people effectively. While the Australian Public Service is familiar with the first two of those trends, I do not believe that the third one has been so evident. All three trends represent quite radical changes for individual employees. However, better management of human resources is probably the only one of the three which offers advantages to individual employees, rather than the corporation or department involved. </PARA>
<PARA> As members of parliament, it is far too easy to rest blame with the Public Service and individual public servants. It is part of the Australian ethos to downgrade public servants as lazy `shiny pants' who have permanently full in-trays and equally empty out-trays. Most members of parliament would have had little detailed contact with the Public Service prior to their election. What contact there was would have been mostly on a business or professional level or, as with most Australians, as a consumer of one or more government services. It is all too easy for parliamentarians to blame public servants for unpopular decisions and to be hyporcritical when the local office of the Department of Social Security gets it wrong and a pensioner or beneficiary does not quite get the service that he or she wants. The position of the public servant is put rather well by a short poem which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It's not my place to run the train</PARA>
<PARA> The whistle I can't blow</PARA>
<PARA> It's not my place to say how far</PARA>
<PARA> The train's allowed to go</PARA>
<PARA> It's not my place to shoot off steam</PARA>
<PARA> Nor even clang the bell</PARA>
<PARA> But let the damned thing jump the track</PARA>
<PARA> And see who catches Hell!</PARA>
<PARA>That is the position for public servants. They do not determine what the Government does. They do not change, say, the operation of the assets test as it affects pensioners, but they must administer the changes. If they get it wrong even once their local member of parliament or the Commonwealth Ombudsman-any number of mechanisms are available-makes sure they know that they have got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Denison pointed out, very little time and effort is given to rewarding people who get it right. I suppose it is the nature of our system to concentrate almost solely on mistakes and to point out where things have gone wrong. However, it is equally important to point out to people who do get it right, by administering things properly and efficiently and adopting a caring attitude towards members of the public, that they have done so. There are more public servants who are dedicated to their job, willing to spend time explaining things to people to make sure that an often confused individual actually understands where he stands than there are those who are offhanded and officious in their attitude. However, it is the public servant of whom a constituent is critical that we as members of parliament hear about. We only hear complaints; we rarely hear praise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted that the Public Service needs to operate more efficiently and has placed very definite goals for the Public Service to reach. That is a sensible and proper thing for the Government to do. However, a number of the new management practices which have followed other trends in the private sector have been a bit slower to come through the Public Service. Considering the cost involved, it makes very good sense to have a more efficient work force. Currently the wages bill for the Commonwealth Public Service is some $4.7 billion. A productivity gain of just one per cent would therefore result in a saving of some $47m. Mr John Baker, in his paper Some Private Sector Models for New Directions in Public Sector Human Management, identified some 18 practices which could be examined as providing gains for individual Public Service Departments. Some of the proposals are, in my opinion, very worthwhile and should be pursued. For instance, he identifies the need to move away from great volumes of personnel manuals and replace them with general policy objectives. The matters raised by the honourable member for Denison are worthwhile and I believe that the House is right to debate them. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House urges Australian business to address the implications for itself and the Australian economy in general of European economic integration post 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the problems for Australia is that it is an island fairly isolated from the mainstream of the international community, and the difficulty with being isolated in that way is that sometimes the great debates of the international community come to us rather late in the day. Sometimes we are not really as aware of those great debates as perhaps we ought to be, particularly in the context of our own long term prosperity. When one goes to Europe these days, east or west, there is no doubt that enormous changes are taking place. The changes in east Europe are very exciting and very encouraging and one looks forward to the day when east Europe will achieve not just greater economic prosperity but a much greater degree of political freedom and pluralism. </PARA>
<PARA> When one goes to west Europe what strikes one there is the way the European Community is developing with such pace and with such effectiveness. The proposition that after the end of 1992 Europe will become a single economic market is really one of the most important changes that have taken place in west Europe since 1958, when the European Community was formally established. The European Community is really exceeding the expectations of many of the more sceptical observers of the evolution of the so-called European dream. I have always been rather sceptical about where the European Community would ultimately lead; I am happy to admit that. I do not think, and I think many people in Europe would agree with this, that we will see a united states of Europe in the next few years or perhaps in the next 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> What is interesting in Europe is the enormous commitment there is now to doing more and more things on a European scale where doing them on that European scale brings very obvious benefits. There is enthusiastic support in Europe now for the European monetary system and some criticism of Britain for not joining that system. As a result of the Madrid European summit recently, there is now a commitment from Britain eventually to join the European monetary system. There is now talk in Europe of achieving economic and monetary union in the next few years, of having a single European currency, of having perhaps one central bank for all 12 countries of the European Community rather than 12 separate central banks, and of some harmonisation of taxation policies within certain margins right around the European Community. Then there has been the evolution of the European Parliament as a democratic institution. As some time has gone on, particularly since the first direct elections to the European Parliament, which were in 1979, that Parliament has gained increasing power and increasing relevance as an institution of the European Community and as a political institution of the whole of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The real revolution in Western Europe, without doubt, is the so-called single European act, the absolute commitment towards what is little less than an economic revolution in that part of the world post-1992. Already, companies and governments within the European Community are taking action, and taking action very rapidly, to prepare themselves for this single post-1992 European market. Those who are a bit sceptical about the effects of this European market post-1992 should take a bit of time to read the Cechini report, produced last year, which contrasts the effect of continuing to have 12 separate markets within the European Community with the benefits that could be reaped, will be reaped, from having that one integrated market: integration in industry; integration in transport; integration in telecom- munications; and integration in business and financial services. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point the Cechini report makes is that the European market, if we could call it that, post-1992 will provide savings for European Community firms of something in the vicinity of $365 billion. That is an enormous saving, brought about by the harmonisation of regulations, the harmonisation of practices and the like, and completely free trade within the bounds of the 12 member states. The Cechini report estimates that the single European act, the post-1992 Europe, will lead to the creation of an additional two to five million jobs and that it will contribute to economic growth within the European Community to the extent of between 5 and 7 per cent per annum. That is an enormous boost to growth within the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious when we look at it why this will happen. The Europeans will gain enormous economies of scale when they are dealing with a market of 320 million people rather than their individual home markets, particularly in the smaller countries such as Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg. Secondly, the greater commitment therefore to competitiveness brought about by this open market will lead to substantial increases in productivity within companies in the European Community and steps are already being taken in Europe to improve that productivity. In turn, that should lead to a greater degree of profitability. The Europeans will also benefit from much greater mobility in both capital and labour. Again, they will benefit from a more efficient allocation of resources than is possible within the confines of 12 separate boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that has really inspired the European Community to do these things in an economic sense-leave politics aside-is the real need for them to be able to compete with the Japanese. Wherever one goes in Europe there is a concern, particularly in the manufacturing area, about their capacity to compete with the Japanese. One only has to look at the European car industry to see how there is almost a paranoia about the effect of imports from Japan, and they have a number of non-tariff barriers in order to stop imports at this stage. They are determined that they are going to be able to compete with the Japanese and they believe that one of the most effective ways they can do that is through the breaking down of the barriers between the 12 members states. I believe that they will succeed in doing that. They will certainly live up to many of the rather glamorous aspirations written out in the Cechini report. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked a little about how exciting these changes are in the European Community. Unlike Mrs Thatcher, I really welcome these changes. As somebody who lived for some years in Europe, I think it is a tremendously exciting thing. But it is enormously relevant also to Australia. We as Australians have increasingly to look at ourselves in a global context and ask: What are the implications of these important global changes for our way of life, for our society and for our economy? The first and most obvious point I would make about the relevance to Australians of Europe post-1992 is that Australia will be competing with a much more competitive European community. That only underlines the absolute urgency in this country of those micro-economic reforms that so many members of this House talk about but so few happen to be implementing; the absolute urgency of making sure that our general taxation structure is one that takes into account the need to compete with other parts of the world; the absolute urgency of ensuring that our industrial relations system changes so that we get rid of outmoded restrictive practices, in particular in areas such as transport and the waterfront and the building industry, in order to make us more competitive to deal with this much more competitive European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> Make no mistake about it. If we in this country do not become substantially more competitive very quickly we will be drowned economically not only by the Japanese but also by the new dynamic European Community. People should be aware of that. In a sense people in Australia should be very concerned about that. It will be harder for Australian firms to sell into the European Community after 1992, not easier, because the Europeans will be much more competitive. It will be harder for Australian firms to gain access to third markets and retain access in third markets because of greater competition which is coming from a much more dynamic Europe. Unless we take seriously these changes in Europe and make ourselves more competitive we will keep falling further and further behind other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and slipping further and further into economic poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make in relation to the European Community post-1992 is that Australian companies need to give a lot more thought than perhaps many of them have done already to establishing a foothold within the European Community. We talk a lot in Australia, understandably, about how so many of us have our ethnic roots in different countries of Europe. We have those contracts with Europe and yet we tend not to take Australian firms and Australian enterprises to Europe-with the possible exception of the United Kingdom, where there has been a certain amount of Australian investment and enterprise. We do not do very much in countries like Italy or Greece, in spite of the fact that so many Australians come originally from those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian firms in a broader sense need to look at establishing a greater foothold in the European Community so that they are able to operate more freely in that market and take advantage of the opening up of that market of 320 million people. We can do it in areas like banking, transport, the provision of financial services and-dare I say it-manufacturing as well. There is no reason why Australian companies cannot set up some manufacturing capability within the European Community in order to facilitate access to those European markets and take advantage of Europe post-1992. </PARA>
<PARA> When one travels around Europe these days it is interesting to see the way in which the Japanese have pursued this strategy-and have been doing so for a number of years. They see the benefits that could come eventually not just to Japanese companies but to the Japanese economy by the way the European Community is developing. It is a central part of Japan's strategy in dealing with Europe and we ought to take a leaf out of its book. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Australian firms need to become much more Euro-conscious. Australian business needs to be much more conscious of changes that are taking place in Europe. We should not just concentrate on competition from Japan and the newly industrialised countries of our own region. If we do not rise to the challenge which is being thrown down to us by a more dynamic European Community then, as I have said, any chance of this country restoring its prosperity or guaranteeing continued prosperity will be blown away by those in other parts of the world who have taken the opportunities of greater competitiveness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In general terms I agree with the context of this motion, although the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) needs to think further about many of his specific comments. There is no doubt that there will be a revolutionary change in Europe as a result of the 1992 changes. Not only Australia but the rest of the world will have to accommodate to those changes. I have had the honour of being elected this year to go to the European Parliament and European institutions. The No. 1 agenda item to be discussed is the changes of 1992 and their impact on other countries, including Australia. I look forward very much to these discussions, to identify not only the benefits for Australia but also what problems we may encounter as a result of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously the concept of a single Europe has evolved tremendously in the last few years, notwithstanding the opposition of some people. It is interesting that the honourable member for Mayo distanced himself from the great leader of the conservatives around the world, Margaret Thatcher, in her continuous and obstinate refusal to accept changes in relation to the development of a single Europe. I wonder whether that is the official policy of the Opposition. What is the position of the Opposition in relation to Margaret Thatcher's actions? It is probably the usual position of the Opposition, with half a dozen different positions in relation to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of a single currency is a very important matter. If Mrs Thatcher continues to oppose a single currency we will get a kind of reactionary attempt to prevent the concept of a single economy from actually taking place. I agree with the comments of Francois Mitterand in relation to the British on this point. The British have to decide whether they want to be part of a single Europe or not. They have gone down the road about 80 per cent but they keep pulling back and saying, `We don't know whether we want the next step', and they want to run away. The British Government has to make a decision as to whether it will cooperate in relation to the single European concept in terms of the economy and the evolution of other things. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo mentioned that he does not expect to see a united states of Europe for a hundred years. I think he is wrong. I expect that there will be a united states of Europe much sooner than that. Already political integration is moving apace as a result of the economic dynamism of the 1992 reforms. One of the most surprising things to arise when one studies this is the power of the European Parliament and the European Commission. The Parliament is a lot more powerful than people recognise in determining the overall policy and structure that governs what ultimately is one of the most significant aspects of life, namely, economic life. I think we will see increasingly that more and more significance will be given to the European Parliament and European Commission as a result of the economic changes. We will see greater pressure for integration. Of course there are cultural differences in Europe which will create some problems but perhaps people there could learn from Australia and adopt a--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Multicultural policy. This is a serious comment. Multicultural policy in Europe will help to achieve greater cohesion and overcome some problems. There will be problems in terms of European countries coming together. I believe that one of the main problems will be to achieve things like a common policy on taxation. As honourable members know, although every country has a value added tax, there are completely different levels at which that tax is imposed on different goods and services. The process of negotiation will be difficult because it will impact differently on the income of the different countries of Europe, depending on the level of tax which they impose and on the commodities on which they impose it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The breakdown of barriers, and the free flow of capital, goods and people will mean, for example, that people can go from Britain to Greece, work there completely unfettered, pay tax and behave as if they were citizens of Greece in most respects. Obviously that situation will have a very dramatic impact. There will be great movements of people towards centres which have greater employment and opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to look at the impact on Australia. I was surprised that the honourable member for Mayo did not mention one of the most important aspects of this for Australia, namely, the common agricultural policy. The common agricultural policy is that aspect of European integration which we are not too happy about. It talks about free markets and access and all of those things; about moving towards a greater dependence on a liberal market. The Europeans talk about the single market as a dynamic component of a liberal world economy. True, if one looks at manufacture; but it is not true if one looks at agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Australian point of view-I was surprised that the honourable member for Mayo did not mention this-the concept of the single European market by 1992 unfortunately does not contain within it any suggestion of further liberalisation of access to the agricultural market of Europe. Nor does it contain any suggestion, so far at least, for some change in the common agricultural policy and the subsidisation of farm products. That will be a difficulty for Australia. As the Europeans move to this position in 1992 we should be putting maximum pressure on them by saying, `Philosophically, you are talking about this being an important component of a liberal world economy. We agree with that, but what are you going to do about the agricultural policy and, in particular, the impact of the agricultural policy on other countries?'. This concerns not merely the United States, with whom they are engaged in a war, but other countries such as Australia, who in a sense are innocent victims of the agricultural war between Europe and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo mentioned the importance of Australian companies and Australian individuals taking advantage of the 1992 changes and getting a foothold in Europe in order to participate in that process through an investment window. That is an important point. The honourable member mentioned Greece and Italy. I have been discussing this in relation to Greece and Italy, and indeed Spain and Portugal. We have excellent opportunities, with relatively low wage costs vis a vis Europe, to invest and to use the cultural connection between Australia and Europe. Australians of Italian, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese background, people with cultural connections, can be used if Australian companies are sufficiently intelligent to take up that cultural connection and say, `We have people in Australia who have these backgrounds and who can assist us gain a foothold in those countries of Europe where we can then participate in a huge market of 320 million people'. If we do that it will be very positive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should initiate more activity in this area. We should have more encouragement. Austrade and other economic bodies should encourage people, especially Australian companies, to invest in that segment of Europe and to use the linguistic and cultural resources which we have here in Australia to establish that link. If we do that, and if we do get a foothold in Europe, it will be very important, as the honourable member for Mayo said, in our future relationships with the European Community. I certainly support that. I go further than the honourable member for Mayo and say that through government initiative we need in some way to encourage this process more than we are doing at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo mentioned that Australian industry has to change in order to come to grips with this European phenomenon. True. But the suggestions of the Opposition about Australian industry are laughable. Opposition members talk about micro-economic reform. Of course, when they were in government they did nothing about micro-economic reform whereas this Government is putting into place the first substantial micro-economic reforms in 40 years-the waterfront, in transport and in a whole range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo thought that he could score some political points about micro-economic reform. The fact is that Australian industry will be able to compete with European industries only if we support high technology and efficient systems in Australia in the way the Europeans do. That is the way we should be going. We should be supporting the development of those systems and supporting industrial development in a broad range of areas. We hear nothing from the Opposition about industrial development. In the last Budget we brought down a package of superannuation changes which will directly encourage superannuation firms to invest in Australian industry. It is a very significant package. We hear nothing from the Opposition about those significant changes and what their impact will be on the capital formation in Australia and on the investment capacities of Australian firms both here and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo also mentioned the taxation structure. I do not know what sort of changes he envisages in the taxation structure which we have not already put into place. Dividend imputation for companies was the last revolutionary change in taxation. The conservatives talked about it for many years; we put it into place. It is one of the most important changes in the taxation structure for capital formation and investment. There is no problem in the taxation structure that we are not looking at. The changes that we have already put into place are significant and they will help us develop a competitive economy that will deal with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the central point about the 1992 changes. We do have a problem, in terms of our rural constituency and rural products, with the common agricultural policy. As Europe changes and moves towards 1992 we should be negotiating with European countries and insisting that if they are going to be more liberal and more competitive at the level of industrial goods, they should allow greater access for our primary industry products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the motion put forward by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), with which I wholeheartedly concur, I must say that he has put the case very eloquently for Australian business to become more aware of what post-1992 Europe will be all about. There will obviously be great opportunities but he sounded a very clear warning that Australian business will have to face up to a more competitive market not just in Europe but right around the world. The honourable member for Mayo brought in some very important statistics from the Cechini report, which showed how the European Community will be more efficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the short time available to me I would like to turn back to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). It was rather disappointing to hear an honourable member take so much time with the usual diatribe which we might summarise as bashing the poms, as though they are always at fault. He then spent a fair bit of time trying to defend what is, in many cases, the indefensible lack of action by the present Government when he spoke about some of the present Government's rather pathetic attempts at micro-economic reform. He spoke about the waterfront, for example. As far as I know, all the Government has done is commission more reports than any other government, and arrange more meetings. So far there has been nothing more than meeting after meeting. He also drew a very interesting long bow. He said that industry will somehow be improved because the Government has encouraged superannuation investment. I am not quite sure how the Government intends to tie superannuation investment to industry alone. That was an interesting point. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have to agree with him that we are concerned about the common agricultural policy and it continues to be a problem, and I do not think post-1992 we are going to see any dramatic changes, although I know the Europeans keep telling us that they are moving in the right direction. But I think the overall message is, as the honourable member for Mayo has put it so eloquently, that when the single market does in fact come into place there will be the removal within Europe of physical barriers, of technical barriers and probably, most importantly, fiscal barriers. When this happens it will provide opportunities for Australian companies, particularly, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Mayo, if they take the opportunity of either going into joint ventures with European partners or in fact establishing a foothold, as, of course, the Japanese have done, such as in the car industry. The warning is there as well that with a more efficient Europe, as was pointed out in the Cechini report, then no doubt there will be a more competitive Europe not only within the market but also as European companies continue to trade around the world. The warning is there for Australian business to take up that challenge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in the light of the joint select committee report on video pornography and violence being finalised, the Government should recognise the urgent need to present legislation to stop the importation into Australia of X-rated and excessively violent videos. </PARA>
<PARA>The present classification system in Australia today is divided into five groups: G for general viewing; PG for parental guidance, recommended for under 15-year-olds; M for those over 15 years old; R for over 18-year-olds, and this group includes explicit depictions of violence; and finally X-rated videos, which includes explicit sexual acts. The present situation in Australia today is that all States, whether Liberal governed, Labor governed or National Party governed, have long ago banned the sale of X-rated videos in their respective areas of jurisdiction. However, the sale of such material has been permitted and encouraged in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) while the present Federal Labor Government has had jurisdiction over these matters. This has allowed the bans in all the States to be circumvented because of the vigorous mail order businesses run out of Canberra. I think there are about 13 of them. Regrettably that continues under the Labor self-government rule that administers the ACT today. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Federal Government, if it really wanted to, could still withdraw the support which it is so willingly giving to the pornography industry in Australia and fulfil the wishes of all decent Australians by banning excessively violent and X-rated videos from being imported into Australia. That would not eliminate the industry entirely but would certainly cut it off at the knees and go a long way towards getting rid of this rather sick aberration of our modern-day society. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say at the outset that I would like to see this present industry go, not because I personally disapprove of the material it peddles but because the overwhelming mass of evidence now conclusively shows that it is substantially harmful not only to children as a whole but also to a certain group of adults. I have some sympathy for the argument that adults should be allowed to view in the privacy of their own homes what they want. However, the argument is not as simple as that. There is another argument, an overriding argument which says that these videos are so harmful that their detrimental effects far, far outweigh the libertarian considerations of a person's right to view whatever he or she wants. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone ever doubted the truth of that-and I must confess I was once never totally sure of the balance between the two competing arguments-then an examination of the evidence contained in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material presented to the Parliament last year would put the issue beyond doubt. However, to understand the present situation with videos in Australia it is necessary to retrace a little history. This whole area started to go wrong back in Senator Murphy's day, when he told Customs to lay off pornography and the like and give imports of it a low priority. That situation was eventually granted a formal legality back in 1984 when Senator Gareth Evans outlined the official government guidelines to the Film Censorship Board. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Barriers to the importation of hard core pornography other than child pornography, publications which incite terrorism and publications containing extreme violence and/or sexual violence have been lifted. </PARA>
<PARA>Following that, there was an enormous backlash from this irresponsible decision which led to a Senate select committee being set up to inquire into video material in Australia. This Committee brought down an interim recommendation that a moratorium be placed on the sale and hire of X-rated videos in the ACT. The Federal Labor Government panicked at the existence of this committee which clearly threatened the viability of the pornography industry in Canberra. It refused to do anything with that interim recommendation and replaced the Senate Committee by agreeing to set up a joint select committee of both Houses to inquiry into video material. The Government, in the meantime, laid down guidelines for X-rated videos in April 1984 which read:</PARA>
<PARA>Language: No proscriptions-</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, anything can be said-</PARA>
<PARA>Sex: All explicit depictions of sexual acts involving adults (except those referred to under ``Refused Classification'')-</PARA>
<PARA>that includes the promotion of hard drugs, or bestiality, or sex with children; that would be banned-</PARA>
<PARA>including explicit penetration, masturbation, ejaculation, fellatio, cunnilingus, insertion of objects in orifices; miscellaneous other sexual activities and fetishes, (e.g. urolagnia, necrophilia, coprophilia, sadomaso- chism). </PARA>
<PARA>All that would be allowed. One has only to consider the fetishes there. One could smear oneself with human faeces, dog faeces, eat it, have intercourse with dead bodies and all these other perverted types of behaviour that I do not think should be allowed in Australia today. Fortunately that recommendation was amended a little in December 1984. Explicit violent sexual acts were taken out, which we would all agree with; however, the fetishes bit was left in. That is virtually the situation we operate under in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the evidence presented in the report of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material. Just to show what the Committee was up against, I open up by quoting the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, which gave evidence. That council said not only that X-rated videos should be retained in Australia but that this classification should be expanded. Can you believe it-expanded! Senator Harradine asked the question:</PARA>
<PARA>That means that you would then say that people should be free to read or see material that depicts child pornography, bestiality, terrorism, and misuse of drugs, for example. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Horler, of the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not my wish, but if that is their wish then they should be entitled so to do. </PARA>
<PARA>That is indeed a remarkable attitude on the part of that organisation. I would like, first, to quote some material relating to violence in videos. The Committee took a lot of evidence in this area and it had evidence presented that the viewing of violent material makes a contribution to aggressive behaviour. In fact the 1982 report of the United States National Institute of Mental Health said:</PARA>
<PARA>After 10 more years of research, the consensus amongst most of the research community is that violence on television does lead to aggressive behaviour by children and teenagers who watch the programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be more definite than that. Further American research, presented by Drs Leonard Eron and Rowell Huesmann in a 22-year longitudinal study begun back in 1960 and involving 875 boys and girls and 85 per cent of their parents, with follow-ups in 1970 and 1982, came to the conclusion that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is a significant relation between television viewing at age eight and the seriousness of criminal convictions by the time you are an adult of age thirty. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, their study found that children reared on a heavy diet of television violence had a 150 per cent greater chance of being convicted of a criminal offence by the time they were 30 than children reared with little exposure to television violence. </PARA>
<PARA> In further evidence, Dr Thomas Radecki, the Research Director of the National Coalition on Television Violence, said that 21 out of 22 studies concluded that violent entertainment has a damaging effect on some viewers. He estimated that at least 25 per cent of murders in the United States are `due to the diet of violent entertainment in our country'. He said further:</PARA>
<PARA>In the United States the average adult, by the age of 21, will have watched 10,000 hours of violent entertainment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I read a report which stated that the average viewer views about 45,000 murders or attempted murders by the time he is 21 years old. Dr Radecki continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . children who are becoming brutalised by violent entertainment and who develop anti-social values are indeed more likely to get into drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr William Belson, a prominent researcher on video violence, also appeared as a witness before the Committee. He referred to the results of a very thorough study of 1,565 London boys aged from 13 to 16. He divided them into two groups according to the extent of their exposure to televised violence. The two groups were then matched with a set of 217 variables. It was an incredible study. His findings gave strong support to the hypothesis that long term exposure to televised violence increases the degree to which boys engage in violent behaviour. He said that in his view the effect of exposure to televised violence is-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to `wear down' boys' training or conditioning against being violent, so that they tend to act as if that training had not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Belson also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . long term exposure to television violence increases boys' participation in violent behaviour, increases their preoccupation with violent acts shown on television, makes them more callous in their reactions to the spectacle of violence in the world around them, produces sleep disturbances, reduces respect for authority, makes them feel more willing to use violence to solve their problem . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Example after example has been given by professors and other well-known experts around the world. Another expert, Professor Peter Sheehan, backed up Bandura's social learning theory that people can learn new behaviours. He said that there is a relationship between a child's viewing patterns, which are in turn largely influenced by parental viewing patterns. Another witness, Dr Patricia Edgar, said that if a viewer is inclined to aggression but has an inhibiting factor working against this predisposition, the video breaks it down by making violence appear more normal, and thus more acceptable. Dr Ann Knowles, from the psychology department of the Swinburne Institute of Technology, said that viewing television violence can, in some children, subsequently increase aggressive behaviour. Some non-scientific evidence was also presented to the Committee. I will refer to two witnesses who gave such evidence. Ms Amanda Ann Vallance, a primary school teacher representing the Tasmanian Teachers Federation, gave this example:</PARA>
<PARA>Their-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the boys in her class with access to videos-</PARA>
<PARA>playground behaviour became quite vicious and their games suddenly changed from being boisterous and energetic to being quite obsessed with making knives, swords . . . with which they victimised everyone else in the playground . . . and in particular the girls in my class . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Ms Sonya Ryan, who taught on Tasmania's west coast, noticed a similar phenomenon. She said that some boys, after watching R-rated videos, become obsessed with violence and began to treat the girls just as objects. Evidence was given of two street massacres that had occurred in Australia. With regard to one of the incidents, police were said to have found several violent videos in the killer's room. </PARA>
<PARA> What about pornographic video material? A lot of evidence was given on that subject. Professor James Check, who undertook research for the Fraser Committee on Pornography and Prostitution in Canada, revealed that those who had been exposed to category II non-violent pornography subsequently reported a higher likelihood to rape, and to force unwanted sexual acts on women, than subjects who had not been so exposed. In fact, more than twice as many men indicated at least some likelihood of raping after exposure to non-violent degrading pornography than after no such exposure. What could be more conclusive than that? He said that frequent users of pornography had the most striking inclination to sexually aggressive behaviour. Professor Check said that frequent users of pornography had come to accept and endorse the values represented by pornography. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr James Weaver, Assistant Professor, College of Communications, University of Kentucky, said that exposure to media portrayals of female sexual permissiveness can activate cognition that reflect a general loss of respect for female sexual autonomy and self-determination. He noted:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . repeated exposure to such depictions is thought to result in the generalization and misattribution of characteristics associated with sexually promiscuous women to other women. </PARA>
<PARA>Zillman and Bryant, two other well-known, respected researchers, showed that massive exposure to pornography promotes acceptance of such material. They found that exposure to pornography causes both males and females to trivialise rape and to increase male callousness towards women. Further, they stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The most astonishing effect of prolonged pornography consumption on family values, however, concerns the desire to have children . . . exposure to pornography reduced the desire to have children and it did so in a uniform fashion . . . The desire to have male offspring dropped 31%. The desire for female offspring . . . dropped by twice that margin: 61%. This reduction proved specific to gender. Male respondents expressed little desire for female offspring altogether. It is the desire of females for offspring of their own kind that, after consumption of pornography, shrank to one third of its normal strength . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Zillman and Bryant also found that prolonged consumption of pornography `reduced sexual satisfaction and sex-related personal happiness markedly'. They said that subjects often compare the appearance and performance of their partner, such as their spouse, with the pornographic model and, as a result, become very dissatisfied after a period of time with their partner. Other behavioural scientists gave evidence that where no willing adult sexual partner is available, there is a possibility that some children may be at risk of sexual abuse, including incest. Inspector Johnson, of the Victorian Vice Squad, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We have evidence from the Child Exploitation Unit, which I am in charge of now, that . . . paedophiles watch films and stimulate themselves and then they go out and have intercourse with children, or they bring the child into watch the film and get the child excited and then the crime is committed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is example after example, taking up hundreds of pages. If anybody doubts that violent or pornographic videos are not harmful to children and some adults in society in tipping the latter group over the edge, I suggest that he should read the report. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I had some doubts myself, but this evidence has left me in no doubt about the detrimental effects of such videos. </PARA>
<PARA> Approval for the sale of X-rated or excessively violent videos in Australia today is totally irresponsible. It is harmful for the children of this nation, it is harmful for a certain percentage of adults and, in particular, it is degrading for women. It makes Australia a less desirable place in which to live. I know that the Australian Labor Party suggests that X-rated video classification be changed to a new classification called non-violent erotica. The NVE classification will be identical to the X-rated classification. I say to those members of the Labor Party who support this suggestion-I know that not all members do-that this move will only entrench perversion in society today. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australia is in danger of exhibiting the `fall of Rome' syndrome in permitting the sale of this material to continue. While I fully appreciate the censorship argument that those on the other side will no doubt put forward, apart from anything else, this material is a bit sick. Quite frankly, I believe that society can well do without it. I believe that the Government should ban imports of this material and perhaps even consider making it illegal for this material to be sent through the mail. If the Government took these steps it would fall in line with the wishes of all States in Australia and, I believe, with the wishes of the majority of Australian people. </PARA>

That is the simple fact. We cannot keep them out of buildings with a razor ribbon around them and with armed guards. Until we find out how to control moral behaviour we will not stop people wanting to view the material, which, frankly, I find reprehensible. I find pornography absolutely boring. One can watch just so much of human beings coupling sexually; it does nothing whatsoever for me.

Only about a month ago, in a street in a large Asian city I saw the latest Raider film-it had just hit the Australian cinemas-for sale at $5 a copy. It is technology that will beat those opposite. They are 20 years behind the times. They are back there before the days of cheap videos. They are back in the days when maybe governments did have the ability, by banning importations, to control the material our populace watches. That time has gone. That is neanderthal thinking. It is a nonsense to think that governments today can control what people want to view. It is just a nonsense. This material comes in in container loads. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at what has happened in the American States that have banned this sort of material. Is anybody going to tell me that the material is not available? Is anybody going to tell this House that where countries have banned pornography people cannot get it or it is not readily available? We cannot say that because it is readily available. It is there, it is on the streets, but with no control by government. It is freely available. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless those opposite can say that their proposals will solve the problem, they should not suggest them. They will not solve the problem. All that would happen is that the moment this Parliament banned the importation of non-violent erotica-and I will come back to the Opposition's confusion about other matters in a minute-organised crime would start shipping material into the country. They already have the marketplace chains established through illicit drugs and prostitution. There is the marketing system. They would ship the stuff in and we would have material such as snuff films coming out of America. Does the Opposition know what a snuff film is? It is where the female model being used to depict sexual activity is murdered-actually killed-in the video. That is the sort of stuff we would get in this country. It is currently banned, currently unavailable. The only pornography which is available in this country is in fact non-violent. There is no violent pornography available; it is all non-violent. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not happen to like the stuff. As I said, in the earlier part of this year when the debate was on, I bothered to go and view some. I have been to countries where sexual activities are performed on stage and I frankly find it very boring. I do not really think the evidence the Opposition produced from the report of the Joint Committee on Video Material was very fairly put. The report contains an equal amount of evidence to suggest that, for the normal human being, such depictions of sexual activity have no effect whatsoever. But when it comes to violent activities, I will support the Opposition all the way on its attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I am absolutely horrified to think that our children are being exposed on television to the sort of nonsense that Rambo and similar figures get up to. It really leaves me cold. I have raised three children, and very early in my life I joined a group that monitored television. It was an adult group that was concerned about what children saw on television. For years I have been concerned about what children see on television; but to ban it will not stop it. How many houses in Australia do not have a video cassette recorder? Very few, and those that have not are buying them at the rate of knots. If the house has a VCR people do not need anything other than someone flogging the product out on the street to buy it. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to organised crime. They are the organisations who are making literally billions of dollars around the world from prohibition. They are the only supporters of prohibition. If we ban some of this material, the increased profit going into the hands of organised crime would be frightening. I am the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority and in the past few years I have managed to gain some expertise in the marketing techniques and the way in which organised crime is infiltrating not just this country but the world. I can say without question that that would be the only result. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) speaks regularly on this subject. No-one else in the House raises this topic in such a regular manner. It is interesting to note that he is an expert on the fetishes. I did not even know what he was talking about. He seems to be very well experienced in the fetishes. He seems to know what he is talking about, and I find that quite surprising. I find it surprising in a debate of this kind that he had to detail in some graphic terms what sort of fetishes there were. Is that really part of this debate? Is it not more of a moral issue, a principle issue for discussion, rather than having a member of this House stand up and so graphically suggest that people find sexual pleasure in eating dog's excrement or smearing their bodies with it. I mean to say, really! I find that just as offensive as the thing he was complaining about. I wonder about the honourable gentleman's problem-why he has almost compulsively to stand in this House regularly and raise this topic in such graphic terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member was thoroughly confused about X-rated and violent videos. The evidence he quoted was confused between the two and he gave little credit to the report of the Committee which examined this subject. Violence is banned in X-rated videos. It is not available in this country and it cannot be obtained through legitimate sources. That has to be clearly put and clearly said. Much as I may not like pornography, much as I may wish that I lived in a society where the demand for such material did not exist, the demand does exist. It is part of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman should state clearly that non-violent erotica exists and that the violent material is in fact legal. I object most to the sorts of films that appear in our cinemas and which come too regularly on our television sets. If I wander into a video shop in my State-I do not know what it is like in other States-I now have trouble getting a video I am prepared to watch. Eighty per cent of the material in most video shops in Australia is absolute rubbish. No wonder we are getting peculiar people out there, if children are growing up and being fed on a diet of such material. That is where this Parliament should direct its attack. The debate gets confused when the honourable gentleman tries to marry the two issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject the honourable member's motion, I think it is ill-founded. His only supporters are the organised criminal groups. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we are faced with it we have to identify it and honourable members are being stupid. Honourable members opposite should listen to the answer and presumably they will accept it. The Saudi officials acknowledge that the diseases did not originate in Australia but they are refusing, as I hope the honourable gentleman knows, to provide Australia with the test details or results. Obviously, in this situation we have yet to be convinced that a serious disease problem exists. All rejected shipments have been accepted and cleared of disease by other Middle East markets.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the case. Kuwait, in particular, has rigorously tested the rejected sheep and has declared them free of the alleged diseases. Positive disease tests were subsequently overturned and we have yet to confirm the United Arab Emirates disease findings. We are looking at further measures to satisfy Saudi animal health concerns and a mechanism to deal with future problems should they arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the interim, we support the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation's action to protect Australia's interests by temporarily suspending further shipments to Saudi Arabia. I repeat that this matter has been handled very efficiently and with complete commitment. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has had the cooperation of those with whom he has dealt. We are not in possession of any evidence whatsoever to suggest that there is any basis, in terms of Australia's position, to justify the action taken by the Saudis. There may be some explanation in some of the internal Saudi considerations. Neither my Government nor our great sheep industry can be held responsible for what may be happening within Saudi Arabia to explain what has happened. There is no responsibility on the part of Australia's great primary industry, nor is there any responsibility on the part of the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a tragedy that on just about every issue that arises, whether it concerns the pay claims of avaricious pilots or in regard to a situation such as this where Australian farmers have acted honourably, properly and without the possibility of any suggestion being made against them that they have acted otherwise than properly and safely, where the Government is giving them all the support it possibly can, this pathetic Opposition regards as the last item on its agenda the real interests of Australia. It is about time it woke up to the fact that the people of Australia are getting sick and tired of a situation where members of the Opposition put their miserable selves first and their country last.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said, the honourable member's statement and his question yesterday were clearly designed to give support to the Federation of Air Pilots. We have the hypocrisy of the Opposition day by day attacking the Government for the damage being done by the Federation of Air Pilots and at the same time encouraging that damage. That is really what the Opposition is about. The Opposition would be better served if the honourable member for Mayo got his brain into gear before opening his mouth because on this issue, as with so many other issues that he raises, he is wrong. Do not take my word for that, Mr Speaker. Let us consider what the company concerned has had to say about it. I will inform the House of the company's response to the honourable member for Mayo. It is not the Government's response. In a full-page advertisement in today's Adelaide Advertiser headed `You're wrong Mr Downer' the company stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>On Sunday, August 27, the Federal Liberal Member for Mayo, Mr Alexander Downer, made allegations about wages paid to workers on the Myer Redevelopment site in Rundle Mall.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Downer's claims were poorly researched and, in most cases, totally erroneous.</PARA>
<PARA> We wish to set the record straight, on behalf of all workers on the site, particularly members of the Builders Labourers Federation (properly known as the Australian Building and Construction Workers Federation) who were singled out.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Downer claimed that the BLF had obtained a `backdoor wage increase' of 30 per cent over the above award payments in the building industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, let me deal first with the latter part of the question, the insinuation that I intervened on this matter at the instigation of Ansett. I do not know what has come over a gentleman who I had previously thought had a mixture of intelligence and decency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Jull interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the honourable member can shrug his shoulders and try to shrug it off. The fact is that what he is trying to say is that the Prime Minister of Australia acted on the basis presumably of a friendship that he has with the head of Ansett. Okay, good. Let us have it out into the open. The fact is that on this matter, in the presence of my colleagues the other Ministers, the head of Ansett, Sir Peter Abeles, and the head of Australian Airlines met me in my office-not just me by myself, but with my Ministers there. The question raised was raised jointly, not just by Ansett but by Australian Airlines as well. Why does not the honourable member demonstrate at least a modicum of decency in his question and ask whether I acted in response to pressure from Australian Airlines and Ansett? Unfortunately the honourable member would not do that because that is the whole truth of who was there. He should not jump up in a muddled little way and try to say what is the whole truth of the issue. I am telling the whole truth about who was there. But no, he could not do that. He could not ask whether it was pressure from the airlines; it had to be `Was it pressure from Ansett?'. Why does he not at least have the decency to say, `Well, did the airlines?'. Now the airlines did raise the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members-Aha!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Airlines; not just Ansett, but Australian Airlines too. Ted Harris and Abeles, representing their airlines, raised the question, and legitimately. What was the question they raised? A very simple one. It concerned the fact that there were existing agreements within the Australia airline industry covering the domestic airlines and Qantas, and under those agreements there was an understanding, and agreement, that no-one would handle this question of re-crewing and re-manning arrangements and attendant possible changes in salaries unless and until any one of them concerned, confronted with a claim on this, had consulted with the others. That was the existing agreement that they had, and Australian Airlines and Ansett, naturally enough, being confronted with demands from their pilots, were saying that they were very concerned that something could have been done in defiance of an agreement which could push them into a situation where they may be forced under industrial pressure to pay increases to their pilots outside of anything that was reasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the answer is yes, the two domestic airlines very properly raised the issue with the Prime Minister of this country and the two of my Ministers concerned, the Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for Industrial Relations. Yes, they did raise-and properly raise-this issue with me, and I properly took it aboard.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us get the facts straight for this very confused honourable member and an increasingly discredited Opposition. I am informed that the Leader of the Opposition had a press conference before the Parliament resumed this afternoon to explain or attempt to explain his position on this issue to the Press Gallery. The universal judgment was that he did not know what he was talking about-it was bewildering. That is not surprising because that is what we have witnessed in this House.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us get clear what the facts are. The new Qantas 747-400 series aircraft provides for two crew in the cockpit-a considerable improvement in productivity over earlier generation 747 series. In assessing any increase in work value due to new generation aircraft in the aviation industry, it is clearly this Government's wish that an industry approach be adopted, as is required under the existing agreements, and, secondly, that such matters be pursued through the Industrial Relations Commission in accordance with wage fixing principles. Now Qantas has given the Government an assurance that no new allowance has been paid in respect of 747-400 crew and it has given us the undertaking that any such proposal will be pursued within the Industrial Relations Commission as required. It is a measure of the responsibility of the Australian International Pilots Association, AIPA, that they also accept that position, and that they have agreed to pursue the matter within the wage fixing system.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude where I began. I regard as beneath contempt the insinuation in the question from the honourable member that this was an approach from Ansett because of-my God, it is not a state secret that Sir Peter Abeles is a longstanding friend of the Prime Minister. But, because of that very poorly kept state secret, there is this miserable insinuation in the question that Sir Peter Abeles and Hawke have come to some position. The fact is that Sir Peter Abeles on behalf of Ansett and Ted Harris on behalf of Australian Airlines properly came to me and the two Ministers and said, `This is a real issue of concern which, if allowed to go through into the domestic situation, could wreck the wages system and the Australian economy'. The Australian Prime Minister and his two Ministers properly took that issue into account.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question because the statements to which he alludes are yet further evidence of what has been persistently revealed here in Question Time in questions from Opposition frontbenchers and in the way in which they have participated in debates. I have seen those statements in today's papers. They came from a press release from Senator Jocelyn Newman, the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel. The statements are replete with the type of comment that has come from the other side of the House allegedly supporting the Government's position but in fact opposing it. Senator Newman goes along with the theme which she has long adopted in that area, which is at least half suggestive of the motion that perhaps the Services ought to do other than operate under direct government directive. For example, she says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our servicemen and women have no right to speak about their own treatment. It is an ironic state of affairs when one considers that the essential duty of our Defence Force is to defend and protect our democracy and freedom of speech, yet they are the only Australian body of people denied just that-the freedom of speech.</PARA>
<PARA>Right through that press release is the implicit assumption that the defence forces have the right to avoid a direction from the Government on this matter or any other. That is an extraordinarily dangerous constitutional position. It would be an interesting matter of debate in itself. In this context, Senator Newman's statement is produced to provide implicit and explicit criticism of the Government's decision to employ the RAAF to fly people in this country in the absence of the capacity of the civilian airlines to fly them following the resignation of their pilots.</PARA>
<PARA> In answering the points the honourable gentleman made in his question, I have nothing but praise for the way in which the RAAF has conducted itself during the last week. It has provided an absolutely essential service and it has done it well. Senator Jocelyn Newman comments, `You can imagine how they personally feel'; I know they personally feel very good about it indeed. They are providing a service to the people of this country. The people who are using that service are expressing their gratitude when they get off the planes at the fact that they are able to get to their destinations. We are getting no complaints at all from the pilots about the services they are performing. That is the first point I make in response to the Opposition's continuing effort at subversion of the Government's activities in ensuring that the travelling public is properly served.</PARA>
<PARA> The next aspect of the honourable gentleman's question I will deal with relates to the priority of return from the Kangaroo 89 series exercises. In circumstances in which the travelling public is massively inconvenienced it would not be unusual if the Government were to assign a higher level of priority to shifting civilians around as opposed to leaving full time defence personnel in place on an exercise. In these circumstances it would not be unusual for the Government to do what has been suggested in Senator Newman's press release. The fact is that we are not; we are continuing to assign top priority over the other requirements to the return of defence personnel from the Kangaroo 89 series exercise. When the withdrawal of those personnel is complete we will have additional RAAF capacity available for civilian purposes. In some circumstances, people who would have been carried either by RAAF flights or by civilian flights on a charter basis have been picked up by Qantas. The fact is that the Government assigns higher priority to the completion of the Kangaroo exercise than it does to the shifting of civilians. There are aircraft to do both jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> We then get to the question of pay and allowances. It is erroneously claimed that pay has not been reviewed. It has been reviewed repeatedly and consistently upgraded in accordance with Government wage fixing principles. Those wage fixing principles have produced a massive lift in service allowances over the last couple of years and, most notably, given the nature of this particular issue, a 75 per cent increase to a maximum of $11,000 a year in the flying allowance. Those service pilots are paid well. They are certainly not paid as well as their civilian counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA> Eight hours a week at the stick is an unknown figure to Royal Australian Air Force pilots. The fact that they are not flying eight hours a week at the stick during these weeks is no particular hardship to them. They are, however, flying considerably more hours than they would normally; they are doing it cheerfully and under Government directive. They are accepting the role that the defence forces always accept from the Government in a democracy-that they act in accordance with Government directives. To fail to accept that principle introduces a revolutionary element into the politics of this country. The Opposition is prepared to assume tacitly that it will accept such a revolutionary element in this dispute. It is yet another example of its total unwillingness to confront this issue. There is no policy really in the Opposition as far as this is concerned. We have got the Chauncey Gardener of Australian politics leading the Opposition here. He is the man who likes to watch.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact of the matter is that such a proposal could not be accommodated within current fiscal policy and the Budget saw the emergence of a bipartisan view about the fiscal stance when the Leader of the Opposition said in his Budget reply:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the forecast surplus this year is the right result achieved the wrong way.</PARA>
<PARA>He is endorsing the surplus and then in his speech headed `Fiscal and Monetary Policy' he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has claimed a lot of credit for producing a $9.1 billion surplus this year. I am not about to criticise that for the sake of criticism but I have said that the surplus is the right result achieved in the wrong day.</PARA>
<PARA>So he has endorsed the Government's fiscal policy or the stance of fiscal policy. To just add some information to the debate about this proposal which we have seen floated about a two-rate personal income tax scale-that is, both by the Opposition and by other elements of the community-I have calculated how the present tax scale would have to be adapted to fulfil those conditions, that is, two rates only, the top rate no more than the company tax rate. Plus, I have assumed that nobody wants the existing tax bill to rise; so I have got that as a third condition. The lowest cost tax scale that could meet those three conditions would be to have the existing bottom rate of 21c running up to the existing 39c threshold and then 39c applying to all higher incomes. That is the lowest cost tax scale that is (a) flatter, (b) two rates only and (c) does not increase the tax bill for any taxpayer. As one would expect, it would be a typical kind of Liberal style tax cut.</PARA>
<PARA> There would be nothing for lower income earners. Nobody earning $17,000 or less would get any tax cut at all. There would be very little for middle income earners, a flat $4.55 running up to $35,000; and a lot at the top. At $100,000 it gives $104 a week. So, to sum it up, it is 55c a week for someone on $18,000 and $55 a week for someone on $68,000 a year. I table for the benefit of the House an actual rate scale and income scale. The cost of such a proposal would be $2.8 billion this financial year. The out year cost would be significantly higher. This is relevant when we consider that on the night the Leader of the Opposition replied to the Budget Speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Let us give them a scoop. First, we will move towards a flatter system of personal taxation that has only two marginal rates. Second, we will ensure that the top rate for individuals is not higher than the company tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, in his reply to the Budget Speech which was shown on national television, committed the Opposition parties to to a two-rate system, with the top personal rate aligned with the company tax rate. That was a firm commitment given to the public. Since then the Leader of the Opposition has used more obscure media performances to try to walk away from that commitment. In an interview on a radio program he said, `We would need to maintain for some time a three-rate system'. Later in the week he referred to a four-rate system. Apparently, at a press conference before lunch today he slid between two and four rates.</PARA>
<PARA> That $2.8 billion cost is on top of the cost of abolishing the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, providing a tax bias for families and an inflation adjustment for the tax system. It is supposed to be funded only by a $1 billion cut in government spending. So a $1 billion cut in government spending will fund a $2.8 billion cost in this financial year of that sort of rate scale, the abolition of the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, substantiation, a tax bias for families, and an inflation adjustment for the tax system. The Leader of the Opposition said today that in a couple of weeks he will give us his tax details. This is about the fifteenth time we have been told that in the life of this Parliament. He has told us he will give us the details by October. He has approximately 30 days to give the Parliament and the public details of the tax scale.</PARA>

It will be interesting to hear whether it is the kind of tax scale which he could live with, because people on the bottom scale would get a 55c tax cut while people earning $65,000 would get $55. At the same time, he proposes to abolish the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, he would have a tax bias for families and, of course, there is his much heralded inflation adjustment for the tax system, from which he has been dissembling since the day he first raised it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An agreement has been reached between the airlines and the RAAF for the use of its aircraft. I will give the honourable gentleman a more detailed answer, but off the top of my head, as I recollect it, as I dealt with the matter some time ago, the airlines are carrying the direct cost of supplying the aircraft with fuel and with what they need to fly at the time they fly. There is an agreed rate of subsequent payment for maintenance. The fares are being collected and the operation is being conducted by the airlines themselves, so there is a complex set of payment arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The assumption is that this operation is being conducted on a non-subsidised basis. Of course, we have not had to do this before, and it is not inconceivable that we could find that there may be a gap between what is being paid for maintenance and the actual cost of flying the aircraft in these sorts of circumstances. If that were to occur, I would address my colleagues on that subject in the course of Additional Estimates committee hearings. However that is not anticipated as the likely outcome. We believe that we have struck a reasonable deal with the airlines. As I said, it will probably take some time and experience in the course of these operations to work out whether or not the operations are going exactly as we anticipated. However, it is our objective to ensure that civilian personnel get uplifted. It is not our objective to make a profit out of the airlines or to put the airlines in a situation in which they have difficulty in conducting their affairs. I think it is reasonable for me to ask the Opposition whether it has an alternative view on that matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can truly say in this case that it is well known in the House that the honourable member for Hughes has a particular and continuing interest in this area of affairs. Australia is very active in making representations to foreign governments about human rights cases. The policy of the Government in this respect is unqualified and it is non-discriminatory. We make representations to any country from which we have received confirmed reports of human rights abuses. Human rights reporting by our overseas posts and our close links with Australian human rights groups, including the parliamentary group of Amnesty International, enable us to respond promptly to human rights abuses. I think it is a credit to this Parliament that in this area of Amnesty International activities we have a thoroughgoing bipartisanship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our immediate and unequivocal response to the tragic and deplorable events in China provides clear recent evidence of our commitment to this policy. I should say-I hope that without any question I would have the full support of all parts of the House-that we have recently made representations to Bulgaria on its policies of forced assimilation and repression of ethnic Turks which have led to an exodus of some quarter of a million of those unfortunate people to Turkey. I can say that we will continue to press our concerns to the Bulgarian authorities and to ask them to find a solution to the exodus which is satisfactory to all parties. We believe that it is also very important to participate in multilateral forums in order to develop and promote internationally accepted standards of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, in answer to the honourable gentleman's question, I repeat: wherever we have confirmed reports of the abuse of human rights, wherever they occur, we make appropriate representations. I am strengthened on the part of the Government in being able to do that by the bipartisanship which does exist substantially in this area. I repeat that particularly in the most recent case of the tragedy that is happening in regard to the ethnic Turks that are being expelled from Bulgaria we have made and will continue to make very strong representations in that regard.</PARA>

There was never any rational basis to the Government's rail charging policy as Queensland was run on nothing other than a series of hillbilly deals. The Liberal Party went along with that for most of the time it was in coalition. The National Party members in this House, particularly those from Queensland, stand condemned. For years that rotten corruption and nonsense was put up with by the Liberal and National Party members in this House-see no evil, hear no evil, think no evil. They all knew what was going on.

<PARA> That, remembering (a) that 3 September 1989 is the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War and (b) that nearly 34,000 Australian service-men and women died in that conflict, this House expresses its profound hope that the troubled peace since the end of the War will become a permanent peace in the world and, in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) reaffirms its deep and continuing gratitude to those Australian men and women who served their country in that War, both overseas and at home, and its continuing sympathy to the families and friends of those who died or were wounded in combat; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) resolves to ensure that the sacrifices of those men and women were not made in vain, by meeting our nation's continuing defence and security responsibilities and by working to preserve and extend the goals for which the War was fought: a peaceful world in which the human rights and democratic aspirations of all men and women are inviolate. </PARA>
<PARA>On Sunday the world will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of the Second World War-the second time in our century that the tragedy of global conflict engulfed us. It is appropriate that the Australian Parliament should mark this event on behalf of the Australian people. As this motion notes, the anniversary of the outbreak of the war is a time for us to recall with deep gratitude the sacrifices made by all those Australian men and women who fought overseas and who served at home during the Second World War. It is a time to recall in particular the debt we owe to the 34,000 Australians who died in the conflict, to those who suffer still as a result of their experiences in the war, and to the families and friends of those who died. </PARA>
<PARA> So much has changed in the world over the past half century and in Australia's place in it that it is sometimes difficult for younger Australians to appreciate how much we owe to the generation which responded so bravely and so enthusiastically to the dreadful challenges of 1939 and the years that followed. But it was the heavy human and economic price they paid that resulted in the final defeat of fascism and imperialism and the liberation of the peoples of Europe and the Asia-Pacific region from the crushing weight of two barbarous tyrannies. This victory, in turn, permitted the creation of the most positive and dynamic feature of the world we have inherited-the collection of free, democratic and equitable societies in North America, Western Europe and East Asia that has been the driving force behind the development of the more prosperous and peaceful world order that now beckons us. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia reaped another benefit from the tragedy of the war-the immeasurable enrichment of our society through the massive influx of new settlers who fled the devastation of their war-ravaged homes to build a new life in the clear Australian atmosphere of freedom and prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the eventual victory in the Second World War did not secure for all people the democracy and human rights so painfully regained for some. As we have been reminded in the most moving way over the past few months in places as diverse as Beijing, Hungary, Poland and the Baltic states, the democratic impulse has been smothered for long periods throughout many parts of the world. But it now seems possible that parts of the world which had appeared frozen in repression may finally be able to take their place with the rest of humankind as we move to a more cooperative and prosperous future. </PARA>
<PARA> We are indeed privileged to be living through an exciting and challenging time in international affairs. For the first time in our unhappy century we can contemplate the idea of a world in which another global conflict seems improbable. Appalling problems, of course, remain. In places such as the Middle East where the suffering of the Lebanese people is so tragically prolonged and the gap between Arabs and Israelis is so apparently unbridgeable, and in South Africa under the abhorrent yoke of apartheid, peace still seems a distant and elusive hope. But, on the whole, we are entitled to permit ourselves a degree of optimism about the future. </PARA>
<PARA> So, this anniversary, Mr Speaker, gives us opportunity and it gives us reason to remember that we have reached this potentially benign point in human history only with the help of the sacrifices that were made by ordinary Australians during the Second World War. It gives us reason, too, to remember one of the great lessons of that war-that peace and security are fundamentally intertwined. Having recently returned from observing the Kangaroo 89 exercise I am particularly conscious of the role that the men and women of our Defence Force have played not only in time of war but also in preserving the peace. They serve us and our nation well. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as Australians can look back proudly on the part we played in helping to win the war, so we can reflect with pride on the way we have helped to sustain the peace. In recent years Australia has made intensive efforts to contribute to an international climate aimed at protecting and expanding peace. Throughout active work in multilateral arms control organisations, by our diplomatic action in our own region, and through the influence we have exerted within the councils of our alliance relationship, we have been able to work towards a safer world. In particular, we have made our voice heard loudly in support of the very welcome measures that have already been taken by the superpowers to reduce their deadly arsenals of nuclear weapons. Although much more has yet to be done, we have worked tirelessly to reduce the risk of other countries joining the nuclear club and we have been at the leading edge of international efforts to prevent the proliferation of the modern plague of chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> As we consider this motion today, Australians are helping to keep the peace on behalf of the United Nations, often in dangerous and uncomfortable conditions in Namibia, in Cyprus, in southern Lebanon and Golan Heights, and along the battle-scarred border between Iraq and Iran. I call on honourable members to support the motion before the House and, at the conclusion of the consideration of the moment, to join me in a moment of silence, recalling the courage of those who died in the Second World War, the resilience of those who survived, and our common hope that by our actions we will repay the debt we owe those Australians, in the best way we can, by ensuring that such sacrifices are never again necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Almost 50 years ago my predecessor in the seat of Kooyong, the then Prime Minister, Robert Gordon Menzies, in sadness and regret, announced to a troubled nation that England had declared war on Germany and as a result Australia was also at war. In every city and town, from Hobart to the cane fields and mining communities of the outback, people gathered around radio sets listening to those words of ominous tidings little realising that the carnage to follow would ultimately involve every continent and prove even more devastating than the Great War of 1914 to 1918. So began an episode in our nation's history and our world's development which we should neither forget nor do anything to cause a repetition. Fifty years later we remember that war and draw upon its experience to strengthen our pursuit of a world free from needless conflict and bloodshed, a world which respects and dignifies fundamental human rights, a world in which every nation has a vested interest in continuing peace, cooperation and freedom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I second this motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I was pleased that it had drafting input from my office. As such, it stands as a declaration on behalf of the three political parties represented in this chamber and by implication it has the unqualified support of every member of the House. It is appropriate for the Prime Minister to move the motion, for the Parliament today to pay due recognition to the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War and to express the important sentiment and hope embraced in the terms of the resolution put to the House by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The war was the seminal experience of any Australian alive at that time, including those who subsequently came to our country through immigration in the postwar years to escape the ravaged and torn European subcontinent. Indeed, it is the only war in our two centuries of existence as a nation which has actually touched Australian soil-the bombing of Darwin and submarine attacks in Sydney Harbour by the Japanese. It was a war provoked by a sinister and evil ideology which poisoned the very soul of humanity with racial slaughter and acts of barbaric brutality against captured enemies and against innocent civilians alike. </PARA>
<PARA> As an escapade in mass war culminating in the use of atomic weapons, it changed forever the nature of great power conflict. The Second World War was also, as I think the Prime Minister indicated in his speech, the turning point of modern history. It marked the end of colonialism as the practice of European empires, and the end of American isolationism, and it changed forever the global balance of power. We entered the war a dominion of the British Empire. We were targeted for Japanese attack at Hitler's request in 1941 to weaken the Empire by capturing its colonies. We ended the war an ally of the United States, to which free world leadership passed as surely as economic leadership began to shift from Europe to the Pacific rim. </PARA>
<PARA> Every citizen of Australia and of other countries more directly involved in the conflagration was intimately touched and affected by the six years of prolonged and bloody conflict. The Second World War was a tragedy of unbelievable magnitude in human, physical and social terms. Some 50 million people, military and civilian, lost their lives on the battlefields or as innocent victims of war. The Soviet Union by itself suffered an estimated 20 million dead. To put that into perspective, imagine the entire population of our country, with an additional three million people, forever wiped out from the face of the earth. </PARA>
<PARA> Our own country, small though it was, paid an enormous price for peace, as welcome and overdue as that was. Unquestionably the cream of a generation was lost in senseless bloodshed in the mud of Europe and the festered tropics of Asia and the Pacific. Some returned home wounded, some permanently incapacitated; services lost to our nation. Thirty-four thousand Australian service men and women gave their lives in the conflict within both the European and the Pacific theatres of war. Of a national population of only seven million in the war years, over 900,000 Australian men and women answered the call to duty and enlisted in the armed forces for part or all of the war, and of those over 550,000 courageous people served outside Australia in wider fields of conflict, where they carried with honour the pride and the character established by the Anzacs, the original diggers at Gallipoli and in the Somme. By the end of the war, 20 Victoria Crosses had been awarded to Australian service personnel in recognition of outstanding courage, determination and bravery. </PARA>
<PARA> This touches, does it not, one of the awful ironies of war: in the face of horror and destruction there emerge inspiring and heroic acts in which considerations of personal safety surrender to a selfless determination to succeed. All of us in this House-and this attitude is shared by all parties-have a continuing debt of gratitude and care for many of our former service men and women and their families. Over 600,000 veterans, their wives or widows and dependants, are reliant on disability and service pensions. This is not a form of compensation to them; it is the execution of an ongoing duty to provide support which I believe is acknowledged by all sides. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Second World War what can be described only as the darker side of human personality emerged. All wars are horrific, but in that Second World War nowhere did horrific acts reach such appalling depths as in Hitler's genocidal Holocaust against the European community of Jews. In this respect, as in others, there was a concert of intent and sympathy between the communist tradition and the fascism of Hitler's national socialism. Even before the war there were signs of impending racist horror when Nazi-inspired prejudice led to the destruction of shops and houses owned by German Jews. The systematic slaughter of six million Jews, shipped like cattle to fields where they were mercilessly gunned to death in mass graves, poisoned in showers of cyanide, literally carved up alive by the surgeons of hate, or locked in concentration camps where torture and starvation were the orders of the day, was a genocide without equal in history. </PARA>
<PARA> A decade or more ago we saw elements of this in Cambodia. The Prime Minister does the House justice and right when he talks of the need for us to work for peace, to enshrine the principles of freedom and democracy and never again to allow such events to occur. They can be avoided, as he says, only with the conjoint of peace and security. Peace cannot be wished for; it has to be worked at. All honourable members would join in working for what he gave voice to today. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned at the outset that the Liberal and National parties entirely support the sentiment of the motion. Fifty years ago the world entered a period of great darkness and despair. Through sacrifice, struggle and determined effort the people of the free world emerged triumphant. Whatever our partisan political differences-and this is the chamber whose right to enact legislation despite those differences was fought for-our continuing overriding mission, notwithstanding philosophic differences, is to maintain the pursuit of peace through democratic means and to ensure that the blood of our children should never stain the soil of foreign lands, let alone the wattle. I join the Prime Minister in commending the motion and in the moment of silence in the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the National Party of Australia, I would like to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) in supporting this motion. As a member of the generation born after World War II, I am very conscious of the enormous debt of gratitude that my generation owes to those who served during the Second World War. Our lack of direct recollection of the war in no way diminishes our abhorrence of the Third Reich or our resolve to be both vigilant and prepared. To my knowledge, while only two members of the House at the present time-the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar)-participated in this war on Australia's behalf, many in this chamber today will have memories of the war. Almost all members' families will have been affected in one way or another in various countries, as my family was affected by the tragedy of World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a mountain of literature now available about the nature of the Third Reich leadership. The inhumanity and sheer maliciousness of the regime is beyond dispute. Out of this horror, however, came a great sense of camaraderie within Australian society. Our people pulled together. There was a sense of team and purpose as the whole nation worked to defeat what was a great evil. Of course, the greatest sacrifice was borne by those in the services. At the end of the war the Australian service personnel returned with an outstanding reputation for toughness, initiative and thorough professionalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Like their fathers before them, the Australians also went overseas with an earthy commonsense. The work of the Repatriation Commission and our repatriation hospitals is a reminder to us all of the continuing need to care for and to compensate those who returned. Those who did not return left behind widows and families. In that context I commend the fine work of Legacy and the Returned Services League throughout Australia. We all hope that such an appalling conflict never again occurs. We must be both vigilant and prepared. World War II offers us an insight into the bitter consequences of a lack of preparedness and vigilance. To illustrate this point I would like to quote briefly a short passage from Gavin Long's official history of Australia in the war:</PARA>
<PARA>Ministers, hoping at the eleventh hour war might be avoided, sought to escape lasting defence commitments. From this point of view it might prove more economical to order equipment abroad rather than establish factories to make it at home, to increase the militia than recruit long service regular units. </PARA>
<PARA> History had proved and was to prove again the futility of such a military policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Defence is not cheap, but, as those who returned will remind us, the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The funding of the Peace Haven Nursing Home has attracted considerable press coverage in Tasmania and there have been many requests for the release of this report. In July 1988 new funding arrangements for nursing and personal care staff in nursing homes were introduced. Under these arrangements, for the first time in Australia, nursing homes are funded by the Commonwealth according to the needs of their residents, rather than the lobbying powers of nursing home management or historical factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Peace Haven Nursing Home, operated by Masonic Peace Memorial Haven of Northern Tasmania Inc, received extremely generous funding under the old arrangements-well in excess of those received by other Tasmanian nursing homes. Apart from extremely generous capital funding of $902,200, this nursing home was funded for the highest infrastructure costs of all Tasmanian nursing homes. While the new arrangements are reducing the infrastructure funding of Peace Haven, some 90 per cent of nursing homes in Tasmania are receiving real term increases. In addition, while the average nursing home in Tasmania received recurrent funding for 17.1 hours per resident per week, Peace Haven was funded for more than 10 hours above this average. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few months, it became apparent that the management of Peace Haven would prefer to continue to receive more funding than other nursing homes and was refusing to accept the new funding arrangements which treat all nursing homes equally. In an attempt to force the Government to approve huge additional funding for this home, the management of Peace Haven made public threats that they would close the doors of the home if such funding was not forthcoming. These threats aroused fears amongst the residents of the home, and their relatives, that they, or their loved ones, would be forced onto the streets because Commonwealth funding for the home was inadequate. For this reason, I was pleased to meet Peace Haven's public request for an independent examination of the financial arrangements of the home. </PARA>
<PARA> This report, which is the end result of that independent examination, was researched by one of Australia's experts on nursing home finances, Mr Peter Geary of Coopers and Lybrand. It finds that efficient management of the home should turn its current operating loss into a sizeable operating surplus, within the funding presently provided by the Commonwealth Government. Mr Geary's report also highlights the exceptionally high level of money being spent on administrative staff at the home, and the fact that some of the costs incurred by Peace Haven have actually been on behalf of other facilities. The report stresses that poor management practices had been the cause of most of the financial problems of the home. While these poor practices could be supported under the previous inequitable funding arrangements, they cannot continue now. </PARA>
<PARA> The report clearly supports the Commonwealth's position regarding this home. It does not, in any way, support the repeated and public claims by Peace Haven's management that the level of Commonwealth funding was inadequate and that therefore the home was being forced to close. It is in response to these allegations by Peace Haven's management, which were supported by some members of this House, that I have now tabled this report. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Masonic Peace Memorial Haven of Northern Tasmania (Inc).-Management Performance Review-Ministerial Statement, 31 August 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the presentation of this report on the Masonic Peace Memorial Haven of Northern Tasmania (Inc.), which, I must say, is in stark contrast to the initial press releases put out by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) in this regard. I think some of his comments may have unnecessarily offended the nursing home involved. Some of those comments related to poor management, too many administration staff, and the fact that a higher level of service could be obtained if certain practices were in place. An implication regarding the standard of care was commented on by the author, Mr Geary of Coopers and Lybrand. There was also a comment by the Minister about the nursing home refusing to accept the umpire's decision. In fact, if one looks at the report, one sees that it commends the home on its high level of service and it made no detrimental comment whatsoever in that regard. In fact, the nursing home itself asked for the report to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report must be looked at in the context of its very narrow terms of reference. Some more meaningful investigations into the home, and the problems of funding dementia care, were omitted from this report. Therefore, while I have every faith in the accountants who prepared this report, some of the methods they used to determine that funding could be saved might miss the point, because such reductions in service and nursing hours care might lead to a deterioration in the fine service that this home has provided. </PARA>
<PARA> In June I visited the nursing home involved in this consultant's report, at the invitation of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), in whose electorate this nursing home is located. It had its problems. One problem was that it had raised these matters with the Minister last July and had received no response from him until January, and even then the response did not adequately address those queries. Invitations have been extended to the Minister to visit this home. I suggest that he avail himself of that invitation because it is a very important matter. The major problem facing the aged care industry at the moment is dementia. This particular home devotes itself particularly to the care of people with dementia. It provides this facility at a cost of just over $2m. At one stage it was reaching for an area of excellence in nursing care which it was hoped could be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the Minister might do as well-he has been hasty in bringing in this particular report-to give this chamber the report that was provided by the Victorian Aged Services Peak Council. As a result of a study over a selection of 27 homes it has indicated that there is a problem in the funding of aged persons homes just on a normal basis, but there is a greater and additional problem with the care of people with dementia. In this particular report to which I am referring, the aims were identified as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Identification of the impact of SAM/CAM on the quality of care in and on the viability of Victorian Nursing Homes; 2. Assembly of information about changes in Nursing Home policies, procedures or practices brought about by the new funding system; 3. Development of options under the proposed incentives funds concept for programmes which lift Nursing Home care above custodial to high quality care. </PARA>
<PARA>I will just mention briefly the impact of this report. It is just an abstract section, and four clear conclusions emerged. Firstly, under the heading `Working conditions', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Working conditions for nurses and other staff are pressured and strained, and this is already causing major stresses in the system . . . Occupational injuries are increasing. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, under the heading `Communication with residents', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A rushed atmosphere is discernible in homes which have experienced funding cuts and have accommodated these cuts by staff reductions. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, under the heading `Diminution of choice', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The overall pattern that was observable was one of paring activities back to medical and nursing necessities in a tense and pressured environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Fourthly, under the heading `Maintenance', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Major concerns emerged in the study that the maintenance of buildings and equipment was a significant casualty of reduced funding. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention this only because this report could have applied itself to the aspect of underfunding particularly in the dementia area. The Government is wasting 18 months in coming to grips with this problem by embarking on a consultancy when evidence is available within this home. Authors within the industry right around Australia have committed themselves to paper on this problem of dementia, and the conclusions that are drawn there are available. Unless the Minister addresses himself more purposefully to the funding of this dementia problem, it will not go away; it will be exacerbated and it will not be tackled within the time it should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Masonic Peace Haven Nursing Home is in my electorate. I will not canvass the broader issues that have been raised by my colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), but I would say that this issue does have a broader implication; that is, the whole question of the treatment of dementia in our community. What happened in Tasmania with regard to this home I think needs to be put into perspective. As the honourable member for Dawson pointed out, the brief statement by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) does not gel with some of the rather outlandish press statements he made after the release of this independent report. He was asked some considerable time ago by myself, by the Board and by other members of parliament, both at State and Federal level, to come to Launceston and discuss with the management of the home the difficulties that it was having with the new funding guidelines known as the care aggregate module (CAM) and standard aggregate module (SAM) arrangements. He rejected those invitations and I think that it was remiss of him to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This home enjoyed the strong support of the former Minister for Community Services, Senator Don Grimes. He, of course, was from Launceston. The community enjoyed the relationship that had developed with Senator Grimes in the provision of this home, which is the most modern in Tasmania and has the largest dementia unit in Tasmania. It is one of the largest of its type in Australia. The issue of the funding of these dementia units has to be looked at in this sense: it does not have normal nursing home requirements; the nursing home requirements and staff requirements of non-nursing staff are much greater and, therefore, cost much more than they do in normal nursing homes. What the Board was concerned about, and what every nursing home board and every member of this House should be concerned about, is that with the community rapidly ageing, life expectancies lengthening all the time and the incidence of dementia increasing, the issues that arose in Launceston have national significance. We wanted from the Minister some understanding and some capacity to deal with the issues in a sensitive way. In the end he chose to do what I believe was quite contrary to the principles he should have been following: he rejected invitations and he responded after the release of an independent report in a most cavalier fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Minister-I think it is sad that he has chosen to leave the chamber when we have been allowed only some few minutes to debate this matter-that there was in Launceston a community meeting of parliamentary leaders. Present were Labor Party members, Independent members, members of the independent Legislative Council, representatives from Senator Aulich's office and Federal politicians. A response was drafted by me, signed by these people and sent to the Minister. This is what we said:</PARA>
<PARA>We welcomed the initiative to immediately have an independent analysis of the home's financial position under the Commonwealth's complex funding formula. We wish to point out to you that all of us view with deep concern the development of a situation that would see the special 48-bed dementia unit closed. The social consequences of such a move are not acceptable to our community and we thus seek your assistance to do all in your power to forestall such an eventuality. We urge that upon the completion of the independent analysis you move quickly to discuss with the home and the State government all avenues to maintain the excellent services that are now provided. As this is Tasmania's largest specialist dementia unit to allow it to close due to a funding crisis and a seemingly alleged inflexibility of the current guidelines is an issue intolerable in a compassionate and caring community. We need your urgent help. Helpful intervention in this matter is respectfully sought and urged. </PARA>
<PARA>We got our independent report, which found that the home was providing expert care; that there were avenues where savings could be made; and that there would have to be delicate negotiations with the Hospital Employees Federation to determine staff cuts. Ten people have lost their jobs. Ten of those people are not nursing staff; two are. I think the attack the Minister made on the management of the home is despicable. It is not appreciated by members of the community which I represent, be they Labor, Liberal or Independent voters. We felt that we got no consideration from the Minister. The approach of his Canberra bureaucrats-not, I might say, of the representatives of his Department in Tasmania, who were most sympathetic and helpful at all times-is to be deplored. In my view, the person who prepared the press release for the Minister ought to be put under extreme scrutiny. If the Minister read that press release before he put it out he ought to be ashamed of himself. His allegation that there was mismanagement in that home is utterly and totally false. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my brief remarks, this is a very broad issue that all of us in this place ought to be cognisant of. This home took the only possible avenue of action that it could after having been ignored continually by the Minister for some 12 months. I believe that the steps the home is now taking to ensure that it stays open and that the 48-bed special dementia unit is able to provide people with the top flight care it is now providing is something for which all in my community are very grateful. For the Minister to come in here and make a statement that is completely contrary to the original remarks he made to the press, acknowledging that the home provides good care and ignoring the broader issues of dementia in our community, really marks him as a Minister who fundamentally does not understand the very difficult issues that this Parliament has charged him to deal with. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Commonwealth offices project, Alice Springs. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a proposal to erect an office building in Alice Springs which will provide 2,800 square metres of usable office space with underground parking. The proposal is in line with Government objectives of increasing the proportion of owned office accommodation and reducing overall costs associated with rented accommodation. At present the Commonwealth leases about 4,750 square metres of office space in Alice Springs. The proposed building of 2,800 square metres replaces space that is currently leased but is inadequate in terms of size, standard and location. The original plan was for an office building of 3,600 square metres at an estimated final cost of $9m. Further analysis of the office accommodation market in Alice Springs has indicated that the proposal needed to be reduced to 2,800 square metres as some Commonwealth agencies were suitably accommodated in leased space at a justified rental rate in the private sector. This proposition is a compromise between public sector accommodation and private sector accommodation at Alice Springs. The proposal to build the 3,600 square metre office could not be economically sustained at this time. The proposed building has capacity for a future extension when we might require it. A detailed economic analysis has shown that the proposal I have just described is a sound real estate investment against a number of parameters including construction cost, level of financial return, ongoing management costs and residual value. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of a Commonwealth centre in Alice Springs is considered essential to the provision of efficient Commonwealth services in the region. The building will also serve as the regional headquarters for areas such as Yulara, Tennant Creek, and as far north as Elliot. This proposal would allow ready access by the public to a building clearly identifiable as the focus of Commonwealth services and activity in Alice Springs. The major tenants for the proposed building are the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Commonwealth Employment Service. The building structure will have the capacity to provide an additional floor of some 1,400 square metres to cater for future expansion. Two groups within the Department of Administrative Services are involved in the project. The proposal is sponsored and will be managed by the Australian Property Group-situated within my Department-and it will be designed and built by Australian Construction Services, also situated within my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit of cost estimate at August 1989 is $5.68m and the total estimated cost on completion is approximately $7m, inclusive of fitout, escalation and fees. I have much pleasure in tabling all drawings of the proposed works and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the reference of this work to the Standing Committee on Public Works, which no doubt will consider all the implications. Nevertheless, I wish to draw to the attention of the Parliament the fact that this now brings to $550m recent construction proposals by the Commonwealth, using taxpayers' funds, primarily for new office buildings. The Opposition is concerned about this for a number of reasons. Firstly, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) advises us that industry would be subjected to interest rates at 24 per cent to slow down economic activity. Whenever the Opposition raises questions about cuts in government spending there is an immediate reference to welfare as though that were the only place where the Commonwealth could reduce its expenditure and the effect on the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly such projects as the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) keeps bringing to this Parliament almost on a weekly basis, are also areas of government expenditure that have a severe effect on the overheating of our economy. One would wonder whether, in every case, the money is warranted. The projects cover a variety of requirements. Such things as airports naturally contribute to our export effort and are to be encouraged, but a lot of the office buildings that the Government is constructing are available from the private sector and, irrespective of the Minister's view of what is reasonable by way of accommodation, they are clearly being provided at the present. No doubt the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) is deeply concerned about this matter but it is no good the Treasurer using punitive interest rates on the private sector to restrict its investment in our economy and then the Government going down the road of spending $550m to counteract that particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also notable of course that a large number of these projects, this one included, are in marginal Labor seats and one must wonder to what extent the pork barrel is at work. They are the comments I wish to make. I hope that when the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works starts considering some of these proposals, it takes into account the Treasurer's words in terms of his intention of slowing economic activity and the pressure he is putting on the private sector through interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend this reference from the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) and make a couple of comments on some of the absurd statements which have been made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I would like the previous speaker to take his statements to the Northern Territory and explain to the building and construction industry why he thinks it should not have these sorts of developments in the Northern Territory. He would know that his counterparts in the Northern Territory have a singular capacity to mismanage the Northern Territory economy. As a result, the building and construction industry is in a trough. The sorts of capital works programs that this Government has been proposing, and has announced in the last Budget, are the sorts of programs which would be an inducement to the building and construction industry in the Northern Territory to get out of its trough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would have thought that the honourable member opposite, who apparently bleeds concern for people in the business sector, would be supporting their wishes that these sorts of constructions go ahead. There is no doubt that this building will be very important for the local Alice Springs economy but it will also, as the Minister pointed out, rationalise the Government's use of office space. In that sense it is an economically sound proposition, one which ought to be supported by the Opposition and one which I think, under closer examination, the previous speaker would support totally without the derogatory remarks which he made at the conclusion of his speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This, I am mindful, is the sixteenth annual Budget which I have had the opportunity of addressing since being elected to the Parliament in 1974. I am mindful also, as a consequence of my announcement that I am not going to contest the next election, that it is the last Budget I will have an opportunity of addressing. Over that period I have enjoyed-to use the word perversely-a period in opposition and a period in government, and I am back in opposition. I have experienced the fervour, the fever, of the Whitlam period with innovative measures warmly embraced by society; the more sober-dare I say responsible-Fraser Government which fell short of the expectations of the electorate for reasons that may be argued; and now the present Government which has left its particular imprimatur on our society and on our economy. What have those three periods got in common? They have in common the harsh realisation that none of them have been able to cope in absolute terms with the problems confronting our country. They have all failed to establish confident, positive, viable, firmly based economies with prospects. They have all pursued the expectations of a society which expectations in the main have been far removed from entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again today we have the opportunity under this Appropriation Bill just to step back and have a look at our country, where we have been, where we are and where we are going. The Budget essentially addressing the revenue and outlays of the Government invites address probably on two elements, quantum and quality. Quality of course is the area in which the political parties, government and opposition, can demonstrate their particular character and the establishment of priorities as to where the outlays may be placed. By way of illustration, it is not inconceivable that some of us on this side of the House may have a predisposition or an inclination to give a greater priority to expenditure on roads, rather than pursuing funding to achieve excellence in sport. I hasten to say that I do not dismiss that activity as being without some relevance to an orderly society, but it is a question of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is the area of quality priorities which distinguish one group from another and in the fullness of time requires an electorate to make a judgment as to in whose hands the future of the country might be best placed. But the quantum is the challenging element, because in that term rests the continuing challenge: how within the resources we possess can we fairly accommodate the entitlements of the community, but worse still the expectations of the community, because there is no question of doubt that invariably a substantial gulf exists between the expectation and the entitlement--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CI4">Mr MILLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And we feed, as the honourable member for Curtin anticipates my comments, because in the nature of the democratic system governments are not free to govern wisely lest their very wisdom has them promptly dispatched from office. It is necessary to accommodate the expectation of the electorate essentially to maintain oneself in office or alternatively to attain office. That explains perhaps why there is an aura of impotence within our society and within this Parliament presently, why it is not possible for the opposition of the day to clearly establish attractive alternatives, just as it is not possible for the Government to satisfy the community that it has the solution in hand to restore the fortunes of the Australian populace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bitter irony of it all is that the fortunes which the electorate seeks to have restored, by some economic legerdemain or some irresponsibility of government of this Parliament, and which it previously enjoyed, should in fact not have been enjoyed. I do not say this out of any lack of charity or sympathy for my fellows. The realisation springs from the simple fact that we in this country, a mere 16 million people, are clawing for a toehold on this planet in competition with near 6,000 million fellow human creatures who owe us nothing. Yet we have the conceit to strut and swagger as if we are masters of our own destiny. Our fortunes rest in the manner in which we can acquit ourselves in the global marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not have to be an intellectual colossus to work out that at any one time not all nations on earth can enjoy a trading surplus. One nation's fortune becomes another nation's misfortune in economic terms. Somehow or other we seem to believe that we can ignore that truism. So in this country of ours, blessed with such incredible resource and happy circumstance, inviting exploitation in the proper use of the term, we have elected to do nothing about it, to let opportunity go by, deluding ourselves that somehow or other we had entitlements. Of course, there can be a reasonable expectation. There is a reasonable expectation that when young people marry they have a right to a house. That is a nice notion, even though, sadly, I must admit that I can recall as a child of tender years that the ambition of my aunts and uncles when approaching matrimony was to find a nice little place to rent. If they found it they were in paradise. </PARA>
<PARA> Today things have subtly changed because we have enjoyed good fortune, circumstantially. We have lost touch with reality and believe that to be the norm. We predicated all our thinking on that proposition. The reality is that these entitlements are relative. Let me give a very simple example to underpin that proposition. We are all dedicated to the proposition that we should look after our ageing population-those who, in their own and various ways, have made contributions over the years and are now in the twilight of their lives. We subscribe to the popular and supportable proposition that through welfare schemes we should support them with a pension. The Government of the day is to be congratulated for finally edging up the old age pension to 25 per cent of the average wage. I congratulate the Government. There would not be a pensioner in Australia who was not absolutely convinced that the pension was his or her unassailable entitlement. We believe that, within ordinary parameters. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, just within the last hour, this House has marked the events of 50 years ago. Is it reasonable to put up the proposition that if the enemy alluded to had invaded this country, as he could well have done so far as our military capacity to repel him was concerned, the pension cheques would have gone out a fortnight later? Would anybody have suggested that we had rights? The honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) could tell us that in his war experiences he did not even have the right to human dignity. He was subjected to the most extraordinary experiences because of that involvement, that circumstance. So when we say that we have an entitlement, it is a relative term. It is an expectation predicated on precedent or practice. They are all within our reach if we apply ourselves within the essential confines, the confines of the marketplace. In simple terms, we have to provide the right article at the right place at the right time. We must be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I had the pleasure of your company in South Korea on a parliamentary delegation last year. I would not presume to say that you could make a reciprocal comment, but you also witnessed the incredible development in growth in South Korea. South Korea has virtually dragged itself up by the bootlaces in the past 20 years-out of the rice paddies. It is going to be a creditor nation in 1991. We could talk about working conditions and say that the South Koreans work six days a week. From my observations, there were no sweatshops and the people were not exploited, but their cost of unit production was lower than ours and therefore they were able to capture the global markets. We could do that but we resile from the proposition that we should because we have become accustomed to conditions reconciling with our expectations as distinct from our entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> The choice is ours. If we want to finish up as a banana republic, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) foreshadowed a year or two ago, that is fine-if we are reconciled to the lifestyle that attaches itself to that changed environment. If instead we have a preference to legitimise and consolidate that which we have been enjoying as a consequence of our expectations, and intimidating political parties in or out of government to accommodate it, then our future is already written. There is no future. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Parliament we have a gathering of talent-at times cunningly disguised, but talent nevertheless. It grieves me, in the twilight of my parliamentary career, to see that talent dissipated and thoroughly wasted in pointless political confrontation. I am not being naive. The very nature of the profession suggests that there will always be a trial of strength. If we persist in deluding an electorate that we can restore its fortunes by some artificial economic device, by some economic legerdemain, which will free people from the requirement to measure up, to toil, to sell their talents in the marketplace and to be rewarded accordingly, we betray them. It is as simple as that. We have been betraying them because of the very nature of the democratic system in which governments are not free to govern wisely. We accommodate the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out in analogous and very simple terms-so simple as to be almost an affront to the intelligence; it is not intended to be so-that in my seventh Parliament I am convinced that there is only one point of difference between governing a country in a democracy and bringing up a family where the youngsters know in an instant what they want. The parents, hopefully having acquired a modicum of wisdom through experience, have to make a judgment essentially on two points: firstly, whether it is good for them; and, secondly, whether they can afford it. If the answer is no on either point, the youngsters instantly hate their parents' guts but they cannot vote them out at the next election. That is the only point of difference. Honourable gentlemen should ponder that. The more they ponder the more they will realise that that is the continuing frustration of trying to discharge one's responsibilities to the generations yet to come and to accommodate the reasonable expectations of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Government remains impotent to deal with the problems with which we are confronted unless it can gain the cooperation of the electorate. For the electorate to have confidence in the diagnostician, it must be given the facts. Just as the worker in the field must realise that the best job conditions on earth are not worth a crumpet if they have the effect of putting his employer out of business, he or she must have confidence in the employer and must have the facts. Workers must know how the company stands and what it is about so that we can bring our collective talents and resources together to get this country where it should have been and where it could be. If we persist in deluding ourselves that we can just snap our fingers and achieve that condition, there is no solution. </PARA>
<PARA> I say without any overtones of superiority that throughout the Whitlam and Fraser periods and now throughout the Hawke period we have shrunk from our responsibilities and perpetuated the notion that expectation is synonymous with entitlement. It rarely is. It is high time this Parliament-I use the term advisedly-came clean with the electorate. Failure to do so will ensure that this country will sink further into the mire. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) for his contribution, which was, as usual, erudite. Whilst I did not agree with everything he had to say I did have some sympathy for a great deal of it. He referred to reasonable expectations. He said that some believe reasonable expectations to be an entitlement. He said that an expectation is predicated on precedent or practice. The matter I wish to refer to during the short time I have available this afternoon goes to the heart of what the honourable member for Wide Bay has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have within the labour market reasonable expectations. Most of the Australian work force accepts that those reasonable expectations will be met within the confines of the industrial relations system. There are some, however, who have sought to have what they perceive to be their reasonable expectations seen as an entitlement which, as the honourable member for Wide Bay said, is predicated on their belief about precedent or practice. I am, of course, talking about the pilots. They have asserted an entitlement which is not a reasonable expectation by any stretch of the imagination. It is not an expectation that is shared by the rest of the Australian work force, which has been happy to play by the rules set down by the Industrial Relations Commission and which has worked actively through the trade union movement and has accepted the umpire's rules. A reasonable expectation of government might be that under the industrial relations system wage claims would be confined to a certain ceiling as a result of an agreement between the Government and the trade union movement-that is, the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> A group of people have asserted an entitlement and, unfortunately, it is based on precedent or past practice. In 1966 pilots went on strike for 28 days because they wanted a 28 per cent wage increase. In 1974 there was a further dispute when the pilots wanted a 27 per cent wage increase. On this occasion they are seeking a 30 per cent wage increase. I would not have thought it was reasonable to hold the Australian economy to ransom because of what they perceive to be an entitlement. I think the honourable member for Wide Bay was right in that sense, because the pilots have not seen what their reasonable expectation ought to be within the confines of the Australian economy and the industrial relations system. What they have said to the Australian community, the Government, the companies for which they worked and the travellers they carry is that they are not prepared to be in a system which sets reasonable expectations in terms of limits; they feel that they are entitled to go outside the system and try to negotiate a wage increase which is 25 per cent above the norm. They can have only one ultimate purpose in doing that-that is, breaking the system. Is it not a reasonable expectation of the rest of the Australian work force that those people should act responsibly and say, `We realise the implications of our action'? They have not done that. Quite the contrary: they have thumbed their nose at the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I will illustrate the implications of the pilots' actions on a small community in central Australia and outline what it will mean to that community if they pursue their actions. I am talking about my home-that is, Alice Springs. We have talked about reasonable expectations. It is a reasonable expectation of the residents of Alice Springs and travellers who wish to go there that they should be able to fly in and out. However, they cannot do so because of the absurd claim being made by the pilots which, unfortunately, seems to be supported by some sections of the Opposition, at least tacitly, by its failure to speak out against it. It is a reasonable expectation of the Australian community that Opposition members would speak out vehemently against the pilots and the threat they pose to the Australian economy, particularly the tourism industry. But we have not heard them do so. They have vindictively attacked the Government for an alleged failure to handle the dispute properly. The Australian community has a reasonable expectation-indeed, an entitlement in this instance-that the Australian Government and this Parliament should stop such absurd claims which would wreak havoc on the industrial relations system and the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of the pilots' action for their fellow Australians are yet to be estimated. However, the tourism industry in Alice Springs in the central Australian region is on its knees as a direct result of the pilots' actions. Opposition spokesmen have spoken out against using military aircraft-Royal Australian Air Force aircraft-to transport passengers. Let me inform honourable members of the net effect on Alice Springs of the use of those aircraft. Between 24 and 28 August 1989 the level of traffic carried from Alice Springs to Darwin and return was 4 per cent of its normal level. The level of traffic on the Melbourne-Alice Springs-Darwin route was 8.5 per cent of its normal level. Under normal traffic operations one would expect 2,857 passengers to be carried on the return route from Darwin to Alice Springs, but in the period mentioned the figure was 114. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder, therefore, that the airport shuttle service has closed down and all those employed on the shuttle service have been either laid off or made to go on leave? Is it any wonder that in the very near future the social security system in Alice Springs can expect an influx of 300 people upwards, seeking to gain social security benefits? Is it any wonder that car rental companies are complaining about an 80 per cent reduction in their turnover? Is it any wonder that tourism companies are experiencing a 100 per cent reduction in some cases in the level of work they are getting? Is it any wonder that places of accommodation in the Alice Springs region are suffering occupancy rates 40 to 50 per cent lower than they could normally expect at this time of the year? Is it any wonder that small operators in the Alice Springs region are extremely concerned that overseas visitors, who constitute 75 per cent of their bookings in the summer months and who should be booking now, are reluctant to do so? In fact, they have few forward bookings. So, even if the dispute ended tomorrow the results would carry over into the central Australian economy for some time to come. Is it a reasonable expectation of the residents of central Australia who are suffering from this exercise for the pilots to say, `Hey, what are we doing to the Australian community? What is the potential damage we can wreak upon the Australian economy and the airline companies which we used to work for?'. I would have thought that it is reasonable for them to do that, but apparently and unfortunately it seems that some of our friends on the Opposition benches do not. </PARA>
<PARA> I share the concern of the honourable member for Wide Bay that we should have expectations, but those expectations ought to be restricted, in this instance, by our capacity to provide. We know that in the industrial relations system in this country we have a delicate balance. It cannot and never will be able to afford increases of the type pursued by the airline pilots. I was involved in the trade union movement for many years and I would never condone scabbing on another trade unionist. However, the pilots have opted out of the system. They have resigned from their jobs. They took that foolish step and they do not have my sympathy. Their so-called leaders ought to reconsider their actions and attempt, as far as is possible, to negotiate a reasonable deal with the Australian airline companies which takes account of productivity increases-not the absurd and unreasonable expectation which they have placed upon the Australian community of a 30 per cent increase in their wage levels. </PARA>
<PARA> I share with the honourable member for Wide Bay a concern for the way in which the people of Australia perceive their entitlements. However, it is appropriate for people to have expectations. It is appropriate for people to expect governments to provide. It is appropriate for people to expect employers to provide a reasonable living wage. It is appropriate for people to expect that over a period their wages will increase as productivity increases or in some cases the cost of living increases. That is appropriate. But it is not appropriate for the airline pilots of this country to hold this nation to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time that our friends in the Opposition, including my good friend the shadow Treasurer, took their Party to account and said, `Let's unite with the Government on this issue! We cannot afford to have a protracted industrial dispute of this nature. We cannot afford to continue the sniping attack upon the way in which the Government is handling this issue for the benefit of some cheap political stunt'. The stakes are too high, and I would have thought that would be apparent to everyone, especially those on the Opposition benches who purport to represent the business community, because ultimately the people who will suffer most from this exercise, apart from the wage and salary earners dependent upon business, will be the business proprietors themselves. That is the case in central Australia. It is not unlikely, as has already been said by the Minister responsible for tourism, that we will see a number of bankruptcies in the tourism industry. It is foreseeable that a large number of people will be put out of work for a long time by these pilots. But they do not seem to have any qualms about it, and that is of concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA> If any of the pilots are listening to the broadcast of this debate, I now plead with them to go back to the negotiating table and to accept something which is reasonable, and to accept that what they are imposing on the Australian community is unacceptable. The Australian community has an expectation that the pilots should be dealt with fairly, but that they should not themselves deal with the Australian population and the Australian economy unreasonably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to add to some of my comments on the Budget in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90. On Budget night my initial reaction to the Budget was in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>When you cut through the veneer of responsibility painted by the Treasurer in this year's Budget Speech there is an overwhelming disappointment at the extent to which the Budget fails to address our fundamental economic problems.</PARA>
<PARA> It fails to develop an anti-inflationary strategy, it fails to stimulate national savings; it fails to have an effective strategy for reducing our total debt; it fails to develop an effective strategy for increasing our productivity and exports; it threatens a recession and it has no answer to the current wages break-out. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the great irony is that history will judge this Budget by the extent of its economic irresponsibility. Just when it was essential to convince our foreign creditors that we could come up with a plan of action the Treasurer failed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I said on Budget night, and here we are, 16 days after that Budget was brought down, and that document is dead in the water. Everything the Treasurer said on Budget night is now totally irrelevant. That Budget strategy has nothing to do with the economic realities of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the Opposition that is saying that; it is a number of other leading groups and institutions, not only in this country but around the world. The Reserve Bank of Australia itself has canned the Government's economic strategy. The Reserve Bank went out of its way-in a very uncharacteristic way-in its recent annual report to draw attention to the fact and to emphasise that there are risks that the present stance of policy may not lay the groundwork for winding back the current account deficit. It went on to warn that these risks will be greater in certain circumstances, including, for example, where there is a substantial slowing in world growth or where there is a decline in commodity prices or some other sort of shock to this system. One of the major shocks is under way at present: the collapse of the Government's accord and wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group to come out since the Budget and attack it, quite directly and quite explicitly, is Moody's Investors Service, which has downgraded our credit rating for the second time in three years-now to AA2, it having been AAA just three years ago. Moody's went out of its way to emphasise a number of factors in our very poor economic performance since it downgraded us last time, in September 1986. It emphasised in particular that in our relative performance with countries that were similarly listed as AA1 at that time-particularly in terms of our debt and our debt service ratio-we have fallen out of line; we have deteriorated in relative performance terms. Moody's said that it anticipates that our relative external debt position will probably worsen before it stabilises in the mid-1990s. It went on to list a number of factors of particular concern, and then, most importantly, it commented on the fact that the Government's `total policy mix' is insufficiently rigorous to balance the external accounts. Moody's questions whether the total policy mix is sufficiently rigorous to balance the external accounts. Its view, by implication, is that it is not. Then quite explicitly, it says in relation to this Budget:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Budget fails to decisively address the issues of external imbalance and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>So in the space of just 16 days the Budget's strategy has been canned by the leading economic organisation in this country, the Reserve Bank, and by a major international credit rating agency, Moody's. I was fascinated to notice the attacks on Moody's, in anticipation of this downgrading, by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and subsequently by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer on the occasion of the downgrading, calling Moody's incompetent, calling it unprofessional. Government Ministers did not worry about that; they did not take that view back in September of last year prior to the Victorian election, when the Acting Treasurer on that occasion praised Moody's and sought to quote it as an authoritative source which had given a reasonable credit rating at the time to the State of Victoria. Who knows why, but it did. So it is a double standard in relation to an organisation like Moody's. </PARA>
<PARA> But the key thing is the current pilots dispute. It is the collapse of the accord. It is the collapse of the Government's wages policy. We have seen an attempt in the course of this week by the Prime Minister to say, `This is your industrial relations system that is on trial. Let's all sit back and look at it'. As is characteristic of this Prime Minister when he is in trouble, he reveals an acute sensitivity. He always lets people know what worries him. He always lets people know where he is exposed. He always lets them know what problems he has. And his problem is that it is his wages policy that is on trial, not ours. The break-out has occurred under his wages policy-and it is not the only pressure on that wages policy. The Australian Council of Trade Unions itself has not yet accepted the recent decision of the Industrial Relations Commission, as an example. </PARA>
<PARA> Most tellingly, on Budget night, Simon Crean came out immediately the Treasurer had finished talking, saying that he was disappointed that the Budget did not have an anti-inflationary strategy. Simon is now admitting the pressure that is on him from the rank and file of the union movement, recognising that they were duped in this current wage deal. They were conned into agreeing to a deal to hold earnings growth to 6 1/2 per cent at a time when this Treasurer was forecasting that the inflation rate would fall to 4 1/2 per cent by the middle of this calendar year and 3 to 4 per cent by the middle of next year. They thought they had locked themselves into a good deal. He comes in in the Budget this time and he admits that inflation is stuck at about 7 1/2 per cent at best and that it is not going to improve much over the course of the next several years. Of course, Simon immediately comes out and says, `Well, how am I ever going to hold these guys together?' They have been done in the eye. They have accepted a deal that they know is unsustainable. The Budget puts down earnings growth numbers as 6 1/2 per cent to 7 per cent. They are already running well ahead of that and by the time this process has run its course, we will see what this accord, this special relationship the Government is supposed to have with the union movement, has really cost this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an enormous cost. We are seeing it now in terms of the impact of the pilots dispute on industry, most directly the tourism industry. Tourism accounts, I think, for nearly 500,000 jobs in this country; about $22 billion of gross expenditure; about six per cent of gross domestic product-and that it is all at risk under this Government. The truth is that the Government's Budget left this country precariously exposed to a lot of risks, as the Reserve Bank said. One of the big risks is its own wages policy coming unstuck. As we teeter on the brink of a recession this more than anything else will probably tip us over the edge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's own figuring in the Budget suggested that a recession is a possibility. The growth numbers given in the Budget, the statements made about the outturn of growth and about employment and unemployment in the course of this year clearly are consistent with the possibility of a recession in the second half of this year, with rising unemployment as a consequence of that dive in domestic economic activity. We are left on the edge of a recession. A pilots dispute or some other form of wage pressure comes along, tips the economy over the edge and drives it down. That is precisely what will happen in the course of the next 12 months unless this Government acts. </PARA>
<PARA> If we think back to the so-called special relationship the Government is supposed to have with the union movement and this wonderful document called the accord, we should not forget some of the detail of that document. When this Government came into office in 1983 the accord was the magic that it brought with it. It was the thing that was going to stop it having to fight inflation first. The accord was going to bring wage restraint and control of inflation so that the Government could go out and run a very stimulatory fiscal and monetary policy on the back of this decisive little document. </PARA>
<PARA> Within two years of that policy being adopted, in early 1985, the country had a massive exchange rate and balance of payments crisis because the whole strategy, the accord, blew the economy right out of the water. It has taken us the best part of the past three or four years to recover from the shock and disgrace of that experience. Yet here we are, again in this Budget, in a similar situation, with the threat of major economic crisis in this country in the course of the next few months because the Government has failed to deal with the problem and left us totally exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us think about the accord. Really what is it? It is a device by which the Government has elevated the Australian Council of Trade Unions-and, in particular, a couple of members of the ACTU-to Cabinet status. The Government has made the ACTU a branch of government. It has put Simon Crean and Bill Kelty in the team as effective Cabinet Ministers with veto power over a host of major economic decisions-fiscal policy and social policy decisions and decisions in the fields of education, welfare spending, training and so on. Simon Crean and Bill Kelty have an effective veto power over all that. We hear them comment on a wide range of all aspects of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The deal that has been done is, firstly, to elevate the ACTU to a position as a branch of government, as I say, with two Cabinet posts to go along with it. Secondly, it is essentially a deal to run the economy in an unsustainable way. It is a sell-out to that power of the union movement to run the economy at rates that are unsustainable, to create the environment in which unions can derive benefits and there can be rapid increases in jobs. But those rates are unsustainable. It is a sell-out of economic management in those terms. In only one year in the life of this Government have we had a situation where spending has not outstripped production. That was in 1985, the year of the exchange rate crisis that I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord is supposed to have lowered industrial disputation in this country. Where is the evidence? Industrial disputes and their costs are at record levels. Thirdly, the accord has locked us into a rate of inflation that is now stuck at about 7 or 8 per cent because it goes on doing deals. The Prime Minister said the other day, `Don't talk of deals'. It is a deal. The whole thing is a deal. The Government has locked this country into a rate of inflation that is double that of its trading partners. It is giving wage increases across the board that are unrelated to productivity and double the rate of those paid on the average by our trading partners. Therefore our inflation is locked in at rates of 7 or 8 per cent from now into the foreseeable future as a result of that deal. Some deal! Tremendous!</PARA>
<PARA> In that sense, the accord fails to address the issue of competitiveness which is fundamental to our getting out of our current economic difficulties. But, perhaps most importantly, the accord effectively represents the surrender terms of overall economic management in this country. All the key decisions that need to be taken cannot be taken because of the veto power that has effectively been given to the ACTU, sometimes with the duplicity and support of members of the parliamentary left wing of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The key issue at the present time concerns our need to increase our rate of production, to increase our productivity, to increase our exports-to trade our way out of our economic difficulties. Yet in every key area in which a decision needs to be taken the ACTU effectively blocks that decision. Think about the issues of privatisation of government enterprises; of cutting government expenditure; of reforming the tax system; of cleaning up the waterfront; of injecting competition into coastal shipping and road, rail and air transport. None of those decisions are being taken because of the effective veto power of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> The special relationship that the Government is supposed to have with the union movement is summarised in this document-this moveable feast, I should say; the goal posts have been moved so many times one loses track of what it actually stands for-but we know by its result what it stands for. It will bring this country to its knees for the second time in the life of this Government. The first time was in 1985-86 and it is about to bring this country to its knees again. The Budget is sitting there. It is totally irrelevant and has no answer to the emerging industrial relations and wage system crisis that exists at the present time. The Treasurer has boasted many times in this Parliament. He has attacked us and belittled us with the argument that, `If you can't run wages in this country, then you can't run the country'. He will be damned out of his own mouth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), I wonder exactly what he is on about. I am not quite sure whether he was here to talk about the Australian economy or simply to give a recitation of the concealed economic policies of the Opposition, which the Australian people have been seeking to obtain for some months. For the whole of this sitting week in this Parliament there has not been one question asked by the shadow Treasurer of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on issues that one would have expected a shadow Treasurer to canvass. There has not been one question about the assessment by Moody's Investors Service Inc. of the economic performance of this country or any of the major issues which the Treasurer has addressed. There has not been one question on any of the Budget papers or the appropriations by this Government to ensure the continued stability and growth of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After listening to some of the speeches by Opposition members and after listening to the Treasurer and studying the Treasurer's documents, I am convinced that the Australian people are well satisfied that this Government, through its Budget, is putting the well-being of the Australian people first. This Budget proclaims a sense of national purpose. It is a sensible and prudent Budget, combining social justice and economic responsibility. It is testimony to the unflinching resolve of the Hawke Government in its crucial mission of good government for all Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Whenever I have the opportunity to comment on the many economic achievements and triumphs of the Hawke Government, I am compelled to recall the economic record of the Liberal and National parties in government. Who can ever forget those disastrous seven years of economic stagnation, negative economic growth, high interest rates, double digit inflation, high unemployment, high deficits and, above all, a resigned hopelessness among the Australian people who believed that the Liberal and National parties were dragging them down to the level of a third world country?</PARA>
<PARA> Wherever I go in my electorate my constituents share with me these sombre recollections. They spontaneously vow that never again do they want that bunch on the other side of the House to have the opportunity of wrecking their personal savings, destroying the job opportunities of their children, and squandering Australia's reputation for economic rectitude. They do not want to relive the Fraser Government years. When I look across this chamber I see many Liberal and National Party members who were part of the Fraser Government years. Since the defeat of the Fraser Government they have said nothing in this House that would lead even their closest supporters to believe that anything would be different were they to regain power. The Liberal and National parties have learnt nothing; they have forgotten nothing. When challenged to reveal to the Australian people their economic policies for the 1990s they retreat; they seek to confuse; they avoid close examination of their policies. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no substitute for honest, credible, clean Labor government. Cynical and deceptive government-the dark side of politics-is what we see in Queensland. It should have no place in the administration of this nation's affairs. The fact is that the Liberal and National parties are masters of making and breaking promises. Tax cuts were never part of their economic repertoire while they were in government. Families, particularly those on fixed incomes, bore the burden of their economic mismanagement, while tax avoidance, cheating and a collapse in public morality flourished under their neglect. To discover the face of Liberalism under this Opposition one need look only to the face of Liberalism under the Fraser Government. Those were the years of division and despondency; those were the years of social inequality, social strife, industrial confrontation, tax cheating and pervading unfairness. The Hawke Government has turned around the prospective $9.6 billion deficit that this Government inherited and has created two successive Budget surpluses. The consensus and cooperation of the Hawke Government has revitalised Australia's economic health, restored Australia's reputation overseas and, above all, awakened the Australian people to pride in themselves and their country and the opportunities for greatness which this nation has to offer. </PARA>
<PARA> In my speech on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 I would like to refer to one item in the Budget which is of fundamental importance to this nation. I firmly believe that the primary responsibility of any Australian Government is to provide the nation with the armed force capability to defeat an armed attack and also to ensure the nation's capacity to live in peace, to have freedom and independence and not to be constrained by the threat of attack. I said it was a primary responsibility of government to provide for the adequate defence of the nation. In my view, this responsibility takes precedence over any other responsibility of government. The Hawke Government is seeking to maintain and develop capabilities for the independent defence of Australia and its interests. It has sought to promote strategic stability and security in our region. As a member of the ANZUS alliance, Australia continues to fulfil its role as a loyal and responsible member of the Western strategic community. In this regard, this nation owes a debt of gratitude to the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley). </PARA>
<PARA> This year defence outlays will increase by 6.5 per cent to more than $8.3 billion, or about 9.6 per cent of Government Budget outlays. Key priorities in this expenditure include the ongoing commitment to improved conditions for service personnel and their families and the continuation of the major re-equipment program of the Australian Defence Force. The provision of good standard accommodation for married and single personnel retains priority. Capital facilities such as the continued expansion of the Defence Force presence in Townsville and the increased role of HMAS Stirling benefit from major spending in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget also includes provision for continuing payments against major re-equipment projects. For example, it provides $488m for the construction of six submarines, with the first submarine due to be delivered in 1995. It provides $213m for the purchase of 75 FA18 aircraft and associated equipment. Sixty-two aircraft have been delivered and the remaining 13 aircraft are planned to be delivered this year. It provides $153m for the construction of two guided missile frigates at Williamstown in Victoria. It provides $198m for the acquisition of 16 Seahawk helicopters for the operation of FFG frigates. It provides $55m for the development and production of radios for manpack and vehicle mounted and ground station capability. In 1988-89, this project progressed towards the achievement of a build standard of high frequency radio acceptable to the Australian Defence Force and particularly to the personnel of the operational deployment force based at Townsville. In 1989-90, it is planned to commence the introduction of high frequency radios to Australian Army units. At the same time, production of high frequency and very high frequency radios will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget also provides $51m for the purchase of 39 Black Hawk helicopters. Thirteen aircraft had been delivered to the end of 1988-89 and a further 13 are planned for delivery in 1989-90. These aircraft are in full operational service with 5 Aviation Regiment stationed in Townsville. It provides $43m for replacing the Army's land rovers and land cruisers with 2,900 new light field vehicles. It provides $25m for the development and upgrading of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar. In 1989-90, tenders will be evaluated and a contract awarded for the construction of the first major radar elements of the Jindalee operational radar network in 1990. This will be built in the electorate of my good colleague the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). The Budget provides $25m to upgrade the avionics of the F111C and its reconnaissance version by replacement of analog avionics with digital avionics and modernised existing radars. This is a long overdue project. </PARA>
<PARA> One decision, however, has caused concern and anxiety. This is the decision to disband the Chinook helicopter squadron with effect from 25 August 1989. The 1987 Defence White Paper called for highly mobile ground forces. Exercise Kangaroo 89 vitally demonstrated this requirement. The Chinook helicopter is a twin rotor helicopter operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. It is a twin engine helicopter capable of lifting up to 22,000 pounds within a 100 kilometre radius-that is, loaded out and unloaded return-and with lesser weights up to a 250 kilometre radius. While the `D' model-a remanufactured and modernised version of the `C' model which is owned by Australia-in the long range version carries 13,000 pounds, or 6,000 kilograms, to a radius of 460 kilometres, its ferry capability on internal fuel tanks carries about 1,000 nautical miles and much more with external fuel tanks. The Chinook can carry 44 troops seated and in an emergency as many as 80, as happened in the Falklands war. It is an ideal and rapid troop mover and it can carry internal and slung loads. </PARA>
<PARA> The Black Hawk helicopter, one of the best helicopters in the world, has one-third of the lift capability of a Chinook. For planning purposes it has a radius of action of 160 kilometres at 120 knots cruise, with a load of 10 fully equipped troops and their accoutrements in the troop movement mode, or a load of up to 6,000 pounds in the resupply mode-that is, food, water, ammunition, lubricants, or even a 105 Hamel gun. The Black Hawk helicopter consumes 1,100 pounds of fuel per hour. It has a fuel capacity of 2,500 pounds and therefore uses nearly one tonne of fuel for a mission. </PARA>
<PARA> There are enough Black Hawks to move an infantry company in one lift. But the primary task of the Black Hawk helicopter is to move troops, supplies and guns in the combat zone within a radius of 160 kilometres of a supply point. From this point it draws its own fuel supply and supplies ammunition for the troops and fuel for light observation helicopters operating in the region and for vehicles in the combat area. Movement further afield requires the setting up of a forward supply point, and Black Hawks alone cannot do this job. The task of refuelling the Black Hawks themselves, as well as supplying their customers, or their users, requires the lift capability of the Chinooks and that thereby enables operations to proceed based on a forward supply point up to 250 kilometres from the initial one. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the sort of situation which could easily obtain in a northern Australian setting, particularly in a wet and hostile terrain. If the Army were to try to do this without Chinooks I believe we could quickly reach the situation where the Black Hawks spend much of their effort in refuelling themselves, because it takes 12 Black Hawks to refuel themselves along with the other eight, making up to 20 on-line Black Hawks if the radius of action is doubled out. Two Chinooks can refuel 20 Black Hawks. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Chinook can do that other military helicopters cannot do is this: it can recover a downed Black Hawk; fundamentally important, it can lift engineer bulldozers of D4 standard; it can lift all terrain forklifts; and it can lift heavier containerised communications equipment. It is the only helicopter in Australia that can lift the 155 millimetre medium gun. It can lift an M113 armoured personnel carrier, and it can quickly lift ship to shore tonnage and large numbers of troops. Three Chinooks can carry an infantry company; one Chinook can deploy 44 troops 250 kilometres; and four Chinooks can deploy 880 troops over 75 kilometres in three hours. In exercise Kangaroo 89, it would have taken 40 hours to deploy a battalion from Kununurra to Kalumburu, on the coast, using Black Hawks, as opposed to 13 hours with Chinooks-so the Black Hawks take three times as long over a distance of 260 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA> There are nearly $87m worth of Chinook spares in Australia and I understand that more spares have arrived recently. Included in the holding are 33 uprated engines or kits for the D models that Australia should have, and a number of fibreglass blades for the D models. Indeed, 20 per cent of the C spares fit the D model. To be highly mobile, that is air mobile, and to be able to operate over the large distances of Australia and its territories, the range and lift capabilities of the Chinook are a necessity. Otherwise movement is slowed; reaction times extended; and more troops and supporting resources are required to do the same job. If these are not made available-and they are costly-then capability is significantly reduced. If helicopter supported operations are to take place more than 160 kilometres from a supply point, Chinooks are needed to ensure full support. If these Chinooks are disposed of, more Black Hawks will be needed in lieu, accepting that heavy loads beyond Black Hawk capability are denied in the battle area. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to retain six Chinooks to convert them to D models, which was advocated to the Government by the Army, and to sell the rest is not an answer. The Army needs 11 Chinooks. It needs eight operational Chinooks and three for crew training and for maintenance. The decision to dispose of the Chinook helicopters from operational duty in the Australian defence forces is, in my view, fundamentally wrong and it ought to be rescinded immediately. The 1987 Defence White Paper stressed and declared that Australia must have an effective air mobile capability-and I stress effective air mobile capability-in the combat area if it is to move its ground forces effectively. Australia's 11 Chinooks must be retained and refurbished. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to Australia's program of assistance in the development of the capabilities of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. This year, in this Budget, the defence cooperation appropriation has increased by more than 47 per cent. In my view the task of developing the capabilities of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force should be an urgent priority of this Government. I urge the Government to provide increased opportunity for individual and group training of Papua New Guinea Defence Force personnel both in Australia and in Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not satisfied, on the information available to me, that the Papua New Guinea Defence Force does have a fully trained and fully professional defence force capable of serving the nation to its best capacity. While I acknowledge that there is an urgent need for major and minor equipment development in the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, the fundamental priority must be the maintenance of a professional, disciplined and highly skilled Papua New Guinea Defence Force. Otherwise the day may very well come when Australian troops may be required to serve those tasks that should be performed by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note from the Budget Papers that there has been a substantial increase in the defence cooperation appropriation for certain South Pacific countries. This is an area of strategic interest for Australia which can no longer be treated simply as a recipient of Australian aid. Australia is and must continue to be a primary source of defence assistance and a respected partner with South Pacific nations in regional security issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The time limited to me in this debate is coming to a close, but I simply repeat the issues that I have stressed to the Parliament in my speech: this Budget presented by the Treasurer serves Australia's national purpose and no amount of carping, or the unbridled, ill-founded criticism levelled at it, can take away one iota from the fact that it will serve the Australian people and regain their economic confidence. It will ensure that the Hawke Government's continuing efforts to achieve economic reconstruction will place Australia on a sound, first class footing for economic success in the 1990s and the years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget this year was delivered in sombre tones by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), and well it might have been because it was a very sad and inadequate document. It was in fact a classic wasted opportunity. This year's Budget failed on just about every count. It failed to address the problems of the Australian economy in the same way as the Treasurer failed to address our economic problems in his six previous Budgets. Labor is still, after six years in power, the highest taxing, highest spending government in the history of this country. This Government, under Treasurer Keating, is locked into policies that have resulted in high interest rates, high overseas debt-rising daily-high inflation and the highest current account deficit on record, and there is simply no relief in sight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer, in his Budget Speech, promised us more of the same. He referred to a continuation of high interest rate policies and predicted high inflation. But he did not highlight one statistic, and that is the statistic that in fact predicts rising unemployment. He knows it, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) knows it, and they know the consequences of it for the Australian community. Unfortunately this year's Budget locks us further into the path towards a banana republic. We are going down the Argentinean road, as predicted by the Treasurer, and he has no answers to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Budget was delivered in this place there have been a number of significant developments. The latest was our foreign debt figures, issued just a few days ago, and they confirm our worst fears. Australia's gross foreign debt is now $135 billion. Our net foreign debt is $108 billion. These figures have risen from a net foreign debt of just $23 billion when this Hawke Labor Government first came to power, and it is one of the most shocking legacies that the Prime Minister and his cronies will be leaving the Australian people when they lose office at the next election. Foreign debt is now 32 per cent of our gross domestic product. It was 13.8 per cent under the previous coalition Government. This Budget will do nothing to improve our foreign debt position. In fact, it will be worsened and that worsening has been acknowledged by the Treasurer in his forecasting of a current account deficit of $18.5 billion for the coming year. That is his estimate, and with the current pilots strike that is likely to blow out considerably further. I will be having something to say about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> The second event that has occurred has been the further downgrading by Moody's Investors Service of our international credit rating on 29 August. That was not a novel event, nor a new event, and let me say it was not unexpected. This Government has an appalling, unique record. One hears Government members chant the rhetoric that they have been fed at Caucus meetings, but they do not chant the Government's record in some areas. In September 1986 Moody's Investors Service downgraded Australia's credit rating from AAA to AA1. In December 1986 Standard and Poor's Corporation downgraded our rating from AAA to AA+, and in August this year we went from AA1 to AA2. We can only speculate how long it will be before we move to AA3 under this Government. Unless the Treasurer recognises that his Budget settings are totally inappropriate for our circumstances, that is an inevitable event. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer does not have a very good record on Budgets. Everyone remembers last year's discredited `bring home the bacon' Budget. Let us spend some time examining the Treasurer's five previous Budgets. His first Budget, for 1983-84, was supposed to achieve the joint objectives of fighting inflation and unemployment simultaneously. We all know what happened to inflation. We know where we stand in comparison to our Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development partners. In the 1984-85 Budget we were promised `an historic opportunity to embark upon a new growth path' which would `consolidate and strengthen the economic recovery'. Five years later, our economy is sicker than ever. The only thing that has been consolidated is our status as a Third World nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1985-86 Budget we were told about the economic trilogy. Do you remember the trilogy, Mr Deputy Speaker? There was a commitment that there would be no new increased sales taxes or excises and no increases in income tax rates. We were told that the Government would not increase the percentage of tax revenue above the 1984-85 share of tax in the total economy. If that was the Government's intention, why in 1985-86, did total Commonwealth tax revenue increase by 11 per cent over the 1984-85 figure? Why, in 1985-86, did total individual tax revenue increase by 11.7 per cent over the previous year? Why was the total level of taxation as a percentage of our gross domestic product in 1985-86 basically the same as it was in 1984-85? And it has been higher ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1986-87 Budget we were told that all of our mounting economic problems had been caused by `the dramatic collapse in world commodity prices since late last year'. It was all the fault of overseas factors. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister said, `Don't blame us; it is the fault of people overseas'. They said that it had nothing to do with failed domestic economic policies. The 1987-88 Budget continued to hammer away at the problems being faced because of our international trading difficulties. According to the Treasurer at that time, all of that was under control. The current account deficit for the year would fall to about $11.5 billion and by the middle of 1988 inflation would be about 6 per cent. He failed in that regard. We know exactly what happened with those forecasts. The current account deficit for 1987-88 was $11.8 billion, and inflation for the year was 7.3 per cent. That was the beginning of the Treasurer's bodgie forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1988-89 Budget, of course, was the one which was supposed to `bring home the bacon'-and what lousy quality bacon it was! The Treasurer promised:</PARA>
<PARA>This year our balance of payments will be halved from its peak of just three years ago and our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. </PARA>
<PARA>The inaccuracy, ineptitude and, dare I say, falseness of the Treasurer's forecasts were really brought home in last year's Budget. The inflation forecast of 4.5 per cent was nothing short of laughable. The actual figure was 7.7 per cent. The current account deficit forecast of $9.5 billion was actually $17.7 billion-only to be exceeded by his forecast for this year of $18.5 billion. Foreign debt, far from stabilising or falling, has reached a new record of $108 billion. Any self-respecting accountant who was that far out in his Budget forecasts would resign, and the Treasurer should do so. Our Treasurer has the hide of an African elephant. He is bouncing back from those rubbery figures. He tells us in the 1989-90 Budget that last year inflation was too high and that the balance of payments did not fall as expected. Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that every pensioner in this country, everybody on a fixed income, everybody suffering under this Government's wages policy, knows that inflation was too high. When that inflation impact is compounded by this Government's tax policies, we know exactly what the impact on living standards is. </PARA>
<PARA> This Treasurer really does not know where he is going. He has highlighted Australia's problems in the Budgets that he has brought down, but he has not been able to address them. In fact, his record has been based on a continued and consistent approach of higher taxation to veneer over his failure to address the structural problems of this economy. When it comes to tax, the Treasurer's record is nothing short of appalling. When we look at the detailed forecasts for this year we see exactly how much more the Australian community will be paying to Consolidated Revenue under the Treasurer's continuing tax policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Since coming to power almost seven years ago this Government has increased total Commonwealth tax revenue by nearly 106 per cent. That is an appalling achievement. It has increased total individual tax revenue by nearly 108 per cent over the same period. Company tax revenue has increased by nearly 163 per cent; prescribed payments revenue has increased by a massive 537 per cent; petrol excise revenue has increased by 186 per cent; and, at the same time, road funding has fallen by 30 per cent in real terms. Customs import revenue has increased by 74 per cent and the revenue from the Medicare levy has increased by 612 per cent over the past six years. Revenue from the fringe benefits and capital gains taxes for each year since they were implemented has increased by 105 per cent and 432 per cent respectively, and revenue from the debits tax has increased by 113 per cent. In short, year after year this Government has increased its revenue from taxation virtually across the board. It is the Australian public that is paying; it is the Australian wage and salary earner who is feeling the impact of these rising taxes. The Treasurer, far from being the world's greatest Treasurer, is in fact Australia's highest taxing Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> This year everybody will be hurt by the Keating economic prescription, but people who live in regional and rural Australia will be savaged more than most. Let us look at the details of what this Budget offers rural and regional people: absolutely nothing. Rural and regional Australia has not just been ignored; it will go further backwards. As I have said, road funding has fallen by 30 per cent since Labor came to power. This Budget does nothing to rectify the appalling road conditions in country Australia. Our tourist roads continue to fall to pieces. Recently I drove from Mackay to Townsville on what we describe as Highway 1. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the major tourist road running through north Queensland in the electorate of Dawson. That road is nothing short of a disgrace. It is irresponsible of us to encourage overseas tourists to travel on that road. Our export roads are in a similar condition. There may be just one silver lining in this appalling pilots strike that we have at present as a result of the belligerent and aggressive attitude of the Prime Minister and the inadequacies of the wages and incomes policy of this Government; that is, it may be that enough people are forced to travel on our roads so that pressure is applied on the Government and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) to increase the allocation of road funding in the next Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, in addition to not doing anything about roads, has again cut local government funding and, worse still, has slashed it by more than the amount projected in the April statement. In reality, this means that rates in rural and regional Australia will have to increase-and that will be another charge on individuals and businesses in the community-or the standard of services will have to be cut. That will compound the declining standard of living. On top of that, there is the amazing situation and short term approach by the Government, whereby the Commonwealth has opted out of drought funding to the tune of $17m this year, with a further projected cut in excess of $20m for next year. What is more, it has removed drought aid from the natural disaster relief arrangements. Drought requirements for 1989-90 will be funded through the rural adjustment scheme. That shows a complete lack of understanding of the significance of drought to our rural economy and, I would suggest, is a very short term approach to the real needs of an industry which is vital if we are to address the massive current account deficit that the Treasurer is forecasting. </PARA>
<PARA> While it might be fair to say that a drought in the current circumstances seems unlikely, it is not the sort of thing that we can afford to ignore or be unprepared for. Droughts are unpredictable, their consequences are severe, and to not have in place a policy prescription to deal with them is nothing short of irresponsible. The airport local ownership plan, which is so important to the development of regional Australia, has also been abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government's policies there has been a continuation of the shocking treatment of pharmacists throughout Australia. If one lives cosily and comfortably in Canberra, as many of the Ministers do, or in the capital cities of this country, then perhaps one does not understand the significance of pharmacists to the community. They are a major contribution to the standard of health care throughout rural and regional Australia. When a doctor is not available-and there is a scarcity of doctors throughout the Australian community, which will be exacerbated by the proposals of the Government for a vocational register-people resort to a chemist for help. Under the proposals of this Government there will be less opportunity because there will be fewer chemists. Those chemists who do survive will not be able to open the hours that are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> In some communities-this may not be apparent to many on the Government side-when doctors are not available people seek the advice of chemists. I spoke to someone in my own electorate the other day whose daughter was running a temperature of 103 degrees. There was no doctor available and there was no chemist available because they were closed. Under the Government's proposals the hours of chemists will be cut back even further. That is the standard of care, compassion and recognition of the realities of life in Australia that exists within this Government at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's high interest rate policy and high inflation policies are severely affecting the farming community. The inflationary impact of freight charges is particularly savage. Of course, the Australian Labor Party has no interest in taking into account the impact of these policies on rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few moments remaining to me, I would like to comment on the Moody's downgrading of our credit rating and refer in some detail to the justification that it expressed in its latest assessment of the economy. As the Treasurer would have us believe, Moody's is not some obscure group overseas that has no credibility. Moody's is a well-respected international rating agency that is regarded very seriously by the international financial community. High gradings by Moody's are sought after and valued by its customers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Moody's is not infallible, but it has got it right three times. It keeps moving our credit rating down in line with the decline in the Australian economy. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) knows that the capacity of the Australian economy to cope with the changing international economy is being reduced day by day and week by week. He knows that his Government's policies have failed abysmally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button said it for the entire Australian community on television and the Minister who is at the table knows that. He knows that he has failed to achieve any implementation of the policies. He understands rightly that the Government has not grasped the dire need for Australia's economy to become modern and to come to grips with the new technology. Let me just quote exactly why Moody's downgraded our credit rating. The factors that Moody's considers crucial to its lowered rating include the following: firstly, the Government's in- ability to control excessive demand growth. The Treasurer has spoken to us about that, but he has not put it in the terms that the objective assessors of Moody's have done-inability to control, failure to act. Unpreparedness to change its policy prescriptions, is another way that it could be described.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point that Moody's makes-I think it is made in a very gentle way-is that there has been insufficient progress in generating additional export earning capacity and in restructuring industry to achieve productivity gains. That is what Senator Button said-the policies have failed. When the Minister responsible acknowledges that his policies have failed, he cannot condemn a rating agency for coming to the same conclusion. The third point that Moody's makes-this is the most crucial point and it is the greatest condemnation of this Government's total and abject failure-is that continued slow pace of structural adjustment has continued, which makes Australia ill-positioned to weather the next downturn in the global business cycle without further large increases in foreign currency debt. Heaven only knows how much higher our debt has to go before this Government will recognise the inappropriateness of its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier, I spoke of the size of our foreign debt and its growth over the past six years, but here we have Moody's predicting a further growth. The reality is that this Government has policy paralysis. It cannot take the decisions that need to be taken because it is captive of the Labor movement in the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is operating to a political agenda and is not aware, nor does it care, about the consequences of its policies or their inaction on the Australian community. Under Treasurer Keating and Prime Minister Hawke we will continue our decline towards banana republic status. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not uncommon to hear about cynicism in the electorate-I think everyone knows what I am talking about-lack of confidence in the political process, disillusion engendered perhaps by disappointed expectations, and a general view that politicians are self-serving and governments are ineffective in making a better society for the people they are elected to serve. It is not uncommon to hear about that. It is no wonder, with the sorts of things that the Opposition comes out with, that that sort of cynicism is engendered. I will interrupt myself here to make the point that the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) actually talked about having more tax revenue, completely ignoring the fact that we have more tax revenue because we have had more growth, more jobs, more people paying tax, and more investment. He completely ignores and completely fails to tell the Australian public that growth has doubled in the five years under the Australian Labor Party but that it has lowered personal taxes. The sort of thing that engenders the cynicism in the electorate is the absolute failure to acknowledge government achievements. I will stop talking for a moment about the extraordinary statements from the members of the Opposition masquerading as analysts of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This cynicism is not unusual; it is not rare for it to happen, it happens all the time. To a certain extent it is inevitable and it is not a bad thing. Members of the public should be questioning and demanding things of us. They put us here to do things for them and we ought to be doing that. As I said a moment ago, it is also pretty important for the public to take time to assess and to analyse what is being achieved in relation to tax and to acknowledge that, while the media attention goes only to party political point scoring and perhaps the performance or the non-performance of individuals, the Government is actually getting on with the job and, in our case, working towards the social justice goals that we have set ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been happening is pretty impressive. I am not sure how many people realise the extent of some of the reforms that have been taking place in recent years and are being implemented by this Budget. What is actually occurring in the area of social justice is far more substantial than the community has yet realised. When people analyse what is happening they will understand that our Government is about real reform. I will refer to a few areas where reform has taken place. How many people still do not realise that their children in years 11 and 12 can get Austudy which was not available to them before? There has been a revolutionary reform in the child support scheme-one can never go back to what was there before-which has totally revolutionised the appalling situation in relation to child maintenance that existed until now. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should think about what has happened in the area of sole parents. Reforms have been occurring in Budget after Budget after all the analysis that our Government put into the plight of sole parents through the Social Security Review. In regard to the aged, there have been genuine and long lasting reforms as well as a whole policy for the future of the aged. What is happening with children? Members of the Opposition constantly remind us of what we have committed ourselves to do for the children of Australia. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), in answer to a question yesterday, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Brotherhood of St Laurence went on to acknowledge that for the first time in this country's history we have a system of guaranteed minimum income for children . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Five hundred thousand families and more than one million children are now benefiting from the Government's assistance-the sort of assistance that we have been gradually improving Budget after Budget. I make the point that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) made yesterday: the only thing we have heard from the Opposition is that it is prepared to slash $1 billion off the social security budget. Will it take it from the children or will it take from the aged?</PARA>
<PARA> What has been happening to the aged in the last few years? I will begin with what has happened in the Budget we are now addressing. Our commitment to an age pension of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings will actually be exceeded in April next year. On top of the normal indexation increase next April there will be an increase of $2 a week for single pensioners and $3.30 a week for married pensioners. That has been derided by the Opposition. I heard members of the Opposition call out, `Two dollars a week; so what!'. Putting $2 a week on the pension will cost $300m a year. All honourable members opposite have talked about is slashing $1 billion from the social security budget. Because of indexation, the biggest area of reform that has been carried through to so many other areas, that increase will be locked in, in real terms. In other words, we will not have a fight in every Budget debate about this increase; it is locked in. </PARA>
<PARA> Rent assistance will be increased substantially-a real reform for the majority of Australians living in rented accommodation, certainly in my electorate. The maximum rate of rent assistance will increase by an additional $10 a week and, from March 1991, it will be automatically indexed. Since June 1989 rent assistance will have increased by 100 per cent for those people without children and by September 1990 it will have increased by over 150 per cent for those people with children. That shows this Government's commitment to the people who need help most. As a matter of fact, at the moment over 320,000 age and service pensioners are receiving rent assistance. The majority of these pensioners have little income other than their pension. That is usually the case for people in rented accommodation. In most cases, rent accounts for over one-third of their income. So a 100 per cent or 150 per cent increase in rent assistance will make a substantial difference to those people. More importantly, our long-term retirement income policy is getting into place, and that will assist and encourage people especially to save for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> From July 1991, the indexation of the pension income test free area will make an enormous difference. That will remain tax free. There will be a simplification of tax arrangements for pensioners. From 1995 no age or service pensioner will pay income tax. As a co-convener of the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes, I know that that and catching up on the consumer price index lag-which we did-are what most pensioners asked for. Of course, we have also improved access to and the adequacy of superannuation. Those ongoing improvements are part of our long-term retirement income policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the youth social justice strategy in this Budget. Over the next four years there will be a $100m expansion of the Government's youth social justice strategy. That is not bad. I think someone ought to take some notice of that. An additional 6,000 homeless young people will have access to secure accommodation. Homeless children are a matter of concern for every Australian. We have now begun the process of helping them. There will be a $7.50 a week increase in the maximum rate of the young homeless allowance and related Austudy payments and more effective labour market assistance to help disadvantaged young people enter the work force. In the health area there are new initiatives in this Budget for disadvantaged young people in high risk areas, as well as other measures to help young people. </PARA>
<PARA> An ongoing area of concern for all working families is child-care. Low income families will now have greater access to child-care because the fee relief will be increased and indexed into the future. Again, indexation is locking in a reform that we have brought in. Of course, the Opposition will have a great debate about whether government should be involved at all in this area of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> We have increased real funding for disability services and especially pilot projects which will establish what processes will best encourage those with disabilities into independence and employment. A new long-term Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy is about to be formulated which will provide full equity of access, participation and education outcomes for Aboriginal Australians. A number of new measures will help the older unemployed and there is an increase in the unemployment benefit for people aged 60 to 64. There will be expanded labour market assistance for long-term unemployed people aged 55 to 64. We have strengthened residential rights for the aged and people with disabilities in nursing homes and hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> All the things I have mentioned that have been brought in in this Budget are evidence of this Government's ongoing commitment to its social justice program. In fact, our achievements since 1983 have addressed all four major requirements that are needed if we are to call our society socially just or in any way working towards a form of social justice. As we have often said, these are: the need for a fair and equitable distribution of income; the protection and enhancement of an individual's rights; an assurance of fair and equitable access to essential community services; and the opportunity to participate in the decision making processes of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have been saying during my short speech, there has been a significant redistribution of income towards low to moderate income earners, particularly those in the 50 to 75 per cent of average weekly earning bracket-an enormous achievement in that area. Those on age and service pensions have also been assisted greatly. The measures announced in this Budget build on these social justice achievements, particularly the major reforms to index the income support measures. Social justice is an ongoing process. This Government has created 1 1/2 million jobs since 1983 and it has brought in what I still regard as the greatest reform of any government-that is, Medicare. Our social justice program is an ongoing one and is well on track. I commend it to the House. Mr Speaker, I also take this opportunity to offer you my congratulations. </PARA>

It has always been recognised by Presiding Officers that occasionally visitors will use the galleries as a venue for peaceful but noisy demonstrations. These actions would be deplored by all honourable members.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much indeed, Mr Speaker. I do not wish to spend more than passing moments on the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), but I say to the honourable member that when she lauds all these programs that her Party has introduced and says how they are meeting a social need, she should remember that a lot of the people who are now in need have been placed in need by her Party. Her philosophical direction is that the Government knows best. The Government, by its taxation levels and the like, has made a lot of previously independent people now dependent upon the Government. That is what it has done; so the honourable member should not come in here popping out her chest to tell us how marvellous the programs have been, because this country is in ruination. The entire world judges us in that light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight's discussion is a continuation of the debate on the Budget Speech. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) told this place on 15 August that the people of Australia are looking for the meat rather than the feathers. Ha, ha! He also told us that this Budget will fulfil that national purpose. From that moment I started to wonder whether the Treasurer had properly addressed the economic issues which are causing Australians greatest concern. During the month of July I sent every household in my electorate of Moreton a Fair-Go survey asking them to rate a range of economic issues in order of concern to them. The results from the first 1,050 surveys returned to me have now been collated. The answer was loud and clear: the average Australian is very concerned about foreign debt, taxation levels, interest rates, inflation, and the standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Had these concerns been addressed by the Treasurer on 15 August? I sifted through the mass of the Budget Speech, the Budget Papers, the Budget statements and the special issue statements. What did I find? What would anyone find? I found gloss; I found hype; I found Keating-speak; I found self-adulation; I found the world's greatest `this and that'. But in terms of the economic issues concerning my constituents, and indeed the people of Australia, I found nothing. There were no solutions, no long term strategy, not even a realistic recognition of the significance of these problems. Respondents to my Fair-Go survey were asked whether they believed Australia was heading in the right direction. Seven per cent said yes; 93 per cent said no. In every age category, dissatisfaction with the way in which this country is heading was above 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are traditionally optimistic, but the `she'll be right' attitude has disappeared under this Government. As Rome burns, the Treasurer has done enough `she'll be right' to last all of us for a good many years. However, he cannot continue to ignore this overwhelmingly gloomy assessment by the people who are this nation's future. Real, non-fiddled, inflation is so close to double digits it does not matter. Month after month, we have record current account deficits; foreign debt is through the roof and rising; mortgage interest rates are at record high peace time levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The nine issues which I asked Fair-Go respondents to rate in order of concern to them were: foreign debt, inflation, interest rates, health, lack of incentive, standard of living, retirement income, taxation and unemployment. Foreign debt received the most No. 1 responses, both overall and in every age category except the 18 years to 29 years group where it rated second behind interest rates. Is there any wonder about that? The community sees that everything it buys is made overseas. It sees more and more of this country being sold to overseas buyers, and the Government's reaction as an election approaches is: `Do not blame us, it is the private sector's debt'. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Treasurer's reaction when Australia's credit rating is dropped yet another notch? It is: `They are wrong. They do not know what they are talking about'. Indeed, I say to the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table, that a proud achievement of the Labor Government is that we are now on a par with Spain. In the absence of the Treasurer let me say that from this survey I know exactly what my electorate is talking about and what it is thinking about. Gallivanting around the world paying back parcels of Government debt will not solve our foreign debt problems. That is what my constituents are saying. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Grim Reaper did not escape unscathed in the results of the Fair-Go survey. Taxation levels received the second highest score overall and deservedly so. Bracket creep has sent workers on below average weekly earnings into tax brackets that were once preserved for the rich and the very rich. New superannuation taxes will reap $1.5 billion annually. Since March 1983, total tax revenue has risen 120 per cent from $41 billion to $91 billion. In the same period cumulative inflation was at 54.5 per cent. During the same period total fuel excise revenue has gone up 482 per cent whilst road funding has dropped 30 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot keep its hands out of the people's pockets. Capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, unfair provisional tax-the list goes on and on. What is the Treasurer's Budget reaction to this plethora of unfair tax imposts on the Australian community? It is a sickly gloat about what he terms `the most generous tax cuts in this country's history'. In reality these tax cuts will leave the average family some $56 worse off by the end of this year than it was in 1983. We also heard of massive increases in the company and pay as you earn tax take. But in terms of respite for the tax ravaged Australian, all we had from the Treasurer was a stony silence. </PARA>
<PARA> In my survey, interest rates rated third overall, both in terms of points gained and the average score. Not surprisingly they were the chief concern of the 18 years to 29 years age group. These are the young families which cling to the forlorn dream of escaping the unproductive rental spiral. These are the young families which have recently taken out mortgages and have been unceremoniously thrown onto the financial scrap heap as a result of the policies of this Government. How would a compassionate and in-tune government respond? Maybe there would be an expansion of the first home owners scheme, maybe some form of mortgage interest rate relief, maybe government-funded mortgage insurance? But what do we get? Every time the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) speaks of something like this he is rubbished by Mr Keating. How did Mr Keating respond in the Budget?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How did our Treasurer respond on Budget night? `I am sorry', he said, `but you will just have to endure these rates to pay for the current massive modernisation of Australian industry'. Some comfort for struggling John Citizen who is funnelling over 40 per cent of his gross weekly earnings into mortgage repayments. The list of economic concerns expressed by my electorate but ignored by the Treasurer in his Budget go on. Fair-Go survey respondents were asked whether a second breadwinner was needed to make ends meet. Where appropriate, 66 per cent of the relevant respondents said that they needed a second breadwinner. A significant proportion of people stated it would be preferable if one parent could remain at home, but they simply could not afford what they now see as an extravagance. So help me, one bread-winner in a family unit has become an extravagance in the last few years! The quality of family life has been sacrificed by this Government's irrational economic policies. The Hawke Government continues to boast about the hundreds of thousands of jobs it has created. In actual fact, it has merely forced hundreds of thousands of inflation-ravaged and embattled households to send a second breadwinner out into the work force to make ends meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The results of the survey conclusively show that people of my electorate-and I believe Australia-are hurting and hurting badly. I can also report that the respondents to this survey are very aware of the problems which are at the root of our economic woes. Time and time again respondents rued the lack of incentive to work, the lack of productivity, the uncompetitiveness of our exports and the overemphasis on borrowing rather than saving. The message was loud and clear. People want and expect governments to address the economic problems which are threatening to bring this country to its knees. The Budget is ample proof that this Government is incapable of addressing these most important issues. At this point I advise the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) that I showed this document to the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron), the Liberal member who has just resumed his seat, brought to this House a survey. I would hope that the examples he brought are a little better than the example his own Leader used of a person in great strife over interest rates when he was having that mock, or phoney, campaign. It is pretty typical of the Liberal Party that it puts forward a family with a couple of kids, two cars they own and a company car, complaining that it does not have enough money to send the kids skiing. That will probably be a typical example of what the honourable member for Moreton has brought forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me outline what the honourable member said. He made some rather nonsense statements and they ought not to go unchallenged. He talked about this foreign debt but he did not bother to point out that 60 per cent of this nation's foreign debt has been accumulated by the private sector and that this Government has reduced its debt to a point where its overseas assets far outweigh its debt. If we wish to look at any particular debt we ought to look to the Queensland Government, where one of its own authorities, the Queensland Electricity Commission, has a massive debt measured in billions of dollars. The Liberal member for Moreton should certainly understand that. He talked about interest rates and the people who are really struggling. I know that there are people struggling because of high interest rates, but the Liberal Party policy, espoused in this House, is that we ought to remove the 13.5 per cent ceiling. McLachlan, the star of the Liberal Party, told members when he was the head of the National Farmers Federation to get rid of the 13.5 per cent protection on one million Australian families. No doubt the honourable member for Moreton would adhere to the views raised by Elliott and McLachlan. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also talked about the tax revenue rise. What he did not bother to point out is that the reason there is greater tax revenue is that under this Government one and a half million extra people have entered the work force. Instead of those people drawing on unemployment benefit, they are earning money. They are part of the productivity boom that is taking place in this nation and they are paying their way in taxes. The other reason there has been an increase in tax revenue is that we have finally got some of the companies which have been rorting the system to pay their way. The vast majority of money that was being paid came from the worker under the pay as you earn scheme. Now industry is being forced to pay its way because the rorts have been removed-the fringe benefits and entertainment rorts and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talked about provisional tax. This Government put a threshold of $10,332 on pensioners for provisional tax. What was it under the coalition government only seven years ago? It was $750. There is now a provisional tax threshold limit for the elderly of this nation-almost two million people-of $10,332. He talked about wanting to expand the first home owners scheme, yet until recently one of the Opposition's five policies was to abolish the first home owners scheme. I am not sure how much notice we can take of the honourable member, but I think we ought to be very wary of the sorts of things he says because they are not backed up with facts. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to move very quickly to what I think is the real challenge before this nation. I know that interest rates are an issue, but if we look at the broad challenge, it comes back to the changing status of our population in terms of its age. In 1989, 11 per cent, or one in 10, Australians are over the age of 65. Yet 30 years down the track we are going to find that the aged community will make up almost 20 per cent of the population. One person in five will be 65 years or over. The projection is that by the year 2020 some four million Australians will be 65 years and over. It has also been put forward statistically that for every one person who has retired and is receiving a pension there are five in the work force, but in about three decades for every elderly person there will be only two in the work force. That will place massive strains on this nation because it means there will be less tax revenue to meet age pensions. There will be fewer people producing and providing for those in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to provide a reasonable quality of life for the elderly as these numbers escalate there has to be a national strategy. That is what this Government has undertaken. The Budget we are now discussing in this Appropriation Bill debate is part of that overall national strategy. It is important that the challenge be met not only by this Government but by State governments and other instrumentalities. I hope that we will set aside party politics on this issue because each and every one of us, God giving the privilege, is going to live over the age of 65. The population is getting older and older. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do we have a challenge to maintain and improve the age pension, but we also have to provide better incentives for people to add to their pensions with a self-generating retirement income scheme. That has been a philosophy put forward by Opposition members as well. It has been argued by honourable members on this side of the House but it has been this Government that has set that objective. It has set that objective not just in place but in cement. It is providing a brand new approach to ensure that there is adequate income support for the needy in its pensions scheme. As honourable members would appreciate, this Budget is going to lift the pension for the elderly of this nation up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, and more by July 1990. The Government is also now setting in train a policy, a plan, to encourage the younger generation to start providing through savings for a higher standard of living in their retirement. That savings program is a superannuation savings plan. We can be very proud of our record of providing security for the aged. In 10 years time people are going to look back at the Hawke Labor Government and praise it for seeing the problem but, more importantly, for having the courage to tackle that problem. It has taken up the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we already compare favourably with most of the more highly developed countries in the world, certainly when it comes to a comparison with the United States of America and Britain in terms of assistance given to the retired. As we move through the next decade we are going to see major changes. Already we have put together a system whereby the pension allowed under social security and the extra income that is allowed to be earned will be non-taxable. It is a major change for the elderly. By July next year a single pensioner will be able to earn $40 a week, or $2,080, in any one year and know it will be tax free. A married couple can now earn $70 per week. When we add that to the pension, we start to understand that that is a very considerable income by comparison with what people earned or were allowed to earn only a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has changed the rebate system significantly. It was $430 last year, for the single pensioner it is going to increase to $650. In other words, single pensioners will be able to earn the amount of money that would have incurred a tax of $650 and not have to pay that tax. For a married couple the position is even better in that they will have a combined tax rebate of $1,040. If, because of unfortunate circumstances, married pensioners are unable to live together, say because of illness, that tax rebate will grow to $760 each per year. This will give each of them a tax free income of $8,710. I think we are finally getting to the stage where the elderly can have a true quality of life. I have always argued that no person can really exist today under $200 a week. I think that is a fair statement. We are gradually getting there. We are enabling people to get a part pension and still earn a couple of hundred dollars a week. By 1995, under this strategy anyone on a full or part pension will pay no tax whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> When that measure is put in place and we add to it savings schemes and the superannuation proposals to encourage young people to save and enter into a life-long plan, we will address the problem I spoke about earlier. It is obvious that we need to look after people now. That is what the Government is doing. This year 320,000 aged and service people will receive rental assistance. That is an added bonus which will be tax free, except in Queensland. It is shocking that the moment a person in Queensland gets any sort of increase from the Federal Government the Queensland Government taxes it. For instance, if a person in receipt of the Federal Government's family allowance supplement lives in a Housing Commission home, the allowance is added to the household income and the rent is increased. In this instance we have introduced a rental assistance scheme that cannot be taxed by State governments. I hope that the Queensland Government will rethink its responsibility, in terms of social justice, to those on lower incomes, the elderly and families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that that will be the case. It is certainly a reasonable projection. The Government has sought to bring about social justice in the community and has targeted those in need. It has targeted families and the elderly. Currently, some 1,370,000 people are on pensions and there are over 600,000 veterans. So we have a very special responsibility to two million Australians. Irrespective of the amount of pension they receive and their allowable earnings, irrespective of whether we are assisting them under the home and community care program whereby generous assistance is given to elderly people who stay in their home, irrespective of the $48.75m that is going to the pensioner housing rental program this year, irrespective of the fact that we will double the number of hostel units available since 1983 by lifting the number to 44,000 and irrespective of the special $6.3m program to build multipurpose facilities to provide health and residential community care services for the aged in country areas, I think we are meeting that challenge. I believe that the issue ought to be addressed apolitically. We will always have different stresses and priorities, but we should remember that we have a special responsibility to the elderly. The Hawke Labor Government has a strategy for the next three decades, which will be the crisis time for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the whole story, although it is certainly part of it. That is a story that is welcome to be told and this is not the first government to be able to tell it. The Government's Budget documents show that a substantial reason for the increase in income tax revenue over the next 12 months is bracket creep. That statement is not a vague allegation: it is shown in the Budget documents. They illustrate that the so-called tax cuts that people received as from July this year will be more than taken up by the effect of inflation carrying people's wages into higher income tax brackets. That has been the story throughout the life of the Hawke Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple fact is that people are worse off because of the Hawke Government. The average wage earner is worse off. It has been shown that a one income family with an average income and dependent children is more than $50 a week worse off in net terms-that is, when all things are taken into account-than it was when the Labor Government was first elected in 1983. Also, it has been pointed out by people in the hospitality industry that the greater tax revenue which the Government looks forward to through the increased number of people in the work force is under severe threat because of its inept handling of the pilots dispute. The hospitality industry estimates that by Friday of next week 150,000 present employees of that industry will be out of work because of the pilots dispute. Yet day after day the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) comes in here and throws petrol on the flames of that dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members have agreed to limit the length of their speeches in this debate in order to allow a greater number of members to speak. Therefore, one must limit the number of subjects that could be covered. I will direct my comments essentially to the Budget as it relates to pensioners and health. Earlier this year we had a debate on the Government's decision to lift the tax threshold so that pensioners do not have to pay taxation on the amount of income that they may receive before their pension entitlement is affected. The honourable member for Capricornia portrayed that as a great reform of the Hawke Government and said that the issue had not been addressed by previous governments. Under the previous Government the issue did not arise. Because of the bracket creep effect to which I referred earlier, if a pensioner's only income was the amount that he could receive before the pension entitlement was affected, he or she would have to pay tax. In fact, prior to last year's Budget a pensioner was faced with having to pay tax on not only the allowable income before his or her pension was affected but also the pension if it was his or her only income. A pensioner who did not receive any part of that $40 allowable for a single person-it is $70 for married couples-would have faced paying tax when all he or she was receiving was the pension. That was the Hawke Government's record. When the Hawke Government introduced a measure whereby those who were getting just that minimum amount no longer had to pay tax on it, all it was doing was winding the situation back to that which had obtained under previous governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the Budget that people who receive pension income will not have to pay any tax by 1995 was a quite startling one and, on the face of it, seems to be a very welcome decision. However, when one looks at it a little further one has to draw the conclusion that it has been curiously ill thought out. In fact, curiously little thought appears to have been given to its implications. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) very properly asked the Treasurer how somebody receiving some part pension income would compare in tax terms with somebody who just failed to qualify for some form of pension income. The vagueness of the Treasurer's response surprised me, for one. It seems that the implications of the decision have not been thoroughly thought out. For equity to prevail the Government should be talking about lifting the tax threshold to the equivalent level. In today's terms that would mean lifting the tax threshold for all income earners to somewhere between $15,000 and $16,000. </PARA>
<PARA> If such a policy were in place now an age pensioner could receive income in excess of $15,000 and pay no tax. However, somebody who was in receipt of just over the amount that would qualify him or her for just the smallest amount of pension would pay a substantial amount of tax. That would amount to more than doubling the present tax threshold. In terms of revenue forgone, it would be an enormous amount. The Government must address this and say what it intends to do about the tax threshold; otherwise the implications are clear. The most enormous incentive will be given to people to arrange their affairs in such a way that they qualify for even a few dollars a week in pension. In any event, why would Australia's pensioners believe that the Government would achieve its promise of exemption from taxation by 1995 in light of the Government's failure to achieve the Prime Minister's promise in 1987 to eliminate child poverty by 1990? If the Government stays in power-which, clearly, is unlikely-its likelihood of achieving that promise is virtually zero. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was saying a few words in relation to the Budget which we are now debating as it applies to pensioners. In the few minutes that are left to me I want to turn to another area of particular moment. We are, of course, limited in the number of subjects we can cover in the Budget debate, and I think it would be remiss of me if I did not raise the subject of the Government's child-care policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has yet again steadfastly resisted the pressure to look at the possibility of child-care costs being either a tax deduction or earning a tax rebate. Whilst the Government has been quite assiduous in its legislation for anti-discrimination and affirmative action, it nevertheless blindly insists, for doctrinaire reasons, on overlooking the biggest structural barrier to women's participation in the work force, and that is the cost and lack of availability of child-care in Australia. The availability of affordable child-care is crucial in removing the barriers to women's participation in the work force in Australia. It would seem to me to be just fundamental in affirmative action practices that the Government would have moved further in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has, of course, extended child-care availability in Australia, but I am afraid we have been getting more promises than action in the last couple of years. Yet again, the Government is talking about the additional places it is going to provide by 1992. This was, of course, announced in last year's Budget, although there was no chance of anything happening in the previous financial year. This year we get the promise that by 1992 the Government will provide a number of extra places-that is, in three years' time. Last year's promise was for three years as from last year. We are told that the national child-care strategy, which was announced last year, will provide 30,000 new child-care places over the next three years in cooperation with the States, local government and employers. That is precisely what we were told 12 months ago. Further, we are told that agreements have been finalised with most States to contribute to the recurrent cost of these new places. The agreements are not final 12 months down the track and they are still just a promise to Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no recent figures available on usage of child-care in Australia, but the figures that are available can be extrapolated fairly simply. In 1980 the Australian Bureau of Statistics carried out a child-care survey which indicated that of pre-school children 37.4 per cent were cared for at home by their mothers, 12.5 per cent were in pre-school kindergartens, and only 5.5 per cent were in formal child-care centres. The remaining 44.6 per cent of pre-school children therefore were being cared for somehow outside the home. The increases in the number of child-care places and in participation by women in the work force would enable us to reach the situation of concluding that there is still a very large number of children who are in informal child-care situations. Probably at least 35 per cent are still not catered for by Government action of one sort or another. </PARA>
<PARA> The leading case in the whole matter of tax deductability of child-care costs is one of Lodge versus the Federal Commissioner of Taxation of 1972. The attitudes that were displayed in that judgment and in subsequent judgments by tribunals-I have no hesitation in saying this, and I do not blush to say it-simply reflect an attitude and a point of view of certain men. In that case there was a taxpayer working at home who had a dependent child and who was a single parent. It was necessary for her to put her two-year-old child in day care for the days that she was working for a law firm from her home. In his judgment on this, Justice Mason concluded that this expenditure was incurred for the purpose of earning assessable income and was an essential prerequisite to the derivation of income; nevertheless, it was not relevant or incidental to the preparation of the bills of costs that this taxpayer was involved in and therefore was not incurred in the course of preparing bills of cost. </PARA>
<PARA> This judgment contrasts quite strongly with other judgments that the court and tribunals have given. For example, under the same section of the taxation Act, we allow people to claim the cost of uniforms. Could it really be claimed that a nurse could not carry out her job if she was not wearing a uniform? Could it really be claimed that the attendants in this chamber could not carry out their jobs if they were not wearing a uniform? If one wanted to apply the same strict interpretation of the Act as has been done in the case of child-care, one would find that many deductions that are presently available would not be available to taxpayers. There are many deductions available to members of parliament, indeed, to only would-be members of parliament, that would not be allowable under those circumstances. I remind the House that the Commissioner of Taxation has ruled that unsuccessful candidates for Parliament, people who have never been a member of parliament, are able to claim taxation deductions for expenses they incur in attempting to be elected to Parliament-not in carrying out the job; in attempting to be elected to Parliament, even when they are unsuccessful. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast a case of a judgment by the Taxation Tribunal a few years ago where one tribunal member pointed out that to earn income it was more essential for a car salesman to be able to buy a prospective customer a pint of beer, and so possibly sell a car, than it was for a mother to buy child-care and so earn a wage. In that case he knew he was addressing himself to a sole parent. It might seem a bit extreme when I say that I fear the attitude that has been reflected is one that is more typically unsympathetic and uncaring about the issue than one that reflects justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Review in New South Wales in 1981 said, in once again ruling against child-care costs as a tax deduction for an income earner:</PARA>
<PARA>It apparently needs to be stressed again and again that the remedy lies with Parliament, not boards of review. </PARA>
<PARA>There it is, fairly and squarely: it lies with Parliament, and therefore with government. If justice is to be achieved and if affirmative action is to mean anything, it is something that this Parliament must legislate. </PARA>
<PARA> When one turns one's attention to the actual cost of this, it is curious to find out who speaks and what they say. In 1984 the Australian Financial Review carried a story headlined `Tax deductions for child care could cost $400m'. This referred to some assessment that had been made by the Department of Social Security and apparently leaked to the press-one assumes by the Department of Social Security-in which the Department estimated that it could cost $400m a year to provide tax deductions for child-care expenses. I would view that judgment with some jaundice because of an answer the Treasurer gave to the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) to a question on notice, the answer appearing in the Hansard of 16 September 1986, more than two years after that assessment by the Department of Social Security. In response to the honourable member's question whether there had been estimated a cost to revenue of tax deductibility of child-care, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>The cost to revenue of allowing full tax deductibility for child care expenses incurred by taxpayers whose children are cared for to enable them to go out to work is estimated to be of the order of $150m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is rather less than the other estimate, which one suspects was prepared in order to oppose any such deduction. The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>For the purposes of this estimate it has been assumed that all such expenditure in respect of children aged 12 years and under would qualify for deduction. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the extreme case has been taken and still the answer three years ago was only $150m for a full year. The Treasurer further said:</PARA>
<PARA>If tax deductability were to be limited to payments to registered child care centres, or allowed only in respect of children of pre-school age, the cost to revenue would be less. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be significantly less, I suggest. In other words, the figures that are bandied about as a deterrent to serious consideration of either tax deductability or tax rebates, which are considered to be a fairer system, show that the cost is not high. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all of us in this Parliament say that we want to take action in Parliament to enhance the quality of life of families in Australia. The alleviation of stress and financial burden in this area would be of very clear benefit. I would also like to put it to the Parliament that we would not have our dramatically declining birth rate if it were not for the inequities that women in particular suffer under this system. I hear a lot of statements made about why women are not having more children these days. Mortgages, interests rates and so on are mentioned and certainly are a factor. People say that a lot of women go to work only because they want to pay the bills. That is true but it is also true that a lot of men go to work only because they have to pay some bills too, and, given the choice of living comfortably without having to go to work, a lot of men would take that option as well. Nevertheless I firmly believe that women are going to go to work in this day and age anyway, and if we had not put so many penalties on women being mothers and also participating in the work force our birth rate would be higher. More women would choose to have more children if the penalties were not so great for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to consider this matter seriously. I am pleased that the Opposition has turned its attention to it and has pledged itself to introducing a tax rebate for the cost of child-care where it is necessary for someone to earn an income. It seems only simple justice and logic. </PARA>

<PARA> In the Opposition's initial response to this year's Budget it tried to play on the point that perhaps in some way this Budget was an election Budget. The Opposition highlighted the various policy announcements and tried to conjure up the notion that they were in some fashion a bid to buy votes. Budgets of that nature, of course, were very much paramount throughout and following the Menzies years but if we look at the nature of Australian politics now there is a more steady progression in the way in which our budgetary matters are pursued and our economic matters controlled. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's Budget had much of its basis in the April statement of earlier this year. It has been the nature of the way that this Government has worked that it has gradually worked on policy items, and a number of those culminated in this year's Budget. One of the most important was the announcement on retirement income. The suggestion that this was in some way a hasty proposition put forward in a run-up to an election is arrant nonsense. One has only to look at the work that has been done by the Social Security Review and the number of papers canvassing issues around retirement income to know that that notion is out of order. Much of the policy that was announced resulted not only from the Social Security Review but also from a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled Income Support for the Retired and the Aged. It has had wide consideration and much community debate.</PARA>
<PARA> Another important aspect of the Budget is the putting down of a social justice for youth statement. This again was something that took several months to develop, in consultation with outside bodies. Again to suggest that this was something that was hastily put together is nonsense. The Budget also gave substantive appropriation basis for the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the environment, which he made last month, and the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia, which he announced last month. Again those two statements were very much proposals that had been developed over time and given great consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's Budget establishes a framework of opportunity for Australia. What a contrast it is between the economic management of this Government and that of those opposite. The projected Budget surplus for 1989-90 is some $9,122m. This represents the third consecutive Budget surplus achieved by this Government. It also happens to be only the third time that the Budget has been brought into surplus in the 37 years for which comparable records have been maintained. This is totally in contrast to the projected record deficit of $9.6 billion left by the coalition rabble in 1983. If we take a few moments to do the simple arithmetic, that represents a turnaround of over $18 billion since the election of the Labor Government. The Budget surplus has been created by restraint in Government spending. This is something about which the Opposition has made plenty of statements but, when in government, did very little about. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget real government spending has been cut for the fourth year in a row. Outlays now constitute 23.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP)-the lowest level for 16 years. The surplus will be sufficient to offset the borrowings by all spheres of Government. As a consequence, the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast to be in surplus by 1.2 per cent of GDP. As was the case with the previous two surpluses, the Government will use all of this year's surplus to pay off debt. Australia's foreign currency debt has fallen from $15.1 billion in 1987 to $9.3 billion in 1989. In addition to retiring this massive block of foreign debt, the Government repaid $2.2 billion of domestic debt in 1987-88 and over $2.7 billion in 1988-89. Again this record of responsible economic management by the Government is in marked contrast to the record of those opposite when in government during the dim dark Fraser years. Between 1975-76 and 1982-83 net overseas raisings totalled $4.5 billion. Between 1983-84 and 1988-89 the Labor Government has repaid in net terms a total of $1.5 billion of foreign currency debt. The same contrast applies when we examine the savings question. This Government has both lifted Government savings and encouraged superannuation. The public sector in total, including government business enterprises, State and local governments and the Commonwealth, has been transformed from being a net borrower to the tune of 6.7 per cent of GDP in 1983-84 to a net saver of one per cent of GDP last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Labor Government more has been done to encourage occupational superannuation than under any other government in Australia's history. In March 1987, as part of the historic accord with the trade union movement, occupational superannuation coverage equal to a wage increase of 3 per cent was extended across the work force. By 1990 most workers should have access to occupational superannuation providing them with genuine retirements benefits. By the end of this year alone, 80 per cent of workers will be covered by an award where an employer must provide superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced that the Government would consider a further 3 per cent award for occupation superannuation as part of the wage system next year. This will be achieved under the Labor Party's accord with the trade union movement. The Opposition's determination to smash the wages system would return superannuation to being a privilege of the wealthy. The Treasurer has made it quite clear that superannuation is the Government's preferred savings vehicle. Compare this approach with the rash, ill-conceived savings gimmick that was launched recently by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock). The Leader of the Opposition and his erstwhile colleague the professor, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), are attempting to substitute novelties for numbers. We are still awaiting some detailed policies from the Opposition-policies, not buzz words. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's support and encouragement for superannuation is given through generous tax concessions. These tax concessions amount to about $4 billion in forgone tax. Last year's superannuation assets grew by a massive $15 billion. Current savings in superannuation funds are in excess of $100 billion-three times the 1982-83 level. As a result of the Government's actions since 1983, culminating in the measures in this Budget, and with the increasing popularity of superannuation, it is estimated that by the year 2000 superannuation funds will receive more than $30 billion a year in new contributions, leading to a growth in assets of about $60 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) recently stated, the political issue of the 1990s will be how we as a nation can best use this pool of national savings. The Minister pointed correctly to the needs of Australia's infrastructure-not only for expansion of infrastructure but also for maintenance of existing infrastructure. This need was identified clearly in the main conclusions of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled Constructing and Restructuring Australia's Public Infrastructure. The report had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there is no reason to believe that Australia will be immune from a build-up of rehabilitation needs of the type that has occurred in other developed nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Maintenance and replacement needs will substantially increase during the rest of this century due to the overall age pattern of Australian infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still significant gaps in Australian infrastructure networks, all of which it would be desirable to fill and some of which it is essential to fill. We may have to cope with the ageing of much of our existing infrastructure before we have completed many of its networks. </PARA>
<PARA>A similar recognition of Australia's needs into the next century, although on a slightly different tack, led to a recommendation for the creation of the national development fund included in the report Australia Reconstructed. In this report it was suggested that savings of superannuation funds might be directed to new industrial capacity and housing. It might be worthwhile re-examining this proposal and adding infrastructure as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA> In the region I represent this issue is especially relevant to the appropriate development of the Plenty Valley, which is one of the most important, if not the most important, growth areas in metropolitan Melbourne. Over the next decade or more it will play a vital role in meeting the housing needs of the expanding Melbourne metropolis. The State Government is now working to ensure that this development takes place with the appropriate physical and social infrastructure, which can be acquired only through the necessary physical and social planning. We cannot afford to have the existing urban fringe placed under even greater pressure because of the lack of infrastructure, with the building of homes outpacing the provision of services. All spheres of Government have a role to play in this social planning. The mistakes of the developments of the 1950s and 1960s must be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget funding has been provided to redress one of these deficiencies through the announcement of the funding for the technical and further education college at Epping, which will expand the post-secondary education prospects of much of my constituency. The Federal Government must participate in the development of programs designed to tackle structural and regional inequalities of income, wealth, housing, transport, education and health. For the first time we can consider these options without having to consider overseas borrowings. We have the opportunity to consider an investment in our future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The dominant issue of the day is of course the industrial dispute between the pilots and the airline companies. That dispute has the potential to destroy the centralised wage fixation system and to put out of kilter many of the assumptions on which the Budget is based. I wish to address two aspects of that dispute. The first concerns a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Question Time today when he clearly said that the pilots were outside the system, that somehow there was no jurisdiction in the system to deal with them. The second aspect I wish to address is the likelihood of how this dispute will settle. Settle it will, of course, and, in the end, I believe the odds are that the pressure for settlement will come from the Australian Council of Trade Unions when it sees its members stood down, as they must be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First to what the Prime Minister said today. Here we have a man with many years of experience in industrial relations. He claims to know more about the subject than any person, or indeed any group of persons, in the country. One would think that he almost invented the system. He came to us in Question Time today and gave a long-winded and abusive answer to a question put to him by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). He was wrong about the way in which the system works. He said, `As a result of the airline pilots' union following its policy' the pilots are `faced with a position whereby they are out of the system'. There was then an interjection from the honourable member for Flinders. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I did not say the pilots union; I said the pilots are out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA>If we were in doubt as to what he meant, he made it plain again when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I said the pilots are out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA>Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It means that there is now no basis upon which under the industrial relations policy they can be dealt with within the system. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinary state of affairs. Does anybody really believe that there is no way they can be dealt with within the industrial relations system? Apparently the Prime Minister does. He has been given advice to that effect, no doubt. Yet today in the Australian Financial Review we see that Commissioner Alan Paine is reported as taking a quite different view. The quotation from what Mr Paine says is this:</PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate therefore to stress, notwithstanding the cancellation of those awards, that it remains open to the federation as an organisation under the [Industrial Relations] Act to bring the dispute to the commission for resolution in accordance with the processes afforded by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Who is right? Is the Prime Minister right or is the Commissioner right? Plainly the Commissioner is. In saying that, let me just add this: I wish to make it perfectly plain that I have no sympathy for what the pilots have done and I am not going to allow my name to be added to those whose views had been misrepresented so repeatedly and so assiduously by the Government side. What they have done is to pursue self-interest without regard for the interests, the convenience and the capacity to earn a living of individuals and for the travel industry. It is a great pity that they did not think of the nationwide consequences of their action before taking the action that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> But I return now to the main point. These pilots are not out of the system, nor is there now no basis upon which, under the industrial relations policy, they can be dealt with within the system-to quote the Prime Minister again-because what we are dealing with here is a situation where the organisation is registered and as a registered organisation it can go before the Commission after having cut a deal with the airlines. That is specifically provided for by section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act. That section says:</PARA>
<PARA>If the parties to an industrial dispute-</PARA>
<PARA>and there would not be anybody here who would deny that we have an industrial dispute-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . agree on terms for the settlement of . . . dispute, they may make a memorandum of the terms agreed on. </PARA>
<PARA>It further provides that they may:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . apply to the Commission for the certification of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>It further provides that:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Commission is of the opinion that the agreement is in the interests of the parties immediately concerned-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the airlines and the pilots-</PARA>
<PARA>the Commission shall-</PARA>
<PARA>subject to certain provisions-</PARA>
<PARA>certify the agreement unless it is of the opinion that it would be contrary to the public interest to certify the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have, in this sequence, an agreement reached, an application made to the Commission, and a process for certification laid down by the Act. Then, critically, subsection (5) of section 115 says this:</PARA>
<PARA>Certification of the agreement shall not be taken to be contrary to the public interest merely because the agreement is inconsistent with general Full Bench principles. </PARA>
<PARA>There are, of course, general Full Bench principles that have been laid down about wages in this country. They were laid down back in 1987, they were reaffirmed and reinterpreted in 1988, and they have been reaffirmed once more in the national wage case of August this year. Those are the wage fixing principles that the Prime Minister must be referring to. But they have nothing to do with the capacity of these parties to reach an agreement and to have that agreement certified by the Commission. Further than that, the Government itself can be heard, because specifically under section 43 and 44 of the Industrial Relations Act, power is given to the Government to intervene. So that if the airlines and the union cut a deal and want to have it certified, then it is up to the Government to decide whether it wants to be involved, as, of course, it would have to be. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in short, the position is this, contrary to what the Prime Minister says. First, the system applies. It is open, and it is ludicrous nonsense for the Prime Minister to come here and suggest that somehow these people, through their union-because the union is the registered body that represents their interests before the Commission-cannot go along and use the processes laid down by the Act. They can do that unless, of course, the Prime Minister is going to come into this House and say that there is no industrial dispute-in which event he would be behaving like a nineteenth century lawyer, and I doubt that is the kind of figure that he would want to cut. </PARA>
<PARA> So that is the first thing that needs be said. The Act provides a mechanism and the Prime Minister is wrong when he says that the members of the union are out of the system. I raise the question: Why did he say it? How could he, with his experience, have made such a mistake? Could he have been given mistaken advice on such an obvious point? Or is it, perhaps, that the Government wishes to be as far away from this dispute as possible while shouting on the sidelines as loudly as possible and saying two things: `Look, we can't do anything. You fellows fix it up. We wish of course that we could do something, but we can't'. Yet, of course, ironically the powers that could be used to force the parties to come to a sensible agreement, sanctions that the Prime Minister has asked private parties, the airlines, to use, are in a Bill which the honourable member for Flinders a few minutes ago sought to present to this House. What happens? He is cut off-`No, we do not want to know anything about it'. The Government does not want to know anything about it because that Bill contains provisions which were originally in its own legislation and were cut out. Why? Because Simon said so. Simon said no-`No, we are not going to have that, Bob', and Bob said, `Okay, Simon; okay'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go to the second aspect. What is going to happen? If the pilots hold out, the strike cannot be broken. That is the reality. It cannot be broken because there are not enough pilots to come in and take the jobs. It would, of course, cause a major industrial relations fight if that happened, but it is not going to happen. There have been attempts made to find alternatives, and all we know is that the outcome is just about zero. The airlines are bleeding to death. Financially the cost to the airlines is immense. Yet the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), that enlightened economic body, always with the long term interests of this country at heart, says, `We will fight to the death if you stand down a single member for a single hour'. </PARA>
<PARA> Just contemplate this: the airlines, through no fault of their own, cannot fly their planes-because the pilots will not fly them. And what does the ACTU say?-`Well, of course, the reason why we have these thousands of employees in our many affiliated unions is that they are there to help you fly the planes. But even though you cannot fly the planes, even though they have nothing to do, even though those checking-in people will not be checking in people, even though the baggage handlers will not be handling baggage, even though the mechanics will not be repairing minor defects in planes as they are turning about, even though the catering system is not going to be there, even though the airline stewards and stewardesses do not have a job to go to, you cannot stand them down. That would be wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that that is going to happen, because money will not be given by this Government to the airlines. That is something which, at the end of the day, the Government will shrink from, because it is quite impossible. The airlines will have to stand down employees, and when that takes place the weight is going to come on from the ACTU to the Government to cut a deal, to facilitate a deal, or not to prevent a deal being cut. When the threat of stand-downs is on, that is when we shall see a settlement emerge. I do not say that that is a good thing, but I say that all the odds are that that is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think that the Government would advance the interests of this country a great deal further if, instead of engaging in a tirade of abuse against the Opposition, it looked to the mechanisms available to it and suggested to the parties that it might be very wise to sit down as quickly as possible, to invoke the mechanisms of section 115, which were brought in by this Government, and to cut a deal. The alternative is a disaster, unless the Government believes that the strike will be broken. It is one thing for the Government to believe that and turn out to be correct, but what are the odds of this occurring? In the meantime the damage that is being done to this country and to individual firms and businesses, and the inconvenience that is being suffered by individuals, is great. It is about time that we had some common sense and some straight dealing by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not want to talk about the dispute involving the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, mainly because we have discussed this matter for the last three or four days. I am sorry to see the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) leaving the chamber, because I want to make a few comments about what he has said. I want to defend what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said during Question Time today. With due respect to the honourable member for North Sydney-I understand that he is a prominent Sydney Queen's Counsel-I hope that not too many people are prepared to pay him the $2,000 per day fee that his level of experience would dictate, because he does not know what he is talking about. The reality is that the pilots have resigned. They are no longer employees under the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. They are not employees of the employers, the airlines. Their award has been cancelled. The Federation of Air Pilots is still a registered union. Orders can be made against it, but not against the membership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister said today-I repeat it in case Opposition members do not understand, although it is kindergarten stuff-the pilots have resigned. They are no longer employees of the airlines. Therefore, the Act does not come into operation. How many more times do we have to repeat this to Opposition members? How many more times do we have to listen to the honourable member for North Sydney say such things? The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) is another lawyer who, thankfully, is a member of this House rather than practising law. Frankly, the kind of legal advice that could be offered by these honourable members leaves a lot to be desired, in my opinion. I am a lowly solicitor, not a QC; but even I understand what is going on. I am not an advocate; I am basically a commercial solicitor. The shadow Minister who is at the table, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), is also a solicitor. He knows full well that what I am saying is correct. Whom should we believe? Should we believe the honourable member for North Sydney, the honourable member for Flinders, Mr McLachlan, or even the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock)? The fact is that members of the Liberal and National parties are in complete disarray on this issue. They do not know what they are doing. They are running around like chooks with their heads cut off. They are running here, there and everywhere. Opposition members should start to do something constructive about this dispute. Instead of asking questions on the airline dispute every day, they should give us some ideas about how to solve it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to waste any of the precious seven or eight minutes remaining to me. I say to Opposition members: war has been declared by the Air Pilots Federation on this issue. The Federation has circulated a financial planning advice document from which I quoted the other day during the discussion of a matter of public importance raised by Opposition members, when they again wasted the time of the House and supported the pilots, as they have done for the last three or four days. The document tells pilots to go fishing. It tells them to get a second job. I do not want to continue with this topic because I think it is fairly obvious that the Opposition does not know where it stands on the issue. It sends in its high priced QC to say things which, frankly, I would not expect my articled clerk to say. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the matter which I want to speak about tonight-that is the 1989-90 Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I am very proud to be a member of this Government. I say that quite sincerely, because the Treasurer has brought down a Budget which has been described as tough but fair; a Budget which, in an election period-I expect this to be the last Budget handed down before the Federal election to be held some time next year-has not been a grab bag of goodies, as is sometimes the case. The fact is that it has looked to the future. I want to read from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 16 August by John Sampson and Graham Williams headed, `Welfare decisions win praise'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The elderly will be the major beneficiaries of a `frugal but well-designed' budget for the welfare sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Julian Disney, president of the Australian Council of Social Service, said last night that the 1989 Budget by comparison with recent budgets, used the money well without as many horrendous cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> Although ACOSS had requested an aged pension of 30 per cent of average weekly earnings, it was happy to get 25 per cent, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Increases in rent assistance, indexation of the pension-free area, simplification of tax arrangements for pensioners, and the further improvement to superannuation, were all satisfactory moves. </PARA>
<PARA> The $100 million expansion for homeless and disadvantaged youth, although it fell short in some areas, was still to be applauded, Mr Disney said. </PARA>
<PARA> In all, he said, it was a Budget which looked to the future. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a Budget that looks to the future. It is a Budget that is part of the ongoing process of economic restructuring that has been undertaken by the Hawke Labor government during its seven years in office. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very proud and pleased to serve on the Prime Minister's task force on retirement incomes. We travelled around the whole of Australia and talked to everybody who was prepared to make submissions to us. I am very happy to say that on the Gold Coast the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), a lady for whom I have a great deal of respect, came along to the meeting and contributed, or at least listened to what was being said. I do not know whether the honourable member for Bass attended any of the meetings. Had he done so, he would have felt that we were listening to what people wanted to tell us, and they told us a lot. We did not let the things they told us go in one ear and out the other. We prepared a full report which we presented to the Prime Minister. I am very happy to say that many of the matters that were raised by pensioners, by superannuants, by retired people in receipt of part pensions, have been taken up by this Government. It gives one a great deal of satisfaction to know that, as a back bench member, one can make some contribution in the area of policy. All of the members of the task force are very grateful for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk about what we have done for pensioners, but I had to waste a lot of time counteracting the rubbish that we have been hearing from the Opposition about the airline pilots dispute. Many of the things we have done involved seeing whether we could give pensioners a reasonable living standard. We appreciate that it is very difficult for pensioners to live on a certain amount of money. We are attempting to advance their position in financial terms in accordance with the cost of living. However, some pensioners, spurred on by baseless claims from the Opposition, in particular by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), have complained that the Government does not care about older Australians. Of course, that is not true. The Government has raised the pension to the current level of 24.8 per cent of average weekly earnings. This has risen from 22.7 per cent in 1983 when this Government came into office. Labor's longstanding commitment to an age pension of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings not only will be met, but will be exceeded in April 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the real benefits of this Budget, about which I have a very smug confidence-and I know that every member on this side of the House has-is that, irrespective of what happens in the future, all of these benefits, such as pensions and family allowances, are indexed. If the Opposition ever gets the chance to do anything about this issue, I would like to see it break the indexation principles. One has to look at the possibility that some time in the distant future the Opposition might get the opportunity to do that. I suggest that it would be a very brave government that would break the indexation principles that this Government has brought in with respect to the question of pensions, family allowances and other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that one major problem that was conveyed to us which is of concern to the people in the electorates-I might also say that it is of concern to the people in my electorate at Wynnum and Manly-is the amount that pensioners could earn before it affected their pension. In fact, we have increased that amount quite dramatically. In 1995 no pensioner receiving any sort of a pension or part pension will be in a position where he or she will have to pay tax. We have included a lump sum bereavement allowance of approximately $1,207 and other options will give the surviving pensioner the choice of receiving a substantial lump sum payment for use on the deceased's funeral costs or for use on other pressing financial commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> Before my time expires I want to touch briefly on one area that we have really got our teeth into and that is the area of superannuation. There is no doubt whatsoever that the superannuation policies that have been brought into place by the Treasurer and by this Government have been an absolute bonanza for this country. I will quickly read from the Chanticleer column in the Australian Financial Review of 16 August. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The revolution this Government has now produced in retirement income and therefore fund management is now as great as anything else it has done, including its deregulation of the financial system. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The growth in the funds management business from here to the turn of the century will be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Hawke Government started fixing up the retirement incomes system . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It would mean that within about 15 years, the savings position of the nation will have been transformed to the point where foreign debt of the size we are all now so worried about will either disappear or become irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> What Paul Keating and Treasury have done is tackle it now, and not put it off for a future Government, and they have done so in a way that looks like it might work. </PARA>
<PARA>Time has beaten me. There are many other measures in the package, such as no tax on non-profit clubs and spending on sport to rise by more than half and then to rise again. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) who is at the table, will give evidence to the fact that we have actually increased road funding in this country by some $120m. So much for all the rubbish that has come from the Opposition. Finally, this Government has brought in a Budget which members of the Opposition are very envious of. They have no policy and they do not know where they are. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has come out with all sorts of stupid schemes and tax savings breaks and everything else. The fact is that they have no policy and they are extremely envious of what the Government has been able to do. As a member of this Government I feel proud that I have been able to speak to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) today. I commend the Treasurer and all the Ministers, including the Minister at the table, for what they have done and for the moneys that they have made available for the betterment of this country to the absolute dismay of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the last speaker, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), believes what he has just said in connection with road funding, he would believe anything. It discredits everything else that he has said before. I say that with great respect in front of the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown). If the honourable member were as good an accountant as he thinks he is a lawyer, he would understand that there has been a 30 per cent decrease in real terms in road funding from the Commonwealth. I wanted to address myself to that matter later, but I might as well address myself to it now. The whole speech of the honourable member for Bowman has lost any impact because of that final statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was interesting that earlier today there was a plea within the chamber by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar). He suggested that what we are debating now in the Budget is a consequence of what has happened in Australia over the last 20 years, under three different governments. He indicated that the Budget should be realistically addressing the problems that confront Australia and should avoid any unnecessary confrontation. I believe that those remarks would have been viewed with some kind of regard by most honourable members in this chamber. When one listens to the comments from the Government side that have been made on the Budget, one gets the feeling that an election is in the air. Somebody used to say at election time that he could feel a dam coming on. This time it is an election coming on. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget does not address itself to the fundamental problems that confront Australia at the moment. While we would applaud the Budget surplus of some $9.1 billion, we must remember that with that $9.1 billion we are paying back the extravagances that the honourable member for Wide Bay was talking about earlier in connection with past debts. The Minister pointed his finger at me when I said that we are paying off past debts. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) got to his feet very quickly the other day and suggested that he is paying off the coalition's debt incurred when it was in government. In actual fact, if we look at the 1983-84 Budget and the three Budgets that came after that, we see that the Commonwealth, the Parliament, the people of Australia, chalked up a debt of $23 billion through the deficits that were provided in those Budgets. I understand that of the debt that this Government, this Parliament and this Commonwealth owes, 75 per cent is on a six months roll-over. To say that the debt is paying off one regime's costs as against the other is just not a fair assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the $9.1 billion is only a fraction of the amount that has been carried by this Parliament as a deficit and it was an extravagance over those years. While we applaud that, there is some responsibility in it. When we look at the document we see that the election factor is there for one main reason; that is that the fundamental problem in Australia today is that expectations become rights. Over a period governments have catered to those expectations and rights-or what people considered to be their rights-on the basis that there will be a payment by the Commonwealth in order to curry favour with a particular section. What is wrong with Australia at the moment is the fact that those expectations have not been matched by productivity within this country. As we go around Australia today, we hear that what is needed is productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just mention the air pilots strike. At the moment people are talking about the eight hours at the stick. People are saying to me-I am not canvassing the proposition-that the 35 per cent increase, or any increase, is worth it if there is an increase in productivity as a result. The reason I say that the Government has not set the framework in this Budget for what will occur in the economy in the next 12 months is that it has not come to grips with productivity or with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). One can feel the dead hand of the ACTU on this Budget because the framework was set well before the Budget presentation as to what the unions would accept and would demand in relation to an increase in their wage component around Australia irrespective of the productivity that was there. This Budget is not addressing those fundamentals. </PARA>
<PARA> I will stress where this Budget fails as far as the productivity criterion is concerned. it accepts an inflation rate of over 7 per cent, which represents a loss of productivity. In other words, we are taking more out of the system than we are putting into it by a factor of 7 per cent. That is what inflation means. When we talk in terms of our gross or net foreign debt increasing, that is also an indication that Australians are consuming to a greater extent than they are producing. Last year that figure was set at $9 billion and it went into a deficit of $17 billion, which would seem to me to be an extravagance that Australian cannot afford at the moment because it is bearing a debt for the future to pay for the extravagances of this particular generation. The framework of this Budget does not address that basic lack of production because it sets in place a figure of $18.1 billion as a further deficit for 12 months. That will have the effect of increasing Australia's foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> During the week I read an interesting address by Mr Ferris, the Chairman of the Australian Trade Commission, Austrade. Apart from the graphs that he gives at the end-I believe that this is so right that one cannot fail to see the point-he says:</PARA>
<PARA> As you can see, our trade predicament is of long standing. That was what the honourable member for Wide Bay said earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been a fact of life for the past 20 years. The address continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It can perhaps be characterised by saying that we currently have the commodity based export profile of a third world country but the manufacturing based import appetite of an advanced economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that puts it rather succinctly. So the Budget fails on that score, but it gets 10 marks for being an election Budget as it does not address the fundamental problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Where did the 1988-89 Budget fail? It failed again on productivity. It failed again on inflation. Inflation was set at 4 per cent and it came in at 7 per cent. On interest rates, being part of the monetary policy of this Government, the Budget failed because they went up. In the small business area, or the borrowing area, people were paying 16 per cent at the beginning of that period and at the end they were paying 22 to 23 per cent. A question asked of me, not with any political intent, was: How do you expect to borrow money at 23 per cent, put it into a business and make a profit? Growth on the Australian scene is not growth in productivity or economic progress but growth in consumerism, and that is where this Government's monetary policy falls flat. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Treasurer said that the 1988-89 Budget was the one that would bring home the bacon. I say to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table: the pig is still alive and well. It has its nose well and truly in the trough and it has not been caught yet. I suggest that the Treasurer should get himself into gear, look at what that pig is doing, and see whether he can convert it into bacon to bring home at the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer to a statement in a book by Victor Hugo that I am reading which really puts this matter into perspective. He commented over 130 years ago that wealth is created by work-that is, productivity, innovation and effort, with everybody interested. Wealth is created by work and productivity and wages are a mere distribution of that wealth. We have to produce the wealth before we can distribute it. I say again that this Budget does nothing in that connection. </PARA>
<PARA> The position of our net foreign debt is borne out by the decision this week of Moody's Investors Service-a judgment by a world accredited body on Australia's debt potential. Anybody who suggests that a net foreign debt of $108 billion is not an embarrassment to Australia ought to look again. We could also look at the judgment of the London money market that the Australian dollar is overvalued by some 20 per cent. Of course, the Minister will say that nothing has happened as a result. One solution to Australia's economic problems would be for us to look at the value of the dollar and let it peg at its natural level without being propped up by interest rates. That 20 per cent devaluation would have two effects: firstly, it would pull down interest rates; and secondly, it would leave the economies of the Third World running on a resource base. At least it would allow those resources to trade better in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year's Budget and this year's Budget both failed on the aspect of competitiveness. At the luncheon today for the Prime Minister of Thailand I asked a diplomat from Thailand what their inflation rate was. Honourable members should bear in mind that Thailand is not really one of the developed countries of the world; it is pulling itself through. Last year its inflation rate was as little over 4 per cent. I asked the diplomat, `What do you expect this year?'. He said, `We expect to bring it in a little over one per cent'. I asked, `How is your productivity? Do you work five or six days a week?'. He said, `No, we work five days a week'. It is obvious, from the productivity point of view, that the cost of Thailand's products is so much below ours that it does not allow ours to be competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some other comparisons in connection with inflation. While Australia was suffering an inflation rate of 7 per cent, our major competitors in the European Economic Community had an inflation rate of 5.1 per cent; in the United States of America 5.1 per cent; in West Germany 3 per cent; and in Japan 2.4 per cent. Again, this indicates greater productivity in those countries than we have in Australia. Turning to overseas interest comparisons on long term government bonds, Australia was nearly 14 per cent; West Germany 7 per cent; Japan 5 per cent; the United States of America 9 per cent; and the United Kingdom 9 per cent. How can Australia be expected to compete when those international comparisons are against us and the productivity of other countries is also against us? In so many ways this Budget has failed to address the fundamental problems that are facing Australia at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned the election footing. Something that might have escaped the attention of the general populace is that within Appropriation Bill (No. 1) there is an extravagance-I am not sure how we could afford it-a $3.1m extension of the House of Representatives postal allowance. It is intended to increase the allowance from the previous $9,000 to $30,500 for each member. I would like to ask the people of Australia how they view that massive-almost fourfold-increase in the allowance. It is part of the election footing being prepared by this Government for its members in the more marginal electorates, together with the aNiMLS, the postal unit, the computers and the excessive use of telephones. I believe that all of this is an extravagance that Australians ought to be looking at very carefully. The Government is doing this at a time when it is trying to bring a report into this House to limit to its own advantage the amount of advertising available on commercial and other television. I think that is a problem that the Australian people ought to be aware of. The Government is being extravagant in spending this sort of money to boost its own marginal electorates when at the same time it is reducing the road component in the Budget by 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention roads because in the division of Dawson, which I represent, we had Cyclone Aivu in early April. While I do not attribute all the damage to the Bruce Highway to the lack of funds, it is in one hell of a mess. While at the moment people might be diverted slightly by the fact that we have an airline pilots strike, which means that air transportation is not available, I would suggest that anybody who travelled on the Bruce Highway in Queensland would see the problem as it really is. At a time when there is a desperate need for good roads for internal tourism and for trade, this matter must be looked at quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of Cyclone Aivu I paid a tribute to the manner in which the weather bureau and the radar tracking station at Townsville tracked that cyclone compared with the tracking of Cyclone Charlie the year before. I pointed out that Australia has too much old equipment, including radar and other safety devices. I have heard that the weather tracking equipment I was referring to did such a good job only because that cyclone came in quickly and passed through with great intensity. There was a lot of damage but it went through quickly. Advice has been given to me that the weather observer station at Mount Stewart in Townsville has old and antiquated equipment. The Mount Stewart radar kept on cutting in and out and had to be controlled manually because it could not keep up with the pace of the wind. The radar equipment, which is 1950 technology, is having problems. The radar equipment, which gives measurements of temperature and humidity from field recorders and ground equipment, is not compatible with the programs available to process radar observations. Only two telephones are available at the station to provide an answering service. In many other ways this indicates that there is a lot left to be desired in this area. I mention it because it is a safety factor. Many people rely on those weather forecasts. Many people in north Queensland, where we believe we are neglected-certainly the road situation comes readily to mind-would like to know when there is going to be a lot of damage from a cyclone and would like to know that that radar equipment is available and is going to be on track. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major difference between the two sides of the House is that when a government presents its financial statements and what it intends to do in the forthcoming year, it is presenting a factual document about what it proposes and has to do. I have heard Opposition speakers on both political sides of the House, and particularly on the conservative side of the House on a number of occasions-not as often as I would have liked, and not as often as would have been in the best interests of the country, but nevertheless on a number of occasions-and they have no commitment whatsoever to this country when they are in opposition. There is never a word about anything the government may have done which will assist and never a word of support for our national interests in Australia and abroad. Promise, promise, promise and mean none of it is what oppositions in this Parliament of a conservative type have always said and have always done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1952 we saw the last surplus Budget of a conservative government in Australia-in 1952. Sir Robert Menzies-Robert Menzies as he was then-took over in 1949 with false promises about what he would achieve in the Australian economy. We had a sound economy under Chifley, but within two boom years in the wool market and in other areas he had destroyed that economy and had Australia in deficit. For every year since then that a Liberal government has been in office there has been a deficit Budget. Promises have never been kept. He promised child endowment for the first child in 1949 and introduced it in 1950. When the Liberals went out of office in 1973 it was still at the same rate; never altered in 28 years. Yet the present Opposition talks about looking after the family. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the most callous things that I have seen in the time that I have been in politics is the misleading and disgusting series of advertisements that we saw recently in a mini-election campaign. We had a family struggling to pay off a home, probably in New South Wales where Greiner has put up every form of cost that it is possible to put up since he has been in office, and we saw the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) come on and say, `I'll reduce the top tax rate from 49c to 39c and that'll save her problems and she won't have to go to work'. The woman in that family was probably earning between $15,000 and $25,000 a year. Tell us some time how she will save money if the top tax rate is reduced. The Opposition would be more likely to throw her out of work, let alone improve her position. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members should have a look at their record. Australians were told through the 1950s, through the 1960s and also through the 1970s that all it was necessary for Australians to do was to get down on the beach and count the ships coming here to cart away our minerals; that that was the natural wealth of Australia and would pay for all of our future needs. That was the policy that destroyed our basic industries in this country. It gave them no support. In my electorate for major industry, textiles, was destroyed by the end of the 1960s. There was no reinvestment, no encouragement for investment, and no encouragement whatsoever for increased productivity or efficiency-because the government of the day saw minerals as the panacea for all ills and was never prepared to look at anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have an election coming up and it is about time that the Opposition told us how many Australians they intend to throw out of work under the policies, supposedly Thatcherite, that are being put forward by the economic spokesman for the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). The Leader of the Opposition obviously reads the economics papers. We saw one a few weeks ago he floated around the country-and I understand the adviser who wrote it has been sacked-about savings interest. Records count too, and it is not that long ago that the conservatives were managing this country-and they did so for a long period. What did they achieve? In my electorate, no kid could get a job; it was impossible. I will tell the House why they could not get a job-the economy was in such a mess because of the incompetence of the government of the day and its advisers. The honourable member for Wentworth was one of them, and Senator Stone was another. Because of the incompetence of that government and because the government never did anything it promised to do-not unusual for conservative governments-we had unemployment growing in this country, at a rate of 1,000 every working day when it went out of office. It tried to con the Australian people with the 1982 Budget and it was going to race off to an election in September, but it forgot about Costigan. It forgot that Costigan's report would be tabled in the Victorian Parliament, because it was a joint report. And what did it reveal? Scandalous corruption, mismanagement and tax evasion in this country which the Liberal Party Treasurer of the day had been notified of in early 1979 and still had not done anything about in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is a change of government at the next election and a conservative government with the policies the Opposition is putting forward now is inflicted on the Australian people, we can forget about the slogans about looking after the family. Unemployed families cannot pay their rent, and those opposite had unemployed families all over Australia and the policies they are advocating now, which they have not got the courage to spell out because they are not prepared to tell the truth, will mean more unemployment. There are over a million more Australians working today than when they went out of office seven years ago. Of course they say they can do better. I even hear people in here talking about how terrible the inflation rate is. It is only 50 per cent lower than when they went out of office, that is all. It is lower than in Thatcher's Britain, which they would copy if they had the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members have panaceas and slogans for everything, but their policies are the same as those which nearly destroyed Australia in the 1970s and 1980s. I wonder how many people in this House are aware that when in 1987 we reversed a $10 billion deficit projected under a Liberal Government, with its expertise in management and its competence-I have heard the speech over there so often that is almost painful-there was not one Commonwealth public servant working in Treasury or Finance who had been in those departments the last time we had a Consolidated Revenue surplus. They were not aware of what had to be done at the end of the financial year; no-one had ever experienced a surplus. We had had over 20 years of Liberal governments in that time. The Liberal Government achieved the biggest deficit in the history of Australia in its 1982 Budget. The reason was that the Budget was fraudulent, just like the 1972 Budget. These were immediately before an election which it was frightened of losing. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate kids can get jobs today. These kids have an opportunity to advance their education but do not have the privileges to get to the ivy league universities. People can live in dignity. There are problems in Australia and there will continue to be problems until we can restore the damage that was done by the indolence, the incompetence and the lies told to the Australian people during the period when the coalition government said, `You can dig coal, iron ore, bauxite and uranium out of the ground'. Who in this Parliament remembers Ministers standing at the table and telling Australians that the uranium industry would provide 500,000 jobs in Australia? That was in 1977 and some of those former Ministers are still in this chamber.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was rather sad to listen to the arrant nonsense that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) seemed to be re-cycling. It was the sort of thing he might have said when he was trying to get Labor endorsement because that was about the quality of the speech. As for content, there was not any. I have never heard such arrant nonsense. It is rather unfortunate that someone who has been in this Parliament as long as the honourable member has finds it so difficult to find anything worth while to say in a speech that should be important when we are talking about one of the most important Bills that faces the Parliament each year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this Budget marks the beginning of the closing chapter of the Australian Labor Party experiment of the 1980s. Labor has failed Australia. It has failed Australia both federally and in the States. We have seen the problems that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is about to inflict upon us. We have seen the problems that Labor is now inflicting on Victoria. We are seeing the mess in Western Australia. There is a common thread. It all starts with Labor and it all shows how the Labor Party, its principles and its policies are a failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Two weeks ago the Australian Government was given the opportunity to show its determination to push through important reforms for our economy-the chance to turn around the disaster which looms on our doorstep. Regrettably, the 1989 Budget was notable for its omissions rather than its content. Overall this failure summarises the problems facing Australia. It summarises the Government's failures to address the problem and it leaves Australia vulnerable in a way that we probably have not seen for over 40 years. It leaves all Australians facing a high risk future while all the Government can do is put its head in the sand and hope that the looming disaster will somehow miss us, hoping that with high interest rates we will still be like Voyager II, when somehow we can wind our way through the complexities of the world economic system without having a disastrous collision. </PARA>
<PARA> Worse still, the 1989 Budget Speech is full of half truths, full of misleading statements and full of claims that even the Treasurer must know can never be fulfilled. Well do we remember last year's infamous bringing home the bacon Budget, where our current account deficit, our balance of payments problems, were underestimated by a mere 80 per cent, where inflation figures were so wrong that one seriously has to question the Treasurer's credibility in the Budget forecast he makes this year. So serious is the future facing Australia right now, and even more serious because of the Government's failure in the Budget strategy, that I feel it is timely to remind honourable members of some history. It is a well known truism that those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is timely to give a brief summary of what happened in the lead-up to the depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s. In the case of the 1890s, the lead-up to the depression was marked by two factors-firstly, by a sustained rise and then a rapid fall in commodity prices and, secondly, by an inflow of capital which financed mainly long term and unproductive investment. From this the combination of falling commodity prices and the drying up of resources of funds plunged Australia into a depression. In the case of the 1930s Depression it was also characterised by a period of high commodity prices and, again, a large inflow of foreign capital. In the late 1920s there were basically three phases of contraction. First there was a severe liquidity crisis. The second was a balance of payments problem, and the third was a loss of export income. It would seem that while there are differences nonetheless we are now poised in a similar vulnerable position. It needs only one or two changes in our present economic state to see these situations being repeated. It is indeed timely to remember. </PARA>
<PARA> With the world economy now in its seventh year of growth one would have to be concerned. After all, growth does run in cycles and even though it is always difficult to predict the end of those cycles they do come around sooner or later. It is pertinent to note that the booms of the 1880s and the 1920s were characterised first by the rapid growth of both government and private debt and, secondly, by an increasingly fragile international trade and financial situation. It would not be drawing too long a bow to suggest that similar conditions are beginning to form, although maybe in the distance, as storm clouds on the economic horizon. </PARA>
<PARA> We are running a balance of payments deficit which rivals, if not equals, that of the 1920s and already some commodity prices are declining, which would suggest that our export income will not hold up. These warning signs are coming through in many ways. First, and probably most obvious, is that Australia's number one export commodity of the last financial year-namely, wool-is now facing a difficult marketing situation. Wool prices have declined by 25 per cent over the last 12 months and the Australian Wool Corporation, through its grower funded support scheme, is now buying in over 40 per cent of all wool currently sold. This means that over 40 per cent of Australia's number one export commodity is now being stockpiled and not exported. Should the Australian Wool Corporation continue to buy at the present rate-I am not suggesting that this will necessarily happen-it could wipe $2 billion off our exporting account just from this one commodity. It is frightening to think what would happen if other commodities were to follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament has heard from the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) on a number of occasions about what is happening to the tourism industry with the continuation of the pilots strike, a strike that was so stupidly fanned by the provocative statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) last week when he declared that there was going to be war on the pilots, something he somehow tried to forget this week. The effect on tourism could be equally savage. Again, that is one of our major export earners. It is little wonder that the chief economist of one of the big banks recently said, following the Budget, that the forecast Budget deficit of $18.5 billion-a forecast we have to dig fairly deep to find because the Treasurer does not talk about it too much and he does not tell us that it is yet another record-was likely to be very much understated and would be much more like $22 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background that the Government deserves to be condemned for its failure in its overall policies for the Australian economy. The Budget Speech was notable for its omissions. When the luck runs out they will be discovered and the Government will stand condemned in the history books from hereon in. The tragedy of it all is that, while we have had several years of high commodity prices and an opportunity to reduce our exposure to overseas pressures, the Government has squandered that opportunity. It has allowed high commodity prices to mask the shaky economic strategy that it has pursued and it has left Australia extremely vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government likes to use superlatives but it omits to use the ones that are frightening the living daylights out of all thinking Australians. The rate at which we are going into debt and current account problems, as I have already mentioned, are likely to be significantly greater than the Treasurer dares admit. We have seen this country going into the red to the tune of $50m a day. It is a record about which the Treasurer does not trumpet. The Government should hang its head in shame. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Treasurer's Budget Speech-a speech that one always used to believe was reasonably accurate and factual, rather than one that was based on rhetoric-he made a number of claims. I will deal specifically with some of those claims to show that his speech was full of half truths and was not the sort of speech that a responsible Treasurer should deliver. Certainly, it does not stand up to the test of close scrutiny. The Treasurer referred to the situation the coalition Government left in 1983 and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Then Australia's Budget was in the red by a record $9 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>Everyone knows that that is just not true. Furthermore, it is known by the Treasurer to be untrue. The last Budget of the Fraser Government-the 1982-83 Budget-had a deficit of $4.3 billion and it was March 1983 when the present Labor Government came to power-nearly four months before the end of the 1982-83 financial year. So the Treasurer's claims in his Budget Speech are patently untrue. Further on in his speech the Treasurer projected forward three years to show the likely reduction in Government spending. Are those projections to carry the same weight as his forecasts for the current account deficit and inflation last year? It would seem that the Treasurer has learnt nothing from his past mistakes. At page 2 of his speech he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Real government spending is cut for the fourth year in succession . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to Budget Statement No. 1, which states at page 3.4:</PARA>
<PARA> Excluding the impact of asset sales, real outlays are expected to increase by 0.1% in 1989-90 and 1.3% in 1990-91 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, for some strange, quirky reason, asset sales are deducted from outlays. I will not question why that has been done, but I would say that, when the Treasurer claims that real government spending is falling and then has to rely on the fact that asset sales are needed to reach that outcome, it is highly misleading. Furthermore, that is compounded by the fact that, when we take out the cuts that have been inflicted on the States, we find that Commonwealth Government spending has increased by 0.9 per cent. So again the Treasurer is misleading in what he says. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Government of what the Reserve Bank has said about the state of the economy and what Moody's Investor Services Inc. said when it downgraded our credit rating again. It has done that twice since the Treasurer had held that position. It is a record which no other Treasurer in this nation has been able to claim, and surely even the current Treasurer must be ashamed of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to see some real effort made on micro-economic reform. We are sick of hearing nothing but details of report after report, meeting after meeting, and so on. Despite the fact that the Prime Minister said that in this term the Government would concentrate on micro-economic reform, to date we have seen nothing but a few more reports and a lot of hot air. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's failure to address the fundamental problems facing Australia leaves us vulnerable in a way that most Australians alive today have never known. It is a concern that must be eating into the future thoughts of all families. It must leave all those who care about this nation wondering how on earth the stewardship of this great country could be put into such irresponsible hands. The 1989-90 Budget Speech will go down as one of the great failures and, as I said earlier, it will mark the beginning of the chapter of the end of the Labor experiment of the 1980s in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by reminding honourable member of a warning given by one of Australia's leading businessmen and most responsible people, Sir Arvi Parbo, the Chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, which is Australia's largest public company. Three weeks ago Sir Arvi warned us that debt will ruin us if we do not start to cut it. I urge all honourable members to heed that warning because, as Sir Arvi pointed out, time is running out; the luck could run out. If we do not start to turn around the burgeoning growth of our overseas debt, this country's future will be bleak. That future will rest very much in the hands of the present Government. I suggest that the people of Australia will judge the Australian Labor Party very harshly for the irresponsible way it has handled this nation's finances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who has just resumed his seat, I might have suspected that the Opposition had a coherent alternative set of policies to deal with our current economic difficulties. However, the Opposition never puts forward an alternative policy that begins to make any kind of sense. That has been the case each year that the present Government has brought down its annual Budget and, if the debate so far is any indication, it is certainly true of the current Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition suggested that certain inflation adjustments be made to the tax system. Those suggestions were made some weeks before the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) replied to the Budget Speech and they seem to have disappeared into thin air. They have been mentioned less and less as the basic difficulties and untenability of what the Opposition put forward became more apparent. There was also an absurd proposal for a two-tier tax system. That makes no arithmetical sense when it is set against other commitments that the Opposition has made to eliminate other forms of tax and revenue raising measures. The Opposition says that it would cut expenditure in order to facilitate changes in the tax structure, but it has not said how it would do so. All we get from the Opposition is some nebulous reference to the benefits that would flow from micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if one accepted the view that the reforms which the Opposition advocates would yield benefits, they would not be benefits that would become available in the timeframe necessary to affect the current Budget in any significant way, unless one considers asset sales which, as the previous speaker pointed out, produce a spurious impact on the Budget accounts. What the Opposition singularly lacks is a coherent policy framework or alternative. That is the case this year and it has been the case every year the Government has brought down a Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In these debates the Opposition refers to what are perceived as negatives in the current economic outlook. It looks selectively at economic statistics and attempts to present the situation in the most unfavourable light. Under current circumstances, it fixes its attention on the current account deficit. The nature of the current account deficit and its significance must be considered seriously along with the concomitant question of our accumulation of foreign debt, what that means and what appropriate policies there are to deal with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reminding ourselves that there are some pretty positive indicators in the most recent sets of economic statistics. Often, of course, the Opposition fails deliberately to refer to them, but at present there are some fundamental strengths in the economy. Firstly, there is employment growth in 1989-90 of 4.1 per cent, which continues a long pattern of strong employment growth, a total of 1.5 million jobs having been created since the change of government, and there has been a significant reduction in the unemployment rate. Looking at the June quarter this year on the June quarter last year, there has been a fall in unemployment from 7.5 per cent to 6.1 per cent, despite a growth in the participation rate. If the participation rate now in the economy-that is the proportion of people of working age actively seeking work-were the same now as it was at the time of the change of government, then unemployment would be significantly lower again than it is. That is not to say that the unemployment position is satisfactory. Certain economists would maintain, and this is said explicitly in Budget Statement No. 2, that if we look at certain sectors of the economy and certain regions, we are getting close to full employment as economists conventionally define the term. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an achievement the significance of which cannot be understated. It does not worry the Opposition, of course-it is not interested in that-but the ability of people to sustain high living standards is clearly related to the growth in employment. A related statistic is the continued growth in household disposable incomes. Despite the real wage restraint that has gone on-in fact there have been real wage reductions over the last few years-household disposable incomes have risen on average by 2.6 per cent per annum over the past six years. So that is the other side of that strong employment growth, and the strong profit growth that has also characterised the current period. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the longer term, what is of enormous significance is the growth in investment. The Budget statements make clear that a very impressive performance is being turned in on that front. Over the past five years there has been average investment growth of 10.8 per cent real per annum compared with an average 2.2 per cent in the previous 15 years. What that reflects is the installation of productive capacity in the Australian economy that has the potential to address our balance of trade and current account deficit problems over the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it needs to be stressed that there is a close relationship between the investment surge that we are experiencing at the moment and the state of the current account balance. The most strongly growing component of demand which has contributed to this current account deficit problem we have been experiencing in the current year and to the fact that it has turned out to be a lot bigger than anticipated has been imports of capital goods. The Budget Papers I think show a 43 per cent increase in endogenous capital goods imports which, while it certainly creates a short term problem as perceived by the financial press in terms of the current account deficit, the balance of trade deficit, does indicate that the groundwork is being laid for increasing the productive capacity of the Australian economy, thereby increasing its capacity to export goods and to replace imports in the future. The importance of that needs to be emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been quite a debate in the media and in the financial press in recent weeks about the significance of the current account deficit and external indebtedness. Perhaps the most well known exponent of the view that it is not anything like the problem that it is made out to be is Professor Pitchford of the Australian National University, who wrote a lengthy article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review recently. While I would not say that Statement No. 2 totally endorses Professor Pitchford's view-that would be a misrepresentation-it certainly emphasises the aspect that a current account deficit, if it reflects large imports of capital goods, has its good side as well. Another recent contribution to this debate which I will just quote briefly is by Ian Harper and G. C. Lim of the Department of Economics at the University of Melbourne, in an article in the current edition of Australian Economic Review entitled `Is Monetary Policy Too Tight?'. There is obviously not time today to go into this sort of debate in any detail, so I will just quote briefly from the article:</PARA>
<PARA> With the release each month of the latest statistics on the balance of payments comes a round of public hand-wringing by politicians and journalists over the size of the current account deficit. The Australian public is admonished for consuming beyond its means and indulging a taste for expensive foreign imports. There seems little appreciation of the fact that the size of the surplus on capital account renders a large deficit on current account inevitable, at least without substantial foreign exchange market intervention by the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> There might be ground for concern if the surplus on capital account were being absorbed by the public sector to finance a deficit in its current expenditure. One could then ask whether adequate provision had been made by the public sector for the repayment of the debt so incurred. However, the budget of the Commonwealth Government has been in substantial surplus in each of the past two years and that of the public sector as a whole is roughly in balance. The funds being drawn in through the capital account of the balance of payments are therefore financing private sector investment. </PARA>
<PARA>I give that quotation just to emphasise the point that there is a connection between the current account deficit and this very large investment surge that has taken place, which implies that there are some very strong positives in the current situation as well as negatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall conclude by making a couple of observations. There are some areas of concern. One is, of course, that one can ask where that investment is being directed. Is it going into the internationally traded goods sector? That is a key concern and is something about which there is some degree of ambiguity. A very high proportion of that capital investment is going into the financial services sector, although the most recent investment survey published by the Bureau of Statistics shows that while by far the strongest growth is in the finance sector, there is expected in 1989-90 to be also very strong growth in the manufacturing sector. So that is an encouraging sign. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I have some concerns about the sustainability of that, given the type of exchange rate system we have. I am a little worried that if monetary policy remains too strong and our currency is valued more highly than it ought to be from the point of view of the competitiveness of industry, we will see a continuation of one other negative in the current situation, and that is a very high import penetration ratio-the ratio of imports to sales. One of the dilemmas in a floating exchange rate system is that tight monetary policy means higher dollar, means our industries are less competitive internationally, means a switching of expenditure to imports. That is one of the perverse effects of the current policy approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Opposition points to negatives. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), referred to that sort of point in his contribution to one of the recent debates. What he fails to mention is the fact that he himself is on record as criticising the Government for the fact that monetary policy was not tightened more strongly earlier than it was. So there is no coherency or sense in what the Opposition has to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, there are a few simple facts that of course are not understood by trade union bureaucrats and people who have never conducted a business, whether large or small. In fact there are some simple rules that always apply. The first one is that if one borrows money one must pay it back. In our environment and our society, one also pays interest. The only difference between a Commonwealth Budget and that small business budget is the noughts on the end of the figures. All the same rules apply. They also apply to a typical household, and every woman who manages a household budget knows very well that if her family goes out and borrows $10,000 or $50,000 they look pretty rich during the period of its expenditure but they find themselves in great difficulty if they have not invested that money wisely and it is not able to repay itself. This is something that is totally misunderstood by that trade union bureaucrat who today presents himself as the Treasurer of Australia who came to this place when he was 24 years old with no skills in business and no academic training, and then stood up here and proclaimed himself the world's best treasurer. That is his background. Of course, he is aided and abetted by a Prime Minister who has had two or three goes at business in his days at the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). They were notable for one thing: they went broke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue before us is the Budget. Let me tell honourable members what it says. It tells us that our trade deficit for the forthcoming year will be at least $18.5 billion, that inflation will continue at 7.5 per cent, that home loan interest rates will be at least 17 per cent and that business and farming interest rates will be 20 to 24 per cent. It tells us that revenue collections by way of taxation will be $91,325m, up from $41,183m in the last Fraser Budget. The amount of tax collected in the seven years since the Hawke Government came to office has more than doubled. Documents released yesterday show that we now owe the world $108 billion net and that we are spending in excess of 17 per cent of our export earnings in interest alone. </PARA>
<PARA> When we divide the 1.5 million jobs that the Treasurer refers to so proudly in his Budget Speech into the additional almost $100 billion of the debt that we have contracted under the Treasurer's economic management we arrive at a figure of $60,000 a job-four or five years wages per job, particularly remembering, as we are never told, that 30 per cent of the jobs in that 1.5 million are part time. To create those jobs we have borrowed every penny of the wages paid from the rest of the world. That is where the money has come from. It is very noticeable when one looks at the job growth areas-primarily wholesaling and retailing, with a little bit in manufacturing. Wholesaling and retailing what? The goods manufactured by energetic people in the countries of the world that know what growth in labour productivity means. </PARA>
<PARA> What else do the Budget Papers tell us? They tell us that the Treasurer has not had enough. I am astounded by the speculation we get in the press and from the Treasurer and other members of the Government about what the Liberals might do in terms of taxation. Let me tell honourable members what the Australian Labor Party has done. It has introduced a capital gains tax. I read the other day of a couple who sold part of their existing operating business, which they had owned well before the threshold date, to a fuel company because they wanted to pay off their debts so that they would no longer suffer the 24 per cent interest rate burden. They sold a lease on their existing operating freehold business. That was immediately deemed a new asset by the Commissioner of Taxation. Instead of clearing their debt, they still owe $85,000 because that was what the Tax Commissioner raked off from that simple transaction, notwithstanding that they have lowered the value of their asset which they had owned well before the threshold date. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is also the fringe benefits tax that the Treasurer said was a means of putting sandwiches back in the brown paper bags of the people on the trams. That was the purpose of that. It was being done for fairness. One thousand two hundred million dollars later there are no more sandwiches in the brown paper bags. We know that the tax burden of low income earners, as admitted by the Economic Planning Advisory Council, has increased further under this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> What about company tax? We specially went to quarterly payments of company tax to even out the effect on the financial system but the Treasurer tells us in his Budget Speech that he has been lending people their own money and that it has got to stop. He will bring back company tax payments-please remember that not every company is a big business-and thousands of small businesses run under corporate structures will have to pay their tax on 15 July, 15 days after the end of the financial year. It is called a notional tax and nobody has yet explained how people who do not get it right at the first attempt in 15 days will be treated when they pay the 85 per cent of their estimate. Will it be like provisional tax where, if people get it 10 per cent wrong, they will be treated like a tax dodger-fined and penalised? It is time the Treasurer explained that. </PARA>
<PARA> Other things have come to our notice in recent times. We have had Moody's Investor Services and the Reserve Bank of Australia trying to tell this Government that there are things wrong with its economic management-simple things that any housewife could work out in a minute if she saw her family debt explode at the rate that it is exploding in this nation. What is the Government's response? It wants to shoot the messenger. It accuses one of the two largest credit rating agencies in the world of playing politics. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was on his feet the other day. His mind is so attuned to politics that he does not think there are any honest people in the world. He has a political response to everything. He cannot see that this Government's economic management is killing our country and that people are just telling him the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> When our own Reserve Bank joined the ranks of the Prime Minister's critics, he thumbed through the pages of their report to find a line that would congratulate him, whilst ignoring the major statements that tell him `Prime Minister, you have got it wrong. Please fix it before it is too late'. That is the message. These people do not dislike him. They do not want to replace him as Prime Minister. To suggest that Moody's has some political intent on little old Australia is absurd. Some of Moody's clients would turn over more money than this nation. Its reputation has to be protected. And the Prime Minister accuses them of playing politics! What is the basis of the message? We find in the newspapers today that in two or three months the Australian Wool Corporation has stockpiled half a million bales of wool and paid the woolgrowers, giving them the opportunity to buy perhaps an imported header or another piece of farm machinery. But Australia has still got the wool. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool and tourism are our two biggest industries. Half of our wool is not being exported, and we have a pilots' strike-and the Prime Minister only wants to play politics with that. He was playing war games one day; the next day he wanted to accuse the Opposition because it said, `Prime Minister, how will you fix it? How will you get check pilots when the ones we have say they will not license anyone, will not license all these people you say you are getting from the rest of the world when countries in the rest of the world have their recruiters over here?'. One airline alone is looking for 300 pilots. Our whole national tourism industry, employing 450,000 people, is on its knees. Our two biggest industries, in terms of their contribution to alleviating our national debt, are on their knees, and the Prime Minister plays politics. He wants to shoot the messenger. One might wonder what he is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the housing sector, my direct responsibility. What did I find there today? Housing approvals for July 1989 are 12,015, down from the June 1989 figure of 15,360. The Australian Bureau of Statistics tells us that that fall of 3,000 in a month is the biggest monthly fall since 1977. We find that it is also a drop of 3,000 compared to last July. The Government says, `That is great! That is a sign that the Australian economy is cooling off'. It is freezing in the housing sector, and it says nothing of the damage that is being done to all the others who are locked into their houses because they believed a prime minister and a treasurer who told them interest rates were falling. We do not know who is hurting most-those that own a home or those that would like to build one. But it is just another message. We are being told, `Don't worry about that. That's a good sign'. I do not know that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more silly things about today is that the Government has added 40 more members to this place, and each of us has 10 minutes to speak on the Appropriation Bills of the Budget. My time has run out before I have dealt with all sorts of serious matters, without mentioning the Treasurer's remarks the other day about interest rates. This is just another example of this Goebbels technique of telling a lie often enough so that eventually people believe it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will close on this point, in the interests of my colleagues. At Question Time the Treasurer told us that part of the continuing story of success in fiscal policy-meaning his own-is the decline in public debt interest, which was one of the fastest growing components of the outlays and is now one of the fastest declining components. That is all true. It went up dramatically under the Labor Government and is now slowly coming down. We find that this year it has come down by $123m compared to $1,200m worth of asset sales! But what is more important is that when we compare this Labor Government with the previous Fraser Government-Government members spend half their time talking about that rather than the future-we see that during the last seven years of Fraser public debt interest averaged $2.296m per annum or 6.7 per cent of government outlays. Over a seven-year period under Keating--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always enjoyable to follow the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the usual diatribes that he produces in this House. He always accuses Government members of playing politics. I admire him for being one of those fortunate individuals in this House who never plays politics!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise to support the Government's Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which contains details of estimates for ordinary annual government services. In an election year it would have been easy for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to have brought down a soft Budget, an election type Budget. But rightly, the Treasurer has shown that he is not prepared to do that. He has quite clearly said that he shuns what he calls gimmicks and quick fixes. The situation of this country is such that we certainly do not want gimmicks and quick fixes. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past I have spoken in this House about the economic problems facing this country. During his speech the honourable member for O'Connor mentioned the $108 billion which we owe abroad. One thing that the Opposition has to remember is this: Australia has traditionally been a capital importing country. We started with virtually nothing and we had to build up with money obtained from abroad. We have always had a high debt ratio in terms of our gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is a responsible Budget. For the fourth year in a row the Treasurer has kept spending increases below the level of inflation with outlays predicted to rise by $4.6 billion, or 5.6 per cent, against a predicted rise in inflation of about 7 1/2 per cent. This has enabled a surplus of just over $9 billion to be predicted. This will be used to retire the Government's debt. This compares with the deficit financing which seems to have been the hallmark of the Opposition over past years. I remind Opposition members that it was the Fraser Government, with the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as Treasurer, which in 1982-83 gave this country the first negative growth in 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last financial year, 1988-89 spending in the Australian economy grew much faster than what the nation produced. That is simply where we are at in terms of our economy. Whilst it is true that some of the spending by business on investment in equipment will generate big returns in future years, much of the spending was in non-productive areas. This has led to a widening gap in our balance of payments, with a consequential rise in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget has three key elements which will establish a framework for lower interest rates. The first element is the increase in the surplus, to which I have already referred, from $5.9 billion to $9.1 billion, which will further build public savings. The second element will be a slowing in the spending growth of the economy from about 7 3/4 per cent last year to 2 per cent this year. The final element will be an improvement in the balance of payments as 1989-90 progresses. These are predictions and they are always liable to be wrong, as we found in the previous year. The stark reality is that in the longer term Australia must increase its production so that we do not have to cut our rate of spending. We need an efficient, well managed and productive economic base. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the success stories of this Government's economic management is its use of the surplus from the last three Budgets to pay off debt. The Commonwealth's foreign currency debt has fallen from $15.1 billion as at 30 June 1987 to $9.3 billion as at 30 June 1989. The Government also repaid $2.2 billion of domestic debt in 1987-88, and it has repaid a further $2.7 billion in 1988-89. The Government's record contrasts favourably with that of the Opposition. Between 1975-76 and 1982-83, total net overseas raisings were $4.5 billion. Between 1983-84 and 1988-89 this Government has repaid, in net terms, a total of $1.5 billion. It is estimated that using these surpluses to pay off debt has allowed Australia to save $2 billion in interest. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of studies in recent years have shown that lower income families, pensioners and beneficiaries renting privately are among the least well off in the community. In last year's Budget, for the first time, an extra payment was made available to families with children in recognition of the extra costs they face. The level of rent assistance has again been increased for those families. These increases will be paid in addition to those already announced and will effectively double rent assistance. The real value of that rent assistance will be preserved because the assistance will be indexed to the cost of living. If one takes into consideration the grant of over $1 billion provided by the Federal Government to the States in 1989-90 for the provision of public housing to low income groups, one sees that these increases represent a major initiative to reduce housing related poverty amongst the aged and other low income groups. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to commend the Government on its retirement income policy which is fully detailed in the document Better Incomes: Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century which was issued by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe). This policy is part of the Government's social justice strategy which is about making a fair go for all a reality and redressing inequities in the Australian society. The retirement incomes policy is a commitment by the Government to maintain and improve the age pension while providing better opportunities and incentives for people to increase their living standards in retirement by adding to their income through greater self provision. Whilst the latest changes do not diminish the choice of retirees to take their superannuation entitlements as a lump sum it will allow those who wish to do so to use the lump sum to ensure a continual income to purchase an annuity from a life assurance office. </PARA>
<PARA> From April 1990 the social security income test will be put on the same basis as the tax system so that only the earnings part of the annuity payment and not the return of capital will be taken into account in the income test. This will significantly increase pension payments to people who purchase annuities. Tax deductions for personal superannuation contributions have been substantially increased. At present there is a tax deduction of up to $3,000 a year for the personal superannuation contributions of self-employed persons and employees who are not covered by any employer sponsored superannuation scheme or whose only employer support is under an industrial award scheme-the 3 per cent scheme. From 1 July 1990 self-employed persons and employees without employer sponsored superannuation will be allowed full tax deductions each year for the first $3,000 of contributions and for 75 per cent of the excess of any contribution over $3,000. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is at a premium in this debate I would just like to finish by referring briefly to a number of other key Budget initiatives. The Government, I am very pleased to say, has responded to the Burdekin report on youth homelessness with a four-year $100m package including increased housing assistance, major improvements in income support, important means to improve the participation in education of disadvantaged young people, upgrading of labour market assistance, and community based health services. There is a $40m package to improve the health of Australian women, an extra $15m to be distributed under the existing mortgage and rent relief scheme, an increase of more than $40m over the next two years for sport, a 64 per cent increase to $118.4m in funding for environmental programs, as well as funding for soil conservation, which is up from $9.8m to $23.2m. It is clear that whilst this Budget is not an election Budget it is a sensible Budget which has been framed in the light of difficult economic circumstances and I congratulate the Treasurer on the Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget strategy of continued high interest rates, high taxes, high inflation and a record current account and foreign debt will not put value back into the Australian dollar. Whilst pensioners will be helped by rises in pension rates this financial year, the increase will not fully cover cost rises and that is worrying every pensioner in this country. There is little hope of a decline in interest rates appearing on the horizon for a long time to come. The Budget contains no relief for those paying off home loans and those wanting to build or buy a home. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has virtually given up on his promise in the Budget of last year to get inflation down and this will have a severe effect on the development of housing, an essential need in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Cost rises through inflation-the Budget now predicts 7.5 per cent-will place a continuing burden on every section of the community. The recognition of the squeeze being placed on pensioners is overdue and the increase in pensions promised in the Budget and which of course will in the main not take effect until next April will for the first time lift the pension entitlement to the promised 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Of course the Hawke Government promised this increase for several years but until now has backed off the implementation of this promise. The higher permissible earning for pensioners in the long term and the lift in the tax threshold will of course help. The fine print in all of the proposals relating to the aged and in particular to superannuation has yet to emerge in real detail. No doubt there will be debates in this House when the required legislation is before the chamber. I am concerned because all of this is a spectacle, deferring the real issue. That real issue is the cost escalation, the inflation rate was and the high debt that this nation faces. </PARA>
<PARA> The long term proposals, of course, may well be to the advantage of the older section of the community in a period of, say, a decade. Unless there are changes to the financial approach of the Government, unless we see an effective remedy to the problems confronting us, even those designed to help the aged will have a limit placed on them. Of course the real issues come down to productivity and to the recognition of the sale of our bulk products from this country. What do we find? There is nothing in the Budget that gives an incentive to the productive sector of the community. This is evident particularly so far as the farming sector is concerned. Without increased productivity, without the opportunity to sell on the world market and to try to restore a balance in our overseas commitments, then every section of the Australian community is placed at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget made absolutely no attempt to enhance the competitive ability of primary industry and of manufacturing because of the high cost built into this Budget and the effect that that will have. Of course interest rates are the main issue. Unless the Government comes to grips with the need for increased productivity then we cannot expect to see an improvement in the overall prospects. I want to come shortly to an aspect that has been, I am sorry to say, denied by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). No way in the world has this been recognised by the Treasurer; yet it is significant as far as this nation is concerned. I refer to the ever growing debt that is being established by the processes of the corporate sector of this nation simply because it is pushed into that process. Let us just take the tax structure as we find it as a result of this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much said by the Government and by the Treasurer about a reduction in personal taxation from 1 July. The truth of the matter is that despite that reduction we still have an overall increase of 9.7 per cent in total taxation compared to the previous financial year. If we take individual tax it is up by 8 per cent. If we take the various components of tax there is an incredible escalation. As has been mentioned by previous speakers in this debate, such areas as capital gains tax, of course, become an enormous burden to sections of the community that really are the source of employment and, as a consequence of this tax structure, will not be able to perform in the remainder of this financial year and in following financial years because the damage will already have been done. It will be too late. It was too late when the mini-Budget was handed down in April. It was too late a week and a half ago, yet the Treasurer and the Prime Minister want to deny that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about Australia's net foreign debt, which now stands at $108 billion. The Prime Minister tells this chamber, `That is not related to an escalation in the public sector commitment'. That may well be true, but there is no way that one can separate the public sector commitment from the overall commitment. Let us look at the percentages. We find that government debt-Federal, State and, of course, the various instrumentalities of government-accounts for about 48 per cent of that total debt, while private sector debt accounts for something in excess of 50 per cent of the debt. I am concerned that those corporations that are the big employers in this country have an enormous debt commitment. The borrowings of companies such as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Bond Corporation, Elder IXL Ltd, TNT Ltd, and many others constitute 50 per cent of our foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is pertinent to draw attention to the fact that there has been an explosion in the provision of credit. It is not a case of public sector extravagance; the explosion has been caused by the Government's policies. There has been an enormous speculative boom. In the 12 months to May, the level of credit increased by $52 billion or 21 per cent, compared to the previous 12 months. In my view, that is dangerous. Various parts of the corporate sector are facing extreme difficulty. The shareholders, the customers, are worried, and rightly so. This is occurring because of the Government's policies, which are forcing this very unwise strategy. The Government has done nothing to try to correct it. While the United States balance of payments is falling fast, Australia's is going in the opposite direction. That is one of the reasons for the decision made two days ago by Moody's Investors Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer denies the consequences of these elements which are so vital to our overall economy. He talks of the need for high interest rates to contain the present economic situation. Evidence gathered as late as today reveals an 18 per cent fall in housing starts. This means, in effect, that we are not strangling those elements in this country that are so vital for employment and for the basic well-being of small business and the family unit. We are not recognising that the policies that have been contained in the last several Budgets are not working. They are not correcting the dangers that this country faces. All in all, the Budget is a tragedy for the average Australian and for the average Australian family. It places on the people of this country a burden that is far beyond what they deserve to carry in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time for the Government to realise the folly of its policies and take action which will correct the unfortunate trends that are so evident. What must one do to get the Government to realise that something is wrong? Moody's report has been virtually dismissed by the Government. Of course, there are elements within the corporate sector that do likewise, because unless they toe the line with the Government's policy they will be in even greater difficulty. I hope that in the months ahead much of our corporate sector will realise the enormity of this problem and will face up to the real issues. I hope that they will tell the Government that this is a dangerous situation and that, in particular, they will look at the commitment aspect as opposed to the asset aspect, if I can put it that way. In other words, spending beyond one's means and raising capital to do so is dangerous for the nation, and this must be recognised before it is too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am somewhat bewildered. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson), said that the Opposition would provide a softer economic policy. The Opposition is actually saying that the Government should loosen policy, lower interest rates and allow more money into the economy. That is, without doubt, what the previous speaker was saying. During the last six years there has been a change in understanding and perception by the community which clearly has not been grasped by the previous speaker or by some other Opposition members who have spoken this evening. The Australian community nowadays is literate, educated and sophisticated. It no longer comprises the uninformed people who accepted pap for decades. They now follow the economy. They follow interest rates and exchange rates. For two years they have been asking the Opposition, `What is the alternative? What would you do?' We have heard the answer: `Corporations in Australia will soon wake up and realise that things are wrong'. Corporations have also been saying to the Opposition for two years, `Tell us what your alternatives are so that we can weigh them up'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This country needs a good economic debate. It needs a good understanding of what is happening. It needs to weigh up the pros and cons of the various philosophies and ideologies, and the perceptions of the various sectional interest groups. It is not getting that debate. We are getting the same old pap that we have been getting for 30 or 40 years. Quite frankly, it does not wash any more. People look at the opinion polls and say, `This is quite hard to understand. Interest rates are at historically high levels. The Government should be a million miles behind. Why isn't it?'. The answer, very simply, is that the Opposition is dishing out last decade's rhetoric. People are not accepting it. People will not fall for it. They want to hear something of substance. </PARA>
<PARA> The most spectacular aspect of this Budget is the change that will develop and has developed in recent years in Australia's net savings. Let us look at the history, and at the rhetoric of the past. Let us look at things such as transfer pricing. I can recall that when I was much younger those on the other side lauded the development of bauxite mining at Gove, the wonderful deal that was being done, and how great it was for Australia. The previous Government presided for 20 years over a transfer pricing policy which meant that there were no profits to Australia. Nothing came back to Australia. The profit was made somewhere else. This Government had to clean up the matter. It took court action to prove that profits were being made, that the prices were artificially low, and had been low for decades. That is the kind of investment that occurred in the past. It is the kind of investment that was necessary because the conservative government, during all the years it was in power, failed to establish an investment capacity in Australia. It failed to establish a capacity for Australians to invest in Australia, because there was no savings pool. If one compares the savings pools in Germany, Japan, Sweden and Holland to ours over the last 30 or 40 years, one must ask: Who was responsible? We will see in the next decade the most dramatic buildup in savings that any nation except Japan has seen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on your recent appointment. I will take the opportunity in this adjournment debate to get a few things off my chest, despite the late hour and despite the lack of numbers in the chamber. In my maiden speech in this place last year I was critical of the standard of parliamentary debate and of the apparent egotistical one-upmanship which occurs, one would say, too frequently on the floor of this House. This week has been no exception to those undesirable tendencies. What I think we need to recognise on both sides of the chamber is that the Australian people are fed up to the back teeth with party politics and with self-centred prima donna politicians. Increasingly the people are saying to us explicitly and implicitly that we are not doing well enough, that we have lost touch, and increasingly they are searching for parliamentarians, not crass politicians, who will evaluate the issues, make objective assessments of their ramifications, come to considered conclusions and apply them in the broad national interest. While I remain a very proud member of the Liberal Party, sometimes such an approach may call for a modicum of personal fortitude and may even on occasion result in a divergence from a party line. So be it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I may be relatively inexperienced in the machinations of this place, but I must say that too often I hear the term `politician'; too little I hear the term `parliamentarian'; and very rarely indeed do I hear the term `statesmanship' in the corridors of this Parliament. Robert Gordon Menzies and Ben Chifley were able to combine these three attributes effectively. Why can we not take a leaf out of their book, and why can we not try to return the people's House to the cut and thrust of debate with reasonable dignity rather than degenerate in the extreme to an unruly bunch of opportunists. It is about time that we all got our feet back on the ground. It is about time that we asked ourselves what we can do for the nation rather than what it can do for us. It is clearly about time that we attempted in the Parliament to put this country back onto an even keel before it capsizes into a Third World economic whirlpool. </PARA>
<PARA> All of that said, the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) this afternoon on the contribution of Australian men and women in the Second World War, as we move towards the fiftieth anniversary of that catastrophe on Sunday next, gave me some heart that statesmanship may not be a lost art after all. I have been as critical of the Prime Minister in this place in the last year as anyone on this side of the House. However, what he said in this place this afternoon was said with dignity, with genuine feeling, and with an obvious sense of deep national pride and gratitude to all those who gave their lives for their country. The same could be said for the contributions to that motion by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt). Both gave very moving commentary on a matter of great national significance and from a personal viewpoint I take the opportunity to repeat the central thrust of that motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to reaffirm my deep and continuing gratitude to those Australian men and women who served their country in that war, both overseas and at home, and my sympathy to the families and friends of those who died or were wounded in combat. I resolve to ensure that the sacrifices of those men and women were not made in vain, by meeting our nation's continuing defence and security responsibilities and by working to preserve and extend the goals for which the war was fought-a peaceful world in which the human rights and democratic aspirations of all men and women are inviolate. It behoves us all in this place to work to that end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I proceed to my subject matter, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) on the five-minute speech he has just made. It is the type of speech that I, and I am sure other members on both sides of the chamber, would like to hear more often in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I wish to speak on an issue of concern to my electorate of Moore. I have spoken in the past in this House about the extremely rapid population growth of the City of Wanneroo. In 1969, when I moved into the area, it was a shire with a population of 6,000. Today it is a city with a population of 170,000 and can lay claim to being the fastest growing municipality in Australia. The effect of this growth, which is still continuing, is to demonstrate a lack of Commonwealth services in the area. I have raised the issue of inadequate Commonwealth services repeatedly with Ministers since 1983. Without suitable accommodation, services such as employment placement through the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) and the delivery of social services through the Department of Social Security (DSS) cannot be provided to the residents of the City of Wanneroo. </PARA>
<PARA> As early as 8 February 1984 the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Don Grimes, stated to me that consideration had been given to the establishment of a new social security office in the then Shire of Wanneroo and it was included in the overall plan which the Department had drawn up to provide services to the outer metropolitan suburbs of Perth. He also stated that it was unlikely that an office would be operational until 1985-86. It is now the financial year 1989-90 and I am still waiting. In the same month, February 1984, I wrote to the then Minister for Administrative Services, the present honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). This letter set out in detail the need for a Commonwealth centre building within the shire. It is an obvious fact that as the electorate grows northwards along the coast the newer areas are further removed from existing services located in the south and south-east of Wanneroo. As nothing eventuated from these actions I again raised the issue of the lack of Commonwealth services in March 1987. This was when I received advice of the relocation of a CES office further south, away from the new growth areas. </PARA>
<PARA> A letter I wrote to the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations reflected my anger at the time and the increasing frustration which remains with me today. The Minister's response indicated that a proposal for the development of a Commonwealth centre was under consideration at that time. I am still waiting. Late in 1988 my colleague Senator Jim McKiernan and I approached the Treasurer (Mr Keating) seeking the location of a proposed new Australian Taxation Office within the City of Wanneroo. Whilst the Treasurer was sympathetic, he gave strong reasons why he could not agree to it. He obviously was not able to assist in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In the autumn parliamentary session I discussed with the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) the problem which Commonwealth departments were having in finding suitable accommodation in the City of Wanneroo. A survey of departmental needs for both the present and future was carried out, but there is still no commitment to the siting of either a CES office or a DSS office in the Moore electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the considerable disadvantages faced by people in my electorate who wish access to Federal Government services. We have a ridiculous situation of clients having to catch public transport into Perth and then another bus back to the nearest office. I strongly urge the Federal Government again to reconsider its priorities so that better services can be provided for the clients of both the CES and DSS who are living within the City of Wanneroo. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to your new position. I am deeply concerned over the future prospect for community pharmacies in Australia, especially in rural Australia. The events of the day do little to reassure me that we have less reason for concern. The cuts recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal would if implemented constitute an astonishing savaging of pharmacists' incomes. The proposed cuts of 23 per cent would reduce pharmacists' incomes by an average of $30,000 per annum, on top of the 12 per cent cuts made over the last 12 months. What sort of reward is that for people who spend years studying and who then go on to take the entrepreneurial risks involved in setting up shop? Most of these people have taken great personal and financial risks, often seeing no economic return on their educational and capital investment until relatively late in their working lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What sorts of signals are we sending out into the community and especially to our young people-the very people that we need to encourage to train, to study and, in this case, to go on and set up business exercises? It seems to me that we are telling them that the pursuit of professional training and excellence, let alone the risk and worry associated with setting up and running a small business, is something that we as a society will not value or reward. This Government, lamentably, seems to condone that signal. The results will cost Australia ever more dearly, especially if we continue to discriminate unfairly against rural people. There are no fewer than 16 one-pharmacy towns in Gwydir.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Warringah may be interested to know that Baan Baa is not one of them, but there are 16. Quite a few of the people who own and operate those pharmacies told me today that they will no longer be viable if the Tribunal's recommendations are implemented. In fact, they will be amongst the first of the 1,600 or 1,700 pharmacies that we are told may well close if the recommendations before the Government are adopted. One pharmacist told me that he would have to drastically downgrade the services that he provides. If he lets his assistant go, if he works for 55 hours a week, if he refuses to make himself available on weekends, even in emergency situations, and carries very low stock levels he may just be able to break even. But the level of services to the community obvioulsy would be drastically reduced and, furthermore, he thought that, when he went in a few years time, when it is time for him to retire, it would be very unlikely that he would be replaced. Another pharmacist told me that his business, quite simply, would no longer be viable. No more for his community the security of knowing that the pharmacist could be dragged out of bed if the kids got sick at 3 a.m. He would simply have to shut up shop and move on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is totally and absolutely unacceptable. For social and economic reasons it must not be allowed to develop. Those Australians who live in remote areas must not lose any more services than they already have. They contribute enough to expect their right to certain minimal levels of services to be upheld. It seems to me that we have a vested interest in seeing to it that, if we expect them to go on producing the nation's bread and the nation's export dollars, they have the wherewithal to carry on. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases the loss of a local chemist will not merely inconvenience the locals; it will lead to the closure of the local hospital, the loss of medical facilities and the withering of the town. That would be a disaster for many country people. It is all very well for people to complain about the possibility of having to go to the next block, or even the next suburb, to find services. It is altogether another matter to have to drive for hours on end, as many will if the local town can no longer provide adequate services. I note today a communication I received from one pharmacist which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>I have never been particularly active because it demeans my professionalism but this Government is destroying pharmacy and I will do all I can to ensure this Government is defeated at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>For the sake of the bush and, by extension, for the sake of Australia, I have no choice but to endorse those sentiments absolutely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week, on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), I opened an important exhibition in this building under the theme `Apartheid South Africa'. I believe that it is most appropriate that this exhibition should be displayed here in the Parliament of Australia. This building, more than any other in our nation, is a symbol of democracy for our people, who each week visit it in their thousands. It is my earnest wish that they pause long enough to examine this exhibition and to reflect on the situation of the black majority of South Africa, who are persecuted and oppressed in their legitimate quest for democracy in their country. In this way, I believe that this exhibition can do much to reinforce and strengthen the will of our Australian Government to continue, and indeed intensify, its strong stand against apartheid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This exhibition reveals in stark clarity the reality of apartheid. More importantly, it reveals the strong spirit of active resistance that lives on in the people of South Africa despite decades of ruthless and violent repression. The exhibition has been arranged by the United Nations Centre Against Apartheid, which was established by the General Assembly in 1976 as a unit of the United Nations Secretariat to strengthen action towards the elimination of apartheid in South Africa. The centre has brought together this exhibition as an affirmation of the resolve of the United Nations to counter the iniquitous and devious propaganda of the South African regime. It is the hope of the United Nations that, wherever this exhibition is displayed, it will contribute to a greater public awareness about the true nature of apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite changes in the leadership of the South African Government, the political situation in that country continues to deteriorate. Repression of the black majority persists unabated and even the most peaceful forms of protest are ruthlessly crushed by all means, ranging from legislation and the courts, through an elaborate system of phone-tapping and informers, to the use of tear gas, guns, whips and police dogs. </PARA>
<PARA> The regime's activities are not only limited to South Africa. For many years the South African Government has vigorously pursued a policy of destabilisation against the front-line states, leaving them a legacy of disruption, devastation and despair. Having visited the front-line states last year and learned first-hand of the bitter effects of the apartheid regime's interference, I am particularly pleased with the recent decision of the Australian Government to increase funding to these countries under its southern African program to $110m over the next triennium. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that this exhibition in our Parliament will send a clear message to all Australians who seek financial gain by dealing with Pretoria. It is surely time for them to look beyond selfish gain, to cease their collaboration with the violent apartheid regime and to raise themselves to a higher level of moral conduct. This message should also go loudly and clearly to those in the Australian sporting fraternity who contemplate selling their sporting prowess to South Africa. The exhibition has been displayed in several countries throughout the world. It comes to us from the United States and when it leaves here next week it will go the United Kingdom and then on to many other nations. It gives a strong and clear message that apartheid will be overcome; its days are numbered. </PARA>
<PARA> I was particularly gratified that so many heads of diplomatic missions here in Canberra found time to attend the opening. It is an indication of the strength of feeling throughout the world against the evils of apartheid. I hope that my parliamentary colleagues will find time to visit this exhibition if they have not already done so. I know that many have. </PARA>
<PARA> The exhibition contains a message of hope as we look forward confidently to the complete dismantling of apartheid and the establishment in South Africa of a genuine non-racial, democratic society which will guarantee the freedom and human rights of all its citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it seems right and proper that we all congratulate you on your elevation to your responsible position in that chair. Last night I listened intently and with interest to the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) when he was speaking in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90. He spoke at length of the Budget increase in the Forward Estimates for the funding for sport. It was a very good speech and I re-read the Hansard tonight. An amount of $230m has been allocated for sport-$43m in 1989-90. The honourable member's congratulations are right and correct. Our elite athletes have needed this sort of response, support and help. No doubt a lot of pride has been generated in the `Go for gold' campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to wind the story back to suburban sport. Specifically, I am most concerned about the attention the Australian Taxation Office is giving to football, certainly at the league level which is starting in South Australia. I challenge the spirit of the Australian Taxation Office in the fringe benefits tax raid that it is perpetrating upon suburban sport and suburban football. Once it has started there, it is its intention to go into other areas. I will close as I started by saying that I do not really think that the spirit of the fringe benefits tax was designed to trap football clubs, sporting clubs and those non-profit making institutions. Everyone knows that no football club in Australia makes a profit. All football clubs do is make the egos of their presidents larger. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a very well written article by Geoff Kingston, a leading journalist in South Australia who played football at a State and league level. His article, which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser, refers to the fact that young Australians-and I can target this back to the speech of the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin)-and the clubs that nurture them are being penalised. The Australian Taxation Office believes that there is a pot of gold, that there are millions of dollars out there waiting to be harvested from the clubs. Clubs are forced to pay fringe benefits tax on simple pie and pastie nights or on cans of coke. League players may have to pay tax on the pasta they eat to boost their carbohydrate level a couple of hours before they play. Clubs have to pay fringe benefits tax at 49c in the dollar in respect of club dinners following a loss or a victory. All clubs, whether they be hockey, lacrosse or certainly league, strive to win a premiership. That is the ultimate. Even premiership dinners attract the tax. Clubs have been sent accounts for guernsey presentation nights. One club has had to pay $12.50 for each of its 40 players who were presented with their guernseys and their sponsors at such a function. Even the $7.50 entrance ticket acquired by footballers who take their spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend to the football are now being rated. Certainly, a lot of work has been done to try to bring this matter to the attention of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Tax Office is even attacking young Australians from the bush who are perhaps boarding, or attending university or school. They have to pay tax on the room they share and the food they eat. I support the fact that the fringe benefits tax should apply to the corporate sector but I do not believe that section 38s should be forcing clubs to the wall. These clubs have huge commitments and huge capital assets which they have to maintain on a year to year basis. If league clubs are experiencing difficulties, what hope have other suburban sports at the lesser level? I plead with the Australian Taxation Office to back off. There is going to be a lot more work done on this matter. I do not think the Tax Office's image needs to be tarnished. However, it seems that, along with taxidermists, tax officers tend to mess things up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much has been said in this House about the new Disability Services Act and in fact the way in which it can deliver services for those people in our community who suffer a wide range of disabilities. I would like to draw the attention of the House tonight to a particular project within my electorate called the Keystone Activity Centre which I had the opportunity of reopening this week after a massive fire earlier in the year. This program has been run by the Lutheran Church for 18 years out of a number of church halls and peoples' houses. It now has a very large building out of which to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the opening of this new centre has come, in fact, a recognition of the kind of service which can be offered to people with disabilities and which does not condemn them to one particular sheltered workshop type of program. The fire-and believe me, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is an ill wind that blows no good-has offered this group the opportunity to meet the challenge head on. Where previously late last year, parents and members of the group found themselves at odds and in fact in some difficulty with the way in which they were going to diversify and the way in which they were going to meet the challenge of the individual needs of those individuals in our community, the reality of the fire forced the issue upon them and they have been able to rise to the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen is a very wide ranging, supported employment program with the community taking part. This is particularly difficult in Logan City since it is a very poor area with a fairly high unemployment rate. But employers have risen to the occasion. With the dynamism of Pastor David Preuss, who in fact has been running the centre for some time, and the information which parents now have at hand, there has been a very different approach to the delivery of services. Indeed, just to give honourable members some idea of the kinds of services and the kinds of programs which are now part of this centre, let me elucidate. We have in fact a small mixed business, a corner shop and a coffee shop in which very many of our people with disabilities work under supported employment and in fact provide a very real service to the rest of the community. It is very handy for people to slip into the shop to purchase items, milk and bread and so on, or to just sit and have a chat and a quick cup of coffee. So, in fact the centre has become an integral part of our very own community. This means that not only are people with disabilities given an opportunity to show their talents but the rest of the community is able to share and participate there too. </PARA>
<PARA> We also, of course, have an involvement in the sporting clubs which are now offered a trophy service. These trophies, which are made by numbers of people within the group, are being sold. So there is a wide range of activities, services and businesses and we, as a community, appreciate that. As we have just heard the member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt) say, sport is an integral part of our community. We in fact participate across a wide range of sports. It is important in terms of integrating people into the community to ensure that some of our disabled people are involved in our sporting groups. Other groups which operate at the centre include classes for self-esteem and a travel club. They offer a very active social life in which many people can participate. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important changes under the Disability Services Act in terms of raising the self-esteem of people has been the change from people being called clients to being called employees. I know that very many of our new employees under the Disability Services Act appreciate that enormously because they are employed within the community. They are earning a wage, they are contributing to our system and they feel very much part of our community. I think this is very important. This is a very real example of the way in which the Disability Services Act has changed people's lives. It is very definitely an example of policy becoming reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to join with those other members in this House who have drawn attention to the attitude of this Government towards the pharmacists of Australia. A lot of people think that pharmacists earn a great deal of money and that they have things pretty easy. This Government has deliberately set out to reduce the number of pharmacies in Australia by about half. It is a quite deliberate ambition of the Government to force pharmacies to close down. Of course, the result of that policy by this present Government will be to very greatly diminish the health services available to the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who will suffer most from this present Government policy of attacking pharmacies right around Australia? The people least able to defend themselves, the people in most trouble will be the ones who will suffer most from, as I say, this quite deliberate action of the present Labor Government. We have a situation where those of advanced age and, in many cases, those in the lower income end of economic circumstances, are amongst those who depend to a very great extent upon the services offered by Australia's pharmacists. In fact of course, as my colleague from Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has already pointed out, people living in the more remote areas of Australia in particular will be the first to suffer through the policies which are being pursued by the present Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that pharmacists provide a most important health service for the community, not only in terms of the drugs they dispense-and they often clear up mistakes made by the medical profession-but also in terms of the great deal of advice that they provide to those who are taking the drugs that are prescribed by doctors in the community. To force these people into bankruptcy, to force them out of their profession, really is a most short-sighted approach by the Government-an approach which has been taken solely to try to save a few pennies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is incorrect to consider unfulfilled offsets obligations as being sums owed to Australia. Unfulfilled obligations should be seen as the value of future activities to be undertaken by overseas suppliers in Australian industry. Australian firms will be required to provide goods and/or services in the discharge of these obligations.</PARA>
<PARA> To the end of the 1987-88 financial year, the value of obligations discharged since the inception of the program is $1.58 billion while the total of agreed obligations is $1.75 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> This discharged figure includes some $260 million credits by suppliers in anticipation of future obligations. There is also an estimated further $600 million of obligations implicit on orders placed on overseas suppliers against which deliveries had still to be made. These figures exclude the sales and achievements of firms which have signed Partnerships for Development agreements which are outside the Offsets Program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) See answer to (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As will be seen from my response to (1) above a very high percentage of civil offsets obligations are ultimately fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of routine, the offsets activities of overseas suppliers participating in the program are monitored against agreed work programs. On occasions it is necessary for my Department to initiate discussions with suppliers in respect of their offsets performance. This has proved to be a successful technique in obtaining compliance. However, if a satisfactory outcome cannot be obtained by negotiation, future orders may be withheld or in a clear case of non-compliance I may publicise the delinquency of the supplier.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A status report of the Offsets Program was tabled, on a commercial-in-confidence basis, at the hearings associated with the inquiry by the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts into the implementation of the Offsets Program in late 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> In early May 1989, aggregate information on the Program was provided to the Committee in the form of a draft of the text of the 1987/88 Annual Report of the Program. This Annual Report has now been published.</PARA>
<PARA> Successive governments have taken the view that details of the offsets activities of individual firms should not be made public because of the commercially sensitive nature of this data. This position was endorsed by the Committee of Review on Offsets (Inglis) in its report published in December 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless my Department has been able to provide information, sought by the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. In particular, the Committee was provided with information on Government purchases and extracts from the offsets obligations register. This information was provided in a form which protected the identity of individual firms. I have also offered to provide the Committee with a detailed briefing on individual companies on an ``in camera'' basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As discussed in (4) above, the disclosure of an individual corporations offsets obligations, activities and achievements is a complex matter. The desire for more open and transparent administration is legitimate. The desire of our local industry to know more about the scale and nature of the offsets obligations and activities of our overseas suppliers is understandable.</PARA>
<PARA> Disclosure of this information, however, must be balanced against the equally legitimate desire by overseas suppliers for confidentiality in their commercial activities. They point to the uses to which the information could be used in their home country and by third countries and the effect it could have on their competitive position.</PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, while I accept these concerns, I have asked my Department to seek ways in which more information can be made public.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) At this stage independent audits of the Offsets Program are not conducted largely due to the cost involved.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department maintains appropriate records and is in close contact with both our overseas suppliers and local participants in the program. Information provided by overseas suppliers is checked with information from other sources.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) See answer to (6) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) As at 1 May 1989 there are fourteen (14) overseas corporations which have entered into the Partnerships for Development program. At present the program applies only to the information industries area of Government procurement.</PARA>
<PARA> Each partner undertakes to achieve a level of research and development expenditure in Australian information industries of not less than 5% of their local subsidiary's gross annual turnover. They have also undertaken to achieve an export/import ratio of not less than 50% within seven (7) years. These exports are to have an average Australian value added content of 70% by the expiry date of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> Based upon their projections, the corporations involved have undertaken to increase their research and development in Australia from a level $46.2 million in 1988 to $250.4 million in 1994. Similarly, they expect to increase their exports of information industry products from $183.6 million in 1988 to $1083.5 million in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The setting of annual targets is an integral part of Partnership agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> Annual reviews are held to evaluate progress in meeting these targets and to ensure that the corporations activities are in line with the Government's Information Industries Strategy. Independent auditing of the program achievements is also undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Where a corporation fails to meet its obligations under the Partnerships for Development program, the Commonwealth may terminate the Memorandum of Understanding by notice in writing to the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commonwealth terminates the Memorandum, the corporation shall cease to be entitled to future benefits provided by the Memorandum. All offsets obligations and achievements which would have arisen would then be assessed and the net offsets position of the corporation determined. The corporation would then be required to fulfil its offsets obligations in the normal way.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The Attorney-General's Department has provided advice on ways in which the offsets policy can be enforced. The advice may be summarised to the effect that self help methods are more likely to secure compliance than an action for damages.</PARA>
<PARA> Methods used to ensure that multinational companies fulfil their offsets commitments are described in my response to (3) above. The high degree of compliance apparent from the figures provided in reply to (1) above, and the fact that it has not yet been necessary for me to publicise the delinquency of a supplier, support my view that these measures are sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) No recommendation of this nature has been made by the Industries Assistance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> In appendix 4 of its 1987/88 annual report the Commission discussed recent developments in the civil offsets program. It suggested that an option which could be examined would be to let contractors discharge their previous commitment by direct cash payment to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the Offsets Program are directed towards the technological development and internationalisation of Australian industry. The Program seeks to achieve these objectives by providing access to international markets, encouraging technology transfer and research and development and by contributing to the development of business relationships between Australian and overseas firms.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not clear how cash payments by overseas suppliers would contribute to these objectives. There would in any case be an inevitable degree of inequity between companies which were fulfilling their obligations in good faith and those in delinquent positions but which were able to regularise their position by making a direct cash payment.</PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for the suggestion is unclear but it seems to be based upon the premise that there is a substantial value of unfulfillable obligations which need to be addressed. You will note from response to (1) above that this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA> If the IAC's option was to be adopted very difficult judgments would need to be made about the level of direct cash payments to be set in particular cases. This is especially so as the offsets guidelines require overseas suppliers to undertake offsets activities which are internationally competitive.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) In its consideration of the Report of the Committee of Review on Offsets (Inglis) in late 1985 the Government decided that the offsets policy should only apply to purchases made by organisations having a Commonwealth bestowed protective advantage. On the basis of this decision the organisations named are considered to be exempt from the requirements of the offsets policy.</PARA>
<PARA> This approach was also used in the Australian Civil Offsets Agreement and has been broadly adopted by the States.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) My Department does not maintain records in respect of exempt organisations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Details of CSIRO's total expenditure in the fields of energy storage, use and management and renewable energy for the period 1984-85 to 1988-89 are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA>$000</PARA>
<PARA>1984-85...</PARA>
<PARA>7218.3</PARA>
<PARA>1985-86...</PARA>
<PARA>6790.2</PARA>
<PARA>1986-87...</PARA>
<PARA>3841.0</PARA>
<PARA>1987-88...</PARA>
<PARA>4099.0</PARA>
<PARA>1988-89...</PARA>
<PARA>n.a.</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on renewable energy constitutes only a minor part of this expenditure. In 1981 CSIRO decided to vacate the area of renewable energy research. This decision followed the decline in world energy prices, especially fuel oil prices and the recognition that Australia was energy rich in all competing resources except liquid fuels.</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO's ongoing commitment to energy research takes into account considerations of efficiency, conservation and emission control. In particular, such planning recognises the critical importance of the need to balance economic and environmental benefits. The Greenhouse implications of energy usage are being developed in the context of this process.</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO has made a large and successful contribution to renewable energy research, particularly to the international solar energy research effort. This research work is now mature and much has been developed commercially by the private sector. In the photovoltaic area, CSIRO's contribution was to develop amorphous silicon films to replace single crystal silicon slices. This innovation demonstrated Australia's international capability, and its commercial application now awaits large-scale production of photovoltaic cells on an economic basis.</PARA>
<PARA> In the period 1984/85 to 1988/89 CSIRO research on renewable and related areas of research such as energy storage, use and management has ranged from efforts to improve the efficiency and extend the range of application of solar thermal and photochemical systems to more recent work to improve and develop new systems for the storage of electrical, thermal and chemical energy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) CSIRO is conducting extensive research on furthering our understanding of the Greenhouse Effect and in relation to providing better estimates of climate change for the Australia region as a result of the build-up of greenhouse gases. It has been able to increase this effort substantially as a result of the Government's initiative in providing funding to CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. Research effort on impacts (and possible technical response strategies) is minimal and carried out mainly under the auspices of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme on climate change. The proposed Greenhouse Funding Scheme for impact research to be established under the auspices of the National Greenhouse Advisory Committee is a prerequisite for a more concerted effort.</PARA>
<PARA> Response strategies to the Greenhouse Effect will need to be multi-dimensional embracing initiatives across the industrial and economic and social spectrum. CSIRO developed technology can play a major role in developing these future response strategies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Changes to numbers of staff positions in last four years.</PARA>
<PARA> The Division has had a net increase of 13 staff over the past four years made up as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Non-replacement of 37 appropriation funded staff who have separated over this period.</PARA>
<PARA> 45 staff transferred from other CSIRO Divisions following the relocation of research activities.</PARA>
<PARA> 5 additional staff supported from external funds.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Changes to amounts of money available for scientists to spend on research since mid 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> In actual terms the Appropriation funds available per Appropriation-funded scientist to do research (i.e. excluding inescapable salaries and overheads) has dropped from $14,887 p.a. in 1986 to $8,383 p.a. in 1988-89.</PARA>

<PARA> Notes:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. 1986-87 expenditure was increased by $612,000 by the transfer of an additional research group to the Division following the restructuring of water research activities within CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. 1986-87 include `one-off' payments ($233.2K) associated with Early Separation Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. 1987-88 expenditure was increased by $1,063.000 by the transfer of an additional research group to the Division following the restructuring of the then Division of Forest Research.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. 1987-88 and later Appropriation figures include, for the first time, employers' superannuation contributions in Divisional (as opposed to Organisational) expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Changes in Divisional Organisation following funding cuts.</PARA>
<PARA> The Division has handled funding cuts in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA> Restructured whole research programs and made across-the-board cuts.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently it cut individual research projects which, while important, were of lower priority than other projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Most recently it decided to close a major regional research laboratory at Deniliquin in southern NSW, with the transfer of its research program to Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Consequences of the Changes</PARA>
<PARA> These have been twofold:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Important research curtailed or terminated</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Mouse plague research has been severely cut with only one scientist now employed where four were involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Australian National Wildlife Collection, an important national resource, has been cut from four scientists to two.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The Division has closed research on introduced pasture grasses in semi-arid regions.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Rangelands research has been severely cut back, with the loss of scientists working on woody weed effects.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Cuts have had to be made in research into the ecology of native forests.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Bird pest research work has been stopped.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Research into Kangaroo studies has been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Nutrition and diet selection research in koalas has been terminated.</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) Research into vertebrate population dynamics in rainforests and the dynamics of the rainforest/Eucalyptus woodland boundary have been terminated.</PARA>
<PARA> (x) All rabbit control research other than that funded by the Wool Corporation has been terminated.</PARA>
<PARA> (xi) Research into Coastal dune stabilization by vegetation has been terminated.</PARA>
<PARA> (xii) Regional scale maintenance of kangaroo numbers can no longer be carried out, and so prediction of kangaroo population trends is now very imprecise.</PARA>
<PARA> (xiii) Recently initiated work on deer farming has been severely curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) New important initiatives not begun</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Research into ecological dynamics in the Antarctic with the emphasis on impacts of tourism and other developments (the Division has the expertise in terms of mammals and birds).</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Development of benign methods of fertility control for wildlife (e.g. the development of the kangaroo ``birth control pill'').</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Developments, via molecular biological approaches, to induce sterility in wild rabbits, as an effective means of rabbit control.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Research into lamb losses with and without fox and/or rabbit control.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Research into the influence of management initiated fires on forest wildlife species.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Restoration of mining sites in the Pine Creek, NT, Geosyncline.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Risk assessment and potential outbreaks of exotic diseases and pests in north Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) North Queensland rainforest inventory and mapping (which has had to be deferred).</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) Developments in the work on distinguishing land degradation from natural change, and on erosion forecasting, are over two years behind. It is hoped that the new Government initiative will alleviate this particular problem.</PARA>
<PARA> (x) Conservation management of arid mountain ranges, one of our most important ecosystem types, has been delayed for two years. (It has recently been able to start thanks to funding from the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory).</PARA>
<PARA> (xi) Research into how to prevent species loss in the remnant vegetation of the western wheat belt has had to ignore all of the insects, owing to the loss of scientists. Work on optimal strategies for identifying and revegetating critical areas to arrest salinization in the region has also had to be deferred.</PARA>
<PARA> (xii) Allocation and management of resources in the Australian coastal zone. The coastal strip from Gladstone to Adelaide will be the country's major focus for conflict over, and competition for, fragile and economically significant natural resources in coming decades.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Implications</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Agricultural Productivity</PARA>
<PARA> Agricultural development is proceeding without due consideration for its sustainability. This Division has the expertise but not the resources to give this important problem the consideration it requires, in terms of both management strategies and policy developments.</PARA>
<PARA> The multi-million dollar problems arising from vertebrate pests (rabbits, mouse plagues, pigs, foxes, dingoes and even kangaroos) are being addressed at far too low a level. Research is well behind where it could and should be for development of effective control strategies, and this influences the cost efficiency for production in the industry and for exports.</PARA>
<PARA> The massive consequences of an outbreak of exotic diseases is of major concern. The spread of such diseases will be largely through feral and native fauna. The initial work by this Division has highlighted the need for a change in strategy towards increased emphasis on early detection. The Division's planned program of research into the interactive dynamics of vertebrates in terms of potential disease spread in tropical northern Australia has had to be deferred until funding is made available.</PARA>
<PARA> The work of this Division has had a significant beneficial effect on reducing woody weeds in semi-arid rangelands, with a concomitant benefit to production. The equivalent potential for benefits from its work on perennial grass productivity and restoration of degraded sites has been held up by insufficient funding.</PARA>
<PARA> The delay in work on efficiency of livestock production through grazing management strategies in arid rangelands, means that governments will be required to continue support for ``drought'' relief programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Conservation Policy</PARA>
<PARA> This Division is the only federally funded research organisation with the expertise to undertake the full range of terrestrial ecological research. As such, reducing its research effort reduces the objective basis for underpinning much of the development of national conservation policies. This Division supplied the basic information for the heritage listing of the tropical rainforests. It is vitally involved in the production of objective information on the distribution and requirements of fauna and flora in the SE forests (it will be this work which will be used in the future as the objective ecological information in deciding on the woodchip vs conservation debate). The development of this work is woefully inadequate at present, and equivalent work in other regions is not going ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> In the areas of wildlife management, vertebrate population dynamics, marsupial biology, rainforest ecology, fragmented ecosystem ecology, tropical savannas, and land conservation and the impacts of possible climate change, this Division is regarded, internationally, as a leader. Within Australia, the ability of the Division to provide the detailed information needed to develop the best national conservation policies is well short of what it should be and in some areas is virtually grinding to a halt.</PARA>
