Questions which would normally be addressed to Mr Brown should be addressed to the portfolio Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, is also overseas on Government business. He returns on 11 October.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I remind him of his promise in February this year, before the Western Australian elections, that interest rates would go down this year. Will the Prime Minister now admit that this either was politically motivated and grossly dishonest or represents the total failure of his Government's policies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Neither is the case. We believe that the Government has the right mix of economic policies to deal with the current difficulties confronting this country. The facts are that Australia has an unsustainably high rate of demand growth and, as all commentators understand, that has led to a level of demand for imports-in fact, a growth in imports-that we cannot continue to sustain in this country. It has required the Government to keep all arms of macro-economic policy tight. We have done that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me briefly refer to the tightness of those three arms of policy. Fiscal policy, of course, is extraordinarily tight. We have the fourth successive reduction in Commonwealth real outlays; the third successive Budget surplus, and each one has been successively higher than the last; and the second successive surplus in the overall public sector outcome. Each of those achievements is unmatched since comparable records have been kept. That is the situation in regard to fiscal policy. No suggestion can be entertained that that arm of policy is not appropriately tight-tighter than it has been on any previous occasion.</PARA>
<PARA> We then go to the area of wages. We have the tightest possible wages policy, given the level of demand that exists in the economy. Certainly we have a flatter rate of wages movement than has existed in any previous period in our history. The outcome for 1989-90 will be one that could not possibly have been achieved under any other circumstances. That leaves us with the third arm of policy-monetary policy-which is appropriately tight. As both my friend and colleague the Treasurer and I have said consistently, with changing circumstances we will adjust that policy. It has been tightened. We both believe that it is as tight as is required. Let me just say two things about it that both the Treasurer and I have said: firstly, we will not keep monetary policy tighter for one day longer than is necessary. The obverse side of that coin is that we will not loosen monetary policy one day before it is economically responsible so to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no substance to the report. It was a view put by Max Walsh, who drew a very long bow-too long a bow-in the Sydney Morning Herald. He tried to suggest some relationship between the purchase on the stock exchanges of shares in the banks and arrangements which were made last week with the Government in relation to housing interest rates. The fact is that the ANZ Bank and the National Australia Bank have not approached me about any possible merger of the two banks. I take this opportunity to say that a merger between those two banks would present very grave difficulties for the competitive future of the trading bank system in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thread of the article was that there was some connivance between Westpac and me in relation to the Commonwealth Bank. The fact is that Westpac attended last week's meeting purely in relation to the new arrangements which relate to the rates on non-callable deposits. It had nothing to do with Westpac's corporate future. The whole article was a furphy and it has no basis in fact whatsoever.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have, I hope with admirable straightforwardness, expressed publicly my regret to Mr Bob Bell for the language that I used in a rather robust interchange I had with him in Whyalla, an area which I am very pleased to report is being very carefully attended to and looked after by the honourable member for Grey. I meant what I said when I extended the apology to Mr Bell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the circumstances of asking that the interchange not be extended, I must say that I think many members of this House would have experienced the rather intrusive activities of the media when they find themselves talking to someone. The next thing they know is that they have one of these boom microphones coming over their left or right shoulders. In the circumstances I explained to the television crew involved-they accepted what I said-that as far as I was concerned it had been a private exchange. They were prepared to accept the fact that I regarded it as a private interchange. Other people in the media-probably correctly on their part-regarded it as good television. I have no criticism of them for that.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, if one gets down to the realities of what the respective sides of this House mean to the elderly, I am more than happy to have our respective policies on the table and adjudged by this House and the electorate. Under the Opposition's seven years of government, its concern for the aged was so great that it reduced, in real terms, the pension by some 2 per cent. During the period when the honourable member for Bennelong was the Treasurer, the real value of pensions was reduced by 4 per cent. The thing about this Opposition is that it is long on words and short on action when it comes to its concern for the aged. As distinct from a position where the Opposition dramatically reduced the real value of pensions for the aged in this country, this Government has increased the real value of pensions by some 8 per cent. The Opposition allowed the pension as a proportion of average weekly earnings to sink to 22 1/2 per cent at the end of its term in government. We have now produced a situation where that is guaranteed to rise to 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> So, as I say, while I regret the intemperate language that I used to Mr Bell-and I have publicly apologised to him-in regard to the attitude of the Government and the Opposition with regard to the aged, the Opposition can rest on its miserable record and we will proudly assert that what we have done is to restore dignity and a proper level of remuneration to the aged with regard to the rest of the community. When the time comes that we are looking forward to when the aged, as well as the rest of the community, can make their judgment about the attitude of Hawke and his Government and Peacock and his Opposition, we will get the overwhelming support of the aged in this community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of very significant developments in this issue in the last couple of weeks. First of all, I have already announced an extension of the isolated pharmacy allowance until June 1990. Following the establishment of the expert panel of pharmacists, which is again meeting today, at its first meeting it advised the interim guidelines for the essential pharmacy allowance, and I have written to pharmacists on this matter. I believe this will go a long way to ensuring the viability of small pharmacies in one-pharmacy towns in particular. Those payments will be made from 1 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another issue that has been in the public eye in some regard is the surcharge on high cost drugs. Following a determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT), the Government has had negotiations with distributors throughout Australia which have led to an increase in the wholesale margin from 10 per cent to 13 per cent on those pharmaceuticals over $45. This effectively means that the invoice prices for pharmaceuticals over $45 will not have a surcharge on them. No pharmacists will now be able to claim that it costs them more to buy the product than the Government pays. So there is now no cause for any pharmacists saying that they will not be able to give access to such high cost medications, particularly when one considers the whole equation, the weighted average principle under which the PBRT's determination was made.</PARA>
<PARA> What has not been understood, to be genuine about it, by many pharmacists as well as some other people, particularly those on the Opposition benches, is that the low cost, high volume drugs will in fact be returning to pharmacists about a 50 per cent increase in some cases over and above what they get now. As pharmacy remuneration is on a per script basis, that is a quite significant change or improvement in the argument that has been put so far.</PARA>
<PARA> Probably the biggest development is the one which paved the way for a meeting last Wednesday between the Prime Minister and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. I would like to refer to the joint statement issued by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Government following that meeting. The statement reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The meeting was held after the Guild advised the Prime Minister that it accepted the fact of the Tribunal decision and the integrity of the Government's Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we are now working within the proper legal processes. Political main force has been shown not to be the way to resolve this issue; the proper way is through proper factual discussion and negotiation. This is recognised, and I think it is a very positive development.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem for the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia is that this solution takes away their opportunity, as they see it, to develop this into a political issue. That sort of thing is no substitute for law or for policy, and in that regard the Opposition should have a good look at itself. The Prime Minister just spoke about social security policy. The people of Australia, particularly the elderly, would like to know the Opposition's policy on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. We know that the Opposition is very keen to lift the price controls; it wants to go open slather on that. But we have not heard from Access Economics Pty Ltd, or whoever the Opposition is getting its advice from these days, as to what it wants to do with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The final answer to the question from the honourable member for Aston is that no person in the community today-or, for that matter, tomorrow-should feel intimidated or worried or have any fear whatsoever about being charged for medications he or she was not charged for before. No-one should fear losing access to those medications or be concerned about the Government's intention to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and its relationship with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member for Gippsland for his question and for his withdrawal of that addendum. As is well known, this matter has had a preliminary consideration by the Cabinet and it will be further considered later this week. I do not intend to canvass in any detail the issues that will be dealt with by me and by my colleagues in the Cabinet. It is appropriate in these circumstances that I should say something about the record of this Government in the area of both growth and conservation. Two facts provide eloquent testimony to the capacity of this Government to take account of the need for growth and the obligation that we have to this and future generations to take account of the environment. Let me refer to them. The first is that in regard to growth the simple indisputable fact is that under the period of my Government job creation in Australia has been more than twice as fast as that in the rest of the Western world. That is the first fact. We have had a record here that is more than twice as good as the rest of the world in terms of employment growth. At the same time I refer to the second point. The World Heritage Bureau has had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . Australia has done more to implement the World Heritage Convention than any other single country.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask those opposite, as I ask the people of Australia, to take account of those two facts-employment growth more than twice as fast as the rest of the world, and the World Heritage Bureau saying that no country has done as much as Australia to advance World Heritage values. We do not resile in any way from the policies that we have adopted in regard to economic growth, employment growth and a discharge of our obligation in regard to matters of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say this while on the question of the environment and of Kakadu: the Opposition's stated policy on Kakadu, as yet unrepudiated by the present Opposition Leader, is to seek the delisting of Kakadu stage 2 from the World Heritage List and to open up the possibility of mining in Kakadu stage 2. We will consider this issue calmly, and not only will we show our capacity as we have in the past to encourage economically sustainable development, but also we will ensure that the considerations of the environment and of the Aboriginal population are properly taken into account. This is not a development at any price government. We have demonstrated, on the statistics, that we can balance properly both the requirements of economic and employment growth and our obligations to this and future generations to preserve the environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Social Security aware of calls by the recently appointed Minister for Family Services in Queensland, Mrs Beryce Nelson, for the abolition of the sole parent pension? Is he also aware of claims by Mrs Nelson that he and the Commonwealth Government support her position? Are these claims true? If not, what is the response of the Commonwealth Government to the growing cost of the sole parent pension?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1256" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the irresponsible and prejudiced calls of Mrs Nelson. I and the Government unequivocally reject Mrs Nelson's calls. The facts are that 80 per cent of sole parents have been in a relationship which has broken down. Only 2.8 per cent of sole parents are teenagers. Most sole parents receive the pension for less than 16 months and few people in this House would question the fact that marriage breakdown causes a crisis that results in trauma for something like that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's approach has four prongs: firstly, to develop administrative procedures to prevent fraud and abuse; secondly, to lift the level of income support; thirdly, to make sure that sole parents receive adequate child support from the other parent; and, fourthly, through jobs education and training (JET), to provide appropriate information, advice, counselling, labour market programs, child-care and other help to encourage sole parents to work. Quite clearly, that strategy is working. Those in the House who have understood the strategy would acknowledge the changes that are occurring and the positive trends that are now showing in the statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of pensioners solely dependent on the pension is plummeting. In 1979 the proportion of female sole parent pensioners solely dependent on the pension was 67 per cent. By 1983 it had climbed to 71 per cent. The proportion steadily fell between 1983 and 1987 to 66 per cent, but in the last two years-years in which the reforms of this Government have begun to bite-there has been a dramatic change. In January this year only 38 per cent of sole parent pensioners were solely dependent on the pension. Sixty-two per cent, almost two-thirds, of sole parents received some income from work or maintenance. This has occurred while levels of assistance under the sole parent pension have risen. A sole parent pensioner with two children under 13 years of age and no other income has had a real increase in income of about 15 per cent since 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the child support scheme means that sole parents now receive adequate and secure maintenance. Since the introduction of stage one of the child support scheme in June 1988, the proportion of sole parent pensioners receiving maintenance has increased by 36 per cent, and average levels of maintenance have increased very significantly. Stage two of the scheme, providing for assessment of child support under formula, commenced last Sunday, and will lead to even more sole parent pensioners receiving adequate levels of support.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the policy of the Government has been to provide every incentive to get sole parents additional income-via either maintenance or income drawn from work. At the same time, in recognition of the real needs of sole parents during the crisis or traumatic period following a marriage breakdown, the Government has provided additional support.</PARA>
<PARA> I return to Mrs Nelson. It is very interesting that a Minister of the Queensland Government should suggest that we wipe out the sole parent pension. The Leader of the Opposition has singled out sole parent pensioners. They are on the top of the Opposition's hit list.</PARA>

<PARA> I return to Mrs Nelson. She is talking about phasing out sole parent pensions, pensions for what is, arguably, the most needy group of people within the Australian community. As a result of the musical chairs that has occurred in Queensland and the inability of the National Party in Queensland to get its act together, the Queensland Parliament is not sitting long enough to pass legislation, which would help the teenage sole parents for whom Mrs Nelson weeps crocodile tears. The only State in Australia not collecting maintenance for the most needy group of people in Australia is Queensland, where we hear this sounding off by this spokesperson for the National Party.</PARA>

Allow me to come to the substance of the question that was addressed to me by the honourable member for Ryan. On 24 August this year the Eastman-Kodak company announced that it was restructuring its operations worldwide in response to what it termed poor financial results for the first half year. That restructuring proposal on a worldwide basis involved the shedding of some 4,500 employees and the disposal or restructuring of operating units with sales of some $US1 1/4 billion. Part of the plan that was outlined at that stage involved the closure of the manufacturing, research and development and export operations of Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd at Coburg, Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian market and export markets currently supplied by Kodak (Austral- asia) under the proposal would be serviced by existing plants in the United States of America or South America. However, a quick response by the local subsidiary and the Government has caused Eastman-Kodak to stay its decision. The possibility of closure is of concern to the Government because Kodak (Australasia), let it be remembered, is Australia's second largest exporter-that is, after General Motors-Holden's Ltd-of elaborately transformed manufactures. The total in 1988 was $167m. Honourable members can see the dimension of the contribution to Australia's export earnings in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures that are involved in this enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA> Closure of the plant is estimated to have a net negative impact on Australia's balance of payments in 1990 of more than $200m. In other words, the net negative impact of the closure of that plant on Australia would be close to a quarter of a billion dollars. By 1992, this adverse trade effect would grow to well over $300m per annum; in other words, that is the loss of export sales and the imports that would otherwise have to take place. Around 400 jobs would be lost by the end of the year with a further 800 jobs likely to go by 1992. The net impact on government revenue of the operation's remaining in Australia is estimated at around $60m over the period 1990-92. It is important to understand that the situation which was contemplated by Eastman-Kodak was not due in any sense to the inefficiency or the lack of competitiveness of the Coburg plant. Indeed, it is acknowledged as one of the most efficient plants in the Eastman-Kodak group.</PARA>
<PARA> Kodak (Australasia) represents the type of manufacturing operation that the Government is trying to encourage here. It is without question efficient, well managed, internationally competitive and export oriented.</PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, which I have outlined in some detail, the Government, under the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, is currently discussing with Kodak (Australasia) what might be required to enable the firm to continue to make a positive contribution to the Australian economy. Let me conclude by saying that any Government assistance will be contingent upon a number of assurances and undertakings being obtained from Eastman-Kodak and Kodak (Australasia) about the future of the facilities at Coburg and other activities in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all right for Opposition members to run around the country rubbishing the Government about its commitment to and concern about the issues of poverty. I am sure the honourable member for Herbert has many people in his electorate who are more concerned about the issues of poverty and who take the issue rather more seriously than some of the honourable members on the other side of the House do. The honourable member asked a question concerning the Government's approach to the issue of poverty. There was very little progress in the battle against poverty in governments that Opposition members have been associated with in the past. If their published policy is any indication, or if their inability to defend any policy is any indication, one would not expect very much in the future. It is interesting to see that the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) today expressed concern about the inability of people on the coalition side of politics to take this issue seriously. A statement from ACOSS today states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's initiatives on child poverty have been of considerable benefit to many low-income families. The financial benchmarks for children which the Government set have been met-and ahead of target. ACOSS congratulates the Government on setting and achieving these standards.</PARA>
<PARA>A further landmark achievement has been the Government's commitment to index all payments for children so they will maintain their real value for years to come. Never does any standard come from the other side of the House, and there has never been indexation in relation to child payments. There are now 182,000 families receiving or benefiting from the family allowance supplement. In Australia there are now 1.2 million children in families which benefit from the Government's family income policy. That is about one in every three children in Australia.</PARA>

The Government makes no apology for its commitments with respect to poverty. It looks to a record of achievement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, relates to the ongoing pilots dispute. Given the attitude taken both by the airlines and by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots (AFAP), is it not a fact that the best hope of an early resolution of this dispute lies in as many pilots as possible being signed under direct contracts with the airlines as quickly as possible? If that assumption is correct, will the Government, as a matter of urgency, consider introducing right to work legislation which will protect pilots from any form of coercion and discrimination and, inter alia, will guarantee the right to work without the holding of a union ticket on the basis that if that legislation is introduced quickly it will facilitate an earlier resolution of the dispute along the only lines that now appear available, given the attitude of the parties?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1259" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I sincerely thank the honourable member for Bennelong for his question. I preface my response to his serious question by saying that I have appreciated in many respects the way in which his interventions during this dispute have been singularly different from those of the Leader of the Opposition and many of his other colleagues. It is a matter that he recognises, as does every other commentator in the country. As on so many other issues, as is being recognised increasingly within the Liberal Party and within the community: boy oh boy, did the Opposition make a boo-boo when it dumped him. As the honourable member would know, I am very well in touch with Deep Throat in his Party, and when I have the latest news on the further developments which are seeking to undermine the current Leader of the Opposition, I will let the House know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong is absolutely right in the first part of his question in assuming that the point has been reached at which the only course of action now is the signing of individual contracts between pilots and their potential airline employers. That has already happened to a considerable extent. With the position now emerging in the Industrial Relations Commission it would be appropriate, as has been requested, that an award be made on the basis of the contracts, which the airlines put before the Commission yesterday and which are now being examined to see whether they fall within the wage guidelines. The airlines are now taking the view, properly and understandably, that there is no employment nexus between the AFAP and its membership and the airlines because the AFAP instructed its members to resign from the airlines, which they did. In that situation, individual contracts were signed.</PARA>
<PARA> One thing that is crystal clear, and I think the honourable member for Bennelong would be at one with me, is that there has been a very significant increase in productivity in the contracts that have been signed. I remind the honourable gentleman that under the pre-existing situation, hours flown a month averaged 30-about eight hours a week. That has been very significantly increased. The fact is that, as a result of the productivity improvements negotiated and determined under the contracts, a significantly lesser number of pilots will be required by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines. There has been a significant rise in productivity.</PARA>
<PARA> The leadership of the Federation has achieved a remarkable trifecta for its membership. Let me point out what that remarkable trifecta is. First, it has caused the loss of jobs to its members by instructing them to resign. Secondly, it has cost the ones who have reapplied and rejoined their seniority. As the honourable member for Bennelong would know, as he has followed this, a loss of seniority involves a very considerable loss of convenience and income. Thirdly, and most remarkably, it has completely cost all those hundreds of pilots who will no longer be required their redundancy payments. In the situation which hitherto applied, if in productivity negotiations people had become redundant but were still in employment, there would have been an obligation upon both Australian and Ansett to make very significant redundancy payments, possibly amounting to a year's salary-which, as honourable members would know, would average $80,000. That is the trifecta of achievement of Mr McCarthy and the leadership of the AFAP. It has cost its members their jobs, their seniority and their redundancy payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman is right. The only course of action to be followed in the situation created by the AFAP instructing its members to resign is that which has been followed and which, by the beginning of next week, will involve a reconstruction of the airlines to a point where they will be operating to about 60 per cent full capacity. What will happen--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that situation it is perfectly obvious, particularly if the Commission makes the award, that the additional requirements of both Ansett and Australian Airlines will be filled by those who have been recruited from overseas, those who are being trained now and those who have already signed the contracts, together with the members of the AFAP who decide to join and have a job. Very many of them will not have one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go to the other parts of the honourable member's question, which I concede to be very important. First, it has never been the position of the Government, nor of Australian or Ansett, that new employees should not have the right to be represented by some organisation of their choice. As I said, that is the position of both Ansett and Australian Airlines. In other words, there is no attempt to say that the pilots will not have a union. On the contrary, it has been made clear by both the airlines that this is a matter for the employees. We are saying, `If you want an organisation, it is up to you as to what that organisation shall be-whether you want an organisation made up of Australian pilots flying for Australian Airlines and an organisation of pilots of Ansett Airlines, or whether you want one that covers both'.</PARA>
<PARA> The pilots who are flying now have made it quite clear that they want nothing to do with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. My God! When we have a trifecta like the one I have just indicated it is very unlikely that the pilots would want to have anything to do with the AFAP. But that is the way it will emerge if the employees of the two airlines want to have an organisation to represent them. That is certainly in line with the wishes and the attitude of the airlines.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no need in these circumstances-I go to the final part of the honourable gentleman's question-to have legislation in this matter because the pilots had an organisation. Any question of coercion or pressure has been by the AFAP. As far as the pilots are concerned now they may well want to have another organisation. If they do they shall have it. Employees generally in the community have taken the view, rightly, that the present system of industrial relations has worked in their favour as, may I say, have the employers in this country. We have a situation where both sides of the industrial relations equation believe that the present system is working well. They are not talking about the need for any legislation. And why should they when the facts are so clear?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the honourable gentleman of those facts. I refer to the Australian Financial Review of 13 September. In an article on this question Mr Stutchbury said:</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to report that the Hawke Government's wages Accord is crumbling under the weight of the pilots' dispute. It would make a good story.</PARA>
<PARA>. . .</PARA>
<PARA> However, only mugs allocate their portfolios on the basis of good stories. The facts are that wage costs are being contained to a remarkable degree given the continuing strong business demand for labour-as shown by the 380,000 extra jobs created over the past year.</PARA>
<PARA>The article in relation to the accord goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . have kept the lid on wage inflation during what has been Australia's biggest economic boom since at least the early 1970s. Under the wage Accord, the ACTU has deliberately facilitated the biggest redistribution of national income from wages to profits for at least a generation.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me then go to this critical point that is made by the writer:</PARA>
<PARA> This fact seems to be conveniently forgotten by those who are now squawking for an abandonment of any centralised rein on aggregate labour costs . . . the Accord has underwritten the corporate profit boom which in turn is funding the current surge in business investment.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the honourable member for Bennelong that we have an impartial analyst saying how the system has worked and it has worked with a representative body of workers-that is, the workers are organised through the unions and through the accord. Negotiations have willingly taken place in a centralised system of wage fixation which has seen a very significant move to profits. Out of those profits we have seen a very significant surge in investments to the highest post-war figure, where currently business investment represents 13.5 per cent of gross domestic product-the highest figure ever. In that period workers have got very significant increases in the social wage. Without referring to the figures in full detail let me remind honourable members of the 1 1/2 million new jobs, of the abolition of the two million who were not covered by any form of health or medical insurance. I refer also to education, where the retention rate has been lifted from 36 per cent to 58 per cent, coming up to 65 per cent at the beginning of next year. We have seen the creation of 150,000 tertiary places where honourable members opposite, when in government, created 29,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the social wage has compensated for the decline in real wages. We therefore have the satisfaction of the trade union movement with this system and we also have the satisfaction of the employers. Let me, finally, in regard to the employers remind those opposite of what has happened since the honourable member for Bennelong was chucked out. An article in the Business Review Weekly of 29 September is headed `Opposition's Stocks Sink'. Why would they not sink? The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Support for the Opposition on the key question of leadership credibility more than halved between the June and September surveys . . . A massive 70% of the top 500 CEOs surveyed said they did not understand the Liberal and National parties' economic stance.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me go to the point that the article makes about wages policy:</PARA>
<PARA> Wages policy remains a weakness for the Opposition. Only 21% of the CEOs think the coalition would run the best wages policy for Australia, down from 34% in June.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, you can see why I thank the honourable member for Bennelong for his question. I thank him because he is right in his analysis that we now require the airlines to be restored to normal operations by individual pilots signing their contracts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Community Services and Health concerned about the potentially adverse effects on children's dental health of the decision of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly to remove fluoride from Canberra's drinking water?

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1262" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the recent decision made by the Assembly in the Australian Capital Territory. I must say that I am dismayed by this decision to deny fluoridation to the water supplies in Canberra. The substance of the decision is clearly based on misinformation and runs quite counter to the overwhelming weight of evidence in favour of fluoridation and the improvement of dental health, particularly amongst children. Of course, the manner in which this hasty decision was made, with very little consideration by an opportunist collection of Independents and Liberals, I think is equally dismaying to anybody concerned with these kinds of issues. I think it is a tragedy that the dental health of children in the Australian Capital Territory should be put at risk by this kind of decision-making. The Labour members of the Assembly rightly pointed out the disastrous consequences that the removal of fluoride would have for the dental health of children living in the Canberra area. Whatever our views on the issue, it certainly deserves much more than the kind of cursory debate whereby this decision was made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue of fluoridation has been subject to numerous studies in Australia and overseas for the past 30 years or so. The evidence conclusively points to the clear benefits of fluoride in drinking water. A full study was conducted by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in 1985. That body, which advises us on public health in this country, reaffirmed its support for fluoridation of water as a safe and effective measure in the control of dental caries. Indeed, it recommended an expansion of the program. It seems that some of the non-Labour members of the Australian Capital Territory Assembly-I accept that a couple of the Liberal members displayed some sense on this issue-ignored this unequivocal scientific advice and were not even prepared to await the outcome of a working group of the NHMRC which has been looking further at the efficacy of fluoride in water. They were quite happy to cast aside the overwhelming evidence of dental experts who have closely studied and are best equipped to comment on the benefits of fluoridation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that this decision has been condemned by national and international dental experts. I will quote from the New South Wales branch of the Australian Dental Association. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Since fluoridation was introduced in the early 60s, Australia's dental health record has changed from one of the worst in the world to one of the best. A recent Australian study has shown that decay rates in 12-year-olds decreased by 84 percent in the twenty years from 1962.</PARA>
<PARA>No-one is claiming that that is solely due to fluoridation. Obviously, however, it has been an important element in that significant change. The Association said that dental decay rates in Canberra children were between 25 per cent and 42 per cent lower than the national average and between 40 per cent and 59 per cent less than in Brisbane, which does not add fluoride to its water. The Association warned that decay rates in Canberra children were likely to soar and that studies carried out in Scotland show that in the five years after fluoride was taken out of water supplies there the rates of decay in five-year-olds increased by almost 40 per cent. Professor Graham Craig of the University of Sydney's Faculty of Dentistry has estimated that tooth decay rates will rise by at least one-third over the next five years and the cost of providing dental care by school dental services will increase by 40 per cent. He predicts that there will be a return to the old drill and fill cycle of the pre-fluoride generation.</PARA>
<PARA> The dentists are speaking entirely without self-interest, because it can clearly be shown that they have lost a lot of their customers and clients as a result of the effect of fluoridation of water. They are speaking from a public health point of view. For all these reasons I will give whatever support is possible to my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories and to the Australian Capital Territory Government to try to see that this issue is reconsidered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Government is about to take significant steps forward in improving both the cost-effectiveness of government purchasing and the ways in which it can enhance opportunities for local suppliers to get Commonwealth business.

At the same time we will introduce new measures to give greater effect to our strong and continuing commitment to encourage the development of local industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Federal public sector purchasing is very big business. An estimated $7 billion to $8 billion, or 4 per cent of gross domestic product, is spent each year by Budget sector agencies alone. This estimate excludes very substantial expenditure by government business enterprises. Purchasing is also very important to the efficient administration of government. Government programs would founder if their supplies of goods and services were to fail through breakdowns in their purchasing systems or if capital acquisition projects were unable to deliver on time and within budget. But in the past purchasing has been a backwater. In Government, as in the private sector, it has not received the attention that it merits from management and its potential to contribute to better management has not been exploited. This was borne out by the service-wide review which was conducted last year under this Government's financial management improvement program. </PARA>
<PARA> The review involved extensive consultation within government and with industry. It took account of the views of the people who work in purchasing and managers who are served by purchasing. It took account of developments in other governments. It also took account of the views of those who do business with government. It found: A restrictive regulatory environment; an emphasis on process rather than outcomes; a culture of caution and risk avoidance; slow and laborious processes; a failure to provide staff with the training and career development opportunities they needed; a preoccupation with technical rather than functional specifications; and a commitment to single stage tendering processes whether or not they were effective in the market. The system was costing us money through excessive processing costs, time delays and failure to obtain the best price or the most appropriate goods and services from suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> It was against this background that the Government decided to embark on the current program of reforms. The aim, as with other reforms to public administration, was not only to give managers greater freedom and authority to manage but also to require them to manage and to be accountable. These reforms are part of a general program to improve efficiency in government administration. In my portfolio this has also been reflected in major reforms to the provision of common services which have already produced better performance and very large savings to government. </PARA>
<PARA> Following months of planning and preparation, the progressive implementation of the changes will begin with effect from 1 November. The following requirements have already been undertaken: The Audit Act 1901 has been amended to enable the issue of ministerial guidelines; the finance regulations dealing with purchasing have been substantially amended to eliminate prescription of detailed processes and tabled in Parliament; I have tabled and issued several guidelines on principles and practices for purchasing under the new regime; and departments are preparing purchasing reform plans for endorsement by their Ministers before they begin to operate under the new regime. Departments are required to advise on progress in their annual reports from 1988-89 to 1990-91. To complete the system, I will shortly issue a policy framework which sets out in summary form the major policies applying to Commonwealth purchasing and their integration with industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA> One main element of the new approach will be a new emphasis on value for money in government purchasing rather than price or acquisition costs. Department officers will need to look broadly at the performance of the goods and services they buy and at the services of their suppliers and take all relevant costs into account in assessment of offers. The other main element will be greater scope for departments to settle purchasing methods within a general principle of open and effective competition. Departments will have to gazette public invitations of offers and contracts arranged but methods of approach to the market will not be rigidly prescribed. Use of conventional public tendering will continue but other approaches, such as staged purchasing and pre-qualification of suppliers, will be encouraged, together with early notification of purchasing plans. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this new approach there will be greater opportunity for departments to tailor their methods to the markets in which they are buying. Generally, we expect to see:</PARA>
<PARA> reduced costs in bidding and administration for both suppliers and government;</PARA>
<PARA> a more competitive approach from suppliers;</PARA>
<PARA> a continuing emphasis on ethics and fair dealing, supplemented by a formal code of ethics which I have already issued with one of the Commonwealth procurement guidelines;</PARA>
<PARA> training and development to raise professionalism in Commonwealth purchasing and supply; and</PARA>
<PARA> use of practices and procedures that will make it easier for industry to provide commercial solutions to government, and for government to get value for money. For example, we will stress functional specifications rather than detailed technical specifications and purchasing planning, including forward purchasing planning. We will encourage negotiation, including post-offer negotiation in appropriate circumstances. We will strive to achieve standardised and simple documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider the first point, the stressing of functional specifications rather than detailed technical specifications in calling for expressions of interest and in tendering documentation, to be extremely important. In the past public sector agencies have relied too much on technical specifications to the exclusion of many fine Australian companies. In future we want to write functionally about a particular agency's need and to encourage Australian and New Zealand companies to tell us how they think they can supply goods which will meet that need. In that way, we hope to encourage research and to have innovative solutions put forward by potential suppliers rather than, in many cases, have companies excluded by an over-reliance upon the writing of technical specifications. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Government's preference policy. I have outlined our purchasing reforms. I now want to describe how we will effect reform of government industry policy as it will apply in future in tandem with the Government's purchasing reforms. (Quorum formed) For a long time the Federal Government has given some form of preference in its purchasing with the object of assisting Australian firms to obtain government business and thereby encourage the development of Australian industry. Since 1983 New Zealand industry has been treated in the same way as Australian industry for the purposes of the policy, consistent with the closer economic relations trade agreement between the two countries. The preference policy has been in operation in some form for many years and has four main elements: firstly, a monetary margin of preference; secondly, avoidance of biased or discriminatory practices in purchasing-as I have just said, we have not always been successful in excluding those practices-thirdly, debriefing of unsuccessful local tenderers so that they might do better next time; and, fourthly, mandatory use of local products in some construction works purchases. The preference margin is generally equivalent to a notional discount of 20 per cent on the Australian and New Zealand content of tendered goods and related services. There is discretion to give a higher margin in defined circumstances and for high value contracts. A review of the effectiveness of the preference policy was initiated last year. The review was part of our response to the 1987 report of the Inglis Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been extensive consultation with industry, the unions and the States about the preference policy as it affects government procurement. As part of the review, the Bureau of Industry Economics evaluated the effectiveness of the margin as an industry development mechanism. What has emerged is that, firstly, the margin is cumbersome and costly to administer; secondly, it has very little effect-for example, it has influenced the outcome of only 107 contracts out of tens of thousands; thirdly, it is inconsistent with the thrust of our industry policy, which is directed to making local industry more competitive-this is because it is like another protective tariff overlaid on the existing customs duty and it does not serve our concern to make industry more competitive-and, finally, the margin is inconsistent with the purchasing policy I have just enunciated, which has an overriding emphasis on value for money. In this regime it does not make sense to use a mechanism which is narrowly focused on price. Remember that the new purchasing policy does not rely solely on final price. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Government, the outcome of the review of preference policy was disappointing. I found myself responsible for a scheme which was not cost effective, which was not contributing to industry development and which was contrary to the thrust of the purchasing reforms which I have overviewed. But the Government believes very strongly that it must do something to demonstrate and make effective its commitment to Australian industry. The Government considered various alternatives to the margin, including a second offer scheme to give suppliers with high local content a chance to make a second bid in some circumstances. However, the scheme did not generate wide acceptance, so I did not proceed with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to abolish from 1 November next the notional 20 per cent discount component of the national preference agreement as applied by the Commonwealth, but it will retain and strengthen the anti-discriminatory elements of the current policy. For example, the Government is considering making purchasing managers ensure that the specifications they issue are not biased. The elimination of discrimination against local industry is fundamental government policy and the basis of the national preference agreement in which the States and New Zealand participate and to which the Commonwealth, under this Labor Government, is strongly committed. </PARA>
<PARA> Our decision was agreed to in principle by the signatories to the national preference agreement at a meeting of the Australian Industry and Technology Council on 22 September, which I attended together with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). Some of the State Ministers wanted to delay the removal of the margin for 12 months, but I said this was not a practical alternative if we were to press on with our general purchasing reforms. The changes will go ahead, and we have been asked to report back to the Australian Industry and Technology Council next year on our perceptions of their effectiveness. In any case, not all the signatories to the national agreement apply the 20 per cent margin. Some apply 10 per cent, and New Zealand does not apply a margin at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The specifics of the new arrangements are as follows: The 20 per cent preference margin and discretionary preference elements of the policy will be abolished from 1 November 1989, the same date as for the commencement of the purchasing reforms. Requests for tender for goods over $20,000 issued before that date will be assessed under the old system. The important elements of the policy dealing with non-discrimination and debriefing of unsuccessful local tenderers will be retained and strengthened, and emphasis will be placed on the use of functional specifications rather than detailed specifications, as I have said. This will give local suppliers the opportunity to offer cost-effective and innovative solutions to users' stated requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> A `Purchase Australian' office will be established. There will be a public sector education campaign about buying local products. We will fund the establishment of a full time national industrial supplies office coordinator. A working party of officials investigating whether departments should pay Customs duty will report by 1 November. Priority will be given to dealing with the remaining recommendations of the Inglis Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements. Consideration will be given to measures to coordinate the use of Commonwealth and State government purchasing to assist industry. There will be additional Commonwealth funding for the very successful national procurement development program. State Ministers at the recent Australian Industry and Technology Council meeting agreed in principle to additional joint funding for the program after June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to some details of these replacement preference measures. Existing measures, the measures which will be retained and strengthened, were last endorsed in 1984 and are designed to give Australian and New Zealand suppliers every opportunity to win orders from the Commonwealth. They require government specifications not to exclude suitable or reasonably adaptable Australian and New Zealand products, and that alternative Australian and New Zealand solutions be considered. They also require that departments' ordering patterns where possible be scaled to the minimum economic order requirements of Australian and New Zealand industry and that unsuccessful suppliers be debriefed on request about the reasons why they failed to win orders. </PARA>
<PARA>Purchase Australian Office</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This new and entrepreneurial organisation will be established in the Department of Administrative Services to develop a role in promoting Australian and New Zealand industry in government and government business opportunities to industry. It will help to educate business about government buying, without cutting across what is already being done in government departments and agencies. A 008 number has been installed in the new office to handle queries from local suppliers. The office will take on the role of designated body under the national preference agreement to investigate any complaints of discrimination. It will manage a public sector education program. It will work closely with those agencies in government with specific industry development functions, such as the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and Austrade, and with the purchasing community generally. It will also join in investigating other suggested initiatives, such as strategic purchasing by Commonwealth and State governments to develop local industries. It will also develop links with the industrial supplies offices. </PARA>
<PARA>National Industrial Supplies Office</PARA>
<PARA>Coordinator</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also committed funds for the establishment of a full-time national industrial supplies office coordinator in Canberra. The industrial supplies offices in the States assist suppliers to be fully aware of the commercial and technical requirements of major purchasers and ensure that these purchasers are equally aware of the supply capabilities of local producers. The national office will coordinate the efforts of the various State offices to stimulate Australian industry. The office is presently staffed on a part-time basis with funds from the States. The coordinator will work closely with the Purchase Australian Office. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Sector Education Campaign</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The aim of this campaign will be to promote in government the real advantages of dealing with Australian and New Zealand industry and the opportunities to get better value for money through doing so. These can include: whole-of-life support; shorter supply lines; and avoiding the vagaries of currency fluctuations. </PARA>
<PARA>Payment of Customs Duty by Departments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> One step we are disposed to take is to make departments, not just statutory authorities, pay Customs duty. Under present arrangements, departments are required to include the duty notionally for tender evaluation purposes. However, actual payment of the duty would remove a possible financial incentive departments might have to buy cheaper imports. It may also simplify the government purchasing process for both suppliers and buyers. We have directed a group of officials considering the issue to report by 1 November. </PARA>
<PARA>General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-Government Procurement Code</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Removal of the preference margin would allow fresh consideration of Australia's accession to the code should the Government decide that this will offer advantages to Australian industry. At present we are unable to sign as a result of the protective nature of the preference margin. </PARA>
<PARA> To reiterate, purchasing reform is an important part of the Government's programs for economic improvements. Greater public sector efficiency, to which I am dedicated, and improved access for local suppliers, has a beneficial effect right down the line. It is consistent with and complementary to the Government's programs for the development and restructuring of Australian industry. The issues have been thoroughly canvassed by all the interested parties. We all want better government purchasing systems that save time and money, improve service and performance and encourage local suppliers. We do not want symbolic reforms or to continue with processes, like the notional discount 20 per cent preferences, that are outmoded or unworkable. We aim to make purchasing by government conform to the best practices of the private sector. Certainly we will demonstrate for all to see our clear commitment to the development and strengthening of Australian industry and we will show our equally strong commitment to the anti-discriminatory principles underlying the national preference agreement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Ryan)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The statement just made by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) is one which any party in the House would support in its general thrust. There were some wonderful anomalies and throwaway lines in it. Towards the end of the speech the Minister said, `We don't want symbolic reforms'. That is exactly what the Government has. The Government is attempting to say that, through the removal of a 20 per cent preference that has been there for some considerable time, we can sign the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Big deal! We will really go places with trade in Australia with this reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister said at the beginning of the statement that this was a major element of micro-economic reform. It certainly is not. It is an attempt to dress up a few little things and to get away from the real problems. The Government is taking away the 20 per cent preference to Australian companies that is already in place, thus making them eligible for full time competition around the world. There is nothing wrong with that. However, there is one problem. They have to compete with the Government's interest rates-the 25 per cent stuff that has been created by this Government, which just wipes out the preferences. The Government has done absolutely nothing about deregulation of the labour market, which is the most important side of micro-economic reform. The shipping cartel costs Australia something like $500 or $600 per head of population every year. The Government has done nothing about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has done nothing about privatisation. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talks about it. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) occasionally talks about it. I know that this Minister does not talk about it because he is one of the lefties. The lefties will not be in it at all. They have control through the trade unions and the various conferences. People in the economic ministries know that privatisation is on. By doing that, far more is done for the efficiency of purchase and management than anything else I know and it would make another significant contribution to micro-economic reform. The last point relates to contracting out. If the Government wants to get value for money, it should call for tenders for services to Government. There was no mention whatsoever of that in the Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's contribution to micro-economic reform in this statement is virtually nil, except for the removal of the 20 per cent preference which places Australian manufacturing industry at more of a disadvantage because of the way in which the Government runs the economy. It is a statement of good intent which fails in all respects. It does not address any of the problems which confront Australia today and will continue to make the balance of payments of this nation impossible. The Australian economy will be almost unbearable for the next five years unless the basic things are addressed: coastal shipping, the waterfront, the labour market, privatisation of some of the most underfunded and poorly managed enterprises in Australia and the option of contracting out. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw those issues to the attention of the House because some of the rhetoric that we have heard here is quite remarkable. I will deal with some of the proposed changes. I have already alluded to the 20 per cent preference margin. It was announced that from 1 November 1989 this would go out the window. Great stuff! On the very same day that the Government announced it would abolish the 20 per cent preference, the Prime Minister in Question Time here defended giving Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd $60m to continue its preference. That is not a bad sort of double for the day. We have talked about doubles and trifectas before. We have one Minister saying `We will knock out the 20 per cent preference' and the Prime Minister saying, `We'll give Kodak $60m, no trouble at all'. It is in his electorate, so why not? This money is being given to a company which has trading difficulties not only in Australia but also internationally. It was all there for everyone to see in the American newspapers last week. In those reports of Kodak's difficulties, Australia was not mentioned. That is where Australia was rated-it received no mention. But the Government has said, `We'll give Kodak $60m anyway and knock out 20 per cent preference for Australian companies'. I say to the Minister for Administrative Services, `Well done! Good timing'. It shows an explicit and wonderful understanding of the workings of the Australian marketplace! But then the left wing does not have much idea of that, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to other elements in this statement. The second matter that was bandied around today is the establishment of a `Purchase Australian' office, but we have no explanation of exactly what that is. It will run some kind of educational program. It will put out a few dodgers. The Government is pretty good at putting out dodgers. The most expensive dodgers have been put out by the Government this year. We had a public relations firm running around the nation handing out dodgers on the environment. We had another lot handing out dodgers on immigration. I presume that this will be another dodgers show. The public relations firms are working overtime for the Government. No wonder the Government is getting so much free market research-that is where it comes from. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government is to run a public sector education campaign about buying local products. This has been going on for years; there is nothing new about it. It has been run by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce for many years. Fourthly, the Government states that it will fund the establishment of a full time National Industrial Supplies Office Coordinator. Big deal! What is he going to do? He will have an education office. There is certainly continuing government interference in the purchasing process. Fifthly, we will have a working party of officials investigating whether departments should pay Customs duty. Currently government departments do not pay Customs duty. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has had a fair go at telling us about this but I do not think he understood what he was talking about. The Government will knock out the 20 per cent preference and departments will now pay Customs duty. That is putting it in one pocket and taking it out of the other. It is convenient for balancing the books. Besides that, I wonder what its real benefits are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sixth matter that the Minister beat the drum about was the priority that will be given to dealing with the remaining recommendations of the Inglis Committee of Review on Government High Technology Purchasing Arrangements. He did not explain what that meant. The Committee recommended that we look at dual tenders for offsets; in other words, we call for tenders on the basis of no offset and with offset and we consider the real advantage to Australian industry and to Australian government services. In our policy we recommend that we call for dual tenders as they relate to these purchases. One then knows the real value of something one might be getting as it relates to the offset programs. In the past I have wondered what benefits that might have. Consideration will be given to measures to coordinate the use of Commonwealth and State government purchasing to assist industry. There is nothing wrong with that. It is an admirable concept. Finally, there will be additional funding for a successful national procurement development program. State Ministers, at a recent meeting, said that in June 1990 they would like to add to the funding of this program. That is commendable but I wonder about the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the ministerial statement is a good try. As I have said, it has missed more points than it has made. There is an attempt to remove the 20 per cent preference but the Government has completely failed in the objective of its statement. In the first paragraph of the statement it says that this is `a major element of micro-economic reform'. This is completely laughable. It addresses nothing more than trivia; it addresses nothing of substance; and it really does very little for Australian industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance before the House today relates to a stench that has come over this Government in recent months. It is not just the smell of political death: that is there; it is very strong and it is growing every day. I want to take up the theme that was developed by Max Walsh in his article about smelly deals to which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) referred in Question Time today. It is the stench of those deals that I want to focus on. They are deals being done by this Treasurer in support of certain specific vested interest groups around this country at the blatant disregard of what is good for this economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A whole series of compensation deals have hit the deck in recent days. Cabinet has obviously taken a decision that certain groups in this country will not live in poverty by 1990-no more bank shareholders will live in poverty by 1990; no more stevedoring owners will live in poverty by 1990; no more airline executives will live in poverty by 1990. So we can go on with the Government squandering taxpayers' money in an attempt to shore up a failing government to support the egos of a couple of its failing rock stars. </PARA>
<PARA> These deals are very bad: indeed, I suggest that they are dreadful economics. I suspect that in time they will prove to be seen to be lousy politics as well. They reek of panic and desperation. They favour a few mates who stand to do very well. In some cases these deals have been put together involving public servants in a way that has disregarded the normal proprieties of public servants' behaviour under the Westminster system. These deals do nothing to address our fundamental economic problems and in some cases they compound them. They are being orchestrated and, in some cases, directly negotiated by the person who, in this Government, is responsible for the economic welfare of all Australians, not just a few mates. That person is the Treasurer. He is not even in the House at this point to take up this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> These deals are a classic, blatant example of this Treasurer's gross irresponsibility not only in economic management but also in particular in the way in which these deals are being done. The snake oil salesman mantle has clearly shifted from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), where the Treasurer thought he had put it, back onto him. The title of `snake oil salesman' really has some contenders in the current circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to focus on three deals specifically. The first is the decision to compensate the airlines. This has prolonged the tourist dispute and threatened the livelihood of the entire tourist industry. Why is compensation being paid? It is being paid to save the Prime Minister's hide-no more, because he inflamed the dispute in the beginning-and to buy off a few mates in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The total cost will be about $A2m, although we do not know for sure. A story in the Age newspaper recently revealed that it was the Treasurer, by his continuing support for this decision-the fact that he went around and bullied some of his Cabinet colleagues to agree to it-who was directly responsible for this compensation deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since we have been subjected to a veritable barrage of misinformation by the Treasurer as to the insignificance of this dispute, the insignificance of its effect on the tourist industry and the insignificance of its effect on the balance of payments. It is a conscious attempt by the Treasurer to mislead. He ought to go to Tasmania or to Cairns or to Townsville. He ought to ask some of the mums and dads in the tourist industry in those areas what sort of damage his dispute has been doing to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently we had the classic case that the Treasurer used as his defence on the insignificance of the dispute from the point of view of the tourist industry. He said, `I mean, I was in Sydney in a hotel last week and it had an 83 per cent occupancy rate'. It begs the question: What was he doing in Sydney? What was he doing staying at a hotel? I thought he lived in Sydney. We have been subjected to this veritable barrage of misinformation-even his own Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) has completely disowned him on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The second classic deal relates to $60m committed to support Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, an American company in that well-known marginal seat of Wills. Apparently the Treasurer has clearly supported this deal. We do not know for sure; he may be ducking and weaving in public about this. When asked the other day, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not a matter of whether I am enthusiastic. The Government has made a decision. I'm enthusiastic for the government decisions, sport, always. </PARA>
<PARA>Okay, sport, wear it. The third deal and the real daddy of them all-and this one is entirely Paul's own work-is when he sat down with the banks and the Reserve Bank in putting together this deal on bank interest rates. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The deal is interest rates won't be going to 18 per cent, they will be sticking at 17 per cent and they'll-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the banks-</PARA>
<PARA>have to keep their eye on monetary conditions in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>He refers to this as a deal. The head of the Trade Practices Commission does not know whether there is a deal. Just look at the words of the Treasurer. Some of the chief executives of the banks have referred to it as an agreement, a deal or an understanding. According to Paul Kelly in the Australian, the Treasurer suggested this idea to the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister liked the idea. They kept it a secret and went ahead and did the negotiation, and the Treasurer took his mate Bernie along with him just to get the job done. This is a most unbelievable set of circumstances. It is unprecedented behaviour by a central bank governor to be involved directly in negotiating that sort of political deal. Today's press suggests that many senior people in the Reserve Bank are apparently totally disillusioned by the role that the new Governor has played in that deal. </PARA>
<PARA> To be clear, I, like everyone else in this House, want lower interest rates. But we want genuinely lower interest rates that are brought about and validated by appropriate policy adjustment, and we want them to be genuinely sustainable at those lower levels. But this deal ensures that none of those things happens; indeed, it threatens to compound many of our basic economic problems. The bottom line, which this Treasurer should wear in due course, is that this is an easing of policy in what is still a very overheated economy. This further easing of policy will underwrite the wage blow-out which the Treasurer most fears. Of course, they are not called blow-outs now; blow-outs are had within the system. They are blow-ins, not blow-outs. But there will be a substantial increase in earnings as a result of this deal, underwritten by this monetary policy easing. The bottom line down the track could well be another Australian dollar crisis to boot, not only because of the bad economics in this deal but because of the irreparable damage that has been done to the reputation and independence of the central bank by the involvement of the Governor in this sort of deal. </PARA>
<PARA> There are key points that I want to put to the House today. There are a lot of unanswered questions about this deal and I think this is a good opportunity to put half a dozen or so questions directly to the Treasurer so that he can spell out to the Australian public, to those who happen to gain and, in particular, to those who happen to lose under this deal, exactly what is being done. First, how long is the deal to last? Secondly, what are the conditions under which this deal is to hold? Did the Reserve Bank agree to target a particular level of cash rates and to hold rates at that level? That would be a pretty interesting exercise if, in due course, the balance of payments numbers continue to blow out. We have had fairly odd behaviour in recent days. The Reserve Bank has been trying to dissuade people from the view that this is an easing of monetary policy. People are saying, `It looks like it'-but look at the way the Reserve Bank has been managing cash rates and the signals it has sent out in trying to downplay this matter. It knows that the last thing it can afford in current circumstances, given the Treasurer's lack of policy commitment in any other area, is to create a bull run in financial markets at present. The Treasurer might want it for political reasons, but the Reserve Bank fears the April syndrome of unjustified bull runs. </PARA>
<PARA> Question three: Is this deal being consummated by an exchange of letters between the Reserve Bank and the banks? I believe that it is. If it is, the content of those letters ought to be made public to everyone in this country so that they can see the nature of that deal. Fourthly, is the deal tied only to owner-occupied housing, excluding lending for investment properties? If so, I guess that the decision taken was, `Stuff those who rent'. Too bad; they miss out. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, why is the deal limited to housing rates at the big four banks and not to business borrowing rates, overdraft rates and so on? We note that all the major banks have increased their prime rates in recent days or weeks. They have not held those rates down, and they will not-because they have learnt that in a deregulated environment, when one rate is forced down artificially low, why lend at that rate and not at other rates? There has been a conscious decision here to subsidise those who have housing loans at the expense of those who do not have them but want them, or at the expense of the business community and other borrowers who are serviced by those banks, because they are all paying higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> To be specific about that issue of new borrowers, what deal did the banks enter into in relation to new borrowers? Will they make the funds available? In a regulated environment we have learnt that they will ration the funds available at artificially low interest rates. So what deal has been done for the new home buyers in this example? Seventh, what about the other banks that hold non-callable deposits that are not part of the deal, such as Citibank Ltd, Advance Bank Australia Ltd, Challenge Bank Ltd, Metway Bank Ltd and National Mutual Royal Savings Bank? Is this just a windfall for them? What about their borrowers? Are they getting lower interest rates or not? What about the State banks, many of which are large housing lenders but do not hold non-callable deposits? They are in the market having to borrow at high interest rates. Has the Treasurer had any discussions with them? Is there any understanding about their rates?</PARA>
<PARA> What about building societies? The Treasurer says that it is not his concern; he does not care about building societies. Building societies lend only in Blaxland. The Treasurer does not care about that as he hardly visits that electorate at all. He has probably been there even less than the Prime Minister has been to Wills. The St George Building Society, for example, makes 20 per cent of its home loans to first home buyers. Forty per cent of them live in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. A third of them are blue-collar workers. They are all basically on average incomes. They have to borrow a very high percentage of their outlay. And 62 per cent of them require joint incomes to service those loans. But, as I have said, the Treasurer does not worry about them. They are only the traditional Labor voters. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a question has been raised by Max Walsh about the link between this deal and the merger plans of the banks. Okay, the Treasurer claims that there is not any link. What discussions has he had with the banks involved in this potential merger plan? Has he had any other discussions with the Westpac Banking Corporation in relation to the potential privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank? I would not be surprised if there were a lot more to that allegation than the Treasurer has been prepared to admit. The fact is that these deals are being done without any consideration of what is necessary and good for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> A week or so ago our balance of payments deficit was $2.6 billion-an absolute record level by a long way; $700m to $800m or so. What was the Treasurer's answer to that? `It is in the groove. Don't worry about it. Everything is coming good. It is right on track. A host of special factors'-the same reason he has used every month for the last 17 or 18 months. There are always special factors that will reverse the trend and turn things around. It is always due to factors that happened six to nine months ago and, when we go back six to nine months we find him saying, `It happened six to nine months ago'. We are living in slots of six to nine months but the problem is growing; it is not shrinking. The Treasurer has no solution to our economic problems. He is locked into a tight monetary, high interest rate policy that he knows is totally counterproductive to dealing with our basic balance payments and inflation problems. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look to the Treasurer's explanation as to how it will work and how it will all fit together, we get a varying range of explanations as to how monetary policy actually impacts on things. Sometimes we are told that it is a very equitable instrument; it distributes the burden right across the population. Of course, when the Treasurer did this housing deal, he said that it was having too much of an impact on the housing sector. He manages to explain how it impacts on investment, sometimes, and, on other occasions, he explains how it does not. On those occasions where it does have an impact on investment, he is very shrewd: it impacts only on investment that is not in the tradeable goods sector. The Treasurer has said, `Investment will be the thing that saves us. This investment boom is creating new export capacity and it is increasing our productive capacity'. Where is the evidence? We have not seen any. The little evidence which we have, which was summarised recently in the Australian Financial Review in a survey done by Miller and Associates on the breakdown of capital goods imports, shows some very interesting things:</PARA>
<PARA> Data processing is the high growth area-</PARA>
<PARA>in these investment goods-</PARA>
<PARA>but most of this equipment is going into the finance sector-</PARA>
<PARA>which, of course, is the Treasurer's favourite sector-</PARA>
<PARA>and public service. </PARA>
<PARA>Things such as video cassette recorders (VCRs) are classified as capital goods. There are big imports of record players, VCRs, radio telephones, televisions and so on-all creating genuine export capacity and all doing what the Treasurer says: creating the capacity to substitute for imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Treasurer has lost control. His arrogance is such that he will not admit that he has lost control. He will not go to the Australian people and say, `I have stuffed it', and he will not change policy. So he is looking for bandaids, panaceas and snake oil remedies to patch this thing up to try to get him through the next election. The Treasurer will bear the cost of this, and in due course, when inflation runs away, when the wage explosion takes place, when the exchange rate comes under substantial pressure, and when the economy slides towards a recession, he should stand up and take credit for the lot of it, because it is entirely his doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard the typically noisy and abusive speech we hear from the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). I do not mind being abused because I can dish a bit of it back, but abusing public servants has become the cowardly stock-in-trade of the honourable member for Wentworth. He came into the House spraying abuse around. An old friend of mine said, `Never worry about the skyrockets in politics-first a shower of sparks, then a dead stick falls to earth'. There is a dead stick on the Opposition front bench. We were seeing the last of his sparks in another noisy, bellicose, empty speech. He said that there are lots of questions to be answered but he could not get a question up at Question Time. He could not get one up on any day of the last two weeks of sitting. Lots of questions have been answered but he cannot ever think of one in Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the cover of a matter of public importance, not having asked me a question about the economy, he suggests that I answer all these matters of high moment. He suggests that I come in and say, `You have questions, do you? Let me get them all down'. He is lucky that I am here to answer his case at all, given the contempt with which he treats the Parliament by not asking questions of the Government on economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member started off by saying that I am always turning things around. One thing we have turned around is investment. He should have winced at the components of gross domestic product chart in Budget Statement No. 2, which is set out in five-year blocks of investment. It shows that, in the five years under Labor to 1988, investment was running at an annual rate of 10.8 per cent real. In the five years to 1983 it was 1.6 per cent. It is not even relative to it. It is not even within proximity. To 1988 it was 10.8 per cent on average, and 1.6 per cent for the previous five years. In the five years before that it was 2.3 per cent. In the five years to 1978 it was 2.6 per cent. So in the 15 years to 1983, investment in this country was running at an average rate of 2.2 per cent. As I have said in the post-Budget debate, if we take investment by Japan in the coal phase out of that, we had no investment in Australia for 15 years. That is where the current account came from. In those last five critical years, the honourable member for Wentworth was the principal adviser to the then Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member said that I am always turning something around. The fact is that we have turned investment around. Only a Labor government could re-ignite the torch of investment in this country. The pin-striped suit brigade, the so-called representatives of the managers, could not do anything. The honourable member had to sit and watch the capital stock fall to bits. He could not arrest a decline in our capital stocks. He could not get investment. There was so little confidence in him by the business community that it could do no better than a 2.2 per cent rate of investment, even with the Japanese building mines like they were going out of style. It had nothing to do with Australian economic policy. The fact is that I am turning things around-Australia, by investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talks about the deals the Government is making. He alleges that we are spending $200m on the airlines. In fact, at the moment the cost looks like being about $20m. It is a very small cost to this year's Budget. To do what? To keep the Australian airline system working, so that planes could get in the air, and the ground staff and refuellers. If the ground staff and refuellers had been put off, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots would have been nearer to a de facto win. That is basically because right through this dispute the Opposition has stood for the pilots. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition talks about having a great industrial relations policy. Little Piety himself, Fred Chaney, is supposed to have the policy. Where has he been? The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has been fronting for him for three weeks. Poor old David Jull. Talk about back from the dead! We have not heard from him for years. He has been dredged out. He has put on a Qantas cap and a pilot's uniform and, joystick in hand, is out there defending coalition policy. Where is the industrial relations spokesman? The going has got too rough. When it really mattered, he evaporated. He has now rejoined the radio programs, as he thinks the dispute has settled into a concrete position so he can criticise the Government. But when the dispute was fluid, where was he? He evaporated. Basically his policy is to cave in. It has always been the same policy. He believes in industrial appeasement. He thinks a tight monetary policy will lock up Australia's employers, and they will then comply with the objective of government economic policy against any rapacious wage claim. In fact, this has never been the case and never will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers gave the Opposition the thumbs down this week. This week's Business Review Weekly survey said that 21 per cent of Australia's chief executive officers supported the Opposition's industrial relations policy. The Opposition does not have a policy on the key variable in the economy, wages. As I have said in this Parliament on a number of occasions, if a government cannot run wages in Australia it cannot run Australia. The Opposition cannot, and that is why it will not be given the chance. </PARA>

<PARA> Then there is the claim about the terrible deal we did with the banks, that is, we developed an even flatter playing field between banks and non-banks and a better basis for the regulation of banks. Instead of that appealing to the shadow Treasurer, he says it is a smelly deal. But his colleague the shadow Minister for finance, Senator Stone, endorsed it, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course we wouldn't scrap yesterday's decision because as you yourself pointed out-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the interviewer-</PARA>
<PARA>it does take the regime in relation to these non-callable deposits somewhat closer to a market regime. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course he endorsed it. He endorsed it because he was a bit thoughtful about it. He understood what it was. The honourable member for Wentworth understands what it is, too. But being basically in the political grafting business these days, he does not have the decency to say so. The result is: How could he support a system whereby we removed the old statutory reserve deposits (SRDs), his instrument? It was distorting savings banks and trading banks because trading banks would not accept deposits while they had to leave 5 per cent of them with the Reserve Bank, so it ran its book through the savings bank, or off book, or abroad, but not on book. How could the honourable member support the retention of SRDs when we moved to these non-callable deposits on a broad basis of liabilities, where we had a penalty of 5 per cent, that is, when we instituted them, as a T-note of around 10 per cent against an interest rate of 5 per cent, leaving a penalty of 5 per cent-to find that penalty had become 13 per cent, as short term interest rates went to 18 per cent and provided the Reserve Bank with a windfall? Instead of having a 5 per cent penalty, we had 18. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have a market-related formula, T-notes minus five, which restores that penalty to 5 per cent, and gives a better basis for the regulation of banks. The diminished revenue which the banks would be paying the central bank can be devoted to what would otherwise have been a higher cost of borrowers in housing. Why is it in housing? It is because the margins in housing were cut down compared to the margins in commercial lending. That is why the banks devoted the proceeds of that to housing. </PARA>
<PARA> But, of course, the Opposition was hoping that housing interest rates would move to 18 per cent. That is what it would have been hoping last week, saying, `Here's a chance. We think the banks are going to jack the rate up to 18 per cent and that will do the Government a bit of damage'. But, as usual, Opposition members fell on their faces. What we came up with was another bit of financial innovation, which is about improving the relationship between banks and non-banks and flattening the playing field. The Opposition talks about building societies and State banks. They do not pay these penalties; they do not make these deposits. So they are not wearing this burden and, therefore, could enjoy no benefit from the change. The building societies have not got between 25 per cent and 33 per cent of their book at regulated housing rates for lending at 13 1/2 per cent. All their book is non-regulated. All their loans are profitable, not just 60 per cent of them. That is why there can be no question about building societies and State banks needing to be involved in such an arrangement. But again that was endorsed by the shadow Minister for finance, who said, `Yes, this brings the arrangement somewhat closer to a market regime. It is a more sensible prudential structure. Instead of hailing that and saying, `That is good, that is a sensible change, it is a market-related price, it is a flatter field for banks and non-banks, and it also means that rates do not have to go to 18 per cent', the Opposition is about rates as high as anyone can get them. That is what the Opposition is about-it is basically about pumping interest rates up. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the honourable member for Wentworth has the gall-he is back to his usual game of the last year or two of attacking the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)-to refer to `my mate Bernie'. That is the term he used. He should be ashamed for saying that. It is unprecedented behaviour. The shadow Treasurer said, talking about non-callable deposits with the constituent banks, that a central bank governor should not be involved in the decision. That is what he was saying. The shadow Treasurer said that it was unprecedented for him to be there. He ought to be ashamed of himself. The shadow Treasurer is a lout for using that kind of language in Parliament about somebody who is in the bureaucracy of this country. When the former Governor left office this is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Throughout more than six years in office, this Government has been very correct in its dealings with the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that: `very correct in its dealings with the Bank'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Relations personally have been harmonious and very fruitful. There has been no interference in matters that are the responsibility of the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>This counters the mealy-mouthed charge thrown around by the shadow Treasurer for years about deceitful interference by the Government in monetary policy. The former Governor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no interference in matters that are the responsibility of the Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is the killer punch line:</PARA>
<PARA>Only an `insider' can know that that has not always been so!</PARA>
<PARA>In the language of bureaucratese, it is like a big neon sign-`only an insider can know that that has not always been so!'. In other words, he was talking about the shadow Treasurer. He was talking about the way the honourable member for Wentworth used to beat the Reserve Bank around the head when he was advising Treasurer Howard, who was up there trying to interfere with RBA policy all the time for his own political purposes. Of course, this is the yardstick of the shadow Treasurer. He knows what he is always up to. He is always in there trying to distort bank decisions, and because he was he thinks that we were. But the fact is that we were not. We treated this institution with respect. It has a proper position, which I enunciated in a letter in a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald about the balance between the Government's proper powers as the elected government and the responsibility of the Reserve Bank. But this notion the shadow Treasurer is now putting that we hide behind some central bank is, of course, nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole matter of public importance is just a sham. What the shadow Treasurer is after is higher interest rates. He has not got a ghost of a policy about anything. He cannot put a question up at Question Time. He attacks bureaucrats under the cover and privilege of Parliament. He is a parliamentary coward who has little decency and no policy to match any of the words he puts here in the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested in the opening remarks of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) because they were unusually subdued. It was an unusually flat performance from the Treasurer which I can only put down to the word going around that he got knocked over in the Cabinet on the Kodak deal. They were the words of someone who has had a pretty rough trot within the Cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can I put one issue aside in respect of investment? The Treasurer was just plain wrong, which is not something unusual for him. Since 1982-83 investment in this country has averaged 24.7 per cent of gross domestic product a year compared to 24.9 per cent under the Fraser years, 1974-75 to 1982-83. So let us just put that one off to one side. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer had difficulty defending himself for his 15 minutes, but I was not disappointed because by the time he had spoken for 12 minutes out came the abuse and arrogance of the Treasurer whom we all know and love. He was the man who a few years ago said, `I am the world's best Treasurer. I'm that good that people would give me the Legion of Honour if I was in France'. Honourable members will remember the Treasurer's phrase, `I am so good I deserve a Congressional Medal'. People will certainly remember his time in office. They will remember the Treasurer as a man of compassion, happily waving to the Sydney crowds from behind the tinted glass of a Commonwealth car. They will remember him with the latest antique clock in his collection tucked under his arm while on an occasional trip to his electorate. They will remember him for his travel allowance and his late tax returns. Above all, they will remember this Treasurer for the language he used to disguise economic incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> Under his stewardship, these years have been years of lost opportunities for the Australian economy. These have been years when Australia, instead of matching our international competitors, has been falling behind. A clear indication of that, one set of facts that really does tell the story, is that when this Government came into office Australia's foreign debt was about $20 billion and today it is around $110 billion. The Treasurer's normal response is to blame somebody else. Have we not had some corkers over the years from the Treasurer? I remind honourable members of the Treasurer's comment about Sydney house prices when they went up. What was his excuse on that occasion? He said, `It is all the fault of the masses out there. They all want quarter-acre blocks'. Blame the Hill's hoist! Then there is the monthly excuse when imports are too high: `Well, there have been too many imports of aeroplanes'. That is the usual one when imports are too high. When the current account deficit is too high, the normal response is usually a bit Whitlamesque. Honourable members will remember Gough Whitlam telling the Gippsland farmers in the early 1970s that they had never had it so good-and they have never forgotten it, either. This Treasurer made famous the statement, `Our cup runneth over with effervescence'. That would make Marie Antoinette turn in her grave. When all else fails, it is the old three-envelope trick, the first envelope saying `Blame the previous government'. That is one of the Treasurer's favourite responses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer should not question the need for change. In fact, it is an issue where there is a fair degree of common view. For example, in 1988 the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>A Labor Government has got to have an on-going reform agenda. If you don't then you will be like a dead cat in the middle of the road being run over by a steam roller. </PARA>
<PARA>If he accepts the need for reform, what I say to the Treasurer is: stand up dead pussy. On the Midday  show in September 1987-and this is a statement about the need for change-he said with a touch of arrogance:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the great coming of age of Australia. This is the golden age of economic change. </PARA>
<PARA>The questioner then said:</PARA>
<PARA>How much credit do you take?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>Oh, a very large part. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the answer from the Treasurer. In September 1988, the Treasurer said to the Economic Planning Advisory Council:</PARA>
<PARA>We will not hesitate to adjust policy further if our balance of payments or inflation objectives are being threatened. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, history shows that within months of the 1988 Budget the Government's objectives had evaporated and gone for all time. Upon its election in mid-1987, this Government announced that this would be the term of major micro-economic reform. The Treasurer was absolutely fulsome in his explanation of the Government's policies. He described himself as a sort of maestro painter. He was going to give us the big brush economic changes, reinforced by sweeping strokes going to the micro or industry level. Of course, instead of the sort of timeless masterpiece he gave us an impression of we have just had the sordid, mindless, contradictory smearing of graffiti on the walls of the marshalling yards of the Spencer Street station. The Treasurer is not on the big canvas. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at the micro-economic reform agenda. It is a long agenda but we should look at the contradictions, the backflips, and the somersaults we have had from the Treasurer on that issue. Take privatisation, for example. It is quite clear that many things could be done better if they were done not by governments but by private enterprise. Talking about backflips, let us go to what the Treasurer said in May 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities in the hands of the Commonwealth. . . . We are not about wrecking them and selling them. </PARA>
<PARA>Not about selling them? Two or three years later he talks about an airline owned by the Government and what does he say? He says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . basically, I don't think the Government ought to be running airlines . . . we can't be putting billions into Qantas and Australian Airlines and the like. </PARA>
<PARA>One day he is one way, the next another. In the end he gave way to the loony Left and is now back opposing privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at interest rates. Again, we have had amazing gyrations. Just a few months ago-only back in July-the Treasurer spoke about interest rates:</PARA>
<PARA>While confirming that Cabinet would discuss measures to relieve interest rate pressures, Mr Keating said he was personally against such plans because they were just `fiddling at the edges'. </PARA>
<PARA>He would not have a bar of them. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he lashed out at the Federal Labor MP's meeting tomorrow to discuss mortgage rate relief, dismissing their plan as just `public theatre' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was just three months ago. Here we have one of the great fiddles of all time. The Government has done a dirty, smelly deal with the banks. It brought in the Reserve Bank of Australia and jeopardised its independence in the doing of the deal. The Treasurer has gone back on what he said just a few months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are just two issues. Let us take shipping as a further example. People say, `What are we going to do to make this country more efficient?'. We ought to do something about the efficiencies of shipping. Transport is a big cost in this country; it is a big country. We ought to have the most efficient shipping service in the world; but instead we have one of the most inefficient. On that issue the Treasurer is absolutely silent, as he has been on the wharfies issue. Do honourable members know what the Government's policy now is? No wharfies shall live in poverty in 1990! That is the Treasurer's policy. The Government has been talking about fixing up the waterfront for years and years and years. We have had more reports on the waterfront than we have had hot Sunday lunches. There have been loads and loads of them. This Government set up a committee in 1984. In 1986 it set up another one. It got that report, put it off and set up another authority, the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. It has got that report. An earlier report said to do something in three months. That was six months ago. The next report said not to do anything for two months. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the Treasurer on these fundamental issues? There is a deafening silence from him. Wherever we look these political deals are being done to suit the political convenience of the Government, with total disregard for the interests of the economy. The Government is buying off geriatric wharfies for $150m and buying off the banks for $200m. It is buying off the tourist industry for $30m-some consolation. It is buying off Bill Kelty with $100m-an open-ended cheque-just to support the Government's position in the airlines pilots dispute, which was inflamed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Wherever we go the snake oil salesman is there with a blank cheque. It is not his money; it is everyone's money. It is the taxpayers' money. This Government has abandoned any pretence of rational policy for this country. It has cast it all aside as it heads towards the next election, and it stands condemned for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Logical consistency has never been one of the Opposition's long suits. This matter of public importance today complains about the Government's failure properly to address the balance of payments problem. In the course of the debate the Opposition has gone on record in effect as advocating a tighter monetary policy than the one we have at the moment. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), criticised the Government for what he in effect characterised as a loosening of monetary policy. I think we can say that the Opposition favours a further tightening of monetary policy-that is, higher interest rates. No doubt tomorrow, or in the not too distant future, the Opposition will put on the Notice Paper for debate at this time of the day a motion complaining about the effect of high interest rates on home-buying families. On the one hand the Opposition is in effect criticising the Government for what is characterised as a loosening of monetary policy-that is, bringing about a situation where housing interest rates are lower than they would otherwise be-but on the other hand it complains about the effect of high interest rates on living standards. There is no logical consistency in that or anything else the Opposition has to say on any of these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of public importance refers to the balance of payments problem. The Opposition criticises the Government for not doing enough to repair that problem. There is no doubt that there is a significant balance of payments problem. But what is the nature of that economic problem and what distinguishes it from the sorts of difficulties the Australian economy was experiencing in the latter years of the former coalition Government? Let us make a comparison there. Towards the end of the former coalition Government, in 1982 and the early part of 1983, headlines in the major financial newspapers talked about an economy in free fall. We were looking at a massive loss of employment, negative economic growth for the first time in the post-war period and a projected Budget deficit of almost $10 billion. That was the legacy of the Opposition. It was the sort of economic problem that the Opposition left us with. </PARA>
<PARA> What sort of economic problems do we have now? We have a situation where the economy is regarded generally by economists as growing too strongly for its long term good. Employment continues to grow very strongly. Some 1.5 million jobs have been created since this Government took office and in the last year we have seen continuing and extremely fast employment growth. We have also seen a massive investment surge. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) pointed out in his contribution to this debate, we now have investment as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) at historically high levels. We have very large scale imports of capital goods and we also have large scale imports of consumer goods. We have an economy in which demand is growing too fast for production. That demand is not just for consumption goods; it is also for investment goods that will lay the foundation for restructuring our economy in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a problem of demand outstripping supply in the economy and that overflow going into imports. Undoubtedly that is an economic problem, but a fundamentally different problem from those left to us by the Opposition. I would submit to honourable members and to members of the public that it is a more benign problem than the sorts of economic difficulties the Opposition left us with-negative real growth, rapidly falling employment and a Budget deficit which was a consequence of that negative growth and looked like blowing out to $10 billion. The surplus projected for the current financial year is of almost equal magnitude to the deficit the Opposition left us with. While there is undoubtedly a balance of payments problem, it is a very different sort of problem from the economic problems the Opposition left us with. In terms of employment, living standards and the long term prospects of the Australian economy, we have a much more favourable situation than that left to us by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition constantly criticises Government policies and what the Government does. It looks at difficulties in the economic outlook and points to problems and so forth. It never puts forward a coherent alternative policy framework of its own. Time and again it is challenged by those who say, `What would you do if you were given the job of running the national economy tomorrow?'. The shadow Treasurer has had this question put to him directly on numerous television and radio programs by a number of interviewers. What has he said? He has said, `That is not my problem. That is something for the government of the day to sort out'. This is what purports to be a credible Opposition. When it is called upon to say what it would do differently from the present Government in current economic circumstances, what does it say? Essentially it has nothing to say that is of any coherence or value. When it is pressed on this matter it starts to mutter a few things. What sort of things do members of the Opposition talk about? On the one hand, they say that expenditure should be cut and fiscal policy should be tighter. They say that they are against increasing taxes, but they think that fiscal policy should be even tighter than it is. That can only mean cuts in expenditure. A logical next step is to ask them, `Where would you cut the expenditure?'. Invariably when they are confronted with the question-and in every Budget in the last few years the Treasurer has put this to them-`Where would you cut expenditure where the Government has not already done so?', they are unable to identify the areas that they would cut. They know full well that over this last few years this Government has gone through the most rigorous expenditure control exercise of any government in Australia's history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says it is nonsense, but the fact is that we have seen public sector outlays as a proportion of GDP fall from close on 30 per cent to something in the low twenties. That is a tightening of fiscal policy which is unprecedented in Australian history; but also very few parallels has anywhere in the world, I would submit. The Opposition says to tighten further, to cut further, but it cannot identify where it would cut. Members of the Opposition know full well that if they were to make meaningful additional cuts they would be cutting not into fat but into bone and muscle-they would be cutting into welfare expenditure and significant health, education and housing outlays. They will not say that that is what they would do because they know full well how the Australian people would react to that sort of information once it is put honestly on the table, which they invariably fail to do. They say that they would run a tighter fiscal policy but, of course, they would not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the Opposition sometimes talk about wages policy. The problem they have is that they really have not got a wages policy; they have no coherent framework for wages determination. Are they seriously suggesting that Australian wage-earners who have put up with significant real wage restraint over the last few years will be expected to put up with further real wage restraint? That is the implication of what they are saying. Again, they fail to spell that out. Having dispensed with that, they then go on to say that they would pursue more aggressively a micro-economic reform agenda and they talk about privatisation, deregulation, fixing up the waterfront, coastal shipping and all this sort of thing. That is all very well, but even if we accept that the sort of policy prescriptions the Opposition put forward in those areas would produce significant efficiency gains-and that is very arguable-the fact is that nobody suggests with any degree of seriousness that those sorts of changes would produce results other than in the medium to longer term. They are not a solution to our short term balance of payments problems, if they are anything at all. I do not believe that the Opposition's micro-economic reform agenda is any good either. I think the Government's agenda is incomparably better. Even if we believe that those things will produce some significant results over the medium to longer term, that does not get us out of the current problem that we have with these very large balance of payments figures coming through. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing much left except for the Opposition to say that it would further tighten monetary policy which, as the shadow Treasurer today has confirmed, is precisely what the Opposition's policy is. As a matter of logical exhaustion of all other possibilities the Opposition is left with the further tightening of monetary policy, higher interest rates, higher mortgage rates and a greater impost on the living standards of Australian families paying off their homes. That is the logical consequence of what it had to say today. In other words, its policy is a load of nonsense. It has no coherency or logic, and it shows a total disregard for the needs of the Australian economy and for the needs and well-being of the Australian people. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation) Amendment Bill originated in the Senate. It was introduced into the Senate by Senator Puplick on 6 September and was passed by the Senate the following day in the face of Government opposition. It now comes into the House of Representatives and, at the outset, we on this side of the Parliament call on the Government to support this piece of legislation and ensure in terms of the programming of debate in this chamber that it returns to this legislation as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a relatively short one, and in fact occupies only two sides of one piece of paper. As has been read out by the Clerk, it is entitled the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits Determination Revocation) Amendment Bill 1989. That in itself is a mouthful, but what the Bill seeks to do is very simple indeed: it seeks to revoke, and indeed strike down, the determination made on 28 August 1989 of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. To read directly from the Bill, proposed section 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal dated 28 August 1989 and made under section 98b of the Principal Act is and shall be of no force or effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, because I think you have been in the Chair on at least one occasion, we in this chamber have debated twice in recent weeks what we might call the current issue of pharmacy-the issue of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), and the specific issue of the remuneration package as it applies to community pharmacy around the country. It is not my intention in speaking to this Bill to go through all of the details and all of the argument again. I refer honourable members to the matters of public importance debate that took place on 7 September and also the debate, on that same day, on the National Health Amendment Bill 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement on 28 August of the reduction of $1.05 per prescription progressively to 1 November 1990 strikes at the core of the Remuneration Tribunal's determination-that is, to reduce by $1.05 the amount that pharmacists would receive per prescription progressively to 1 November 1990, and eliminate totally the mark-up on the costs of pharmaceutical goods that the pharmacists have hitherto been able to charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few weeks that determination has precipitated the greatest crisis that community pharmacy has faced in this country since Federation. It has precipitated the greatest threat to the integrity and operation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which benefits all of us, whereby our desired and necessary pharmaceutical products are subsidised. Reliable estimates are that if the determination is proceeded with there will be closures of up to 1,000 pharmacies around the country, and greatly reduced access by the public to pharmaceutical services and, therefore, to the facilities of and provisions offered by the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Finally, if one had to pick one figure to sum up the situation, alongside the closure of 1,000 pharmacies around the country there would be upwards of a 23 per cent cut in the remuneration package to pharmacists in respect of the dispensing work they do.</PARA>
<PARA> I said I would not repeat all the arguments that have been aired in this place, but there are a couple of statistics I would like to put forward to remind the House of what I said in the matter of public importance debate a couple of weeks ago. If this Tribunal's determination is proceeded with, small pharmacies which commonly dispense about 80 prescriptions a day would suffer a loss of income, straight off the top, of about $400 a week. Medium sized pharmacies which commonly dispense about 120 prescriptions a day would suffer a loss, again straight off the top, of about $600 a week. Large pharmacies which commonly dispense about 300 scripts a day would suffer a loss, again off the top, of about $1,700 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> There has grown up in the community, among the 5,600 pharmacists and hundreds of thousands of people around Australia, a public outrage about this Tribunal decision and the likely flow-on effects if it is ever implemented. In the face of that outrage the Government has remained steadfast and resolute. It has referred to the fact that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is an independent body constituted by legislation and it, the Government, cannot interfere in its determinations. If that is its public, upfront stance, the Government has made two changes already. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it has made a new package deal with wholesalers whereby the Government has agreed to increase wholesalers margins on PBS items above $45 from 10 per cent to 13 per cent. The reason the Government has made this change already, in the face of the Tribunal's determination, is that one of the consequences of the determination is that pharmacists would actually lose money stocking-let alone dispensing-higher cost items. The argument I used several weeks ago is that quite apart from the reduced remuneration package which pharmacists would be getting under this Tribunal decision, it would cost them money to stock items costing more than $100, for example, insulin, to be dispensed to diabetics around the country. This is one of the so-called unintended consequences of the Tribunal's decision. `Unintended consequences' is one of those phrases that have found their way into the political lexicon of this country. This was certainly an unintended consequence of some moment, and the Government has moved to put it right. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, what is perhaps of even greater significance in this overall issue is the fact that the Government has joined with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia at long last. Last week the Prime Minister called representatives from the Guild into his prime ministerial suite, and he and they came to an arrangement whereby the introduction of this Tribunal finding, scheduled to be introduced on 1 October, would be delayed a month. That delay has occurred only because of direct prime ministerial intervention in the face of the resolute and steadfast stance adopted by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), who is responsible for this area. The Government hopes that this extra breathing space will allow it to negotiate with the Pharmacy Guild through the expert committee the three other areas that are closely allied with this particular Tribunal decision. Basically, they are the development of the eligibility criteria for what is known as the essential pharmacy allowance (EPA); the appropriate means of enhancing the professional role of pharmacists and community pharmacy and appropriate remuneration; and, lastly, the restructuring of retail pharmacy including the need for financial incentives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Housing and Aged Care thought he had struck pay-dirt with the establishment of an expert panel charged with the responsibility of looking at these three areas. It is true that the panel has recommended eligibility criteria for what we now know as the new essential pharmacy allowance. The panel recommended that the essential pharmacy allowance be paid to pharmacists who are at least 10 kilometres by road from the nearest approved pharmacy, have a claimable prescription volume of no more than 15,000 per annum and are open at least 20 hours per week. </PARA>
<PARA> All the three areas that I mentioned-the eligibility criteria for the EPA, the concept of a professional fee, and the restructuring of retail pharmacies-are very important but, in the context of this whole issue, they are fiddling at the edges, and this is an example of the Government back-pedalling as fast as it can. The real problem still lies with the determination of the Tribunal of 28 August 1989. The real problem with the Tribunal's determination is that it was based on flawed surveys and an invalid database. Only 0.3 per cent of the pharmacies around Australia were surveyed, the figures were grossly out of date, and key costings, such as wages and rent, were based on unrealistic figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that the Liberal and National parties have been making ever since this tribunal finding was announced is that it is the wrong decision. It is based on the wrong data and the wrong survey. For that reason, it should be revoked. The Government should start again from scratch, from square one. It should sit down with the Pharmacy Guild and again work on a submission to the Tribunal, if that is the Government's desire. It should start again and come up with a fair and reasonable package for community pharmacy around this country. It is a fundamental responsibility of the Government to do that because, with the implementation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, it cannot deliver that scheme by itself. The Government relies on community pharmacy to deliver the scheme and the benefits to the public for it. The bottom line responsibility in such a partnership is for the Government to remunerate pharmacists fairly and reasonably, and this determination is not a fair and reasonable package. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer is not to go down the track of an essential pharmacy allowance, no matter how important that may be at the end of the day; neither is it to go down the track of a professional fee, no matter how important that may be at the end of the day. The Government should not go down that track if all it is trying to do is to make up the package by another name, as it is currently doing. The Government can call it any other name it likes, while trying to make up the package in some other way to make it politically and economically more palatable. No matter how important these issues are, that is not the answer. The answer is to go back to square one. That is why we introduced the Bill in the Senate and why, it having been passed in the Senate, we now introduce it in the House. </PARA>
<PARA> We call on the Government to support the legislation and, as I have said, to list it for early debate. If the Government wants to express its goodwill in this area and establish its bona fides, it should go back to taws, go back to square one, and start again. The Government should invite the Guild to sit down with it and come up with a fair and reasonable package. I suggest such a package would include mark-up, an assessment of dispensing costs, and the concept of a professional fee. An overall remuneration package composed of those three items would be a long way down the road to a fair and reasonable package. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said that it cannot revoke the Tribunal's decision. The plain fact of this Bill is that it can. The passage of this simple legislation would ensure that the 28 August determination had no force or effect. We could pass it through this chamber very quickly. There would be no need for even the ministerial representative of the Government to utter one word. We could pass the legislation in the next five minutes if the Government had a mind to do so. It is a very simple matter indeed and the Government's arguments do not wash in terms of the parliamentary and legislative opportunities for us to revoke this determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also cited the fact that the Tribunal is independent, saying that it cannot interfere with it from that standpoint alone. I remind honourable members that the Government did not have that attitude when it came to parliamentary and judicial salaries. For political reasons, the Government decided that the determinations of the tribunal which determined those two remuneration packages were not satisfactory and that it would revoke them, set them aside, turn them over, and come up with its own remuneration package. I put it to the House that there is a far greater reason for the Government to do likewise in this instance. It is not about politics; it is about good government and sound policy-making. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, because of the high office you occupy you would certainly not need to hear any words from me about the principles in respect of an independent tribunal, but I put it to you that the overriding principle is the power of the Parliament-of the House of Representatives and the Senate together. For example, the highest judicial body in the land, the High Court of Australia, sometimes makes findings-brings down determinations, if you like-with which the Government and the Parliament disagree and it is within the province of Parliament to legislate. Parliaments have done that since Federation. Fundamental power resides with Parliament. Parliament is not a panel of experts; it is not a tribunal of judges or a collection of technocrats or bureaucrats. We are the assembly of the people's representatives and in a democracy ultimate power rests with the people as represented by the delegates in this place and in the other chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Any member in this chamber who is sensitive and attuned to what is going on in his or her electorate will know that the population is speaking out mightily on this issue. It is not just the 5,600 pharmacists who are doing that. Hundreds of thousands of people around the country are making their voices known by filling in coupons in the newspapers and coupons they get from their doctor's surgery or their pharmacy and by signing petitions. They are unhappy with the Tribunal's decision and with the consequences that will flow from it. They are concerned that it will precipitate a lower standard of health care in this country. They are concerned that it will bring about reduced access under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. They are concerned that the Tribunal itself made a determination based on wrong surveys and wrong facts, and they are definitely concerned that the Government's arguments in support of what it is doing in this area are totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides a very simple chance for the Government to act. As I have said, we could pass this Bill in the next five minutes. Let us be reasonable; we cannot expect the Government to come into the chamber and debate it now. The normal course is to have a second reading speech, such as we have now, and then for a week to go by before the legislation is again listed on the Notice Paper. The acid is on the Government to list the Bill on the Notice Paper at the next convenient sitting of the chamber so that we can debate it and pass it. I hope that the Bill will not be listed on the Notice Paper by the Government and that that is the last we hear of it. If that happens, the people will know the extent of the Government's bona fides on this issue. The people-pharmacists and the public alike-will have one more fundamental opportunity to pass judgment on the Government about its administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. If the Government does not enact this legislation quickly, the population will have only one more chance-to get rid of the Government at the next election. For my money, I hope that is sooner rather than later. With those words, we call upon the Government to support the legislation and to list it for debate in the chamber as quickly as convenient-and that means this session. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use the few minutes that are available to me in this committee stage debate to continue the Opposition's arguments about the unsustainability of Medicare. I use the word `continue' advisedly, because we are not going to stop. The reason we are not going to stop is that the unsustainability of Medicare and the problems it is giving rise to, specifically severe funding problems in the public hospital system around this country, will not go away. This most recent Budget has done nothing to deal with these problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without weighing myself or the chamber with a great deal of statistics, let us remind ourselves that when Medicare was introduced it was promised that it would provide access to all according to need, that it would be funded by all according to means, and that largely it would be self-funding. The Medicare levy introduced at the time was one per cent. That has now risen to 1.25 per cent and currently raises just short of $2.6 billion, or 22 per cent of health outlays. The point about the figure of $2.6 billion is that it is $1.6 billion short on medical outlays alone. Seventy-eight per cent of health expenditure, from the Commonwealth's perspective, comes not from the so-called Medicare levy but from general taxation. The 100 per cent figure is now $11.8 billion and it is second only to the Budget figure for the Department of Social Security. Chart 4 on page 3.17 of Budget Paper No. 1 shows an estimation from 1989-90 through to 1992-93 of the real growth of expenditure across portfolios. It is predicted that health will outstrip all other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though we have not had sufficient growth already. Back in 1982-83-coincidentally, that was the financial year before the introduction of Medicare in early 1984-the Commonwealth spent $3.4 billion, or 6.9 per cent of total outlays, on health. With the introduction of Medicare in 1983-84, that figure rose to $4.4 billion. We now find ourselves in 1989-90 with an expenditure of $11.8 billion, as I have said, which is 13.6 per cent of total outlays. This is a veritable cost explosion. </PARA>
<PARA> One would expect that for this vast increase in money over a relatively short period, we would have the world's best, you beaut health system; but, regrettably, it is not so. There are public hospital waiting lists around the country that now number not tens of thousands but at least 100,000. The public hospital system in particular is strapped for cash. The States at the same time are closing beds if not wards and, as a public health system, they are reacting in the only way they can where there is increased demand and diminished funding-they are rationing places and there is queueing. The point that I have made in this place many times before-and I will not resile from making it as long as I have breath to speak-is that the cruellest irony of Medicare is that the very people the public health insurance system is supposed to be looking after, the aged and the disadvantaged, are typically those who are being pushed further and further to the end of these public hospital waiting lists. They have no private insurance alternative; they have no private hospital alternative; they are left to languish in the queues. At the same time, we have an underutilisation of private hospitals. We have empty private hospital beds, and the private hospital sector generally is struggling to maintain viability, let alone profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in a funding crisis in respect of hospital care in this country. It is our clear contention that that directly relates to Medicare. It is a crisis that will not go away. It is a crisis that demands a solution, a solution that is not about an ideological binge from the Left, or from the Right for that matter. It is not about ripping up the system and starting again. It is about recognising the problems and trying logically and sensibly, in public policy terms, to work out how we can make the system better. That is the responsibility that the Government, certainly, and we collectively are charged with-making the system run better. </PARA>
<PARA> One solution might be to spend more money. What will the Government do? Will it introduce a 2 per cent levy? Certainly that is not the case in respect of this Budget. Will it be a 3 per cent levy, a 4 per cent levy, a 5 per cent levy? The levy necessary to fully fund the system would be about 5.6 per cent. That does not seem to be the solution. I have no expectation, for political reasons alone, that the Government will go that route in trying to solve the problem by spending more public moneys paid for by an increase in the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Might the solution be to increase taxation of a direct or an indirect kind? I do not think that is likely either. We are operating in a political environment where the Australian public are clamouring and demanding-and rightly so, in our view-for fewer taxes, not more. It does not seem that the Government has available to it the solution to spend more money by raising greater direct or indirect taxes. Perhaps the Government could solve the problem by taking resources from other portfolio areas. I do not think that is the solution either, because we could be talking about child-care, education or defence. The arguments in each and every portfolio area are strong and compelling for one type of expenditure or another. The Government will not have the opportunity to take huge sums of money from other portfolio areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the answer is to save money within the health portfolio, to take it off other areas and give it to the public hospital system. I do not think that is the answer either. To accept that it is not, we have to look only at what the Government is trying to do in a desperate bid to save money at the margin: trim the medical benefits schedule; trim pathologists' incomes; cut back on the pharmacists' remuneration package; and take money off the States. I do not think the Government can continue to go down that track in the hope of finding the millions of dollars necessary to solve this public hospital crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the answer is that the problem will go away all by itself, that we as a community will spend less on health. But anybody who has spent any time on this area will know that that will not happen either because of the demographic ageing of the population. The fact that we are all getting older and living longer, the fact that there are new surgical and therapeutic technologies available, the fact that we want to improve the quality and longevity of our own lives, and the fact that our own expectations are growing all the time, lead me to conclude that this problem will not go away. It will get worse and worse. If we look at all of the traditional public sector options-and I have been through all of them, I believe-we will realise that the solution does not lie there. It does not lie in increasing the levy. It does not lie in increasing taxation. It does not lie in taking money from other portfolios. It does not lie in shifting resources within the health portfolio. And it certainly will not go away because of changes in the demography and other changes I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution lies-and I will seek the opportunity to have another 10-minute burst later on-in encouraging more people to go back into private health insurance so as to bring about a sustainable balance between the public and the private sector. At the moment there is an imbalance and, frankly, it is unsustainable. Until the Government faces up to this realistically, the problem will not get better; it will get worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Appropriation Bill (No. 1), under consideration by the Committee. In doing so I will make a couple of comments about the contribution of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). He seemed to be disappointed that we will not increase the Medicare levy and that we will not increase taxes while we go about the process of this major restructuring of health services in Australia. He is correct in saying that we will not rob Peter to pay Paul. We will not pinch money from other sections of our social justice strategy to bring about these changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The solution we are putting in place, and the one the Liberals chose to ignore in their term of office and which the honourable member does not like to talk about now, is that for once we are making a few people pay their taxes. Because we are making them pay their taxes and we now have a Budget surplus of $9 billion, we are able to bring about some of these changes and announce the sorts of reforms included in this very comprehensive community services and health Budget allocation. If the honourable member for Tangney wants to persist with that argument he might as well trot out the Liberals' other argument about where the solution lies; that is, more cuts in government expenditure. One cannot wander into this sort of committee debate and propose that we do this and that and at the same time say that we should be cutting government expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel says, whereabouts? I will raise a matter that the Minister will be very familiar with following his role as Chairman of the Government's country task force. Everywhere one goes, but particularly in rural and provincial Australia, one meets groups of people-it does not matter whether they be policemen, teachers, or members of school boards or hospital boards-who say that there is no more fat in the system and that there is no more scope for cuts. Yet those opposite propose that more cuts may be one of the answers. We will not go down the road of increasing taxes and cutting out these services. Instead, we will continue to manage the whole process a lot better. We will make sure that some of these people who have not been used to paying taxes do pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Tangney also made reference to some areas in which there have been a few squeals. Ever since 1974 when Bill Hayden, then the Minister for Social Security, started the process of introducing Medibank, as it was then called, the self-interested sections of the medical profession have squealed like stuck pigs. Through every single phase of Medicare, they have done so, with the support of the Opposition. It does not matter whether they were doctors, specialists, consulting physicians, radiologists or pathologists-one by one they have had their noses in the trough. We have had to clean up the system. They have squealed and those opposite have come into this Parliament trying to protect them from reasonable scrutiny. Of course, we are getting the same thing now from the chemists. It will just not work. </PARA>
<PARA> I will point to some of the positive aspects of what has been taking place and refute some points made by the Opposition. This Budget, particularly the allocation to community services and health, is the real demonstration-(Quorum formed) This seems to be one of the tactics of the Opposition. When one points to very positive measures embraced in this Community Services and Health allocation, those opposite disrupt the Parliament and waste our time with this sort of tactic. The fact is that this allocation has special merit in two areas. Child-care is one. This is an indication of the Government's continuing commitment to child-care. Secondly, it has played a role in getting people into the work force and in developing our social justice strategy. We will have expanded the number of publicly funded child-care places from 46,000 in 1983 to 122,000 by 1990. That is a dramatic increase in availability of child-care and in commitment to it by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the lead-up to the Budget considerations there was a lot of discussion about the future of the housing industry and, in particular, the effects of high interest rates. I am very pleased to note the allocation of $15m in the Budget for relief funding for people caught in the squeeze. We, as a government, are guaranteeing that while we have to run this high interest rate strategy people will not suffer. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said, no-one wants interest rates one point higher than they have to be for even one day. But while the strategy is in place it is important that the Budget contain an allocation of mortgage interest and rent relief. It is a very positive measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as important is the very substantial allocation of funding for the expansion of public housing. While there may be a slight downturn in private home dwelling starts and in the private home sector, the Government has made sure that the housing industry remains viable at the same time as it has responded to the urgent need for a continuing allocation of funds for accommodation in the public sector. As a result of this Budget almost $1.3 billion has been allocated under the Commonwealth-State housing agreement for special purpose housing needs in the public sector. Part of that allocation is in response to the need for a new social justice package for young Australians. The Burdekin report on homeless children, with which we have all become familiar, indicated the need for an allocation of funding for housing for young homeless people and other matters associated with young people. There, too, that allocation has been specifically targeted. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take a few seconds to point to one particular aspect of the Budget of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I am very pleased to see two items: the special recognition of prisoners of war of the Japanese, in that we have an increased allocation for them; and the development of the support projects for veterans' independence. I know my colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) is delighted that his model will be run as a pilot project in Frankston. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 in so far as it relates to the estimates for the Department of Community Services and Health and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I will begin by referring to the health area. I am very concerned about the Ross River virus situation for this summer. In many places around Australia there is a red alert situation for mosquito-borne viruses. The Federal Government has cut back dramatically on funding for Ross River virus prevention and related research. Over two years ago the allocated amount was over $600,000. In this particular Federal Budget zero dollars have been allocated for Ross River virus prevention assistance to the States. After battling away through the Budget Papers and campaigning on this issue, the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), I and others have flushed out the fact that there will be an indirect allocation of some $77,000 for Ross River virus research, which in many ways is a drop in the ocean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a deadly serious virus. A similar and related virus is the Australian arbovirus encephalitis. I attended a summit in Mildura last week relating to the red alert situation for this summer over so much of Australia. Yet in this Federal Budget and in the estimates before this Committee we have a drop in the ocean in allocated funding for Ross River virus research and Australian arbovirus encephalitis research and prevention. The question of priorities should be looked at very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same Budget we have a $7m increase in AIDS research and related funding. I ask the question, quite legitimately: if Ross River virus were impacting on the trendy suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne would, miraculously, millions of dollars be found for Ross River virus research and prevention and Australian arbovirus encephalitis, which are diseases carried by mosquitoes? There is a red alert situation for this coming summer because of the extremely wet winter in many parts of inland and coastal Australia from Cairns to Condobolin, from Corowa to Collie near Perth. Indeed, earlier this year Condobolin had over 50 cases diagnosed of Ross River fever, indicating the very real concern for a virus which impacts very heavily on veterans and elderly citizens. The symptoms of Ross River fever include swelling of joints to soccer ball size in elderly people. It has to be taken seriously. I appeal to the Government to think again. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some other aspects relating to the estimates. I noted two events in South Australia which have some indirect relevance. I commend the commitment of the Army to Nurrungar. I reflect on the repatriation cover that some of those service personnel would have. I also commend the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy, in passing, for the role that they are fulfilling during the pilots strike, but those are matters which will be dealt with in more detail under other estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the area of veterans' affairs. During the last non-sitting period of the House of Representatives we had the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) make the now famous trip, as part of a public visit, to a local shopping centre in Whyalla at which television camera crews were invited to accompany the Prime Minister. He had his celebrated clash with a veteran service pensioner, none other than Bob Bell, whom the Prime Minister chose to call `a silly old bugger'. Those are unfortunate words and ones which I hesitate to use on the floor of this chamber. But even when I raised that matter by way of a question to the Prime Minister today he would not and could not justify why he sought to suppress film footage arising from that incident. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) saw fit to use that in two States, South Australia and Queensland, but not in any other State. The ABC even used it in Queensland in a current affairs program on the very day that the position of Premier of Queensland changed. So the ABC thought it was so important in Queensland as to insert in its programming that interview and incident with a digger, whinger Bob Bell, yet in other States it mysteriously was not utilised. I want to put it to the House, as the Prime Minister did not do so at Question Time, that the track record of this Government on veterans' affairs, as mirrored by the estimates before this Committee, is a series of complex changes and a series of no less than nine cutbacks on veterans, war widows and ex-service personnel since May 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that, in the estimates before the Committee, Veterans' Affairs funding will rise from $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, an increase of 6.2 per cent, showing some signs of plateauing out. Let me say that hidden in the camouflage of those overall amounts are nine quite severe cutbacks. Tracking through them quickly they are, firstly, the halving of travel allowance in May 1985; secondly, the halving of subsistence allowance at the same time; thirdly, the introduction of limitations on dental assistance-originally down to $300 for four categories of veterans but, to be fair to the Government and to be accurate, now being lifted slightly to a limitation of $375; fourthly, the totally and permanently incapacitated pension criteria tightening up which we have dealt with on other occasions; fifthly, provision for the termination of the dependants' allowance by commutation; sixthly, the complete elimination of war widows as well as certain other categories from the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme; seventhly, for war widows who receive an age pension, the freezing of their component from the Department of Social Security at $60.05; eighthly, the imposition of a $5,000 plus levy on certain categories of veterans in nursing homes even when in nursing homes for war related conditions; and, ninthly, a series of cutbacks in the list of drugs and related provisions of the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. To be fair, the Government has at long last restored one previous cutback, the 2 per cent cut in Defence Force retirement benefits, which will be dealt with by legislation tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The track record of the Government is full of cutbacks and complex changes on veterans and on war widows. It has even brought the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) to their feet, along with me and others, in defence of those who served their country in time of war. In terms of these estimates let me say two other things. Firstly, the Government has re-affirmed its desire to push on with transferring the repatriation general hospitals (RGH) system to the State government hospital system-that wonderful public hospital system that varies so much from State to State! I say to the House, as I said to the national Returned Services League of Australia conference two weeks ago, that the repatriation general hospital system in this country is the ace of spades. One does not lightly give away the ace of spades, particularly before the peak demand of World War II veterans has been carefully and capably handled. It is a delicate issue; it is a complex issue; it is one which must be dealt with responsibly. I, as shadow Minister for veterans' affairs in the coalition in terms of its policy approach, will be dealing very responsibly with the future of the repatriation general hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with my colleague the shadow Minister for health, we stand to retain the repatriation general hospitals system but, of course, to provide a flexible community patient formula associated with the repatriation general hospitals so that veterans can be properly cared for and so that there can be a maximisation of cooperation and liaison between the public hospitals system and the repatriation general hospitals system. I repeat that the RGH system is the ace of spades. Mr Deputy Chairman, you have an RGH in Perth. There are repatriation general hospitals in every capital city and they fulfil a vital role and should not be lightly dispensed with. Yet the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) has said that he wants those hospitals disposed of by 1993 or earlier. The coalition has a very clear-cut alternative policy approach in relation to that vital issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the brochure produced by the Department of Veterans' Affairs entitled `Budget Review 1989'. There is some excellent information in that brochure. I have already referred to one or two of the changes. I support fully the pilgrimage to Gallipoli which will take place next year on the seventy-fifth anniversary of Anzac Day. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) have indicated their total support for that pilgrimage. I just highlight that one of the key changes in the Budget, the elimination of the Medicare levy anomaly, has not been picked up or referred to in this document whatsoever; yet it has a big impact on veterans who have been caught under that anomaly where their spouse is working, or in other quite complex but special situations. There is no reference to that in this document. Otherwise, it is certainly a very helpful document. In terms of the Budget estimates for Veterans' Affairs, I assure the Committee that the coalition will be all about a fair go for veterans after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Community Services and Health, I intend to address myself to two issues. One relates to the appropriation for the breast and cervical cancer screening evaluation, and the other relates to the care of the aged. I deal with the second matter first. The home and community care (HACC) scheme has had a substantial impact on the community in the last couple of years. On a number of occasions in this chamber I have expressed my concern that there appears to be pressure on to keep people away from the formal care of the aged, such as in nursing homes, to a point which is not reasonable. I have previously expressed the concern that the old bogey that existed once upon a time about nursing homes, which has been got rid of with the great advances that have been made in the care of the aged in nursing homes over the past two decades, may well rear its head again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to reiterate all that; I just want to address one point which has been raised with me by doctors in my electorate. Of course, a high proportion of my electorate is aged people, not only in the Gold Coast section but also in the rural areas. The concern has been raised by doctors in those areas particularly, although I believe that it would apply in more closely settled areas. The concern is simply that, whilst there is much merit in the home and community care scheme, it operates only on certain days of the week and between certain hours; it does not operate to assist the aged at weekends and on public holidays. The Government really needs to address the fact that the aged have needs seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and that these needs do not simply neatly fit into Public Service office hours and working days. </PARA>
<PARA> I have communicated with the Minister on this subject but I received an utterly unsatisfactory, fob-off reply; not even an indication that the Minister or his Department, much less the Government, had any intention of addressing the issue. I urge the Minister to face his responsibilities. It is all very well to be commissioning inquiries that look at the rights of users of nursing homes and find ways in which people can act and safeguard their rights, but the reality of day-to-day life for a lot of aged people in the community now is difficult-even those who come under the HACC program. The simple issue that I have raised should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise relates to the allocation of money for breast cancer screening. The Women's Budget Statement 1989-90, which was circulated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Budget Related Paper No. 6, contains the statement that one of the key elements of the national women's health program is:</PARA>
<PARA>continuation of the present breast and cervical cancer screening evaluation (which presently expires at the end of 1989-90) with a concurrent public awareness campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>I think most people would be aware of the public awareness campaign so far as cervical cancer is concerned; there has been substantial advertising on television of the need for Pap smears. I welcome that program. But once again I express my deepest concern about the way the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) is dragging his heels on the subject of breast cancer screening. </PARA>
<PARA> To recap the issue briefly, a woman can receive a mammography if she is referred by a doctor to undergo it and she can receive a Medicare rebate. However, there is no Medicare rebate if the mammography is not as a consequence of a doctor's referral. There is a strong feeling in the community that breast cancer screening should be treated in the same way that, say, tuberculosis (TB) screening was treated in the community some years ago. Australia managed to eradicate tuberculosis because the government of the day, the Menzies Government, sent out into the community X-ray machines and people underwent chest X-rays on a reasonably regular basis-not every year; maybe every three to five years-and tuberculosis was eradicated in this country as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government just shillyshallies on this issue. There is plenty of evidence from other countries, where breast cancer screening is made routinely available at no cost, that the incidence of deaths of women from breast cancer is dramatically reduced-by 70 to 80 per cent. Breast cancer is the single greatest killer of women. It is responsible for the deaths of at least 2,500 women in Australia every year. The message that one receives from the Minister is that it is reasonable not to have a Medicare rebate for the expense without a doctor's referral because this is something that could be overused. Of course, that was not a consideration in the TB screening that we had in this country. The simple fact is that by the time the possibility of breast cancer is detected by a doctor or by the woman herself-that is, by the awareness of the presence of a lump in the breast-the malignancy, if the lump is malignant, has existed for between five and 10 years. It is therefore not surprising that women who have breast cancer diagnosed commonly have other forms of cancer following. </PARA>
<PARA> The external detection of breast cancer is a highly unsatisfactory approach to detection of this form of cancer. Furthermore, when the cancer is advanced to that stage it almost inevitably leads to a radical mastectomy which, of course, is considered by many women to be an operation of mutilation. It is fear of that physical mutilation which deters many women from conducting self-examinations. If they conduct them and detect something that they think might be a lump it deters them from going to see a doctor about it. The availability of routine screening of mammography would make a very big difference to this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government has three mobile vans to conduct such tests. There is one in the Rockhampton area, this week one was to have started in the Gold Coast area, and another one is scheduled to come on stream. It is very important that this procedure be available to women in an easy way. It does not mean that every women will have a mammography. Certain groups are clearly more at risk. For example, it has been established that a woman who comes from a family which has a history of breast cancer and women over the age of 45 are the ones most highly at risk. These women are not necessarily aware of that. There are sometimes major obstacles in their way when they try to gain access to the screening that is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government may well think that this is a cost effective way of approaching health. I would like to suggest that it is not. If it conducted a true publicity campaign on the subject of breast cancer, which it is not doing, in contrast to the campaign on cervical cancer and the need for Pap smears, there would be a major leap in the Medicare rebate because of the number of women going to general practitioners (GPs). It is a fact that when women of all ages are encouraged regularly and routinely to have Pap smears our medical treatment costs must increase, including the Medicare rebate for GP visits and the cost of the pathology that is involved. The easy availability of the much simpler process of a mammography should be an encouragement to the Government as a way of reducing the medical costs that are otherwise inevitable, namely, the cost of the rebate for the GP who first must be visited in order to get a referral. I have heard it said that a mammography costs only about $30. The Government knows only too well that there are many women who do not have $30 in spare change in their pockets to pay for a mammography without a referral from a doctor in order to earn the Medicare rebate. As one voice amongst many, I once again urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude to this subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I want to speak about an area of Government health funding that is not usually identified in Appropriation Bills or Budget material but which is receiving a lot of prominence. I refer to the funding by the Government of abortion on demand. Mr Deputy Chairman, you might recall that statistics made available recently by the Department of Community Services and Health revealed that abortions funded by Medicare increased by just under 3,000 in 1988-89 to a total of 64,788. As a result the total Medicare subsidy of abortion under items 6469, 274 and 275 grew by 7 per cent in 1988-89 to just under $6.9m. This figure is included in the current statistics relating to appropriations for the Department of Community Services and Health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With abortions performed within the Commonwealth and State health systems but not funded directly by Medicare, it is now estimated that the total number of abortions performed annually in Australia stands at approximately 85,000, or one for every three live births, with an annual cost to the total health budget of nearly $9m per annum. A breakdown of these abortion statistics indicates, firstly, that the total number of Medicare-subsidised abortions grew from 61,922 in 1987-88 to 64,788 in 1988-89. Secondly, the Medicare bill for abortions grew from just under $6.4m in 1987-88 to just under $6.9m in 1988-89. Thirdly, there was a small drop in the number of late term abortions-identified as item 274 and item 275 abortions-from 674 in 1987-88 to 662 in 1988-89. Fourthly, New South Wales accounted for over 48 per cent of Medicare abortions funded in 1988-89. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the tabulated figures for abortion rebates for the year 1988-89. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The release of the 1988-89 abortion statistics coincided with the release of new fee levels for Medicare item 6469, evacuation of contents of gravid uterus by curettage or suction curettage, $138, and items 274 and 275, management of second trimester labour with or without induction, GP and specialist, $150 and $186 respectively. The statistics release also follows petition figures showing that in the last month nearly 55,000 signatures have been tabled in Parliament on the abortion issue by 125 members of parliament and senators, with nearly 49,000 of those signatures being from pro-life petitioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be increasingly obvious to the Parliament that there is a strong interest in the community in having this matter debated and voted on. It is about time, with the number and cost of abortions continuing their steady climb, that the Parliament found time to consider the question of whether one individual should be forced to fund another individual's abortion decision via the tax system, which is the debate we are engaged in at the moment. It seems to me that the ease with which abortions are procured in Australia, and the apparent lack of concern in the Parliament about the increase in the destruction of life suggest that this country's moral deficit is growing at the same rate as its economic deficit. The release of these abortion statistics, along with petition figures, now places even greater pressure on the House of Representatives to allocate time to debate without delay the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare payments for abortion now require a significant Budget allocation, an allocation about which there is seldom a mention in Budget material or debate. I intend to ensure that henceforth allocations of health funds to abortion receive adequate scrutiny in the Budget debate. It is my intention, of course, to ensure the passage of the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill, which would allow funding only for abortions performed to save a mother's life or for abortions which occurred unintentionally as a result of some other procedure. Given the disclosure of the significant revenue costs of Medicare payments for abortion and the significant public interest in having the matter debated, I hope and expect that the Bill will be debated in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other very important aspects of this area of appropriations. I believe that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) is putting in a lot of effort and deserves to be commended. For example, the Government's expenditure with regard to the major difficulties in the community concerning acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is commendable. We are perhaps leading the world in our screening processes. Some of the newer areas of screening we are going to adopt are very good. Of course, more can be done. An enormous amount of money is being spent in this regard. I believe that the Minister and I would differ greatly in our philosophical approach to the main perpetrators of the spread of AIDS. Nevertheless, I put on record that there are quite a few areas in his portfolio where I believe he needs to be encouraged. He needs to be encouraged in the area of AIDS. The shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), is working on a strong bipartisan policy in this area which is so important for the future well-being of our nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the responsibility under the Veterans' Affairs portfolio for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which was established in Great Britain by royal charter in 1917. I refer particularly to the membership of the Commission. There are 17 members of the Commission, of which only six represent the member governments of Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, South Africa, India and Australia. Australia is very well represented by its High Commissioner in London, the Hon. Douglas McClelland, to whom I spoke only a few weeks ago about this and other matters. I believe that it is time for general Australian representation on the Commission. In 1987 Sir Miles Wingate was appointed to the Commission to represent the merchant seamen. There is also a distinguished Canadian on the Commission. But there is no Australian general member of the Commission. The matter needs to be addressed by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, based in the United Kingdom, should be a genuine Commonwealth organisation. It should be as genuine in its representation of the membership as the Commonwealth Secretariat that serves the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. In other words, it should not be entirely the preserve of the United Kingdom Government and nationals of the United Kingdom. All other members ought to have an opportunity across the board to participate in it. The United Kingdom Government has failed to open up the Commission. The United Kingdom Government has failed in its responsibility to allow the Commission to become a genuinely representative Commonwealth organisation. It should be an organisation that is generally, in the broadest sense, representative of its constituent member countries. It is not. </PARA>
<PARA> I have great regard and respect for the work that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission does in maintaining Commonwealth war graves. It really does a first class job. But that is not the point I am discussing. Recently, a new director of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission was appointed. I asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) on notice whether he was consulted before the appointment of the new director of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. He has replied that he was consulted formally through the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. But I read into the answer that he was only contacted formally-in other words, there was no consultation by the United Kingdom Government or by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission with the Australian Government. An Australian, Canadian or other national was not even considered for the position of director. I do not think that is good enough. There has been a failure of government policy here-and successive governments are equally guilty-to see that Australia is represented not only at the Commission but in the organisation itself. It is outrageous when the opportunity arose to appoint a new director, which is not something that happens very often in the lifetime of an organisation, that an Australian was not considered for the job. </PARA>
<PARA> The War Graves Commission is in danger of becoming a self-perpetuating oligarchy which is responsible to no-one. I do not know to whom it is answerable. If one looks at the explanatory notes that accompany the Budget papers for the Department of Veterans' Affairs, one cannot even find out how much revenue from Australia goes as a contribution to the upkeep and administration of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. I believe it is in the order of $2m a year, but I would ask the Minister to tell the House the actual amount. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see a greater input by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs into the management of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It is not clear when one reads the explanatory notes for the Department of Veterans' Affairs portfolio. It needs to be cleared up. A direct relationship between the Minister and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission needs to be set up. An independent inquiry into the management and management practices of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is needed to see that the Commission is truly representative and is using modern management practices and techniques. There is a need for it to be representative, as I have said, because it is a body or quango that is becoming answerable to no-one. This needs to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see more Australians employed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. I asked the Minister a question on notice about that matter, and I thank him for his answer. He has said that there are no Australian citizens currently employed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission based in London and with significant branch facilities at Arras in France. It is very comfortable for the United Kingdom Government and the employees of the organisation to keep employing people from the United Kingdom, but I do not think it is good enough. Not only should Australians be employed at the Commission but also there should be an exchange program with the Australian Government so that Australians at all levels and in all areas of interest can be employed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Let us open up this body. This body, headed by the Duke of Kent, needs to be opened up to the Commonwealth and to be truly representative. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to refer to is the contribution that Australians have made over the years, particularly during the Anzac campaign at Gallipoli. Next year is the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, and there is a proposed visit to Gallipoli by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). If there is an early election, it will be Prime Minister Peacock. If there is not an early election, it will be Prime Minister Hawke. I understand that the Prime Minister plans to fly to Gallipoli on a Boeing 707 aircraft, accompanied by a number of veterans and others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dundas helps me with a very constructive interjection. Two Boeing 707s are planned to be taken. Doubtless the media will be there. It could even be in the middle of an election campaign. If it is, I hope that the visit will not be used for election purposes. The history and tradition of Gallipoli and the Anzac campaign have been bipartisan. It goes beyond political parties, deep into the Australian psyche. It is important that the delegation be bipartisan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a need for memorials at Gallipoli-as I think there is in other war grave areas. I think the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), has proposed that a joint task force be set up under the Australian War Memorial's auspices, involving the Australian War Graves Office and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, to facilitate the portrayal of our involvement in various theatres of war and to assist younger generations in particular in understanding what took place. </PARA>
<PARA> I have found that younger Australians are flocking to Gallipoli. I was at Gallipoli at about this time last year. It is a very moving place and it was a very moving moment in my life as I walked along the beach at dusk with no-one in sight and only one fishing boat at sea. The hush of the dusk made an impression on me. I said to myself, `We need to have young Australians involved'. Young Australians are flocking to Gallipoli and I think there is a need to provide the opportunity for young Australians to participate overseas not only at Gallipoli but also on the Somme and other battlefields throughout Europe and in Asia. There need to be signposts. There need to be integrated exchange programs in which young Australians have the opportunity to participate and following which, during the European summer, they can help interpret the battlegrounds and war memorials for other Australians. In other words, a program needs to be set up, employing Australians-particularly young Australians-and in conjunction with host governments, to help inform Australian visitors about war memorials, graves and battlefields. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was speaking earlier in the Committee's consideration of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 in relation to the Department of Community Services and Health, I spoke about the crisis in public hospitals in this country and the search for the traditional public sector solution to such a crisis-that is, pouring in more public sector moneys to solve the problem. I concluded that politically and financially this solution does not appear to be within the reach of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now want to turn to what the solution is. I refer to the fact that it is no coincidence that the sorry state of affairs in which Australia's public hospital system now finds itself has been paralleled by the drop in the numbers of people who are privately insured in Australia. For example, in December 1983 61.5 per cent of the population was privately insured. We have now reached the point where the last figures that I have available-March 1989-show that 45.8 per cent of the population is privately insured. The percentage is dropping. Hundreds of thousands of people have dropped out of private health insurance in that period or have never taken out private health insurance at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Each and every one of those people is an actual or potential claimant on the public hospital system. In Australia at the moment we have an unsustainable imbalance between the public and private sectors, as I have said, and the current Budget does nothing to redress that imbalance. The situation is getting worse. It cannot do anything but get worse. The reason it will get worse relates to the fact that private health insurance premiums will continue to rise. Notwithstanding the recent reinsurance changes, private premiums will continue to rise because the funds are left commonly with the older and higher claimants in the community who, in the face of public hospital queues, are unwilling to rely on Medicare. It is an interesting statistic that some 600,000 pensioners, if one believes all the political rhetoric, would be content to rely totally on the public system, but are in fact not content to rely totally on the public sector. Many of them have no source of income other than their pension. They are scrimping and saving in order to ensure that they remain privately insured. </PARA>
<PARA> As claims go up only two things can occur as the health funds struggle to maintain their solvency-reinsurance arrangements and other fiddles at the margins aside. As claims go up, with a shrinking contributor base, what can the funds do? They can either put their premiums up or put their benefits down. They are doing both of those things and will be forced to do so in the months and years ahead. That leads inevitably to more and more people dropping out of private insurance or never taking it up. Those who are insured already pay personal income tax, the Medicare levy, and their private health insurance premium-and increasingly they seem to be paying a bigger and bigger gap. As premiums go up and benefits go down and the gap gets bigger and bigger, many people make a rational economic decision that it is no longer worth being privately insured. Many others, pressed with all the other claims on the family budget, are being forced to drop their private insurance. Let us take young people, for example, who have never been privately insured and who believe, by dint of their chronological age and outlook on life, that they are virtually indestructible. They may say, `Why should we take out private health insurance? If something goes wrong with me-if I have a catastrophic fall off my motorbike or if I am in a car accident-I will be in the major public hospital system anyway'. So the whole privately insured market is in not only a downward spiral but a tailspin. It is going to get worse. We must find a solution to this before the crisis in public hospitals turns into an absolute rout. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already argued that the traditional public solution-that is, just to find more moneys from some source within the public sector and to fund the increased public hospital demand-is not available. There is no doubt that that is conceptually possible, though I would have some philosophical argument about whether it is desirable. But it will not happen politically or financially and it is a sterile solution for anybody entering into the debate to say that we will solve the problem by simply spending more public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA> At the other end of the spectrum we could scrap the entire system. We could start again. We could go, I presume, down a totally private route-perhaps akin to the United States of America model. Nobody on this side of Parliament argues for this. Perhaps the Private Doctors Association does. Perhaps they are all out there in right field by themselves. But that is not real life, and it is not desirable. We do not want in this country a high-cost risk-related system where large sections of the population are uninsured. In this very important area of public policy the Opposition has only been arguing for a better mix between the public and the private sectors. The solution to the problem is staring us in the face: to achieve that better mix. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution is soundly based philosophically because no government should stand in the way of an individual spending on or investing in his own health care or the health care of his family. It is soundly based in terms of social equity because at the end of the day we will always have a finite amount of money, no matter how big it is, to be spent on health. Every dollar we spend on someone who does not need it and who perhaps has a private insurance option is a dollar less we can spend on somebody who does need it and has no private insurance option. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution is soundly based financially because we are not talking about a thimble and pea trick. We are not talking about increasing the numbers of privately insured people so that we can somehow cut back on the public moneys going to the health system; we are talking about increasing the whole quantum. We will always be charged with the responsibility of spending as much as we can, wisely and prudently in public terms, on health. We will be able to increase the quantum only if we can encourage more and more people to invest privately through private health insurance. The system is soundly based in terms of competition and efficiency not only between public and private hospitals but also between health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution is also soundly based in historical terms. We are not talking about an American experience or an international flirtation that is untried in Australia, but about going back to what we used to do in this country-with improvements. We are talking about going back to a better balance between the public and private sectors, but with improvements to ensure that no-one is uninsured and that no-one is underinsured. They are two improvements that we can learn from Medicare. This is not about an ideological binge by the Left or the Right; it is the very crucial issue of health care for the nation and what we can sustainably afford. We are not going to be able to afford the current system, let alone a better one, unless we get a better balance of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Budget, the Government should have encouraged those people who could afford it to go back into private health insurance with the assistance of a taxation rebate. That would cost some money from a public point of view, but the total quantum of money that would be encouraged back into the system would far outweigh any cost. It would increase the quantum of money put into the entire system by both public and private sources, it would achieve a better and sustainable balance between public and private sector funding and it would eliminate public hospital waiting lists. There would be a better utilisation of all the empty private hospital beds around the country, there would be competition between health funds in the country again, and there would be a better choice for consumers. Unless we achieve this proper public and private sector balance our contention remains the same-the current system is unsustainable and will collapse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to focus on some comments that were made on the home and community care (HACC) program. The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) is concerned about the home and community care program and the people in her electorate. This program is a very important element in underpinning the aged care support systems in the community and the aged care reforms of the Government, particularly its reforms in residential care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the precursor to the home and community care program-the various random programs under the previous Government-very little attention was paid to people with disabilities. The range and spread of those services were, to put a blunt point on it, insufficient for the needs of the community. That was why many people, inappropriately, had to live in nursing homes and in the few existing hostels. When this Government came to office it set about implementing aged care reform in a regular way to ensure that the real needs of people were addressed rather than simply and solely the needs of government at any particular level. Aged care reform programs have been directed at making the programs and projects suit the needs of the individual rather than the individual having to meet the demands of government. That is pretty well indicated in the level of expenditure that the Commonwealth has put into this area, in particular, into the home and community care program. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is now spending about 360 per cent more than what was spent in the last years of equivalent programs and projects under the former Government. Since 1985, when the home and community care program was put together with the States in a cooperative arrangement, there has been a vast increase in Commonwealth expenditure-from $78.5m to $245m this year. Total HACC expenditure by the Commonwealth, the States and Territories has increased from $154m to $411m-an increase of 167 per cent. Included in that is the tremendous range of services provided by carers of the frail aged and the young disabled who want to stay in the community as long as possible rather than be in any form of residential care. </PARA>
<PARA> While the honourable member for Moncrieff expressed concern about people being kept out of nursing homes too long, to paraphrase her, it is important to recognise that many people get tremendous sustenance and support from being as active as possible in their community with family or friends or by themselves. We are trying to help people to maintain their independence for as long as possible, whether they be young people with disabilities or the frail aged. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the chamber's attention to a primary focus of the home and community care program at this stage of its development; the attention being paid to the needs of carers. Thousands of people in the community look after their relatives or friends in a way that no other person could, and the demands on those people are vast. The cost to them in financial terms, their physical effort and the emotional drain on them are incredible. This is particularly the case for people who care for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related disorders. The Government is very concerned to address the needs of carers. They are a group who have stood back-I suppose that is the best way of describing it-while services were developed for the frail aged and the young disabled at risk, almost befitting the manner in which they address their task. I can certainly speak from the point of view of the Commonwealth Government: it wants to address this area and give these people the support they certainly deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of institutionalisation is important and one where the Commonwealth has had many problems with the States. It impacts on areas such as housing, for example. The Government certainly needs to address the issue. In the forthcoming Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement we will see it addressed far more fully than it has been in the past, as well as other issues related to homeless young people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the home and community care program we are seeing a process of development that cannot simply be explained by the rapid increase in funding from the Commonwealth. I make mention here of the $20m that we spent this year in unmatched moneys to develop innovative approaches to the delivery of services to provide for the needs of the individual in a cost-effective manner and in ways that have not been tried before. In many respects that symbolises the Government's attitude to aged care reform in Australia, not only to get the best value for the dollar but also to get the best value for the individual concerned. In areas where the unmatched money projects have been working for some time, there are benefits and ideas emerging in a way that certainly was never the case in the general program, stimulating better utilisation of the resources that we have available and providing far better support for many people. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of hostel funding deserves some comment. I do not think it was raised by honourable members in the committee stage of the Bill. It is a focal point of the Government's aged care program because it brings a form of accommodation and support into the community that was not there before, and gives a great degree of independence to the individual. It makes that link, which is so important in developing a continuum of care and independence, for the individual who is trying to stay at home as long as possible with the support of the home-community care program, and who is not yet at a stage where he wants or needs to be in the more intensive care of a nursing home. It is important to stress that, by this time next year, this Government will have doubled the number of hostel places in Australia. That has brought tremendous flexibility and security to thousands of elderly people. There were about 22,000 hostel places in Australia when we came to government and, by this time next year, 44,000 places will have been approved. In addition, there is the security of the funding arrangements that go with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Issues such as housing are very much related to the needs of older people, for flexibility in accommodation is not the need of most people in the community. With the support that comes through the home and community care program, hostel accommodation and, very importantly and never to be forgotten, the nursing home area-with increases not only in the number of beds but also in the standards and qualities of buildings and other issues-we see a very rapid increase in the quality and quantity of aged care in Australia. That is certainly welcomed by many people in the community and, I believe, respected for the value it brings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members for their contributions to this debate, especially those who referred to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I would like to point out to the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) that he is misrepresenting the facts on integration. He says that 1993 or before is the Government's policy on integration. I point out that it is 1995. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I have given the assurance that there will be no integration if the Returned Services League and the trade union movement have any concerns with integration. They are well aware of that assurance and special committees have been set up in relation to integration of the repatriation hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) referred in part to the appropriations of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. There is $3.45m in total for the care and maintenance of the graves. In 1989-90 Australia's contribution to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will be $2.281m. Last year the amount was $2.181m. The honourable member for Higgins also referred to Australians being employed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. On my recent trip overseas I spoke to people from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission-Sir Arthur Hockaday and other officers. Officers from the Commission were in Australia and, I understand, interviewed Australians who had applied to work with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and they will probably be making announcements in relation to that later on. I cannot say exactly when. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) for pointing out the bipartisanship approach in the visit to Gallipoli next year-the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Gallipoli landing-by World War 1 veterans, war widows and students. I also point out briefly the initiative taken by the RSL and the New South Wales patron of the First World War Veterans Association, Mr Hall, who visited Parliament House during Question Time. He met and made representations to the Prime Minister. They asked the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) whether he would allow them to go on a trip to Gallipoli and he would supply a jet. He agreed to do that. He thought it was a good idea. The Prime Minister approved it, and now I have the responsibility of making sure it all goes well. I think every member and senator is fully behind that trip next year. Once again I thank honourable members for their contributions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking in the place of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) who, unfortunately and unexpectedly, is not able to lead this debate. He is the shadow Minister for trade and would ordinarily be doing so. I want to make much the same points that he would have. The first and overriding point is that we are in a time of crisis with our foreign trade. It is an indictment of this Government's disastrous economic stewardship of the past seven years. Australia now has a foreign debt that has increased by over 500 per cent since this Government took over from the previous coalition government. The debt stands at $135 billion; it has even doubled since 1985. That has devastating implications for the standard of living of all Australians for many years to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A graphic illustration of this impact is that 63c in every export dollar is required to service that debt. Last financial year we had our worst ever balance of payments deficit of $17.4 billion. The Budget projection of $18.5 billion for this year is already hopelessly wrong. Last month, our worst ever by far, the trade deficit was $2.6 billion. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) gives the impression that from now on any deficit less than $2 billion a month will be seen as being a good figure. That means a balance of payments deficit for this financial year of over $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Projections on imports are hopelessly wrong. Projections on some key exports are also wrong. As early as May this year the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and I were telling this Government that it was too optimistic in its projections for wool exports this year. Wool was our major net export earner, and it could earn $1.5 billion less this financial year than last financial year. Because of the combination of its having been too wet in much of the wheat belt, and now a lack of rain in the same and other parts, wheat exports will earn $700m less. It is anybody's guess what live sheep exports will earn, and the figure could be anywhere between $50m and $200m less this year. The rural commodity boom-if it was ever really on-is now over for some key agricultural export commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism is our largest export industry. It earned $6.5 billion gross, with a net contribution of $430m, last financial year. Because of this Government's disastrous policy during the pilots dispute-and it is the Government alone which is to blame-it is anybody's guess what tourism will earn this year. I would say there will be a $2 billion turnaround because Australia's image overseas is now so negative. We also have to remember that Australia is not only losing export dollars in the sense of tourists not coming into Australia, but also, because of the impossibility of Australians being able to fly interstate, many Australians are now taking overseas holidays rather than holidaying within Australia and adding to our imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately for this nation, the remark- able flexibility and dynamism of those two great export industries, agriculture and minerals and energy, which comprise about 70 per cent of our exports, have once again led to their providing some positive figures for this country. In agriculture, sugar, cotton and beef are significant industries in which exports will be up this year. It is projected that mineral exports will be up by 15 per cent and that coal will again be our top export earner. The North West Shelf project will begin and the gold industry will continue exporting strongly. If one added simply transformed or processed products from these two industries to their 70 per cent of raw exports, their total contribution to exports would be far higher. Overall, however, we have a rapidly and disastrously deteriorating situation. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing? I refer first to what the Government is doing in the world forum. I commend, in particular, what the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) is doing with the Cairns Group under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. There is genuine bipartisan support for attempts on Australia's behalf on the world stage to get better trade relations. However, some very negative policies and positions are still coming out. For example, the European Economic Community is going ahead with some of its commodity regimes which add to the difficulties of genuine world trade. In the United States, another farm Bill is coming up in which the export enhancement program will still be a key factor. </PARA>
<PARA> In other areas also of our foreign affairs relations and our trade relations we are not being firm enough as a nation. There is a growing number of bilateral trade relations between countries. I refer, in particular, to that between the United States and Canada which began only in January this year and under which we will lose market share. We have not been firm enough in our relations with Saudi Arabia in respect of live sheep or in our relations with Taiwan in relation to beef. Those are the two most recent examples. Those countries are allowing their domestic politics to override trade opportunities with this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that, the Government is not addressing the major issues in relation to our being once again a world trader. We are not competitive. Our inflation rate is significantly higher than that of our major trading partners, and it has been for seven years. Interest rates are at a record high of more than 20 per cent. Nobody in any sort of business activity as an exporter or an import competitor can get a 20 per cent plus return on any new investment to increase his exports or his import replacements. With those record high interest rates goes a continuing high dollar level which, in itself, is a very negative factor in increasing exports or replacing imports. We still have labour market restrictions. We still have a situation with respect to the waterfront, coastal shipping and trans-Tasman shipping which is estimated to cost us $850m a year, and we still have other transport deficiencies, particularly with the State railways. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not addressing any of the major factors necessary for us to overcome the trade problem. There are no incentives for exporters or those who are into import replacement. I have already mentioned interest rates and the dollar value. Year after year the Government has removed incentives for agriculture and, particularly since 1986-87, it has used the excuse that there is a commodity boom in primary industry so the farmers do not need the incentives that had been provided by a coalition Government. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has just provided some interesting revised figures on farm profitability for the last five years. It indicates that it underestimated by over $5 billion farm costs in that period and overestimated farm income by $4 billion in the same period. So much for the great incomes and profitability that were supposedly going to the rural sector and providing it with the natural ability to continue to be competitive internationally. In this year it is forecast that there will be a 19 per cent real reduction in the net value of farm production. </PARA>
<PARA> Miners have been subjected to increased tax. One thinks of gold, in particular, with respect to mining taxes under this Government. There have been restrictions on mining; one thinks in this respect of the three-mine policy on uranium. There has been prevarication. We have the Coronation Hill issue before us at present. No incentives have been given to the producers of oil and gas and with the reduction in oil production we must be looking at $3 billion in additional imports by the mid-1990s. In the tourism industry there has not been adequate public expenditure on airport terminals, runways and the like. In this respect one thinks, in particular, of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport at Mascot, and of instances where private expenditure should have been allowed. I refer, for example, to the desirability of privatising Australian Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd so that they could maximise tourist opportunities. In addition, we have no flexible labour arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, there is confusion and uncertainty. The Government has double standards, as can be seen, for example, in a comparison of the Government's treatment of Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and its exports versus live sheep exports. The Government will not take on its own constituency and require those people to be efficient by world standards. If the Government would only provide some positive incentives and economic policy for the exporters and import replacers of this nation, I am sure they would respond dramatically. Even in this very difficult and negative situation, they have continued to progress and to compete well on behalf of this nation. </PARA>

It appears that the coalition once again has a policy of subsidies to prop up the inefficiencies within sectors of its constituency, as it did for 30 years. Notwithstanding that, I will get back to what I wanted to talk about in regard to the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. I will discuss, in particular, the South Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, the Prime Minister of Fiji, Ratu Mara, has not really got over the fact that he was defeated at the last election. He has remarked that he has not one single friend in Australia, which is a pity as I am quite sure that he has. I am not taking any political side there. The Prime Minister of Fiji said that Fiji is alone. I do not believe that. Fiji has many friends. I, for one, and many members of the Parliament wish Fiji well in the next few months as it tries to sort out political differences and to work towards a new constitution and new elections leading to a democracy in that country. It is a pity that Ratu Mara says such inflammatory things at a time when it is unnecessary to say them and when they do not help the situation not only in the South Pacific, but also in Fiji. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I continue my remarks, might I say that it is nice to see the image of the Clerks of the House take an upward-looking profile, with the first woman Clerk Assistant in the chamber tonight, Robyn Webber. We welcome her and hope to see her more often in the future. I congratulate her on being the first woman Clerk Assistant in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In continuing my remarks I shall again refer to the foreign affairs portfolio and the South Pacific and in particular consider the Australian aid program. The Australian aid program has been maintained in real terms, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has indicated in his press statements, at around 3.6 per cent even though the actual figure is 3.3 per cent; there is a juggling of the figures which I will not go into now. Excluding Papua New Guinea, which receives around $300m from Australia, $85.3m will be given to the South Pacific countries of Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Western Samoa, Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Cook Islands, Micronesia, Niue, New Caledonia and a variety of regional organisations. That figure is, in fact, a couple of million dollars below the figure for last year, but last year's figure was inflated by an extra $5m that went to Fiji. It was an addition to the normal aid program to assist that country back to democracy after the coups that took place. There was also a one-off grant of $6m to Vanuatu. More correctly, it went to Air Vanuatu to assist in the purchase of an aircraft to boost tourism in that country. When we take those two one-off figures away we see that last year's figure drops to around $78m, which was still an 11 per cent increase on the previous year's figure of $70m. So we are maintaining in real terms the money going to the aid program for the South Pacific, which is good to see. The countries of the South Pacific, particularly the Melanesian countries, look to Australia for assistance in a number of areas other than development. They seek aid for military and strategic areas and general assistance for other things such as disasters. For instance, not long ago a cyclone hit the Solomon Islands. That is only one of a number of instances that have occurred over the last decade in the South Pacific where Australia has been ready to come to the aid of particular countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Pacific is a unique area. It is our region. We are part of it. Our emphasis and our policies are moving away from Europe. Although Europe is still a very important area-I do not have time to go into the post-1992 trade and economic issues connected with that situation-obviously from a regional viewpoint and a direct contact viewpoint, the South Pacific is our own backyard. We are geographically part of it. It is something we cannot deny. And so we should be part of it. The countries of the South Pacific are our brothers in the region and I am glad to see that Australia has taken a first-hand look and has been right up front in regional forums. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Foreign Minister have been right up front in negotiations on a number of issues, including the South Pacific nuclear free zone treaty, which was initiated by this country and has now been ratified by the majority of countries in the South Pacific. Papua New Guinea just added its name in ratification of that regime. The treaty is very important in nuclear and strategic terms, not only for this region but for the whole world.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian aid is being used very sensibly for development in the region. I led a delegation to the South Pacific 12 months ago when we looked at a number of aid projects funded by Australia. We were very surprised to see that Australian aid had been well targeted in most circumstances. Of course there has been the odd problem in the past and I think we have all noted that. I want to raise an issue tonight that was raised by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which I chaired. In its report, which was tabled in the House, the Committee suggested that the Government should look at putting recurrent costs into its aid program. A notable example of the problem is a secondary school project in the Solomon Islands. It is a marvellous secondary college but its recurrent costs must constitute a drain on that small country's budget. We cannot allow that to occur. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department are aware of that problem and are taking it into account for the future. It is an ongoing problem when we are trying to create something that will be of use, of longstanding benefit, to countries which are small in relative terms. Nonetheless, Australia is doing its part and will continue to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although foreign policy does not have a particularly high profile at the moment in the public debate in Australia, I think all members of the Committee would agree that the role of the Australian Government in promoting our foreign policy is one of its most fundamental roles. Nowadays I suppose it is right to say that bilateral relations and trade are our principal foreign policy priorities-if we can say that trade policy is a foreign policy priority. Many speakers before me in this committee stage debate have talked about the need for Australia to be more effective in operations in its own region. There is no doubt that over the last six years, during the life of the Hawke Government, whilst its game has risen a little in a regional sense in the last year or so, the region has been substantially neglected by this Government. Certainly the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade showed scant interest in the affairs of our region and, above all, in the south-west Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We still need a much more positive and intelligent approach to the south-west Pacific. I do not think anybody who has stopped to think about the problems of the south-west Pacific-the growing indigenous movement, the growing Melanesian chauvinism-would be insensitive to the developments. After all, within our own country we are sensitive to the aspirations of the Aboriginal people, who are the indigenous people of this country. We should not be insensitive to the aspirations of the indigenous people of the various island states of the south-west Pacific. Yet, I think we have lacked cautious sensitivity, and I include the case of Fiji. At times we have behaved in an overweening, insensitive way and, as a consequence, in the longer term we as a country will suffer. Many of the statements that have come out of various countries in the south-west Pacific in the last few weeks, and in fact in the last two or three years, have reflected their growing irritation with the insensitivity of the Australian Government towards the aspirations of the indigenous people of the south-west Pacific. I do not want to concentrate too much on that tonight as I have discussed that issue in many other speeches and I know others who have participated in this debate have covered those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area of foreign policy that has been concentrated on to a greater degree by the Government is international trade relations. Again, the Government needs to do more. It needs to take a higher profile in building on the initiatives of the Fraser Government in developing the Pacific Basin as a coherent region. Nowadays the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is running around with what is rather curiously described as the Hawke initiative on developing some sort of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in the Pacific Basin. I understandably support that, but it certainly was not a Hawke initiative. I give credit where it is due. It was around at the time of the Whitlam Government. It was strongly promoted by the Fraser Government as well. It was part of the coalition's foreign policy during the 1984 election. It is not new; it is not a Hawke initiative. It is a good initiative. But the Government needs to do more. It needs to contemplate what it will do in the event of the Uruguay Trade Round not being successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The success or otherwise of the Uruguay Round will depend ultimately on the success or otherwise of the international agricultural trade negotiations. They are fundamental to us and, as I have said, they are fundamental to the success of the Uruguay Round. The fact is that if the Uruguay Round does not succeed-in other words, if there is not progress in international agricultural trade-then the world will fall back more and more on international trading blocs such as the European Community and the United States-Canada trading bloc. Other blocs will also start to spring up. In that climate it is important that we prepare ourselves to take the initiative to work towards an Asia-Pacific free trade zone incorporating the south-west Pacific countries, New Zealand and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries at least as a first step. There is a natural complementarity between all of those countries in terms of international trade and although the ASEAN countries are at the moment somewhat loath to go along with that sort of initiative, and in some respects I suppose that we should be, because we still want to see the Uruguay Round succeed as our first priority, I do, however, think that we need to be prepared for the eventuality of the failure of the Uruguay Round and, in that context, be ready to take up the initiative to move towards an Asia-Pacific free trade zone. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the early advocates of the free trading regional zone was none other than the former Prime Minister of this country, Malcolm Fraser. It was a very good example of the many visionary, and, frankly, now forgotten, initiatives that he had in the field of foreign policy. His vision in foreign policy and his continual initiatives in foreign policy are just a couple of the reasons why I think he would make an excellent Secretary- General of the Commonwealth of Nations. He very strongly addressed regional issues in a way that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs did not, and the Prime Minister certainly has not. Malcolm Fraser himself promoted a far-reaching trade initiative in 1982-83, which addressed the sort of fundamental international trade problems we have today. Yet they were completely ignored and ridiculed by the press and by the Australian Labor Party in 1982; and let us not forget it. His insistence that there be a freeze on protectionism and a freeze on export subsidies and that subsequently there should be moves towards trade liberalisation was ridiculed by the Labor Party and by the Australian media but was fundamentally right and visionary. He took a strong position on the European Community, opposing its common agricultural policy yet recognising the importance of the Community as an institution that brought Europe together after hundreds of years of confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> Malcolm Fraser recognised also the importance of North-South issues, which under this Government have completely fallen off the agenda. It was Malcolm Fraser who knew that if the so-called South, the developing countries, did not have proper economic opportunities, a much more divisive international political climate-instability, in a word-would be created. He argued both for trade liberalisation for the developing countries, particularly for primary commodities-that was directed at the European Community, the United States and Japan-and for a significant aid contribution to developing countries from the developed world. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that under the Hawke Government the Australian aid contribution has gradually declined. This would be a matter of shame for some Government members sitting opposite. In fact, both members of the Labor Party sitting in the chamber tonight are members of the Left faction. I am sure that they secretly think this is an appalling aspect of the Hawke Government's record. That is probably why the Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan) was at the Community Aid Abroad function last Friday. He got himself on television, even though his Government has been slashing aid left, right and centre. But Malcolm Fraser recognised its importance in the context of North-South issues and therefore global stability. </PARA>
<PARA> Malcolm Fraser recognised the role of Australia in peacekeeping forces, such as the Sinai peacekeeping force. Again, it was opposed by the Labor Party. We all recall the story of the present Prime Minister breaking down in tears when he addressed the House on the Labor Party's policy of withdrawing from the Multinational Force and Observers-the MFO, as it was known. But the Fraser Government was right. The present Prime Minister knew that the Fraser Government was right and that the Labor Party was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Malcolm Fraser has been particularly controversial on South Africa; but he recognised that unless there was constructive liberalisation in South Africa, that part of the world would simply become a place of superpower confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think that with that record of vision, with that record of constructive contribution to international affairs, which has been all but forgotten by far too many people in Australia, Malcolm Fraser would make a marvellous Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations. He would be better than Mr Anyaoky, who is an able bureaucrat but a man without the stature of a former Prime Minister of a great nation. All members of this House, particularly the Liberal and National Party members, would do well to recognise the great contribution to this country and the great contribution to the Commonwealth of Nations that Malcolm Fraser will make when he eventually becomes the Secretary-General of that institution. </PARA>

I endorse the comments made by some earlier speakers, especially the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles), about the importance of the Melanesian countries to Australia. Indeed, next year being the International Year of Literacy, we have a good opportunity to make a very meaningful contribution towards those countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to spend some time talking about recent events in South Africa and the Australian Government's response to them. In South Africa recently a so-called general election was called to form a new government. It was an election with somewhat of a difference in that it was an election such as has been held in few other parts of the world. It was so different because although South Africa has a population of some 34 million, less than six million have the right to vote. (Quorum formed) What is happening in South Africa is bad enough. It must be clearly understood that the South African regime does not limit its campaign against human rights in that country. It also seeks by a carefully planned program of military and economic destabilisation to make life as difficult as possible for the people of the frontline states who so strongly support the international campaign against apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that it is most important that our Government maintain and increase, as it recently has done, its level of funding to these countries under its southern Africa program. The recent decision which allocates $110m over the next triennium to the frontline states will, in conjunction with other international aid, do much to assist those nations to achieve a greater measure of economic independence from South Africa. It was therefore a little bit disappointing for our good record in regard to southern Africa to find that the allocation of funds to the United Nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination for next year is $3,000, a drop from the $4,000 of last year. I really think we could be a little more generous in that field. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased that, despite the economic constraints, our Government is seeking to maintain a high level of overseas aid to Africa generally. On this point, I am appalled that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) sought recently in a speech to criticise our food aid program to Ethiopia. He claimed that Australian aid, especially wheat, was being used to feed not refugees but the Ethiopian army. He made this claim on the basis of his inspection of a refugee camp in Asmara. I find it most surprising because I was also present at that inspection--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was my colleague the honourable member for Hawker. We saw with our own eyes that the food being distributed by the Ethiopian Catholic Secretariat, I might add, was going not to the army, as the honourable member for Parkes claimed, but to the people who needed it most-the refugees. I challenge the honourable member for Parkes to produce hard evidence to support the claims that he made that this food was going to the army.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now briefly, as so much of my time was eaten into by the calling of a quorum, to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. I note that our funding to UNESCO has not increased this year, which again is a disappointment to me. Recently UNESCO has come under the mantle of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I hope that this will be an upgrading of the UNESCO secretariat in Australia and not, as some people might say, a downgrading. I hope that the secretariat will not be lost in a bureaucratic mess but that it will continue to play its rightful role. Australia has had a very strong role in UNESCO and I think that that should continue. We actually get a lot of value out of UNESCO for the money that we put into it. On a wider field, looking at our obligations to the international community, I hope that UNESCO will be strengthened. It was always a matter of personal disappointment to me that the post of Ambassador to UNESCO was cut. I would like to see, when Budget constraints permit, that post restored. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also several points in relation to funding for the various embassies and the staff of the embassies. One in particular relates to the Australia-Japan Foundation. I was recently in Japan and had discussions with the people at the Australia-Japan Foundation. As Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I also visited our new embassy building there, which is a magnificent building. It will be a credit to Australia. I think that a lot of credit goes to the team which is working on it. The construction is right on schedule, which is different from our embassy in Beijing which has increased substantially in cost over the last few years. I do not know when that embassy will be completed. I know that you, Mr Deputy Chairman, visited that embassy site with me two years ago. I do not think there has been much progress on the embassy site in Beijing since then. But the Tokyo embassy is proceeding on time and will be within budget. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my concerns is that the Australia-Japan Foundation will have to move into the new embassy complex. This is worrying some people because it will take the Foundation away from one of the most important parts of Tokyo where people can, from the street, just come into the building where the Foundation is located, whereas where it will be in the new embassy building is away from public transport and will not have ready access for the people of Tokyo. I would ask that the Australia-Japan Foundation remain where it is in that part of Tokyo and not move to the new embassy when it is opened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my comments to a specific trade portfolio matter, namely, the decision of the Government on 22 August this year to put a complete ban on ivory. Nearly all ivory which comes into Australia originates from the African elephant, loxodonta africana. I believe the decision, though undoubtedly well-intentioned, was hasty, wrong and may be harmful. I liken it to the action of President Moi of Kenya who only recently gave permission to burn 12 tonnes of illegal ivory to dramatise the illegal trade in ivory. If we believe in the law of supply and demand-if demand stays constant but supply is reduced by that amount-then undoubtedly the price of ivory will be forced up and that action will give an even greater incentive to poachers to kill elephants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are 50 countries on the African continent and 36 of these have elephants in them. But only five out of 36 countries have elephant numbers which are either stable or increasing. Those are Botswana, Malawi, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia. These countries are successful because their parks are well managed. For example, there has not been an elephant poached in Kruger for the last two years. These countries gain ivory out of their parks from the deaths of elephants which die of old age and from a proper culling program. The money gained from the sale of this ivory is used for the better management of their parks, such as the financing of gamekeeper wages and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> We can compare that with other countries such as Zambia, Tanzania, Zaire, the Sudan, et cetera, where the numbers of elephants are drastically falling. An examination shows that that comes about because of the poor management of their parks. These countries want a total ban. I appreciate that there are arguments on both sides but I believe we must not penalise the successful countries for the successes that they have had. I want to mention some background comments so that we can better understand the arguments relating to the ivory trade and so that we can come to the best informed decision in the interest of the African elephant. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all the animals on earth the African elephant is perhaps the most celebrated, the most awesome, the best loved in many ways and one of the most endangered. Sadly, African elephants are falling prey to poachers. They are in danger because of their peculiarly shaped upper second incisor. The tusk is used by male elephants for fighting and by all elephants for food gathering, such as levering bark off trees. It is ironic that this survival tool has become the elephant's misfortune. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1979 and 1987 some 6,828 tonnes of ivory that we know of were exported from Africa, representing the deaths of 680,000 elephants. While the raw ivory brings only around $75m per year to the exporters, the real money lies in the finished product. Japan is the largest consumer of ivory, accounting for up to 40 per cent of the world's supply. Other major importers are Hong Kong, Macau and Belgium. The tragic fact is that the number of elephants in Africa has plummeted from 1.2 million in 1981 to 0.6 million in 1989; in other words, the population has halved in eight years. If this trend continues the African elephant will be extinct in the wild by the middle of the next century. In fact, we have only about 60 years left to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make some further comments which will be of particular interest to my electorate. The Western Plains Zoo at Dubbo has the only African elephants in Australia-three females, each 21 years old, and one male called Congo, who starred in the film Daktari, who is 31 years old. He stands 10 feet 4 inches at the shoulder-that is, about 31 hands-and weighs upwards of six tonnes. Of course, the largest African elephant ever was about 13 feet tall at the shoulder-that is about four metres-and weighed about 11 tonnes. The skin of that elephant alone would have weighed over a tonne. The tusks of the average adult elephant, if allowed to grow out, would be about two metres long-about 6 feet 6 inches-and would weigh about 100 pounds for the pair. The product ivory is very fine grained and beautiful. It is durable and has a very smooth texture. It is a variety of dentine that has been carved for the last 20,000 years and used in ancient cultures such as those in Egypt, China, India, ancient Rome, et cetera. Of course, ivory is produced also by the hippopotamus, the sperm whale-those carvings are called scrimshaw-the walrus, the narwhal and the warthog. I believe it would be a shame if the world were denied the proper use of this product. </PARA>
<PARA> The African elephant, as compared with the Indian elephant, is much bigger and heavier; in fact, it is the second largest animal in the world, the biggest being some whale species. It has bigger ears than the Indian elephant; it has two little tips at the end of its trunk to distinguish it from the Indian elephant which has only one; it has a flat or curved head as opposed to a domed forehead; it has a dip in its back instead of an arched back; and it has three toes on its hind foot instead of the four of the Indian elephant. There are many other differences. It is an amazing animal. It uses only the front of its six molars to grind its food. When they wear down the ones immediately behind them move forward. This continues until the last molar is in place at the age of about 60, and after that it usually dies of starvation.</PARA>
<PARA> African elephants run in a matriarchal society where the female is dominant and the males turn up only in the mating season. The gestation period lasts for about 22 months, and the mother elephant is very protective of her young. The young suckle for about two years but that may be extended. It is interesting to note that, along with human beings, the African and Indian elephants are the only animals that I know of that have their breasts between their front legs. They are absolutely gorgeous animals and I love them dearly.</PARA>
<PARA> An international organisation-the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)-now has a program well in place for the survival of elephants and it is working well. Countries that have elephant populations are now all members of CITES. They have set export quotas based on sound, scientific management principles: the number of elephants they have; their management and culling programs-which take into account the amount of feed they have-the protection of their habitat; and what they are doing about poachers. The importing countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau, Japan, Belgium, et cetera, can buy ivory only from approved quota stocks which are clearly registered, marked and accounted for. Any violation of this leads to that country being banned from all ivory trade. No country can afford to have that happen. </PARA>
<PARA> There were initial difficulties when this organisation was first set up because illegal ivory trade went on through the back door of third countries which have few elephants or none, such as Burundi, the United Arab Emirates and Somalia. But those initial difficulties with illegal suppliers, stockpiles, et cetera, have largely been overcome. The program is now working well. There is a demand for ivory for jewellery, such as arm bracelets, earrings and brooches, which I think is quite legitimate. But I shy from the use of ivory for things such as piano keys and billiard balls. Japan uses slices of ivory for personal seals. I am pleased to see that that is being eliminated in that country as it will lessen the demand for ivory. If we can cut demand and at the same time regulate supply, I believe that the future of the African elephant will look good. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we must do all we can in this country to join with the rest of the world in ensuring that the African elephant is saved from extinction. In this regard I believe that the 22 August total ivory trade ban decision was wrong. Of the 300 species of the order proboscidea that have roamed this earth, 298 are now extinct. Only the African and Indian elephant species survive. While the threat of extinction may seem distant to some we may not be so complacent when we wake up a few years from now to find that the last elephant on earth is dead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I intend to address my remarks in this debate to Australia's relations with India. For most of the period since India's independence in 1947, the relationship between Australia and India has been one of friendship and cooperation. As far back as 1942 the then Minister for External Affairs, Dr H. V. Evatt, publicly expressed the hope that India would be granted dominion status. Australia was the first dominion to exchange high commissioners with India, in 1944. In the late 1940s Australia and India collaborated to assist the cause of Indonesian nationalists. Indeed Australian representatives were the only non-Afro-Asian participants at a conference in New Delhi in 1949 which dealt with the issue of Indonesian independence. Australia was the prime mover behind the inception of the Colombo Plan in 1950. At the Afro-Asian conference in Bandung in 1955, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Australia and New Zealand are almost in our region . . . They are next to us and I should like Australia and New Zealand to come nearer to Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>This was not to be. Until recently, Australia's strategic orientations were mainly towards events in and around the Pacific Ocean. There were and are many reasons for this: our experience of World War II, the Korean War and our involvement in Vietnam and our assessment of the future strategic and economic realities of the nations of the Pacific Rim. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until the early 1980s that political and economic relations with India received serious attention. Australian Government statements acknowledged the past neglect of Australia-India relations. These relations were frustrated by a woeful lack of knowledge and understanding of each country for the other. Certainly, many Australian children were aware from their geography studies that India and Australia shared democratic ideals and similar legal and administrative systems. However, it took the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, in an address to the Australian Institute of International Affairs in Perth on 20 June 1984, to remind Australians:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when India won independence nearly 40 years ago, there were not many more than 300,000 or so Indians in uniform. Most of them were in the army and very few of them held senior rank. By the end of the 1970s, India had the third largest standing army in the world and the fifth largest airforce. Its navy is now the eighth largest in the world, and the evidence is that it is soon to become a lot larger. India has an advanced nuclear capability; five operating power reactors and five more being built; a fuel fabricating plant; two processing plants; and an active nuclear research establishment. It is well known that India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and it has to be said that, since then, it has not been very helpful to the cause of arms control and disarmament. It will not accept the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>Of India's economic performance he made these observations:</PARA>
<PARA> Measured by Gross National Product, it is in the top 10 of the world's economies. Its steel and machinery producing industries are among the top dozen in the world. Its exports total many billions of dollars a year. Its scientific sector is now one of the world's most advanced. Its University population has grown from no more than 300,000 in 1950 to more than four million today, creating a vast pool of trained professional, scientific, technological and executive talent. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure to recognise the scale of this performance is common. It has led to serious misunderstanding of India's anxieties and its objectives. It has resulted in a serious under estimation of its potential. It has caused a failure to appreciate India's staggering performance as the world's largest democracy-every failure and every blemish out in the open for all the world to judge. It has obscured India's role as a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement. It has neglected the salient fact that India is the biggest power among the littoral states of the Indian Ocean-with a legitimate interest in developments there and the potential to become a significant global power eventually. </PARA>
<PARA>Other misperceptions about modern India have often influenced Australian decisions. Australia tends to neglect the study of culture and society which is necessary in dealing with the countries of Asia. And the China factor has also had a part to play. (Quorum formed) China has been perceived as a great market while India has been thought of as a land of the poor. Another reason for low key relations in the past could be attributed to India's approach to international and multilateral issues which has, at times, been at variance with the interests of Western countries, including Australia. First, Australia believes that a stable nuclear deterrent relationship is the only means available to minimise the risk of nuclear war and that it provides a basis for confidence to engage in negotiations to reduce the risk of nuclear war. Secondly, Australia supports the presence of the United States defence facility at Diego Garcia which enables the United States to protect the strategic and economic interests of itself and its allies, particularly the supply of gulf oil. The United States presence is also aimed to uphold freedom of the seas through securing air and sea lines of communication, and the various Indian Ocean choke points, against harassment and interdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> Most significantly, Australia is a most important defence ally of the United States-indeed, Australia is the only nation in the southern hemisphere which has a defence treaty with the United States. In contrast, India is a respected leader of the non-aligned movement and, more often than not, during debates in the United Nations supports the Soviet Union and its objectives. Nevertheless, Australia and India do support many common goals. The two countries share similar views on apartheid and decolonisation issues, for example, in South Africa, Namibia and New Caledonia, and have voted together on issues such as human rights in Chile and the arms race in space. </PARA>
<PARA> It was in 1984 that, as a result of a policy review, the Hawke Government endorsed a set of policy goals covering Australia's relations with India. In essence, the policy objectives stipulated that Australia would have to take into account India's position as a friendly and powerful country in the Indian Ocean region and underlined the potential for Australia to derive long term economic benefit specifically in the area of stronger trade links. Until then the commercial relationship had suffered because of Indian preoccupation with industrial self-sufficiency and a perception of Australia as a primary producer and exporter. This point was emphasised by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi during his visit to Australia in October 1986. Speaking at the National Press Club, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We should move beyond what tends to characterise our two-way trade now, being raw materials and a few consumer goods. </PARA>
<PARA>The visit also led to the establishment of the Australia-India Business Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia must establish a significant strategic presence in India if we are to take advantage of commercial opportunities which will occur as the Indian economy becomes more deregulated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments tonight will be addressed mainly to the treaties and protocols dealing with refugees, for which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible. I intend to address some comments to matters concerning Kampuchea, Vietnam, Hong Kong, East Germany and the Lebanon, which are all places of considerable concern to us in Australia, where there are large numbers of people who have been affected by events and hostilities in their homelands which are causing them, and others in the world, enormous problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I heard the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) talking this afternoon about the impact of his visit to Turkey and Gallipoli I was reminded that there are other places that have had an impact upon me. All too frequently they have been the graves of those who have been affected by hostilities in one form or another. One of the most telling places for me to visit was Kampuchea. I am one of a small number of Australian parliamentarians who have travelled into Kampuchea in recent years and who have had the opportunity to see at first hand what legacy Pol Pot left behind. I must say that as I follow, in the international press, events which are affecting the Khmer population today I despair somewhat, knowing what those people have been through. I know that there has been a good deal of effort on the part of the Government-I do not disparage that-to try to play a positive role in the international conferences which have been directed towards trying to find a solution to the problems of this area. I know how difficult it is. I have met over a long period with the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed forces, its leader, Son Sann and his son, Son Soubertt. I have met with representatives of Prince Sihanouk, his political party and his forces. I have visited one of the Khmer Rouge refugee camps, site 8, supposedly one of the free camps but where young Khmer are recruited to fight on the side of the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA> In Phnom Penh I have met with Hun Sen, the Prime Minister, and many of his Ministers and have had dealings with the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. I know from the discussions in which I have participated of the chasms that have existed between each of them. Nevertheless, I was hopeful that the discussions that have taken place, particularly in Europe and Indonesia, involving Australia, the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Vietnam may have brought about a solution. I would be keen for Australia to play a part in any solution. </PARA>
<PARA> I offer these comments because of the problem that the Khmer face but also from a selfish point of view. I do not believe that it is in Australia's long term interests for there to be an outstanding problem of that dimension within our region. I have said to many who have asked why we have a concern to try to resettle Khmer in Australia, as with Vietnamese, that it would be an absolute disaster were we to end up with a Palestinian problem in our region, particularly in those countries with whom we have to trade and work and/or those areas of the world where we holiday or have to travel through if we are holidaying further afield. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to Vietnam and the moves in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, has been involved recently to put in place a comprehensive plan of action. Over a long period we have dealt with Vietnamese refugees substantially differently from the way we have dealt with others. The international community was prepared to accept that all those who left Vietnam were doing so with a legitimate fear of persecution, and thus all were accepted. It has now been determined to test that. </PARA>
<PARA> Hong Kong has been the focal point for some of the concerns and problems which the Vietnamese fleeing Vietnam and landing in Hong Kong are presenting in relation to the attitude that is being taken to Chinese who might leave and try to find a place for themselves in Hong Kong. The United Kingdom has been keen to put in place provisions which would enable Hong Kong to discourage Vietnamese from landing on its shores or, if not discourage them, at least test those who do to see that they satisfy the international convention and protocol relating to refugees; that is, that they have a genuine fear of persecution and are not, in the parlance, `economic' refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant numbers of Vietnamese landing in Hong Kong now have to be assessed, as they are in Thailand and Malaysia. My real concern is that there be a proper and genuine assessment. I seek from the Government assurances that it will use its best endeavours, particularly Senator Evans, to ensure that, in each of the countries to which Vietnamese people flee, a proper assessment is made, that people have access to independent advice on their rights, that international agencies, particularly welfare agencies and aid organisations, are able to have access to them in order to assist them in their flight, and that they have proper access to an appeals structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Having stated the principles which Hong Kong seeks to apply to refugees from Vietnam and which apply to refugees from Kampuchea, it is timely to emphasise that these are conditions which apply to people generally. A view has been proposed recently that, particularly after the events in Tiananmen Square, Australia might accept larger numbers of people from Hong Kong outside normal immigration criteria at present. My own view is that we ought not to relax our immigration criteria. There are many bases upon which people from Hong Kong can now apply to come to Australia. If they are to seek status as refugees, there needs to be a marked change of circumstances before such applications could be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is interesting to note-and it is a Labor Government in South Australia that has offered these comments, apparently-that there is a desire to resettle refugees fleeing from East Germany. My own very clear view is that the principles that apply to Vietnamese, to Khmer and to Chinese from Hong Kong ought equally apply to those seeking to flee East Germany. Of course, West Germany accepts East Germans automatically. As such, East Germans are not seen as refugees within the international treaty and would not be available for resettlement ordinarily in Australia. Therefore, the ordinary immigration rules would apply in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The final area I want to comment on is the one area in regard to which an exceptional view has been adopted by Australia, and that is the Lebanon, which is another country where there has been great tragedy and where, because people are not fleeing their own homeland and seeking to be in a third country, the usual rules relating to refugee status do not apply. Some accommodation has been made in that area recently by the Government. I commend the Government for that, but there are still many inadequacies in the arrangements that have been put in place, many inequalities between individuals, and a good deal of attention still needs to be devoted by the Government to the situation in the Lebanon. Because of the large number of people in Australia from that troubled country, there needs to be a comprehensive approach by Australia to that problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to the need for Australia and the Government to develop policies for Australians to work in international organisations overseas. I refer to the need, on the one hand, for Australians to have careers and, on the other hand, to have exchange programs in international organisations such as the United Nations (UN), the various United Nations agencies and, indeed, the whole range of international organisations and agencies outside the United Nations: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bank, the postal organisations, the telecommunications organisations and international scientific organisations. This country needs to have-and I hope that there could be an element of bipartisanship in this because there has been neglect by both sides of the political process-a policy of placing Australians in international organisations, a policy to project Australian's national interest in the broadest sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very nice and appropriate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, to want to be the Chairman of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I would support an Australian being Chairman of the General Assembly of the United Nations, but it happens only once every 20 or 30 years. I would advocate Australians in the Secretary-General's Office at the United Nations. If we cannot have an Australian Secretary-General, we could have an Australian Deputy Secretary-General or senior Australian officers in the United Nations bureaucracy, Australian career officers. It is a long time since we have had a very senior UN bureaucrat. We had a deputy chairman of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund and I think Sir Robert Jackson, who was very distinguished in peacekeeping matters, was involved many years ago, but we have no policy or program. We need to develop these policies so that we have Australians at the UN and in other agencies. There needs to be a program where the movements of Australian public servants from the whole range of government departments, including if need be, Foreign Affairs officers, can be integrated so that they can choose to serve in an international organisation as part of their career development and, in so doing, develop their own skills and abilities and project Australia's interests overseas. This applies to lawyers, scientists or any one of a whole range of people in government departments. We need to develop a program whereby Australians from government service can slot in and out of public sector positions in the international arena. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great need to do this, in my view, because such a course would project the national interest and enable an understanding of Australia in the general sense. Australian employees will thus have the capacity to promote the interests of Australia not in a corrupt or disloyal way but in a general way inside an international organisation. People will then know about Australia. The international organisation concerned may become more responsible to Australia's interests and needs. There is a real dilemma, a real problem in Australia, in that we have not looked at this as a way of projecting our national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations operates in many places. It has enormous bureaucracies in New York, Geneva and Vienna. We need to develop a UN program and a general program to have Australians who can both work in the system as a permanent career and opt in and out of it as part of their general career. All of it would project Australia at the UN and internationally. I ask the Minister to obtain for me the number of Australians in the United Nations and associated and affiliated agencies to see whether they in any way relate to our contribution to the UN and whether we are discriminated against. I will bet that we do not have our fair share of international bureaucrats at the United Nations and other agencies. Most European countries, the United States of America and Canada are sophisticated and have developed ways and means of getting their personnel in and out of the UN system as a career path. It could be part of an Australian public servant's career path to be able to serve in the United Nations and other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to have a general influence. If individuals in these agencies understand Australia they can project our general national interest and understanding and create a climate that is valuable to us. In many ways it is more important that we develop a program such as this than that we engage in the establishment of embassies in some countries. It is as important as diplomacy itself. I hope that the Government will develop the programs I have mentioned to establish policies for Australians to work in these international organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available I also want to refer to the question of Hong Kong. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) talked about the Vietnamese refugee problem in Hong Kong. I am very sympathetic and have great empathy with the points he made, but I want to make an additional point that goes to the development of the basic law in Hong Kong itself. As we know, the United Kingdom has reached agreement with the People's Republic of China (PRC) concerning the transfer of Hong Kong-both the New Territories and Hong Kong itself-to the People's Republic. Since 4 June and the events of Tiananmen Square the people of Hong Kong are very rightly nervous about what will happen when they are consumed and taken over by the PRC. The United Kingdom Government has a special responsibility to develop the basic law-in other words, develop a democratic representative government system in Hong Kong before 1997 so that when the takeover takes place there is in position in Hong Kong a democratic system whereby people have a form of representative government. It is essential that the United Kingdom Government bring forward the development of the basic law program. </PARA>
<PARA> I found in a recent visit to the United Kingdom a lack of interest amongst members of parliament on the one hand and the community on the other in relation to events in Asia. The United Kingdom, like other European countries, is very Eurocentric. European countries concentrate on the Common Market and the development from 1992 onwards of the Economic Community. Protection in the Community is greater than ever. Western Europeans are also fascinated with what is happening in Eastern Europe. With the twin preoccupations in Europe with the Common Market and the developments towards democracy, glasnost and perestroika in some Eastern European countries, Europe-in particular the United Kingdom, as I am talking about Hong Kong-have forgotten Asia and the Pacific. The United Kingdom Government should establish in Hong Kong the equivalent of a special democratic zone. The torch of democracy ought to be established in Hong Kong as an example for the rest of the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA> Twin developments in relation to democracy are occurring in Taiwan. The Hawke Government has been hypocritical in relation to Taiwan. Since 4 June a number of Taiwanese nationals have wanted to come to Australia for a conference but were refused visas. That is outrageous. They wanted to come to an anti-communist conference and this Federal Government refused them permission to come. It is also outrageous that this Government has not established a direct air link with Taiwan, which is one of the richest economies in the world-the People's Republic of China in Taiwan. It is one of the so-called economic tigers. Here we are with an enormous balance of trade deficit. We need investment and we do not have a direct air link because this Government refuses to develop an air link with Taiwan. I know talks are going on; they are lingering. It is outrageous that we do not have a direct air link. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Chairman, I congratulate you. It is the first time I have seen you in the chair. Recently the Australian Financial Review editorialised on overseas aid and made the following observations:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Australians are offended by global poverty. Millions respond personally, and they wish their Government, with its access to resources beyond any available to non-Government organizations, to help too. The chief government aid delivery body, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, is a much-improved organization with a capacity to do more. </PARA>
<PARA>Those observations were only a small part of an editorial which sought to encourage political action by overseas aid bodies-political action designed to lift the level of Australian overseas development assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> What provoked the Australian Financial Review, a hard-nosed economic rationalist commentator on these budgetary matters, to make this editorial comment and take up the cause of aid funding? It was the 1989-90 Budget allocation by the Government, which saw total aid funds as a percentage of gross national product (GNP) drop by over 8 per cent in real terms to 0.33 per cent. As the Australian Financial Review noted, overseas aid serves Australia's diplomatic and export interests as well as meeting unarguable humanitarian obligations that this country has to human beings beyond its borders, many of whom are in great need. There is nothing wet or soft minded about overseas aid, as many people would seek to say to anybody who speaks on this aspect of the Budget, particularly those who wish that more funds were allocated in that area. We affirm our basic values and serve the national interest in allocating resources for overseas development assistance. Cuts to aid are therefore irrational. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. Funding has dropped from 0.56 per cent of GNP under the Fraser coalition Government to an almost miserable 0.33 per cent of GNP under this Government. On 30 May this year I raised with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Question Time the matter of Australia's grant to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). I drew his attention to a request from Ken Done, Australia's UNICEF goodwill ambassador, for the UNICEF grant to be lifted from approximately $3.3m per annum, or half a cent per head of population per week at that rate, to $7m per annum, or just 1c per head of population per week. I asked the Prime Minister whether he could assure the House that UNICEF's grant would be doubled within an overall real increase in the total aid budget in the 1989-90 Budget. The Prime Minister answered by saying that he thought everyone would put a tick against that proposal if fiscal circumstances allowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Budget was brought down fiscal circumstances allowed for a $44m boost for sport in Australia. Everybody applauded that, and I applaud it too. We have also seen since that fiscal circumstances have permitted a $60m hand-out over five years to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd in Victoria and a $200m hand-out to banks to keep down interest rates. During the handing down of the recent Budget, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made quite a thing of the $9 billion surplus associated with that Budget. However, when it came to overseas aid, fiscal circumstances required an 8 per cent real cut in the aid budget-a tragedy-and fiscal circumstances allowed a lift of the UNICEF grant from $3.3m to $3.4m per annum, a miserable rise of only $100,000 in a very essential area of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the UNICEF example typifies the Government's attitude to balancing our humanitarian obligations overseas against the need to win votes domestically. I acknowledge the recent decision to re-establish Australia's support for the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a program which directs funds to those most in need at the grassroots level and in very effective projects. During the next week I will have the pleasure of attending the South Pacific Conference in Guam with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). The main topic will be the discussion surrounding the production of foodstuffs, particularly as it affects Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall record of the Government in the area of overseas development assistance is really quite shocking: a real cut of 4.8 per cent in the 1985-86 Budget; a real cut of 11.9 per cent in the 1986-87 Budget; a real cut of 2.8 per cent in the 1987-88 Budget; a much needed boost of 7.4 per cent in the 1988-89 Budget; but then, back to the old habits, another severe cut this year of 8.4 per cent. Forward estimates anticipate that overseas aid as a percentage of GNP will decline to 0.3 per cent by 1992-93, notwithstanding continued lip-service to the United Nations-endorsed target of 0.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that times are tough in Australia, but they are nowhere near as tough as they are in developing countries in South East Asia, South Asia and Africa. Indeed, our current problems have in part been due to excessive consumption and economic growth. It is somewhat ironic therefore, with high growth, consumption and government revenues, that Australia's official or government level overseas development assistance has been declining. It is not just ironic, it is quite shameful. Most Australians acknowledge that their hardships pale into insignificance when compared to life and death struggles in developing countries. They therefore support overseas aid even though current Budget constraints mean lower living standards in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Australian Financial Review observed, most Australians are offended by global poverty. Most Australians reject the funding cuts that this Government has made to our overseas aid budget. I add my voice to the protests levelled at current overseas aid allocations and call on the Government urgently to review those allocations with a view to moving rapidly to the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP, a very small target indeed. I call on the Government to begin that funding boost by increasing the UNICEF grant from $3.5m to $7m without delay. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, this Parliament ought always to remind itself and not forget that throughout the world, in the developing countries to which most of the foreign aid goes, every year relentlessly 14.2 million children under the age of five years die as a result of malnutrition and poverty. There ought to be neon signs around this building indicating that fact, making people aware of the need to increase our grants to these very needy countries-and particularly to UNICEF, which is concentrating all its effort on aid to children-to at least $7m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to say a few words on these estimates. Before doing so, I note that this is the first time I have been aware that we have had a lady Clerk Assistant in the House. I think it is a notable advance and I wish her well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The field I want to address is the involvement of politics and trade, and I am delighted that the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) is at the table. He has put a quite considerable effort into the international dialogue pursued by the Cairns Group in the negotiations to secure better recognition of the role of agricultural trade within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). My worry is that that is not enough and that at the moment there are enormous problems for the Australian economy which everybody seems to be blithely ignoring. Of course we have been conscious of the live sheep trade embargo by Saudi Arabia. We are aware of the difficulties of disposing of the 10,000 sheep that are now, I understand, thanks to Egypt, to be allowed to pass through Suez and will be sold to an Italian buyer. </PARA>
<PARA> The circumstances of the live sheep trade and of the embargo are only illustrative of a much wider problem. To start with, we all need to be aware that Australia faces a very serious export downturn with its rural exports. Already in this wool selling season the Australian Wool Corporation has purchased about 50 per cent of the wool on offer at auction. We are all aware, or should be, that as far as wheat is concerned there has not only been a slippage from the expected about $178 a tonne to about $170 a tonne in prices paid for wheat at the moment, but there has also been a slippage because of dry weather. In my own part of New South Wales, and that of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), there has been a significant fall which I expect will lead to an even greater reduction in the expected harvest this year. At the moment the Australian Wheat Board assesses the harvest at 15.1 million tonnes but my own assessment is that we will be very lucky if we make 14 million tonnes. The product of the downturn in those two commodities alone-wool and wheat-is assessed in the Australian as a fall of about 45 per cent in our export income, which will be down from about $8.22 billion to $4.33 billion. This is at a time when we know our chronic balance of payments problem is at the core of the difficulties in our economy and one of the reasons for tight monetary policy and high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to that is the problem which I have just mentioned, the live sheep bans, and the enormous difficulties with the beef trade. As far as beef is concerned we have the incredible situation whereby, only a month before Taiwan applied the ban, a delegation from the Australian cattle industry and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation came back, after consultation with the Taiwanese, believing full well there were excellent prospects for the future. We all know there was, first, an absolute ban and then a partial relaxation of the ban. A consequence of the partial relaxation is that those parts of the carcasses which are sold in Taiwan with the greatest profits for Australia-that is, the flaps and the shanks-are still, apparently, being refused access. It is a great pity that nothing has been done about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The live sheep ban in Saudi Arabia represents a reduction by about half of our approximately $300m worth of live sheep trade. There are difficulties which flow on in other countries in the Middle East because of that ban by Saudi Arabia. There is a real difficulty about health access, and problems as to just what is the reason for our being unable to lift that embargo. I understand there is to be a meeting tomorrow at which the Minister for Agriculture for Saudi Arabia is expected to be present. Having spoken to the Ambassador for Saudi Arabia in Australia I am aware of his concern that there should be an easing of this present difficulty between our countries. I am sure that concern exists at the government level as well as the ambassadorial level. This is a very real difficulty. Once Saudi Arabia imposed that ban, it flowed through every one of the other Middle East countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are another two areas where politics have intruded on trade. Not so long ago there was a ban on goat imports into Canada. The nature of that ban might not seem significant to many people, but for the goat industry its effects are likely to be as serious as those of the ban on the live sheep trade. The live sheep trade has already experienced a drop of approximately one-third in the market price of cast for age wethers and younger wethers sold for meat, particularly in Western Australia. Similar consequences are expected in the goat trade as a result of the ban in Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another difficulty in Japan. We are all aware that, as a result of a lapse in electoral support, there has been a change of Prime Minister, and there is a feeling that we might have difficulties in achieving the full relaxation of the beef trade in Japan that we would have hoped for. If that happens-and Japan is today our major beef market, certainly for prime cuts-the Australian beef industry will suffer as well. We have the live sheep ban, the problem with goats, difficulties with cattle in Taiwan and potential difficulties with the relaxation of the beef trade in Japan. The combination of all those could mean that the expected 45 per cent drop in rural exports could become something like a 55 per cent drop. It might even be higher than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make to the Minister is that the present trade promotion system, the trade political representation system, is not working. I do not believe that Austrade, with a restriction on its general field of responsibility, is able to do what the old trade commissioner service used to. I do not believe it is efficient to have this split between Ministers. The Minister at the table is in one sense, with due respect, the Minister for nothing. He is the Minister for Trade Negotiations. On the one hand he represents the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) while on the other he represents the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and Austrade. The next minute he tries to represent the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and, occasionally, he represents himself. Trade is split in four bailiwicks. One country about which we are concerned, Taiwan, is not even diplomatically registered in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that Austrade, under its present charter, does not have responsibility for these agricultural commodities yet they, together with minerals, represent Australia's major exports. We know what is happening with the pilots dispute and tourism, and we know there will be major difficulties in that area. We have to see what we can do to overcome this impasse between politics and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> I seriously put to the Minister and this House that it is not good enough just to advocate the relaxation of rural barriers within the Cairns Group and GATT. We need, at the ministerial and senior policy advisory levels, to recognise what is going on in the politics of the countries which import our exports. I have mentioned four countries. There are actually far more involved. </PARA>
<PARA> In Saudi Arabia and the other Middle East countries we need to have not just an Austrade representative-but if there is just an Austrade representative he must be responsible for minerals and, above all, agriculture-but a senior trade commissioner. We need somebody responsible for the agricultural industry who can give advice to the Minister and the Government. We need a commissioner in Taiwan. How ridiculous it is that a trade mission went to Taiwan, came back and said the trade potential for beef is tremendous, and a month later there is an absolute ban. We need to look at the situation in Taiwan. I suggest to the Minister that now is the time for us to overcome the nonsense of the present basis of Far East trading company representation for Taiwan in Australia. We have major commercial ties with Taiwan and need to do something about them. </PARA>
<PARA> In Japan, Canada and, I suggest, the European Common Market we need senior trade commissioners. In the meantime, we certainly need to change the charter of Austrade so that it is working with agriculture in a field which is so critical to Australian trade exports. Working in multilateral fields in trade negotiations is good, but it is not enough. We must work on a commodity by commodity basis, we must do it with agriculture and we must be prepared to do it, where needed, with minerals. I suggest to the Minister that Austrade's charter needs to be broadened, and it is essential that we have a few senior trade commissioners to represent our case forcefully and alert Australian exporters before market closures or changes are put into place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I will pick up some of the matters raised by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in what was a constructive contribution to this debate. He raised matters which he obviously believes need to be looked at in respect of the trade performance of this country. I do not agree with a lot of the points he has made and I will deal with those in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to thank honourable members from this side of the House, particularly the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles), who dealt with the South Pacific area, and you, Mr Deputy Chairman, for dealing with South Africa, where you have a particular interest, concerning aid to Africa and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. I also thank the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who dealt with the question of trade with India, arising, to some extent, out of a recent joint commission meeting held here in Canberra. It showed a good deal of promise in relation to bilateral trade with India which for many years, it could be said quite reasonably, has probably been treated with almost benign neglect. </PARA>
<PARA> The matters raised by the right honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) representing the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) this evening tended to cut across one another to a large extent. As the right honourable member for New England pointed out, the Opposition shows a somewhat split personality in trying to deal with various areas. Nevertheless, I welcome the Opposition's support on a bipartisan basis for the multilateral trade efforts. That is one of the few things on which we have been able to establish a bipartisanship in this place. It is a pity we cannot have bipartisanship in many more areas, but I am grateful that it exists on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the honourable member for Murray and the right honourable member for New England put what to them, unfortunately, was a very realistic assessment of trade prospects in the future, but I think the prospects are brighter than they outlined. The latest export forecasts predict a firm rise in exports in 1989-90. The prediction is based on expectations of a 7 1/2 per cent rise in export volume. As well, average export prices are expected to remain near current levels. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecasts, which were mentioned earlier this evening by the honourable member for Murray, predicted that commodity exports would expand by 9 per cent to $39.8 billion in 1989-90, a record level, but lower, admittedly, than earlier expectations due largely to the revisions to the wool export forecasts which were mentioned by the honourable member for Murray and again by the right honourable member for New England. The ABARE forecast that the volume of commodity exports will rise by 11 per cent, reflecting significant increases in production levels, despite the somewhat pessimistic views put forward by the honourable member for Murray and the right honourable member for New England, especially in the minerals sector, and also continuing firm demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The mineral resources export volumes are expected to rise by about 15 per cent. That reflects the investment in new capacity and upgrading existing facilities and higher average rises in output. That is across a fairly wide area. Coal, alumina, gold, iron ore and new exports of liquefied natural gas, will all contribute to the strong export performance. The recent predictions in relation to steel production and the benefit of that in respect of export of iron ore have been particularly encouraging, and they are very recent forecasts. Rural export volumes are forecast to rise by 4 per cent, with strong increases for sugar and meat products, especially beef, and modest rises for cereals and other rural commodities. The higher commodity prices in the last 18 months have been of particular benefit. We have directed our efforts in the Uruguay Round on agriculture and coal, which has been mentioned, to ensuring that we lock into these higher commodity prices and avoid the boom and bust mentality we have tended to have in the past. Such slumps have been caused by policy-induced excess production. </PARA>
<PARA> I must touch on a couple of specific points made first by the honourable member for Murray and later by the right honourable member for New England. The first mentioned was the problem with Saudi Arabia and the live sheep exports. There is no question but that we are all concerned about the problem raised by the right honourable member for New England this evening. The Government has clearly made known its concerns to the Saudi Arabian authorities. A high level delegation visited Saudi Arabia. It also visited Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The visit was made in August when the problem first surfaced. As a result of this difficulty, I wrote to the Saudi Arabian Commerce Minister on 23 August, noting that Australia regarded the dispute as a major trade policy matter-one of the points the right honourable member for New England was making-with potential serious adverse implications for our bilateral trade relationships, something which none of us wants to see happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans took the opportunity of his presence at the NAM Foreign Ministers meeting in Belgrade in September to highlight in discussions with the Deputy Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia the concerns of the Australian Government with respect to the situation that had developed with live sheep exports. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has taken up the matter twice by correspondence with the Saudi Arabian Minister for Agriculture and Water, most recently on 7 September. The Saudi Arabian Minister is expected to return to Riyadh at any time. The right honourable member indicated that he may have already arrived there; if so, he did so only yesterday or today. The Government's principal concern is to resolve the matter so as not to undermine the overall commercial relations that Australia and Saudi Arabia have enjoyed. The Government remains willing to consider any proposals that may resolve the present impasse, but it is not easy and, in fairness, I do not think the right honourable member for New England was suggesting that it is an easy problem to solve. At this stage, we have done all we can through representations to the Ambassador and the relevant Ministers. The matter has been complicated to a large extent by the absence from Saudi Arabia of the relevant Minister during the period in which we have wanted particularly to make representations on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are aware of the pressure that the Taiwan domestic beef industry faces in competing with imports, we do not consider that the solution lies in unilateral trade restraints. The industry, with the full support of the Australian Government after extensive consultation with the industry, has made the strongest representations to the relevant Taiwan authorities regarding proposals to restrict beef imports. It is disappointing that despite the fact that there has been partial lifting of restrictions-one can be thankful for small mercies-we have not been able to succeed in having the ban lifted for all types of Australian product. We will monitor the situation and continue to give strong support to the industry and its representations urging the lifting of the restrictions. Again as the right honourable member for New England pointed out, it is a particularly difficult matter. We are doing our best to resolve both the matters raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving to another area, it must be acknowledged that the Government has achieved remarkable success in bilateral trade. That was not picked up by any of the speakers, including the Deputy Leader of the National Party and the former Leader of the National Party. We have directed substantial resources to Austrade, although the right honourable member for New England feels that it does not work as well as the old Australian Trade Commissioner Service did. When we consider access to Australian trade commodities in the face of often unreasonable protection, we must conclude that a good deal has been achieved. The 1988 United States Trade Bill, for example, now poses only a minimal direct threat to Australian interests; that was not the case when we started making representations in relation to the Bill. We are now working to achieve a similar result for the 1989 Trade Bill in the United States. Again, that will require a lot of work-which we will do-on that particularly important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We have negotiated a new beef access agreement with Japan that will lead to the abolition of quotas by 1991, which was an enormous achievement and one which was acknowledged by honourable members opposite. We are optimistic that our efforts to secure liberalisation of the Korean beef market will also meet with success. The right honourable member for New England raised the problem that the domestic difficulties in Japan-political difficulties-may cause some change in the liberalisation of the beef market. There are many matters which I do not think are appropriate to go into which have caused the difficulties in Japan. One of those matters may have been a reaction to the liberalisation of the beef market, but it would be gilding the lily to put that too high on the list of problems that were faced by the Japanese Government. At this stage we do not have any indication that the Japanese Government will not honour that agreement. We are optimistic that it will honour it, because when we consider its enormous domestic difficulties we realise that it took a big step. When the Minister of Agriculture, Mr Sato, was in Australia to negotiate that agreement the difficulties he presented were pretty obvious to us. I think the result of those negotiations did, in fact, bring considerable credit to the Japanese Government. People talk about the liberalisation of trade. Japan took a big step, and I do not think it is about to step away from that position. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the bilateral areas and the question of the August 1988 Australian New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA), which will result in free trade in goods from July 1990, I do not think any of us contemplated that it would have moved that quickly by July 1990. After all New Zealand is still our biggest export market for manufactures. The inclusion of trade in services within the closer economic relations and harmonisation of business law, quarantine procedures and Customs policies should not be underrated in relation to Australia's trade performance in the future. We continue, as has been indicated, to work assiduously to avert erosion of Australia's access to the European Community for agricultural exports. The right honourable member for New England knows only too well how difficult that is. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many new trade agreements and memorandums of understanding which will provide the basis for further expansion, including new trade agreements with Turkey and a new trade program with the USSR. The recent joint commission meeting here with India has much potential. We have also been active in promoting regional trade efforts, and after more than two decades now of discussion, and nothing more, of the concept of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, we have been able to take the prospect of cooperation to the point where a regional ministerial meeting is to be hosted by Australia in November as a result of the initiative taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when he was in Seoul earlier this year. This initiative offers real prospects of further integrating our trading and economic interests within the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> Those matters are the matters of real substance that were raised by both the honourable members who have a particular interest in this area. There are a couple of other areas that I would like to touch on briefly. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) again suggested, as he has in the past, that he was somewhat pessimistic about, firstly, the Uruguay Round. It is all very well to be pessimistic about it. The fact is that more progress has been made to date in that round than there has been in any other. Whilst I agree that there is still a long way to go, I do not know why he is in a great state of pessimism about it. He also suggested that we should have another look at an Asia-Pacific free trade zone in case the round fails. I do not know how often one has to say that there is no interest in any such proposition in this region. No country has any interest in it. That was clearly spelt out when it was necessary to sound out the various countries in relation to the regional initiative. One thing they are not interested in is a trading bloc in this area. When we look at the difficulties in developing the concept of the CER with New Zealand, a country with so many similarities to ours, whether it be from a social or economic viewpoint or whatever, the problem of trying to establish what the honourable member for Mayo seems to be on about would be such that any government that embarked on it would be wasting an enormous amount of resources for no ultimate result, because-and I repeat it-the countries in the area are not interested in the concept that he is talking about. It is certainly in the best interests of Australia and the other small to medium sized countries to maintain an open, multilateral system and to try to explore how that can be developed through that regional initiative. That will certainly be complementary to the work in the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) raised the issue of Australians in international organisations. He thought we did not have enough representation proportionally and asked whether I could get figures on Australians in international secretariats. I will endeavour to do that for him as obviously it is a matter in which he has some interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I welcome the constructive comments of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) on the situation in Cambodia and the Government's efforts to assist in working towards a comprehensive solution to that problem. The honourable member's interest in refugee problems in Cambodia and elsewhere is well known. He can be assured that the Government pays close attention to the issues both in particular countries' circumstances and in relevant multilateral organisations. The Government is a strong supporter, of course, of the role and efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. </PARA>

Together with my National-Liberal Party colleagues, I recognise that the Government's approach to science funding has given rise to considerable community concern, to state the obvious. Indiscriminate and across the board reductions in funding have threatened vital areas of research which the coalition believes ought to be quarantined from further cutbacks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although there is bound to be considerable debate as to what constitutes vital research and, therefore, warrants continuing government support, it is, nevertheless, possible to identify in broad terms those areas which ought to be given special status in regard to public outlays. Implicitly, a discussion of such matters also demands an exposition of the coalition's perspective on the responsibilities of the private and public sectors in regard to research. Although the coalition is supportive of the trend towards exposing public sector research organisations and institutions to market demand, it is not convinced that this policy ought to embrace the concomitant tendency which is aimed at reducing government appropriations for research. Similarly, the coalition does not subscribe to the view that all research shares common characteristics in regard to its capacity to accommodate commercial relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> There are areas of scientific and technological activity which, by their very nature, or as a result of time lags associated with their very research processes, do not attract the immediate interest of business enterprises. Many of these areas, I might add, are critical not just to the long term economic interests of the nation, but also to the effective operationalisation of government policy. It is arguable whether costly government initiatives on pressing agricultural or environment problems can proceed with any confidence unless they are underpinned by a comprehensive body of knowledge derived from long term research. Of particular importance in this regard are those areas of research which produce the data base upon which a diversity of other strands of important research depend. It is not possible, in this context, to switch research of this order off and on according to the passing needs of fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition also contends that research of a more basic kind must be maintained at appropriate levels in order to increase our domestic access to fundamental knowledge, which underpins the medium to long-term viability of the innovation process. While it is rightly argued that a narrowly conceived, applied science oriented policy misunderstands the breadth of scientific and technological endeavour which underpins the innovation process, there are even more disturbing implications. That is to say, a vigorous basic science capacity is also essential for ensuring continued wide access to the fundamental knowledge which ultimately drives the innovation process itself. More broadly still, the coalition is concerned that if this tendency were to continue unchecked, Australia would essentially be reduced to becoming dependent upon the importation of overseas science and technology. As a consequence, we would lose all capacity to assume leading edge positions in any market areas. Incidentally, concerns of this type also confirm the Opposition's concern with the demise of public sector support for the creation of a domestic aerospace industry. In this context, I do not believe I am drawing a long bow in submitting that the nation's hopes for enhanced international competitiveness, at both the scientific and economic levels, are closely related to Government willingness to maintain basic scientific research. This lesson has not been lost on the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> Relatedly, we also maintain that one of the surest methods of bridging the gaps between industry and researchers in public institutions would be the recognition by industry of the implicit value of basic, and/or long range research. While it would be hoped that in time domestic companies would come to utilise basic science research and development in the same way as their overseas counterparts, the coalition accepts that this might well be an organic development which will flow on from the expansion of their own closely directed research and development efforts. With respect to the Government's role in generating business enterprise research and development, the Liberal and National parties acknowledge that there is a serious problem in the policy settings which determine the rates of private sector research and development.</PARA>
<PARA> As private sector research and development is financed from company profits, and given the limited cash flows of most of the companies which constitute our manufacturing sector, Government policy exerts an enormous impact upon the level of research and development activity within business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> While the coalition believes that the most beneficial impact on private sector research and development would result from the lowering of domestic interest rates and the implementation of micro-economic reforms to enhance industry profitability, we are nonetheless committed to encouraging research and development directly. The coalition will support the retention of 150 per cent research and development tax concessions to 1991 and, subject to review, will extend it in line with current coalition government policy. Notwithstanding this, we are anxious to reconsider the various other or additional means of generating a higher level still of private sector research and development over time. Specifically, I am interested in identifying the avenues by which we can sponsor greater research and development efforts in relation to adding value to exports from our established resource based industries. Given the sales volumes and the levels of cash flow in these companies, we might anticipate a tangible outcome for the rest of the manufacturing sector if these established industries were to increase their use of research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider it imperative that the matters discussed receive the close attention of the science bureaucracy. While I envisage that this bureaucracy will be overseen by an activist science Minister in the next coalition government to whom, for instance, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation will be accountable, I would prefer to see the existing machinery energised in the pursuit of building a more coherent policy for public sector-led research. This bureaucratic machinery would, if the arrangement proves successful, include the existing Science Council and the Office of the Chief Scientist. The coalition believes care must be taken to ensure that the science policy process is not overtaken by the predominance of departmental input. The cutting issues of science policy must be those identified by the science and technology community itself, and not just the sectarian agendas of particular departments of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, the coalition in government will ensure that the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC), whose role is to provide advice based upon the voice of the Australian science and technology community, would be highly valued in the science policy process. Specifically, ASTEC would be placed on a footing in which it could, with the support of the Science Council and the Science Coordinating Committee, provide comment on Cabinet decisions which impinge upon science related concerns. The Joint Parliamentary Forum, as outlined in the coalition's science policy, would provide supplementary input into this process. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the operation of the Australian Research Council (ARC), the coalition would happily see that those who chair the discipline subcommittees retain their right to be members of the Council itself. Additionally, where departmental reviews of ARC decisions are called for, the coalition will ensure these review mechanisms incorporate representation from the science and technology community. These policy directions are also consistent with the coalition's higher education policies, which are predicated on a decentralised administrative model. In drawing to a conclusion, I hope to have outlined to the House and to the science and technological community the coalition's views on the responsibilities of the public and private sectors in supporting research and development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to discuss productivity in Australian industry. It arises under the appropriations for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Industrial Relations. Recently I read a piece about the apparent decline in the growth of labour and total productivity in Australia. That shocked me somewhat because I was used to the notion that we, as a government, had been somewhat successful in lowering the cost of labour. I assumed that somehow this would mean that there would be a measurable growth in labour productivity and, indeed, in total productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems that, as we measure labour productivity, it is not always so. For instance, there has been a slow-down in the rate of increase in productivity. Productivity is some measure of our ability to compete with other nations and of technological process in our industry. It also takes into account our management practices, our work force practices, our economies of scale, the structures of industries, which we might derive benefit from. All can be measured by productivity. We have done a good job indeed in shifting the return to the two key factors of production-wages and profit-very definitely in the direction of profits in the last couple of years. That in itself has contributed enormously to lifting productivity but it is not the entire question. </PARA>
<PARA> Simply referring to Budget statements, section 2, shows that we have also had a record performance in business investment in the last five years. In terms of shifting the rewards towards profit and increasing the level of investment we should, in a sense, see a return through the productivity of our industries. It is apparent that there has been a shift in the industrialists' minds as labour has become somewhat cheaper. In fact, we have hired more labour. As a measure of productivity against labour it is apparent that labour productivity has declined. There has also been, it seems, some labour hoarding shown and measureable in the economy such that should we hit a decline in output some time next year, we would probably see a fairly quiet shedding of labour which would be an uncomfortable thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, I am trying to paint the general picture that in this country we have still a long way to go on the whole question of the productivity of our work force. I want to raise a particular case, that of Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, which in April was presented to the Economic Planning Advisory Council, which talked about and delivered a paper on productivity in Australia. I thought it was an interesting case study on Tubemakers Structural Products Division (SPD) based in Newcastle. It was here that we saw the Government's entire policy for the steel industry plan plus our ability to negotiate with trade unions that finally brought real rewards in terms of labour productivity and real output and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the steel industry plan, which we introduced in January 1984 and which ran for only four years until late 1988 and is now complete, agreement was reached between Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, unions and the governments to ensure that BHP should invest efficiently but have no retrenchments in its work force with the cooperation of the unions and that a bounty would be paid to BHP customers. One of BHP's customers is Tubemakers and especially the Structural Products Division. The SPD decided to use that money not simply to boost profits, not to take from the Government and return nothing, but to turn itself into a profitable, viable and efficient enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that when we talk about intervention in industry policy in this country it is not a bad thing to intervene. It is what we get at the end that is the critical question. Giving money to the private sector is not a bad thing; it is what we get at the other end that matters. I am impressed by the SPD results. What that organisation did is a very smart notion. At all stages it negotiated with its work force retrenchment packages because it was agreed by both sides that there would have to be a shedding of the labour force in SPD but that all along the way SPD would set itself some targets for productivity. This organisation was very intelligent. It looked at the most efficient producers of comparative products in other countries and then set targets. It looked at a number of sister plants and measured their productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just quickly go through those. For instance, there was a weld stretch reducing mill, which is a particular production process that SPD has. It looked at a sister plant in Japan and on a measure of productivity it discovered that the sister plant produced almost 250 units whereas at this stage in 1982-83 the Newcastle plant was producing only 100 units. The Australians were a long way behind the eight ball. It required a tremendous investment effort in new machinery and an investment in the way in which the managers and the workers worked together to make a more productive work force. The result, with the input of this government assistance and this intelligent communication between management and the work force, was that by December 1988 in this particular weld stretch reducing mill we found that the productivity index for the Australian mill was at about 280 units whereas for the Japanese sister plant in 1988 it was only about 270 units. Not only did we catch up with the Japanese in this particular process but we outproduced them. We are now more efficient than the Japanese in this particular milling process. That deserves some applause in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> A second process called the electric resistance weld mill is another instance where the Australians selected a plant, this time in Finland. The sister plant was producing at about 170 units on the productivity index in 1982 and that improved considerably by 1988 and was producing at nearly 250 units. The Australian plant in 1982 was producing only 100 units but had increased that almost to the level of the Finnish plant, to about 230 units. Again, in terms of looking at the best overseas competitor, we have almost caught up. Finally, the third plant that the SPD looked at was a galvanising plant. It again looked at a Japanese example. The sister plant was producing at about 170 units. In 1982 the Australian plant was producing a little more than half of that, about 100 units. By 1988 the Australians were producing at about 230 units whereas the Japanese, whilst improving their output, were working at about 180 units. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of these sorts of examples where intelligent intervention by the Government can produce the sorts of results that give greater labour and total productivity and a greater return on capital to the investor. This particular example is a fine one which we can use from here on in. I congratulate our Government for being intelligent enough to use this sort of industry intervention process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address matters in relation to the industrial relations section of the Budget, noting that there is $156m worth of expenditure in these areas out of a total budget of $87 billion. I draw the attention of the Committee to the quite remarkable influence of the industrial relations system in Australia and the amount of money spent in this area compared to the outcomes of some of the decisions by the Industrial Relations Commission and the decisions over the years when that former commission operated. This is a time when the focus on industrial relations relates to the pilots, waterfront reforms, the Industrial Relations Commission itself, union membership at 42 per cent of the total work force and in recent days, when the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Congress has been questioning the future of trade unionism. The detailed functions in this area, which handles the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Industrial Registry, have been allocated $63m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that Budget Paper No. 3, where the summary is very relevant to the current state of industrial relations in Australia, states as an objective:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to promote industrial harmony and co-operation and . . . to encourage the organisation of representative bodies of employers and employees and the democratic control of such organisations registered under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>If we think of the problems that we have seen in the last few weeks in relation to the pilots, we do not see those sorts of attitudes being carried out by the Industrial Relations Commission. I would just like to refer to the Australian Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) which was set up in 1975 and in the Budget is projected to spend $8.9m. The report indicates that there have been a greater number of training days in the last year. The number of courses has been increased and the number of participants has increased by 33 per cent. I wonder whether the Government might consider setting up a similar institution for management. I think there should be educational programs for management as well as trade unions. I hope that TUTA will be training trade unionists to bring about a more productive Australia in the 1990s, to change the historic attitudes that have caused some of the fundamental problems facing trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the pilots dispute, which has been going on for 54 days. Claims have been made by the managements of Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia that 50 per cent of their planes would be in the air. I do not see many planes in the air at the moment. As each week goes by 50 per cent of the fleet certainly is not in operation. It is interesting that the whole of the pilots dispute is completely outside the Industrial Relations Commission. It seems to have no control over the outcome of the dispute or anything that is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is paranoid about a wages break-out. He has done everything in his power to try to influence the outcome of this dispute. He well recalls the wages break-out in 1974, when he was the President of the ACTU, and the wages break-out in 1981. He made a contribution to that set of circumstances. It all took place under a centralised wage fixing system. The 30 per cent wage claim by the pilots is obviously not helpful in the centralised wage fixing system. I draw to the attention of this chamber the fact that good pilots are in short supply throughout the world. There is a good market for experienced and safe pilots. They attract high salaries and low tax rates in some of those countries that are seeking pilots to fly very expensive aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have seen in this chamber, the Prime Minister has used every tactic to break the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, which has been looking after the interests of the pilots. It is interesting that an ex-President of the ACTU should endeavour, in the democratic process, to break the union and to use strikebreaking tactics. The pilots, judging from their public statements and personal interviews with one or two of them who have come to see me in my office, have been trying to negotiate an agreement with management outside the system. That is anathema to the Prime Minister because he does not like anyone questioning the centralised wage fixing system. Here we have a reasonably powerful group of people suggesting that they should follow the policies which the Opposition is putting forward and negotiate an agreement with management for suitable wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently there is very little competition in the airlines. That will be changed in 1990; the pilots will be applying their skills, their experience, their capacity and their responsibility for the job in a more competitive environment. It is interesting that the pilots' salaries are a small percentage of the total costs involved in running airlines. All the public comment by the Prime Minister and others about the importance of these salaries is not relevant to the total costs involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission has been powerless in this dispute. It makes a mockery of the centralised wage fixing system that when Mr Justice Maddern eventually tried to get the parties to the negotiating table, he was totally unsuccessful. The airline industry might move to the situation which we now see in Queensland. The South East Queensland Electricity Board now employs its workers on a system of voluntary employment agreements following the strike in that State in 1985. The terms and conditions negotiated by the authority have been incorporated in the last 12 months in the awards of that State, setting up productive conditions and awards and getting away from a very unfortunate and difficult situation where that authority was inefficient and unable to cope with its work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade unions are losing power and muscle in the workplace. Another example of this is the recent Federal Court of Australia decision relating to Troubleshooters Available Inc., which was doing contract work on building sites. It was subjected to harassment and black bans and was forced to close on a number of occasions. The building unions in the building industry objected to contract labour being employed on building sites. But the recent court decision paved the way for the employment of contract labour. The building unions are unable to organise, disrupt or extract unreasonable working conditions with contract labour who are out to do a job efficiently and who are motivated to get the job on a day-by-day basis. That gives the builders a choice of skilled workers and, under the contract system, those skilled workers can often get higher wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Court ruled on the eligibility of Troubleshooters to perform as subcontractors. This has now broken the monopoly of union power in that industry in some areas. The breaking of the power of the Industrial Relations Commission relates to awarding rates of pay, having particular awards and generally controlling the industry. In the last couple of days we heard an outrageous request by building workers on the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) project. They are seeking a site allowance in the re-establishment of the turf on the MCG grounds, where the recent grand final was played, in the hope that they will be able to extract extra money on that site over the next couple of years from that $140m project. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole thrust of recent changes in the industrial relations scene-the Queensland situation, the pilots and Troubleshooters-indicates the way the Government might handle the waterfront. Management might move away from the labour force pool and change the whole attitude on the waterfront. I wonder whether the Prime Minister will take such strong action. Similar situations might arise in the tourist industry, the nursing industry, the teaching profession and the finance industry where salaries and conditions are much more market-oriented and where there is very little influence by the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw the attention of this chamber to the concern of the ACTU Congress that union membership constitutes only 42 per cent of the work force. Only 32 per cent of workers in the private sector are unionised, whereas 68 per cent are unionised in the public sector, where there is no profit motive and no real pressure to perform in a profit sense. Mr Kelty himself said that, unless the trade union movement lifts its game, it will become outdated in the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to rise during this stage of the discussion on Appropriation Bill (No. 1 ) 1989-90 to support the legislation and to make a couple of comments about the development of the Government's industrial relations strategy. I wish to refer particularly to the advances that have been made in the equal opportunity area. I will speak only briefly on those topics because I also intend to pick up some of the points made by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) in his outline of industrial relations in Australia as he sees it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This appropriation continues what is now a six-year program of the Hawke Labor Government to bring both opportunity and democracy into the workplace. I commend the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris) for embarking upon this program. I mentioned in my maiden speech in this place that I felt the principles of industrial democracy and employee involvement were real avenues by which Australia may improve its productivity and achieve a better outcome. I have always believed in the adage that, if one wants to find out how to do something better, one should go and talk to the people who actually do the job. This is something that the management class in Australia has never understood and, on all the evidence placed before me, it still does not understand. One of the reasons we have had such a slow response to the opportunities created by the devaluation is that the management class in Australia still has not learnt how to maximise productivity and opportunity by working properly with its employees. I mention the extent to which this appropriation makes it possible for the Minister to continue down those roads, makes it possible for the Minister to continue the strategy of equal opportunity, to encourage equal opportunity, to encourage the national policy for the education of women and to encourage those ways in which women might be given not only equal opportunities in the workplace but more opportunities in the work place-opportunities such as those made feasible by the national child-care strategy, the national Commonwealth Employment Service strategy and the national women's employment strategy. All those opportunities deserve to be commended and carried on in the work that is built into this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say a few words about the industrial relations strategy as it relates to what the honourable member for Corangamite had to say. He is a nice bloke. He is a good friend of mine but basically he is a gentle farmer. He has never been out in the real world of industrial relations and what he had to say tonight indicated that. (Quorum formed) My colleague the honourable member for Corangamite is a gentle farmer but is pretty dumb on the issues of industrial relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Deputy Chairman. Perhaps it would be better to say that he is lacking in perspicacity. Off he went on a tirade about the pilots. He preached the pilots' industrial relations strategy, this whole direct negotiations and collective bargaining stuff. He trotted out the usual thing and then turned around to rail against the people at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) who want a site allowance for putting down new turf. Here is a different group of people turning around and saying that they want to negotiate directly with their employer for a mud allowance. The honourable member is saying that it is outrageous. We have to get this right. He must understand that he cannot preach one system for one group of people-the highly paid pilots that he supports-and then turn around and say that the system is no good for the mud workers at the MCG. He has to have a policy and get it right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say a little about the industrial relations position with the pilots and the comments that the honourable member for Corangamite had to make. We do support totally a centralised wage fixing system, and we support the accord. The Prime Minister had no option whatsoever but to go out with Bill Kelty and everybody else and support that accord in the face of a 30 per cent wages claim outside the guidelines. If the pilots were smart, if they wanted to put any pressure on the system at all, they would have gone to the Industrial Relations Commission and offered to negotiate within the wage fixing principles and have the settlement tested by the Commission. Until they make that offer they do not even have a leg to stand on anywhere. No amount of preaching on the honourable member's part even makes them relevant. The fact is that only then can they be taken seriously within the wage fixing system. Until they do that they are out of bounds and they stay out of bounds. I wish some of my colleagues had been here to hear how wonderful the South East Queensland Electricity Board (SEQEB) structure now is. The pilots who come to talk to me tell me how disgraceful we are treating them; that we are treating them like the SEQEB was treated by Joh in Queensland. Now the honourable member is wandering in here saying how wonderful the SEQEB is. He is not talking to people who know anything about the caper. He ought to stay on the farm. He has probably never employed anyone on the farm except for himself and the kids. As a result he knows nothing about industrial relations policy or strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very good to see the Minister for Industrial Relations in the chamber. This Appropriation Bill provides for the very substantial continuing of his program of encouraging employee democracy, employee participation, industrial democracy and equal opportunity. All of those very good things which have been brought about under the Hawke Labor Government's expertise in the industrial relations strategy are to be commended. I know that my colleagues in the House tonight fully support me when I say that I support the Bill entirely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Industrial Relations. These are two areas that need to be centre stage in policy to set the Australian economy back onto a sound track. Make no mistake, the Australian economy is in deep trouble. It is a long time since anyone had any inclination to put the Hawke Government up for an award in economic management. The relevant overseas bodies are more into downgrading Australia's international credit rating under this misguided Hawke-Keating Administration. But what is more, despite the favourable gloss the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in particular continually puts on every indicator of the economy going bad-such as that `the massive foreign debt is okay because it is mainly private' or that `imports are not such a problem because they are mostly investment goods, apart from special factors'-the fact is that increasingly the average Australian, the man in the street, knows that the situation is bad.</PARA></TALK.START>

But nothing, be it noted, is offered to hundreds of small businesses around Australia that are being ravaged by this senseless dispute or to the hundreds of ordinary Australians who have suffered harm and cost from the strike. We do not get fixes like this save from a desperate government that has lost control and in which policy has been taken over by expediency dictated by the Hawke Government's election agenda. </PARA>

It moved ahead of our major trading partners in 1982 and has stayed there ever since at a factor of two to four times as great as overseas. Such persistent high inflation is basic to our national economic failure. Related is the vast and unsustainable balance of payments deficit at the all time monthly high of $2.6 billion in August, leading to the relentless build-up in the overseas debt, which imposes a vast burden on this and future generations. There is the very high level of interest rates with home mortgage rates at 17 per cent, as we all know, and short rates of 18 per cent compared with 6 per cent to 7 per cent in West Germany, 5 per cent in Japan and 8 per cent to 9 per cent in the United States.

<PARA> What is central to a sound overall economic policy is precisely where the Hawke-Keating Government has performed worst, namely in combating the array of supply side restrictions to increased national productivity and production. If on the one hand the nation has a problem with too much demand-overheating, as the Treasurer likes to call it-on the other side, the growth of production, especially via increased productivity, is constrained by these supply side factors I have referred to. The supply side difficulty is by far the most important and fundamental problem this nation faces if it is to overcome the external deficit problem and the mounting overseas debt and restore falling living standards. I stress, as I have often done, that there are no quick fixes. To make significant progress is going to be a long haul. Nevertheless, this is where the principal focus of Opposition economic policy is.</PARA>
<PARA> These supply side constraints are, first, inadequate investment in export and import replacement industries, notwithstanding the recent strong levels of investment generally-I concede much touted by the Treasurer. But by and large it is not in the right areas. Notwithstanding the recently restored profit share, the problem in this matter of investment has been what is sometimes referred to as too much `short-termism', inhibiting long term investment of the more productive variety-a preference for shorter term investment induced over the whole course of this Hawke-Keating Government by continuing high inflation, a volatile exchange rate on a generally sinking trend, and higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA> When one looks closely at the investment figures, one finds, notwithstanding all the fine motor vehicle, or textile, clothing and footwear, or even the Kodak industry plans, which are the responsibility of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, a predominance of investment in the non-tradeable area-new office blocks, shopping complexes and the renewing of equipment in businesses not operating in the export or import replacement areas. I believe that the subject is a most important one, but time does not permit any further development.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that investment factor, the main constraints to productivity and production-and, by that token, what is necessary to bring it about-are, first and foremost, fundamental change in the centralised and inflexible wages and industrial relations system, exacerbated as it is by the straitjacket of the accord. It is a thoroughly anti-competitive and anti-productivity increasing system, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's long defence of it in Question Time today. Linked to that are these other requirements of the combating of restrictive work practices generally; reduced government involvement in economic activities and the regulation of business; change for increased productivity, competition and lower protection in a range of industries, including in particular transportation, the wharves, coastal shipping and communications; the privatisation of publicly owned enterprises or parts thereof for greater efficiency; and changes to the tax system, mainly lower taxation overall, to provide more incentive to work, save and invest.</PARA>
<PARA> One has only to spell out these areas of, to use the jargon, micro-economic reform to appreciate why there has been so little progress in these areas under this Government: that is, of course, that by and large it will involve taking on some pretty powerful unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That is the principal constituency of the Australian Labor Party. To put it very bluntly, they will not permit the Government to do anything very effective in these areas. In the privatisation area, it is the left wing of the Labor Party. In the face of this situation, in the election that appears increasingly to be just around the corner, the only option to the Australian people is to change the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak very briefly about Public Service industrial relations. In an address to the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration at the end of August, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morris), who is at the table, warmly praised the quality of the work of Federal public servants. Among the many positive aspects he highlighted, the Minister said that public servants are generally extremely professional, dedicated and hardworking. This is certainly true. Unfortunately, however, there is sometimes a tendency, particularly by Opposition members, to compare public servants unfavourably with private company employees. To do that is ignorant, prejudiced and simplistic. There are efficient and inefficient people in both the public and private sectors. There is no evidence whatever of a systematic difference between them. The reality is that most public servants have a commitment to effective service delivery, to equity of access and to impartiality, all of which are central to the traditions of professional public administration. The Minister's comments were both correct and appropriate, and I strongly endorse them. (Quorum formed)</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that members of the Opposition do not want to go to bed. They know we are going to finish the Budget tonight and are trying to extend the sitting of the Chamber. I was talking about the Public Service and I would now like to go on and welcome wholeheartedly the new $10m middle management training program which the Minister announced in his speech at the end of August. I am delighted with that announcement because it is an outcome of some lobbying that I have been doing on behalf of public servants. That program, administered by the Public Service Commission, will involve conduct of courses aimed at increasing government officers' professionalism with emphasis on the development of Public Service middle manager skills. Individual departments and agencies will tailor training to suit particular needs and functions. That is a practical move because departments vary in their requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The program will also operate through a joint venture established with tertiary institutions and the private sector, the States and the Territories, offering high quality residential courses in public sector management skills. This is the most important of many recent changes introduced by the Hawke Government. The list of worthwhile initiatives is long. It includes equal employment opportunity and industrial democracy programs; the introduction of individual departmental personnel functions; the breakdown of barriers which previously hindered workers' advancement-traditionally women-at the lower level; and job redesign and work reorganisation encompassing multi-skilling, flexibility and staff mobility. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes have made the Australian Public Service both more efficient and more egalitarian. It is very important that Public Service middle managers are equipped to accommodate the changes. With the new structures in place we must now gear everything towards proper implementation. Traditionally there has been an emphasis by the Public Service Commission on training for Senior Executive Service officers but this recently announced program will enhance the development of middle managers' expertise, and that is important. Also, training will be provided for interstate officers. Of course, 70 per cent of Australian public servants are located interstate, so that is significant too.</PARA>
<PARA> Unquestionably, compared with their private sector counterparts, many middle management public servants have not concentrated sufficiently on developing their management skills. For example, a 1986 survey of senior public servants showed that while most senior executives intended to spend about 10 days on training in 1987-which compares favourably with private sector counterparts' training time-in fact their average attendance was only one day. This point is further illustrated by a recent Public Service Commission report showing that for various reasons 44 per cent of the Senior Executive Service did no training in 1988 and 22 per cent did not intend to participate in training in 1989. That is totally inadequate, and if it is allowed to continue, it will undermine the drive towards improved personnel management. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia cannot afford not to invest in training and skills development, which is the key to national industry restructuring in both the private and public sectors. Realistically we will have full productivity from the Hawke Government's reforms only with appropriately trained managers. Undoubtedly there is always room for improvement, but the value of Public Service reform to date cannot be questioned. This Government saw a need for an overhaul in the Commonwealth Public Service-and did it. It saw that changes were necessary in departmental classification structures, in technology and in many other Public Service areas. It implemented changes and has achieved both greater efficiency and greater effectiveness. With these improvements the Public Service will be better able to deliver community programs with the professionalism and humanity which most officers want to achieve. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 in relation to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, I want to address the issue of Australia's continuing problems with quality control and productivity, with particular reference to our manufacturing sector. A recent article in the Bulletin of 29 August this year made these very interesting comments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Inferior goods, irregularity and indifferent shipments have caused no end of worry . . . you are a very satisfied, easy-going race who reckon time is no object. When I spoke to some managers, they informed me that it was impossible to change the habits of national heritage. </PARA>
<PARA>One could be excused for thinking that those remarks were a criticism of Australia in the 1980s; but they are not. They were directed at the Japanese Government in 1915 by two Australian economists. How the tables have turned! Seventy years down the track it is Australia that is being reproached as a classic underachiever, rich in resources and potential but hampered by setbacks and fumbled opportunities, low productivity and turning in a mediocre performance. </PARA>
<PARA> We may indeed be a lucky country-lucky to have enjoyed for so long a standard of living that cannot be regarded as earned by virtue of the amount of effort that we have put in. The `near enough is good enough' mentality that we have enjoyed for too long has crippled our capacity to compete with the products of other countries both here on our domestic markets and abroad in the international arena. The quality of Australian goods and services in too many sectors is simply not good enough. The Foley report-a report of the Committee of Review of Standards, Accreditation and Quality Control and Assurance commissioned by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce in 1987-is one of a number of assessments of standards, quality control and productivity in the Australian manufacturing industry conducted by several bodies. It acknowledges that whilst there are a significant number of Australians who have `established an enviable reputation in international markets for the quality of their products, few issues are of greater importance at the present time than improving the competitiveness of Australian industry'. In April 1984 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We need a change . . . in Australia today. Australian industry has tended to lag behind that of our overseas competitors in recent years and we are overdue to catch up. </PARA>
<PARA>He was right on that occasion, and were he to reiterate the point he would still be right. The view is supported by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. An article entitled Manufacturing Industry Revitalisation  states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australians have been caught napping. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Johnston highlights a tradition of `fair average quality', or FAQ-a terminology well known to older wheat growers-exemplified in `a lack of commitment to excellence in quality at all levels'. Another general manager has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Australians don't understand the need for a reliable and dependable product. </PARA>
<PARA>Until the connection between a highly motivated, efficient and productive work force and national prosperity is widely understood and accepted by greater numbers of Australians, the opportunities for improved achievement by manufacturers and national economic survival will remain elusive. Confrontationist industrial relations tactics, combined with the traditional culture of entitlement and the `she'll be right' attitude, dominate the Australian work ethos. For example, they contribute heavily to the problems faced by our car manufacturers. The very reputable motoring magazine Wheels states:</PARA>
<PARA>Research conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that Australia's motor manufacturing industry, shackled by low levels of automation and high labour turnover rates, has a productivity level barely 50 per cent of that of Japan or the US. </PARA>
<PARA>Extraordinarily high labour force turnover rates and absenteeism are nominated by the industry as the major obstacles in the way of quality control and productivity improvements. Figures of up to 40 per cent annual turnover rates have been quoted. This compares with 3 per cent to 7 per cent turnover rates in other major car making countries, and makes it extraordinarily difficult for manufacturers to cope with the need for training. Until recently one company was putting people on the production line after a mere two hours of training. That company claims much better results because it is now spending three weeks training new employees. It still cannot match the Japanese `500 times' philosophy, whereby a new worker practises his job no less than 500 times before he is actually allowed to bolt a car together. For all that, the industry in Australia is convinced that it can overcome the problems of short production runs and small markets which make it hard to justify large capital investment in robotics and new technology. For it, the big problems relate more to government policies, management and worker attitudes and industrial relations, all of which are interrelated. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most significant impediments to the achievement of improved quality control and improved productivity in the motor vehicle industry lies in the frequency with which employment training schemes are changed, in addition to the multiplicity of training institutions which offer different level courses. Many of these courses are of dubious quality and are not related to the needs of industry. This reflects on the depth and quality of skills possessed by workers in that industry. One senior management official told me that the number of training institutions-he nominated several, including technical and further education and the Institute of Technology-makes stability and uniformity in worker skills very hard to achieve. Another made the point that training institutions are driven by academics rather than by industry people. Yet another blamed the `informers' in our society-including schools and the media-for creating a bias against industry and careers in industry. There is a view that industry is somehow dirty, anti-environmental, not a nice area to be involved in. As a result, many talented people stay away from manufacturing and industry. Yet another manager told me that the `socialist mentality'-to use his terminology-abroad in our community militates against hard work and motivation. He claimed that in his situation too many workers take a sickie or leave their job altogether for quite insubstantial reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of quality control, which follows to a very great degree from these problems, costs a lot of money in lost production, product rejection and lost sales. The cost to our balance of trade is immense. Too many Australians will not buy Australian-made and too many Australians buy imported manufactures. Both of these problems show in our horrendous monthly deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the Government's responsibilities in this matter? I suggest that they actually go way beyond the funding of research and development provided in this Budget. At the highest level what is needed is leadership. We need the sort of leadership in this country which can set a vision and a course and then inspire the Australian people-managers and workers in the manufacturing sector included-to work towards that vision. Instead, we receive a bewildering variety of messages. We are told, `Everything is okay, there is nothing to worry about', when in reality everything is not okay. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Keating) spoke about the past year's investment phase-`the most significant investment phase since Federation', he said. Other qualified commentators are at a loss to know exactly where this investment has taken place. Opinion is divided between suggesting that productive plant and equipment have been acquired, or that we have been merely spending unwisely on imported luxuries. We need more flexible and realistic industrial relations. We need effective restructuring of our awards so that workers can be trained in a variety of skills. This would help overcome the problems posed by high turnover and absenteeism, so that when somebody just does not turn up to do his job, or a substitute is needed, he can be found. Our manufacturing sector needs an economic environment in which it can plan for the future without the fear of sudden lurches in exchange rate or interest rates. Predictability about business environment is of great importance. Without stability in industry there will be a lack of commitment to long term planning and investment. Furthermore, all possible efforts need to be made to encourage workers to upgrade their skills as they seek to compete with highly trained workers in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, an all-embracing national effort is needed desperately to turn around our declining economic performance. Nowhere is that more evident than in our manufacturing sector. That effort must take place giving due emphasis to the funding of research and development, as the honourable member for Gippsland said earlier tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank those honourable members who have participated in the consideration of the estimates for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Industrial Relations this evening. I want to respond to some of the points that have been made, in particular, with respect to the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. Funding has been provided for a number of new measures to increase support for science and technology in the portfolio. These were announced in the May statement, Science and Technology for Australia. The 150 per cent tax incentive for research and development is to be extended for a further two years to June 1993, recognising the long term planning necessary in research and development. The incentive will be phased out, operating at 125 per cent for a further two years to June 1995. The cost to company tax revenue of this measure in 1989-90 is expected to be about $200m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Funding to enhance the strength of the public research sector, which began in March 1989, is to be boosted in this Budget by $15m. Of this, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) will receive $14m for priority programs and equipment. CSIRO will use these increased funds to play a major role in assisting Australia to develop its capacity in the fast-growing, high technology sectors of world trade in which scientific expertise is a critical asset. In addition, a new program of initiatives, to begin in the year 1989-90, at a cost of $800,000 a year, will enhance awareness of the role of science and technology in economic and social development. Following a recent review of Australia's marine industries and marine science and technology capabilities, $700,000 will be provided in 1989-90 for marine science and technology activities. </PARA>
<PARA> A second major initiative has been to boost the Government's investment promotion program by $22.5m over four years, with an additional $3.7m being provided in 1989-90. This is the third year of the investment program which was created to promote overseas investment and collaboration in the manufacturing and traded services sectors. Another major development is the metal-based engineering program costing $15m over four years and $2.5m in 1989-90. This program is designed to speed up the pace of adjustment in the metal-based engineering industry, and aims to encourage firms to internationalise their operations, improve their capacity to export, develop an export culture and assist in the adoption and development of enabling technology. The additional funds I referred to earlier will enable activities to be expanded into new markets and provide additional resources to take better advantage of opportunities in the United States of America and Europe. A feature of this year's program will be intensive promotional campaigns, particularly in industry sectors, and improved coordination and handling of major investment proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in respect of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, I want to refer to the important initiatives taken by the Government in the area of housing. The Government will be providing $15m over the next three years for programs directed at problems of land supply, building regulation, local government approval processes and community acceptance of a greater variety of housing. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the estimates for the Department of Industrial Relations. I heard something of the contribution from the Opposition in respect of the pilots dispute. We have seen an avoidance by the Opposition of the fundamental issue in relation to this dispute which is management of wages policy and management of the economy. In pretty simple language, if one cannot run a wages policy, one cannot run the economy. It is as basic and as simple as that. The Opposition has not got a wages policy. When this dispute began, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) said that the Opposition fully supported the Government. The former Leader of the Opposition took a different view altogether from that of the current Leader of the Opposition. There is a multitude of views across the spectrum from individual members of the Opposition. Simply put, if the pilots had been successful in holding this country to ransom, grabbing a 30 per cent increase in salary and running, there would have been a wages explosion followed by inflation and massive unemployment. That would be a return to the old 1981-82 performance that the Opposition knows so well. We hear constantly from the Opposition the parrot-like call of a `failed accord'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has failed to produce the past performance of the Opposition. It has failed to maintain the record unemployment, the double digit inflation and the high level of industrial disputation that were the hallmarks of the Opposition's performance. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) was a Minister then and a part of those decisions. Certainly the accord has failed to maintain the hallmarks of the Opposition's performance, but the accord has succeeded in restraining wage cost growth, in underpinning the growth of 1 1/2 million new jobs and in bringing stability and improvement to the workplace. What the Opposition cannot, and will not, understand is the role of award restructuring and the substantial productivity improvements that flow from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the report of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Senator Chaney) in the Australian Financial Review today. It reports that the Opposition, having given up on attacking trade unions, has now turned its sights to attacking business. The article in the Financial Review states, `Chaney attacks business on Accord'. Senator Chaney criticises many Australian industries for preferring the present centralised system because it is predictable. There are two things that business needs most of all, and they are stability and predictability, so that they can then plan investment, market development, training and the changes that are necessary to substantially improve productivity. That is what this Government has produced. That is what the accord has been producing for 6 1/2 years. It is what the Opposition cannot produce. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Opposition is now turning to attack business indicates how bereft it is of ideas and policies in respect of industrial relations. It wants a re-run of the same tired old thing-collapse the economy, massive unemployment, screw people down and let her rip. That is not the policy of this Government. The policy this Government has pursued in working with the trade union movement and industry has produced 1 1/2 million new jobs, a 60 per cent fall in industrial disputes, a reduction in inflation from 11 1/2 per cent to 7.6 per cent and a huge and record increase in business investment. The Opposition could not bring about investment. It is one more failure of the Opposition. The Opposition remains in the desert, by itself, battling along. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to raise is in respect of unions, and the number of unions. We hear so much said about unions and the old confrontation policy of the Opposition. There is a provision of $450,000 in the estimates before the Committee for this financial year which will be available to federally registered unions on a case-by-case basis to assist in the process of union amalgamation. I want to underline the point that those funds will be available only if the amalgamation meets the community of interest criteria under the Industrial Relations Act. Above all, the amalgamation must be along industry lines and must contribute substantially to the restructuring effort, the improvement of productivity and the lift in performance of Australian industry. I finish on that positive note. I thank those honourable members who have participated in the debate, and I commend the estimates to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to concentrate my comments tonight on the two areas of tourism and sport which are my portfolio responsibilities. I wish we were debating the estimates tonight in more happy circumstances. It is very difficult to make a contribution in relation to the tourism vote simply because the tourist industry is in such a state of flux that we really do not know what will happen.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to raise the matter of the statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) a little later. The chamber should be aware that there has been a commitment by the Government to provide extra funding for the resurrection of the tourist industry once this dispute is over. I put on record here and now that the Opposition welcomes the initiatives that have been announced by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Tourist Ministers Council that special funds will be allocated to the promotion of Australia overseas, and to the promotion of tourism to the domestic market, to Australians who should be travelling within Australia. The Government and the Opposition in a bipartisan way should work together as hard as they possibly can to try to restore an industry that is bleeding very badly indeed at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) enters the chamber, I must say that most people rejoiced with him when in August he announced to the chamber that tourism had become our biggest export earner, that tourism was our biggest earner of foreign exchange; yet within a matter of days, we were in this state of crisis. That is a great pity because in the last 10 years on both sides of the chamber there has been a bipartisan approach to building the tourist industry into the great industry it is today, an industry that was employing 480,000 people. Significantly, it is the biggest private sector employer and the second biggest employer in Australia after the public service of the Commonwealth, State and local government authorities. The number of jobs that were being created in the industry was immense. In my State of Queensland alone, something like 93,000 new jobs came about through growth in the tourist industry. Now all that is in jeopardy and many of the smaller operators in the tourist industry-the small businesses are really the backbone of that industry-are faced with total and utter devastation. </PARA>
<PARA> While all areas of Australia are suffering from the dispute, some parts of the nation are hurting much more than others. I refer in particular to north Queensland and the Whitsunday islands, the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Tasmania. We will have problems anywhere that the industry is very reliant on domestic air services. I sympathise with the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, who is at the table, in terms of the difficult task that he has at the moment of trying to defend the industry against some of the other actions of the Government. I was really surprised when the Treasurer came out with a statement on 22 September that the pilots as yet were not really damaging the tourist industry. I was also surprised when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was reported in the Australian Financial Review on 14 September as having described the costs to the tourist industry as `transitory and minor' compared with the potentially catastrophic cost to the economy of a wages breakout which destroyed the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> Just after those statements were made I visited Cairns in far north Queensland to find that occupancy rates in hotels were down to 10 per cent and that the bus companies were facing ruin, even to the extent that the flow-on effect was starting to go on to the local distributors and to private industry. I have made this statement before, but I think it is indicative of the real effect tourism can have on the economy of Australia. The week before last in Cairns 100,000 dozen eggs were destroyed; there were no consumers there to eat them. The local orange juice company was fast going to the wall; the consumers were not there. The flow-on effect from this dispute will be an absolute disaster unless the dispute is resolved soon. We may think that the industry has been hurting so far, but we have not seen anything yet because it is only now that so many of those small businesses dependent on cash flow to pay their bills are reaching a situation where the money is just not there. Although some high sounding words have been spoken by the banks and other financial institutions, I have yet to see any evidence that the banks will be particularly generous or helpful in trying to get the tourist industry, especially the small operators within it, into a situation where it can survive. Survive it must because, as I said a little earlier, small businesses are very much the backbone of the tourist industry in Australia. If the situation is bad in Cairns, it is worse in Tasmania where things have virtually shut up completely. In Alice Springs, occupancy rates in hotels are down to 10 per cent and a similar situation exists in Perth. Even in Sydney, with hotel occupancy rates having declined to 30 per cent, we have a disaster on our hands. One can only hope that some commonsense will prevail in this dispute in the next few days and that the parties can get together and get those aircraft back in the air. </PARA>
<PARA> The damage that the pilots have done to the tourist industry in Australia-to a great extent the tourist industry is their bread and butter-has been unbelievable. The airlines are not the knights in shining armour that they are made out to be in some quarters either. In fact, the provisional air services operating at the moment are quite inadequate and do not give much confidence in terms of giving some hope for a regeneration of some of that domestic tourist flow into some of those far-flung regions of Australia. It is all very well for the airlines and the Government to tell us that 50 per cent of capacity is there. I doubt that figure. We would need 157 Boeing 737 aircraft flights per day to handle half the normal capacity. Frankly, that is not there and very few flights are going to Cairns or Alice Springs; not many are going to Darwin or to Western Australia; and the services to Tasmania have proven to be quite inadequate. Until such time as the travelling public has some confidence in the airline system we will have continued difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the travel agents of Australia are small businesses and also presently face difficulties. They are going to the wall very fast indeed because they just cannot sell domestic travel and domestic holiday packages. Most of their domestic activity at the moment is in the form of refunds of tickets and they do not make too much money out of that. To survive, the Australian travel agents are selling overseas packages and overseas holidays that are being offered by the various tour packaging companies as a means of trying to keep their heads above water. Unfortunately, time in this debate is quite limited and I was hoping to spend more time than I have on my other portfolio activity of sport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomed the increase in funding to sport that was announced by the Minister in this year's Budget. However, the sporting community has some concerns as to just how that particular funding will be spent. It also has some concern that very heavy emphasis, perhaps too much, is being placed on the Olympic sports rather than on an examination of the real requirements of sport right down the line. There is no doubt that very few Australian families are not influenced by or do not participate in some form of sport. Government has a role in sport. We should not only promote our elite athletes, but also try to provide as much help as we can down the line. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sports Commission has a real job ahead of it to ensure that the increased funding is spent wisely and well. At this stage we have not yet seen the full budget for the year and there is no game plan in terms of the allocation of that sports funding. I would hope that that would be a major priority, that all members of parliament would be able to find out exactly where that increased funding will be spent. The Opposition's policy on sport is sports for all. That should have bipartisan support in the chamber as well. Let us hope that the Sports Commission and the other bodies involved in sports spending in the next financial year in their wisdom are fair and make the appropriate allocation to all levels of sport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Hollis, I take the opportunity to congratulate you on your exalted position in the chair. It is the first opportunity I have had to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In speaking on the appropriation for the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, I first congratulate the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) and the Government on the 64 per cent increase in the funding of environment programs for the 1989-90 period. Many of these programs are a result of the environmental statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), a truly historic document which contains undertakings to the Australian people to save further degradation of the Australian environment which have never before been made by a Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The major programs include: the 10-year tree program to grow an additional one billion trees by the end of the century; the national strategy to conserve endangered species and their habitats; the protection of the surviving stands of our native vegetation; a coordinated research program on regional climate modelling; and support for the development of national and international responses to the greenhouse problem. These major programs are only some of the many programs funded by the additional $46.1m provided within the departmental budget, which also covers rainforest conservation in Queensland and Tasmania and coastal zone management. </PARA>
<PARA> In my comments on the environmental budget it would be remiss of me if I failed to draw attention also to the initiatives which have been included in the estimates for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, namely, the expansion of the national soil conservation program and the funding package for the south-east forests of New South Wales. In this respect I compliment the Government on its biological resource study which will assess the existing flora and fauna characteristics of the forest and the effect of logging on the survival of species. The study should enable us to understand whether those areas of the National Estate which have previously been cut have degenerated beyond the point of no return. This issue is a matter of great contention between local environmentalists and the forest industry. I certainly hope, given time and patience on both sides, that the study will enable proper scientific management of the south-east forests when the study has been completed in six to 12 months' time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, the New South Wales Government should cease its provocative statements and actions which seem calculated to cause conflict between local conservationists and forest workers. The recent decision to allow limited logging in the National Estate forests, to which the Federal Government has agreed, has in my view jeopardised the development of the forests accord and has unfortunately raised doubts amongst the conservation movement in relation to the Federal Government's assurance that environmental objectives will be given due weight in the consideration of forestry industry demands. The principles on which the proposed forests accord is based need to be strengthened to reflect a greater emphasis on the environmental importance of native forests and the establishment of hardwood plantations as a means of reducing and eventually eliminating dependence on native forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Uranium mining remains a problem. As indicated in the statement of the Prime Minister on the environment, all aspects of the uranium policy are currently under review. As a member of the uranium review committee of the Australian Labor Party I have been most impressed by the fact that an overwhelming number of the submissions we have received have been totally opposed to uranium mining and many have called for a total phase-out of uranium mining. The recent Government decision to operate what amounts to a variable floor price for the sale of Australian uranium bears out what I and others have been saying for several years, and that is that there is an oversupply of uranium on world markets, demand is falling, and obviously these plain economic facts cannot be ignored. Certainly any suggestion that new uranium mines should be opened in Australia, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and others on the Opposition side, is plainly economic madness, apart from the environmental destruction which such mines would cause, particularly in Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also ensure that all environmental protection measures are strictly enforced in relation to the two existing operating mines and ensure that there is full public access to information on the environmental and health implications of uranium mining. In this respect a strengthening of the powers and the responsibilities of the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region is absolutely vital. I had the opportunity earlier in this appropriations debate to draw attention to the fact that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott), the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) and I have put in a joint submission in relation to the changing responsibilities of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. We believe that that office should have more responsibilities and should have the opportunity, for example, to monitor the health of mine workers at Roxby Downs. I hope that will be taken on board when the Government looks at the review documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the greenhouse effect, whilst I have welcomed the initiative proposed by the Government, as mentioned earlier in my speech, it is disappointing that we have not yet adopted the goal of the June 1988 Toronto Conference of a 20 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2005. While the commitment to funds for research is commendable there are many changes that could be immediately implemented to commence the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. (Quorum formed) Obviously the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) is not the least bit interested in the greenhouse effect, otherwise he would not have called a quorum. He has been calling quorums all night. I hope the people who are listening to the proceedings are aware of that fact. I was talking about the important funds for research which have been committed to trying to overcome the greenhouse effect. The Government is to be commended on these things. We have sales tax penalties for energy in efficient electrical equipment and motor vehicles, minimum energy efficiency standards for Commonwealth Government building designs, and a number of other things. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the pressing nature of the more serious environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect, ozone depletion and pollution from sewage outfall, there is an urgent need for enforceable national support standards to be established and implemented as soon as possible. Full support should be given to a vigorous campaign for constitutional change for this to be facilitated. Such a campaign would serve to expose the Opposition's lack of credibility on environmental issues and encourage bipartisan support for a referendum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a very strong commitment to a more deregulated market-driven economy on the one hand and to a more environmentally responsive and sensitive society on the other. Members of the Australian Labor Party have not thought these issues through; they just pick up the slogans from a few of their ideological mates. The fact is that a deregulated market economy is in reality the most effective way of raising the living standards in particular of lower income Australians. Let me go further and say that there is no correlation between environmental responsibility and low or negative rates of growth as is often argued. Some people try to pretend that the only way one will have environmental responsibility is to desecrate the living standards of people. There are no better proponents of that argument than Senator Janine Haines and the Australian Democrats, but there are also people in the Labor Party who hold that view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a completely contrary view and would argue that economic growth simply cannot be sustained if, in the quest for that growth, we desecrate the environment. I see matters completely the obverse of people such as those in the Australian Democrats and the left wing of the Labor Party who think we should destroy growth in order to maintain our environment. Indeed, there is no correlation at all between economic deprivation, lack of economic growth, and care for the environment; quite the reverse. Countries which have very low living standards, negative rates of growth or stagnation are countries which show very little concern for the quality of their environment. I actually think that economic growth strategies will not only be inefficient but also fail if they ignore the environmental costs associated with growth and, perhaps more controversially, fail to allocate those costs to those who are primarily responsible for incurring them. </PARA>
<PARA> First and foremost one could take the example of national income accounts and corporate accounts. The interesting fact relating to national income accounts is that they do not evaluate the decline in the stock of natural capital that takes place through the general process of economic growth. For example, if one has a particular project-it might be a logging project; it might be a mining project-no account is taken in assessing the economic benefit of that project of the long term economic cost to the community of taking down those trees or taking those resources out of the ground. In other words, there is not really a proper cost-benefit analysis done of the economic costs of too many projects, which are in many cases environmentally controversial. </PARA>
<PARA> This can be best expressed, but perhaps most dramatically expressed, by taking the example of the famous Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. That disaster showed up as a positive in the United States national accounts because the economic activity associated with the cost of cleaning up registered as a contribution to economic growth. Whereas if one actually considers--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Holding" NAMEID="CH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr Holding</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ha, ha!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no point in the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories laughing; it is a simple fact of economic reality-not that the Minister has a long record of understanding economic reality-that that activity shows up as a positive contribution to economic growth in the United States. Yet I do not think anybody, with the possible exception of the Minister at the table, would argue that there was a net community benefit flowing from that disaster. In other words, the damage done by the oil spill from the Exxon Valdez is not measured at all in national accounts, whereas the cost of cleaning it up is measured as a positive factor in those national accounts. I very strongly believe that in the years ahead, if we are to be serious in our concern about the environment, we have to take into account the negative costs of environmental damage and offset them against the obvious economic benefits that can accrue to the community from activity that may indeed contribute to damage to the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also important that environmental costs be built into particular projects and particular economic activities. Perhaps one could put that another way by talking about the concept of polluter pays. In the past, if a polluter, be it a particular company, a power utility or an irrigator, caused some damage to the rest of the community, the rest of the community ended up paying the cost of cleaning up that pollution. The New South Wales Government has set an interesting example in the cleaning up of Sydney beaches by imposing some sort of polluter pays charge. If we are serious about the environment we need to consider whether the polluter or the general taxpayer should pay for that damage. If those costs are passed on to the general taxpayer, the overall economic costs of any particular project are ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> One could take the frankly rather controversial example of irrigation. Irrigation brings many positive benefits, as anybody who understands in particular the Murray-Darling system knows and, as I as a South Australian and a member who represents an electorate which borders the River Murray, well know. Substantial benefits have flowed from irrigation in the Murray-Darling system, but it has to be understood that there are also some costs. An enormous amount of money has had to be spent on salinity mitigation projects in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales to rectify a lot of the environmental damage done through the process of irrigation. That is all very well, but the fact is that the broader community, rather than the people who originally caused the environmental damage, ends up paying the costs of that. For example, according to the Industries Assistance Commission, the South Australian Government recovers only 27 per cent of the total cost of supplying irrigation and drainage services. Similar figures apply in both New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about particular projects, particular growth strategies, we need to think of the environmental damage done and the distribution of the costs of that environmental damage. If we allocate those costs where they more reasonably belong, which is to the people who initially incur those costs, we will get more rational economic outcomes than we are currently getting. </PARA>
<PARA> We can also look at the overall efficiency of our economy. The environmental movement argues that the only way of caring for the environment is to introduce a rash of regulations which, as Bryan Gould, one of the leading members of the British Labour Party, described it recently, would lead to a totalitarian society. I tend to agree with that. If we adhered to every single demand of the environmental movement, we would live in a society where free choice was simply eliminated by an overwhelming burden of regulation-obviously not something the Minister at the table would welcome. I think that would undermine our fundamental civil liberties and the sort of society we have come to take for granted over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> As an alternative, we can ensure that costs are properly distributed. At the moment we have a system in our transport industries, for example, where costs are unfairly allocated. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics argues that road transport-it takes the specific example of six-axle semi-trailers-receives a de facto subsidy of about $18,000 per vehicle per annum. In other words, those road transporters which are environmentally unfriendly as compared to rail transport receive a very substantial subsidy compared to our railways. That has the obvious effect of encouraging the use of road transport and discouraging the use of railways. Add to that the fact that our railways have grown up as public sector monopolies with enormous inefficiencies and one can understand that through practices such as overmanning we have made an environmentally friendly form of freight transport inefficient and made environmentally unfriendly forms of transport rather more economically viable. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a good example of inefficient economics contributing to a degraded environment. That is something that as a society we will have to give very serious consideration to overturning in the years ahead. In conclusion, I point out that a rational market based economy is one very important way that we can start cleaning up our environment and ensuring that environmental costs are properly allocated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in his contribution tonight, whilst in his usual way has made some controversial points, has used some sound reasoning on issues to do with the economic balance and environmental factors of a lot of development. There is no question that a number of quarters on this side of the House would agree with him about the polluter pays principle. There would be no debate on that. It is a fundamental principle worth pursuing in whatever way it should be. If we look at the argument as he evolved it, we would have no qualms in agreeing that those who do the damage and those who put in place processes that damage should bear the brunt if in fact through some failure of a system or through an inefficient system there is a form of pollution that has a cost. I do not think there are any disagreements that there needs to be a balance between a proper look at resource usage and a proper use of economic models, as against those other important factors for environment and conservation when we look at a whole host of projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been a trait of tonight's debate during the committee stage of this Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1989-90 that a number of quorums have been called. I understand that that is because of some disquiet on the Opposition's part about Question Time. I think perhaps there should be some disquiet when Opposition members really think about what they were told and what was exposed in Question Time especially on this question of our attitude to the environment. One of the answers from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) illustrated that a balance exists in our continuing economic growth-we have twice the increase in job growth compared with other Western developed nations-whilst at the same time we have a track record in environmental matters that is the envy of many and has been acknowledged by the World Heritage Bureau as being second to none. That is important. This Government has tried to a great extent to balance the appropriate economic factors against its keen desire to ensure that there is proper environmental protection and to ensure that Australia is seen on the international stage as being a nation that has particular regard to conservation-environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to one aspect of the portfolio which we are looking at. Included in the portfolio is a Budget item of $59.8m for the Antarctic Division. Australia has a long history and involvement in Antarctica. It has claims to over 42 per cent of that continent and it has played a prominent role in the development of international cooperation in the way in which we have dealt with the continent. Some of the things that we will be undertaking in the next 12 months in regard to Antarctica are quite exciting. There will be the maiden voyage of the Aurora Australis which will be the first Australian owned and manned flagship to be used by the Antarctic Division and that is an important improvement in our transport plan. There will also be the trialling of an intercontinental Australian-Antarctic air link involving the use of two Royal Australian Air Force Hercules flights. I see that the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), who is the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, is in the chamber. I follow the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), who is the Chairman of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just completed an inquiry into tourism to Antarctica. During that inquiry we heard a lot of evidence from people who have a keen interest in Antarctica, not only scientists who work for the Division but also other institutions which have a keen interest in Antarctica. They indicated that one of the things that slowed down the amount of information that they were able to get out and the amount of study that they were able to do about the continent was the time it takes to travel there. The honourable member for Macquarie and I would have liked a quicker journey to enable us to go to Antarctica with our colleagues from the Committee when the inspections took place to have the full Antarctic experience. By all accounts those who have been to Antarctica say that it is not something which is easily describable. It is something that somebody must experience to fully understand. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important aspect about Australia's attitude to Antarctica which was reinforced in the Prime Minister's statement on the environment Our Country, Our Future is that we have indicated that we are not going to sign the Antarctic Minerals Convention. What is more, throughout the international community we will exert our influence to establish some form of Antarctic wilderness reserve. From the start of this debate this puts us at odds with the majority of the world community. But it is a worthwhile goal that we should continue to pursue because, as I said earlier, the Antarctic is a continent where there has been a degree of international cooperation. I do not think that that has been displayed in any other pursuit on the world stage. It is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to another matter which is of developing importance to the environment-something that I raised in a debate earlier this year on the Arts, Territories and Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 1989-that is, the use of recycled paper. I do so because in that debate I put before the House a notion that had been put at a business seminar in my electorate by an industrialist that the public sector could help the efforts of recycling. It was indicating that by 1992, 20 per cent of stationery and photocopy paper requirements would be supplied in the form of recycled products. At that time I said that perhaps that was not an overly ambitious aim. In the past few months we have seen the way in which a number of departments have decided to use paper that uses recycled fibre. This is quite encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I have a further instance which was just put before me: the latest edition of the Age Pension News put out by the Department of Social Security which is using a product called recycle 80, consisting of 80 per cent of recycled paper and 20 per cent of virgin fibres. The importance of these mixes of 80 per cent recycled fibre, as against 60 per cent and so on, is shown in relation to the difficulties that have been found with the use of some of these papers in different printers. I know that in normal photocopiers and laser printers there is some difficulty in the use of 100 per cent fibre. These are the kinds of products that we need to encourage. They can have some significant effect in diminishing the need to use the dwindling resources of our forests. I think it is quite important for us to pursue those kinds of products, to use them at a greater rate and to increase the economic benefit from their use. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to mention a problem that has arisen in my electorate between the State Government and the Friends of the Merri. At the time of the State election a promise was made that the grasslands of the Merri Creek would be protected. There is now some debate about which tract of land is best and most appropriately protected. There is a great deal of benefit in the notion of a Merri metropolitan park in the suburb of Campbellfield. It has a large tract of temperate native grasslands. In Victoria I think only about 0.1 per cent of native grasslands remains. This is an area in the Merri Creek basin that is worthy of protection on the ground that the flora that it contains should be conserved. It has kangaroo grass, a species which is found in only one other place. Even on the basis of seed production this area is important. Any help that the Federal Government is able to give in the conservation of an area of such significance is important. I have said in other debates that I feel that areas such as Merri Creek are of significance and importance to the urban areas of a large city like Melbourne as a way of giving an example to urban dwellers of what can be seen. Some of the debates that we talk about in this place are perhaps remote, whether they relate to tropical wetlands which people cannot easily access--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I only wish to speak very briefly on these appropriations so far as they affect the environment. I want to make a brief comment with regard to what I believe is the Government's poor track record in responding to reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. It is a matter of stewardship in terms of these particular appropriations and appropriations of a similar nature in the past. Tonight I checked the statement on government responses to committee reports, tabled on 9 May this year, to confirm my own recollection as to whether on key environmental reports by that Committee, of which I happen to be Deputy Chairman, there had been any timely responses by the Government. I am not holding up any past government's record of responding at a great rate. The Fraser Government had a six-month stated response period to reports that had been tabled by committees. When there was a change of government and the Hawke Government came into office, it was changed to a ministerial responsibility to respond to reports within three months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is what the record shows with regard to the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. The report on the protection of the great Daintree forest was presented in August 1984 but as yet there has been no tabled response by the Government. The report on New South Wales heritage properties and Commonwealth-State administrative arrangements was presented in November 1985 but as yet there has been no tabled response by the Government. The report on the Namadgi National Park was presented in October 1986 but as yet no response has been tabled by the Government. The report on fiscal measures and the achievement of environmental objectives was presented in February 1987 and, at last, the Government tabled a response some 22 months later-bearing in mind, of course, its undertaking that there would be a response within three months. The report on the use of ionising radiation was presented in December last year but as yet no response has been tabled by the Government. I also checked on the report of the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, on which I served, presented in this chamber to the Minister in November 1985. As yet no response has been tabled by the Government. I noticed in the commentary in the tabled report in May that of the 50 or more reports that had been tabled in this chamber, only one had been responded to within the allotted time. The majority of those 50 reports have still not been responded to. </PARA>
<PARA> I should note that on one important issue-land degradation; a report that is currently being finalised by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts-the Government has already put forward its response. Unfortunately, it did so before the Committee had finalised and presented its report on the problem. So here we were, issued with references by the Minister to engage in intensive, lengthy trips around the country, public inquiries, public hearings and submissions from all sorts of bodies, and we were getting all this together for the report when the Government announced its strategy. It seems quite odd. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter tonight because it involves wasted committee system resources-resources allocated to the task of bipartisan policy-making on environmental issues. The amount of effort that has been put in by committees probably runs into millions of dollars, and the response rate to date is absolutely disgraceful. I raise this matter because it also casts doubt on the Government's willingness not to politicise environmental issues and it casts doubt on the Government's willingness to examine environmental issues objectively and comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe in the committee system because it is essential to good government and a vigorous and relevant parliament. I believe that the Standing Committee dealing with environmental issues, under the chairmanship of my friend the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), has done good work, often on the less glamorous or topical, but nevertheless important, environmental challenges facing the community. I simply do not understand the unwillingness or neglect involved in the Government's silence on reports by the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, some of which I have already outlined. I urge the Minister to review the relationship between his Department and the committee system with a view to greater responsiveness to outstanding parliamentary reports or reports to be tabled in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I make these comments tonight in view of the fact that we are discussing these appropriations and, as I said earlier, millions of dollars are spent by committees in coming up with outstanding reports in many different areas. It seems a great waste and a great pity that months and even years go by before we get any response from the relevant Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once more I intervene briefly in this debate, especially as the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) is at the table. At a time when the tourist industry is in great difficulty I was absolutely amazed when a document entitled The Future of Tourism-a seminar on the future of tourism for cultural and tourism planners and environmental resource managers, presented by the Commission for the Future, arrived on my desk today. At the time of such difficulties in the industry I find this document quite offensive. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian tourism development has not been invested with future vision. It is in effect being driven by property developers and quick-fix marketing managers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now a feeling that tourism is too important to be left to tourism people. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The growth has been spectacular and paralleling it is a growth in concern about tourism's cultural and environmental impacts. This is particularly so in regard to the environmental degradations of coastal tourism development, the trivialisation of local cultures by the marketing of stereotypes and the creation of `non-places' as tourism destinations, the distortions on development created by the flush of Japanese investment and-</PARA>
<PARA>wait for this one-</PARA>
<PARA>the political corruption that has accompanied rapid and profitable development of property associated with tourism and illegal service industries such as prostitution. </PARA>
<PARA>This is really good stuff. At a time when the tourist industry is bleeding, this crowd, the Commission for the Future, which has to be a fairly doubtful commodity anyway, is coming out with absolute tripe and drivel like this. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell honourable members exactly what will happen at this seminar. Those deeply involved in the tourist industry will not go. There will not be a contribution. The same old mob will glide up, and I have no doubt that a number of motions will be passed absolutely unanimously and they will be sticking it fair into the tourist industry. I could stand here for hours tonight arguing about the contribution that tourism has made. I could stand here for hours and argue about the need for the environmental movement and the tourist industry to work close together. I am a great believer in the proposition that tourism is one of the best promoters of environmental protection that there possibly is. If we go to the Great Barrier Reef and see the tremendous work that has been done by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in association with the industry, we have a fair indication of what can be achieved and has been achieved in the environmental area and what relative benefits we can get for our economy through the right combination of the tourist industry and the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Commission for the Future should be condemned for coming out with this document, with this bodgie seminar and with the drivel that it has written in this document. It is an absolute disgrace. I say to the tourist industry: avoid that seminar like the plague. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable members for their contributions to the debate. My colleague the shadow Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), made some important and legitimate points about the damage done to the tourist industry by the disastrous airline pilots dispute. I share his concern that this dispute should be resolved quickly. Clearly, various parts of Australia have been affected differently. It is true that, for example, certain five-star hotels in Sydney and Melbourne are doing reasonably well. It is true that, in my State of Victoria, certain locations are doing reasonably well because people are travelling internally. It is true equally that, in that same State, where there is a reliance upon international visitors-for example, the world famous penguin parade at Cowes-about 300 people have been stood down as a result of the inability of overseas tourists to get there. Equally it is true that, the further we seem to be away from the major areas of population, Sydney and Melbourne, the worse the impact of this strike seems to be. I share the shadow Minister's view in respect of Cairns, Darwin, Alice Springs, Western Australia and Tasmania. If one is located on an island the impact is so much worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is to be hoped, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said today, that the pilots will come to their senses. I do not know whether at the time they set out on this disastrous course they realised the damage they would do to the tourist industry, to the hundreds of thousands of people employed in that industry and to the hundreds of thousands of small operators in that industry. If they did, it simply compounds the statements made by the Prime Minister condemning this strike as being thoughtless. I have very little sympathy for those people, some of whom are in the trade union movement and some of whom are ex-parliamentarians, who have suggested that somehow or other there is not a primary obligation on the part of the Australian Council of Trade Unions-I believe Bill Kelty and Simon Crean have seen the issue correctly-the major body of trade unions, to represent low income earners. The tourist industry is a major employer of people who can never hope to have the salary range of the pilots. They are the people who have been damaged. They are the people who have been stood down. They are the people whom the pilots seem to have forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this dispute resolves itself quickly. It is important that we also realise that the basic assets of Australia in respect of tourism are still there. The beaches and the environment are still there. Despite the levels of despair that one finds in certain areas of the tourist industry, there is still an enthusiasm present and a confidence in the future. It will be realised that there are difficulties in that. The longer this dreadful dispute goes on, the greater those difficulties will be. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the sense of outrage felt by the shadow Minister in respect of a seminar that has been called, that seminar might have chosen some of the terminology that it did to attract some attention to the discussion that it would hope would take place. The seminar has absolutely nothing to do with my portfolio which was approached, I understand, to provide some funds for the seminar but which did not respond to that invitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the other issues that were raised related to various aspects of the environment. They were arguments about which honourable members could either agree or disagree. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) raised what he saw as a failure to respond to committee reports. I will certainly draw his concerns to the attention of my colleague Senator Richardson. I ask the honourable member to remember that no area of political life in Australia has expanded as dramatically or placed its Minister under so much pressure as the environment portfolio. My colleague seems to move from one set of pressures in one part of Australia to another, almost on a daily basis. I suppose that should not mean that there is neglect in responding to the hard work done by committees. When we have people involved in serious confrontations in forests and various other parts of Australia the heat and division that these issues can create in the community obviously will take up the Minister's time immediately. That is not to say that other items raised by committee reports should not be attended to. I would be happy to draw the honourable member's concerns to the attention of my colleague who I am certain will respond positively. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of my portfolio which is important and which was listed for this debate is the arts. However, it has raised absolutely no critical comment, or any comment whatsoever, from members of the Opposition. I thank them for their silent vote of confidence in the work done by my Department and by the hard working public servants who have served the arts very well in Australia. Perhaps there will be a level of bipartisanship in this area, which will mean that there is at least one area of potential political conflict in this Parliament which does not have to be the subject of continual enjoyment. </PARA>
