<TITLE>Health Care</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that,</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.</PARA>
<PARA> if open not-for-profit health funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably.</PARA>
<PARA> some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to,</PARA>
<PARA> take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Constitutional Reform</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia draws to the attention of the House their conviction that citizens in a democratic society should be able to have a direct say in the laws they are to live under. The citizen initiated referendum, as introduced in Switzerland over 100 years ago and some other countries since, enables a small percentage of voters, by signing a petition, to compel the government to hold a referendum on a law just made by parliament or already in force. If the vote goes against the law, it is automatically repealed. This system has proved outstanding in all the states and countries where it has been adopted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the Committee's report entitled Release of Tyre Safety Inquiry Documents, together with the minutes of proceedings and a letter from the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department to the Secretary of the Committee dated 14 March 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2J4">Mr SAUNDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a small report which deals with a large issue, that is, the reliance one can place on the word of the Parliament. Briefly, on 30 November last year a petition was presented to the House seeking, amongst other things, the publication of the confidential exhibits identified as such in the tyre safety report. This report was presented to the House on 11 September 1980 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. The House referred this matter to the Committee on the same day the petition was presented-on 30 November, the day before the House was due to rise for the summer adjournment. I think there was an expectation in some quarters that the Committee would report within 24 hours. If so, this was an extravagant expectation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The petitioner was a firm of Canberra solicitors acting on behalf of a firm of New South Wales solicitors whose client was claiming damages from the Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Co. (Aust) Ltd for negligence arising out of a motor vehicle accident caused apparently by a blow-out of one of the tyres. The tyre safety report had concluded that one manufacturer had acted irresponsibly in not recalling defective steel belted radial tyres. It is clear that the production of the confidential exhibits was expected to prove the accuracy of this statement and to identify Goodyear as the manufacturer which acted irresponsibly. Obviously, such an inquiry cannot be completed in a day. We wrote to the manufacturers seeking their views on the release of the confidential exhibits. Goodyear informed us that there was no need for the release because the solicitors for the plaintiff and the solicitors for Goodyear had agreed to an out of court settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The petitioner had corresponded with me on the inquiry. I was not informed of the out of court settlement by the petitioner. This is disappointing. It is also discourteous. Those who want the Parliament to take certain decisions have a responsibility to inform the Parliament of changed circumstances which may render unnecessary the initial need for the review. Be that as it may, the Committee decided to report on this reference because the House has not withdrawn the reference and also because there are several important matters of principle that relate to the release of confidential evidence. Our basic task required weighing up the disadvantages of releasing the documents with consequential adverse effects on parliamentary committees, with the advantages as they affect the interests of justice. </PARA>
<PARA> From its deliberations, the Committee advances two general propositions which are applicable to all committees. The first proposition is that there is a strong presumption that evidence taken in camera or documents treated as confidential by parliamentary committees should not be released, and this presumption is related to the effectiveness in the working of parliamentary committees. The purpose of the proposition is to clarify the protection offered to witnesses in standing order 362. The basic reason why protection is afforded to witnesses is for greater effectiveness in the working of parliamentary committees. People with a full knowledge that whatever they say or present will not be used against them will be more forthcoming. This protection is given by taking evidence in camera and treating documents as confidential. </PARA>
<PARA> The second general proposition the Committee advances is that, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, the release of confidential documents when sought or consented to by witnesses does not prejudice the protection of witnesses and, therefore, does not affect adversely the effective working of parliamentary committees. When we apply these two general propositions to the reference from the House, the first holds but the second does not because the tyre manufacturers have objected to the release of their confidential exhibits. </PARA>
<PARA> The first proposition has a strong presumption that confidentiality when given should not be taken away at a later date. There are two other disadvantages associated with the release of some of the confidential exhibits. The first is referred to by Pacific Dunlop Ltd, namely that the 27 March 1980 letter from the Chairman of the Road Safety Committee promised confidentiality as a pre-condition for receiving the statistical information. The second and related matter is that the documents were brought into existence solely for the purpose of the tyre safety inquiry. The information in the exhibits complies closely to the information sought in the March 1980 letter. </PARA>
<PARA> This set of circumstances constitutes a very strong case for the preservation of the confidentiality of certain specified exhibits. When confidentiality is requested and then given, and even more so when it is promised in advance and thus becomes a pre-condition for receiving information, a contract has been entered into between a committee and the provider of the information. Such a contract is not enforceable legally. The Committee holds firmly to the view that the House has a strong moral obligation to protect such a contract. Not to do so, by authorising release of these documents for use in a court, could seriously impair the future effectiveness of the working of parliamentary committees because witnesses could refuse to be forthcoming in what they say or provide, knowing full well that they could be disadvantaged in court proceedings by release of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this the other side of the scale is the interests of justice. The argument is that the plaintiff's case would be assisted and the hearing of the claim adequately conducted if the confidential exhibits were released for use in a court. The conclusion the Committee arrived at was that the need to protect witnesses for the purpose of preserving effectiveness in the working of parliamentary committees outweighed considerably the interests of justice, whether or not court procedures could discover the information required for the plaintiff's case. An appropriate recommendation is made. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) commends the Antarctic Division, and in particular the Antarctic expeditioners whose initiative and enthusiasm contribute to expanding our understanding and scientific knowledge of a unique and vitally important environment; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on the Government to provide the necessary resources to enable the Division to continue its valuable research in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA>I do so because I believe that there is insufficient appreciation by the Australian public of the wonderful work that is undertaken by our expeditioners in the Antarctic. I am fully qualified, I believe, to move the motion because in all the history of our work in the Antarctic over the past 30 or 40 years no other member of parliament has had the opportunity while being a member of parliament to spend the time that I have there. I consider myself to be very lucky. Two years ago I was able to visit Antarctica on the Nella Dan. Because of what is known as the Antarctic factor-that is, the environment is one where anything can happen at any time, particularly weather changes-on that occasion we had a much longer voyage than expected. The whole voyage took seven weeks. I had the opportunity to visit Commonwealth Bay and to inspect Mawson's Hut. We then visited Dumont d'Urville, which is the French base. So I had a chance to see the airstrip which the French were constructing with, I must say, unfortunate disregard for the penguin rookeries which were being disturbed in the process. Nevertheless, the French are continuing with the construction of that airstrip and there has been some confrontation with Greenpeace expeditioners as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> We left Dumont d'Urville and went on to our Casey Base to assist injured expeditioners and I had an opportunity to inspect the Casey Base. We then headed for Bunger Hills to unload some expeditioners for scientific work but, unfortunately, we became beset in the ice. After about eight days we were rescued by the Soviet ship  Mikhail Somov. That of itself was quite an experience. I was fortunate enough to be able to undertake an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio broadcast from the beset ship and I described the ice conditions around us and the icebergs that were gradually moving towards us, fortunately at a slow enough rate that we were able to be rescued before we were crushed. </PARA>
<PARA> We then went on to the Davis Base and were able to inspect that base also. We also attempted to discover the exact position of the South Magnetic Pole. I had the opportunity to take part as research assistant for that work. As I have mentioned, the trip took seven weeks and it was very fascinating. I did not think for one moment that I would have an opportunity to go again two years later. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad that the  Nella Dan grounded on the rocks at Christmas time just over a year ago. Unfortunately, having grounded on the rocks off Macquarie Island, eventually it had to be scuttled. The Nella Dan was a great ship, a wonderful ship, and it is very sad that after 26 years of service with the Division she should end her days in that way. </PARA>

<PARA> Because the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) decided that he would ask the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts to undertake an inquiry into tourism in the Antarctic, I had the opportunity to travel again to the Antarctic, with three other members of the Committee. The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), who is in the chamber, will probably make some mention of that trip because he was one of those members who accompanied me. We had another seven-week trip, but the Antarctic factor intervened again. We had problems trying to supply one of our bases and that delayed our voyage. We had seven weeks during January and February and we had the opportunity to visit the Mawson and Davis bases. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had the opportunity to go to Larsemann Hills, which is not very far from our Davis base. There we found that the Chinese expeditioners were constructing a winter base. The Soviet Union had also enlarged its previous base. On my visit two years ago I had also visited our base at Larsemann Hills, the Law base, and at that time the Soviet Union had not expanded its operations to the extent it has now. We made courtesy visits and talked to the Chinese and Soviet expeditioners as well as our own. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to mention the research work which is undertaken by our expeditioners and by the scientists who are supported by the Antarctic Division in undertaking their work. In this sense, we are involved in a range of research activity, particularly marine biology, glaciology and terrestrial biology and upper atmosphere physics. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to mention all the work that is being undertaken, but I would like to mention that when we were there we had an opportunity to visit one of our special sites of scientific interest with the Assistant Director Science of the Antarctic Division, Dr Patrick Quilty. We had the opportunity to observe the work that was being done with the discovery of marine fossils that are some 3 1/2 million to 4 1/2 million years old. While we were there we participated in the discovery of several fossils, one of which was of a juvenile baleen whale. The fossil was of the whole skull and it was a very exciting discovery for all of us. We certainly wish Dr Quilty well with his further work at Marine Plain.</PARA>
<PARA> We also had further talks with many of the scientists and expeditioners while we were on the sites. In particular, we talked to Dr Stephen Nicol, who is doing work on krill. He pointed out to us how important the krill are because basically the Antarctic is a krill-based ecosystem and animals like the baleen whales, crabeater seals, penguins and many other sea birds depend directly on Antarctic krill for their food. In that respect it is very important for us to understand how the krill live and generally what sort of effects the environment might have on them. It is my main intention, in speaking in this debate, to congratulate the expeditioners on their enthusiasm and on their wonderful work in an area which carries great dangers. I ask those involved-particularly the Minister at the table, who I know agrees with me-to ensure, even when the building program is run down, that the money we are spending in the Antarctic, which is some $50m annually, continues to be used for the very valuable research work that is being done there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the leader of the voyage. There is still a deal of interest and expedition-type involvement in Antarctica. It is one of the few frontiers left to us, apart from space travel. I compare the isolation of the Antarctic with the western end of my electorate, which runs out into the Channel Country and central Australia. That is the type of isolation one experiences when one is in Antarctica. One cannot just ring an ambulance to rush one to hospital, or have other people look after one's problems. One is very much on one's own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to congratulate Des Lake, the leader of our voyage 6 expedition. We formed a subcommittee of the Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts and we looked at tourism in the Antarctic. Personally, I believe that there is unlimited potential for tourism in Antarctica. I do not see why the Australian taxpayer should not be able to make a visit if he or she wishes. As the honourable member for La Trobe mentioned, we spend $50m of taxpayers' good money in Antarctica each year. No doubt that amount will continue to grow. We are three parts of the way through a complete rebuilding program, and I congratulate the people involved, such as the architects, on the magnificent job they have done. They have constructed very substantial buildings which, from what we saw of them, are not going to fall down overnight or get blown away. There are always complaints about design, of course, but overall the people involved have done an excellent job. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the scientists overwinter in the Antarctic. Although the Chairman of my Committee did not like my mentioning it, we were only tourists down there for six weeks and back again. Most of the scientists spend at least 12 months there; they overwinter. Of course, there is no sun throughout the whole of the winter period and the temperature drops to minus 80 degrees. I think the lowest temperature in the world has been recorded in our territory, at minus 89 degrees. I can assure you, Madam Speaker, that it is pretty cold when it gets down to that temperature-even colder than this House sometimes gets. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to thank the crew of the Ice Bird, the ship we charter from a German company. I thank the captain, Eveal, and Roger, the Australian who was on board getting experience because we are to launch a new ship, the Aurora Australis, next year. It will be doing a lot of work that ships such as the Ice Bird are doing now. We still will not own our own ship, which is a great disappointment to me. It was not until I went on the trip that I realised that the Aurora Australis is being leased. It is a pity we do not own our own ship. I also thank the crew and the captain, Eric, of the Lady Franklin, the Canadian ship we lease which brought us home safely. There was a wonderful company of people on board, including the Army personnel who took us ashore, the people who operated and piloted the helicopters-Pip and his people-and of course the press who were there. Tim Bowden used the visit to promote the Antarctic, and I can also recommend that people watch the Beyond 2000 shows. There will be six scientific episodes; the crew was looking specifically at the scientific endeavours we are discussing today. </PARA>
<PARA> We viewed the work being done at both Mawson and Davis. It is important that we continue that work. Obviously the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones), does not need to be told about that need. We do not have to argue with any strength that we need more money for scientific endeavour; no-one is more strongly of that view than he is. It is his colleagues around the Cabinet table who need convincing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In discussing this motion on the Antarctic Division I would like to read from my diary that I kept on our trip to the Antarctic. I feel I am one of the most fortunate people on this earth, having had the experience of visiting one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to in my life. My diary entry for 8 January, on the way down, reads, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rough. 20-30 knot winds. Waves 10 metres high. Boat crashing through. Speed 5 . . . to 8 knots. 60 degrees S 121 degrees west. 11 a.m. . . . Barometer starting to rise . . . Definitely roughest seas I have ever seen. Boat rolling to 30 degrees both ways. </PARA>
<PARA>My entry for Monday, 16 January, notes that:</PARA>
<PARA>we have arrived in Antarctica; we can see the mountains, sticking up at the back of Mawson through 2,000 feet of ice. </PARA>
<PARA>My diary describes the ice sheets, the rivers of blue ice through the cream and the melting white snow pools. There were sky blue pools around the bottom of the mountains where the wind had scoured the mountains. I noted that it was truly magnificent; the weather was fine and dry. I noted also that we held on that day the historic first meeting of a parliamentary committee on the Antarctic continent. We created history when we went down there, on behalf of this Parliament, by holding a committee meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into it too much, but we had some tremendous experiences, and I hope to have time later to relate in this Parliament some of the things I enjoyed and the way they will affect me for the rest of my life. One night there, while some of our members were arguing politics in a hut on the base of the ice plateau, called Platcha Hut, I went for a walk. It was about 12 o'clock at night. The sun was setting. It takes about an hour or so for the sun to set because of the angle of the earth at the South Pole. I spent an hour or two by myself on top of a mountain on the edge of the ice plateau. There was tremendous silence, and a great experience of the cold. The only living things I saw were a few snow petrels flying to their nests. It has left an indelible impression on my mind; I will never forget it. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to my diary entry for Wednesday, 15 February, when we were on the way back. Our location was 49 degrees 40 minutes south and 127 degrees 27 minutes west. It was 2.30 a.m. I saw an aurora. We had been out for about two hours looking for an aurora. This was to me something that left a truly lasting impression. The diary note states:</PARA>
<PARA> 2.40 a.m. I am lying on my bunk still amazed at the aurora. It is hard to describe as it melts into nothing or into ghostly shapes and figures. </PARA>
<PARA>They were all over the top of me. The diary continues:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be one of the greatest sights I have ever seen. In fact the greatest. I think of a passage in the Bible, `God so loved the world'. I can see why he loves it here. </PARA>
<PARA>It was an overwhelmingly impressive and beautiful sight. There were lights coming in from outer space. That aurora is something one cannot photograph; one cannot picture. It is truly amazing. While we were in Antarctica we visited a Chinese base which is being established there. I, on behalf of the people of Dunkley, presented an Australian flag to the Chinese. All the work stopped as we put up the flag and exchanged gifts. It was a quite memorable occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> In the five minutes available to me I wish to talk about something that could change the whole face of Antarctica. The Australian Government is now discussing whether we should sign the minerals convention. I say at the outset that we should not sign it. I will use all the powers that I have as a member of this Parliament, lobbying every member of the Government and the Opposition, to ensure that we do not sign this treaty. I say that we should not sign the treaty because of some of the evidence which has come forward in just the last few weeks. On 5 March, before the oil spill in Alaska, Reuters in New York put out the following report:</PARA>
<PARA> A Government report said improper and careless management of chemical and oil wastes by the oil industry was seriously damaging parts of the Alaskan tundra, the New York Times  reported in its Sunday edition. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The newspaper said the report documents hectares of tundra blackened by chemical spills, oil wastes seeping from drilling pads, stacks of leaking chemical drums and failure to comply with Federal regulations for handling hazardous materials. </PARA>
<PARA>The magazine Time of 3 April 1989 said this:</PARA>
<PARA> It was the kind of ecological disaster that environmentalists had been warning about since oil first began flowing from Alaska's North Slope twelve years ago . . . After taking on 1.2 million bbl. of crude at the Valdez terminal, the southern end of the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the 987-ft tanker Exxon Valdez headed out through Prince William Sound. Manoeuvring to avoid icebergs, the tanker ran into an underwater shoal called Bligh Reef. The vessel's side split open and thick North Slope crude spewed into one of the most pristine bodies of water in the US. </PARA>
<PARA> In the press yesterday, 5 April 1989, an article was headed `Exxon determined to search for Arctic oil'. The oil companies have just ruined thousands of square miles of territory in Alaska. There is a huge oil slick. Thousands of birds and animals are dying, and the oil companies are determined to search for more oil. I ask honourable members to listen to what has been said by one of the oil companies, the main lobbyists pushing the Antarctic Treaty nations to sign the minerals convention. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Exxon Corporation's president said yesterday that he hoped the ``emotional type of atmosphere'' generated by his company's Alaskan oil spill would not prompt Congress to reject the oil industry's request to drill in protected wildlife areas. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> ``I want to tell you how sorry I am that this accident took place,'' Exxon's chairman . . . said . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . since 24 March the accident has been receiving our full attention and will continue to do so.''</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a load of rubbish. All that Esso and the majority of oil companies are doing is pushing to get more areas of the world to explore, exploit and ruin. We in Australia have a great opportunity. I know there is talk within the Cabinet, and I imagine there will be a lot more talk after this speech, to the effect that we should do something about this minerals convention. I firmly believe that we should not sign it. Australia has a great opportunity. If we do not sign it, it does not come into force. We can show to the rest of the world our concern about the environment. We can prove that we can stand up to other signatory nations. The other signatory nations include: Argentina, Belgium, Chile, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be tremendous pressure on Argentina, Chile, Norway and Poland to sign. South Africa will sign. Germany will sign. Japan will sign. The Soviet Union will sign. The United Kingdom will sign. America will sign. But will we? We will have to withstand huge pressure from the United States and the United Kingdom. However, I think we can do it. I would like to think that Australia will stand up to the pressure that will come on us very soon if there is any talk about not signing. </PARA>
<PARA> This minerals convention has been discussed for about eight years. However, I do not think it has all been thought out. Some areas of concern have been raised by many organisations. The convention that we will sign, if we do sign it, will allow mining to take place. If we do not sign it, we can stop it. It is quite simple. We just will not sign. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only a limited liability for damage. If one of the companies, such as Esso or Exxon, finds oil-traces of it have been found already-starts to ship it out in tankers from Prydz Bay, which is in the Davis area that Australia has claimed, and it damages the environment, how much does Esso or Exxon have to pay to rehabilitate this area? They will give us nothing. I am quite certain of it. There is only a limited liability for damage. There is no anti-subsidy clause in the minerals convention; that is, countries with large economies, such as the USSR, America and Japan, could actually subsidise mining there. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia can take a stance. We must stop the signing of this convention and prove to the world that we alone in this particular area are not greedy and avaricious. We can set aside this beautiful continent for other people and for the rest of the world to enjoy for future generations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) notes the development of agribusiness in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on the relevant Government departments in devise strategies to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) control appropriately the activities of agribusiness companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) limit further concentration of ownership of their companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) develop alternatives to agribusiness;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) encourage research to enable farmers to move towards more sustainable agricultural practices; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) provide guidelines for the operation of agribusiness in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I begin by complimenting the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), a man of passionate and deep convictions, on his very important contribution to the debate on the future of Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate concerns agribusiness. The first question to ask is: What is agribusiness? One financial journalist has answered the question in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>Agribusiness can be a seed company, a fertiliser manufacturer, a food processor, a commodity trader, a bank, or it can be all of these things and more at once. </PARA>
<PARA>Agribusiness is a post-World War II phenomenon in the world's food distribution system. It means that big city-based businesses are progressively taking over all aspects of agriculture. Agribusiness companies increasingly are supplying the fuel, the seed, the fertiliser, the farm chemicals, the plant, equipment and machinery and the finance to enable their purchase. Put simply, agribusiness is a few large companies controlling the food market and the farming community. It is important to understand the effects of these developments on rural society and consumers both in the country and in the city. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a 1987 report to the United Nations Bruntland Commission called Food 2000, the criteria prevailing in today's agricultural systems are ecologically blind. The Bruntland Commission believes that it is possible to build a more prosperous, just and secure global future, provided it rests on policies that are both economically and ecologically responsible. The report recommends that farmers should be given incentives to adopt ecologically acceptable forms of maintaining soil fertility and increasing productivity, with the ultimate aim of the development of sustainable agriculture. The report calls for the development of an international code for the sustainable and equitable use of life support systems and for all countries to set up structures to give effect to these goals. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all aware of evidence that in Australia over the past 10 years and longer farmers have been walking off their land and going to cities in very substantial numbers. Between 1964 and 1979 farm costs rose 235 per cent but returns rose only 113 per cent. This year one small orchardist in Tallong estimated that half the orchard income was spent on pesticides. That is of great interest to me because my late father was born and lived the early part of his life on an orchard near Tallong. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is a strong argument that agribusiness has a large responsibility for the huge rise in farm costs and while farmers are getting less for their products agribusiness profits are increasing. For example, during the drought stricken second half of 1982 Elders IXL Ltd lifted its profits by 78 per cent. We should ask ourselves why these huge profits are being made by agribusiness companies at a time of rural downturn. The answer, of course, lies in the market power of a few big companies which are able to dictate to many farmers what they will produce and the prices they will pay for essential items such as seed, fertilisers, pesticides, farm machinery and plant. Forty-three per cent of agrochemicals and pesticides are sold to Australian farmers by four big companies. Similar figures exist for the sale of agricultural machinery and the production of poultry meat. </PARA>
<PARA> The two biggest pastoral companies in Australia, Elders IXL and Dalgety Farmers Ltd, are the brokers for about 80 per cent of wool sold and 60 per cent of livestock. They are also the two largest rural estate agents. The pastoral companies are also effectively banks for many farmers as they advance credit to enable those farmers to purchase from them or their subsidiaries stock, plant, feed, seed and fertilisers as well as land. They get their repayments when the farmer sells his produce either to them or through them at a price. The farmer has little choice, either as a purchaser or a seller. He or she is caught in the cost-price squeeze. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, time does not permit me to give more than one example of agribusiness controls of sections of rural industry, but there are many more. In 1982 chicken processors told their growers that they needed fewer chickens. The growers, who had spent money on equipment and facilities, were geared to supply at least four batches of chickens during the year but they were told that the processors needed and could pay for only three. The growers were not compensated for this loss of output by receiving a higher price per chicken. As one industry spokesman said at the time, the growers lose out badly. Each individual grower often has a huge bank loan, yet during the glut Inghams Enterprises Pty Ltd kept its own growing farms at peak production, leaving the small growers to bear the brunt of the oversupply system. One farmer noted that some growers were on the dole line or lower because they had invested money to build or improve sheds on Inghams' advice or insistence. </PARA>
<PARA> When agribusiness sought to gain control of two well-known farmer cooperatives-Dairy Farmers and Letona-this provoked a fierce resistance from farmers and the following critical editorial from The Land newspaper:</PARA>
<PARA>The battles now being waged for control of two of the State's biggest agricultural cooperatives, Letona and Dairy Farmers, raise important questions for the future of all farm cooperatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Something is radically wrong with a system that enables corporations to gain control of cooperative organisations that were set up specifically to allow farmers to be masters of their own destinies. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporations involved in cooperative takeovers defend their actions on the grounds of bringing more efficiency and expertise to bear on the enterprise in question, but this is not the point. The point is that takeovers remove control of the operation from farmer producers and vest it instead in the boards of directors dedicated to making profits for shareholders by whatever means necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Often that means will not coincide with the best long term interest of farm producers. </PARA>
<PARA>And, I might add, of consumers. Unlike the farmer, agribusinesses are not affected by the natural cycle of good or bad years. They can still make money from fluctuating money prices, capricious markets and even the tempestuous Australian weather. Agribusinesses protect themselves against loss of money by not becoming involved in farm production. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other consequences of the agribusiness phenomenon. The indiscriminate use of chemicals on the farm can directly affect only the health of the farmer in the first instance, but in the longer term the consumer is affected. In handling pesticides and insecticides, farm workers are known to develop aches, cramps, nausea and skin ailments. Further, agribusiness companies put pressure on farmers to buy from them an excessive amount of chemicals, bigger and better machinery, a restricted variety of seeds and money to expand their land holdings. This leads to exhaustive farming practices that in the short term may produce bumper crops but in the longer term reduce the value of the land. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation recently has established that approximately 500,000 hectares of prime wheat land has less than 50 years of productive life remaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important part of agribusiness is its control of people's lives. As one journalist has described it, `Large industrial conglomerates exercise tremendous control over what food is produced and for what price it is sold'. As a member of a responsible Government, I say that we have to face the reality that Australia's rural community is fading fast and has been for a long time, with increasing numbers of people leaving their traditional way of life. Regrettably, city dwellers are often unaware of the incredible pressures many farmers and their families face. We also have to face the reality that control of agricultural activity and food processing now being exerted by agribusiness companies is placing farmers and consumers in a situation where increasingly they have fewer choices. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have a doctrinaire and narrow approach to this question. What I say is that this issue should be placed fairly and squarely on the agenda for public debate in Australia. I believe that the Government, through its requisite activities in various government departments, must play a role in critically evaluating agribusiness in Australia and then respond in turn with appropriate regulation. I conclude by paying tribute to the many community organisations such as Action for World Development which have been doing their best to raise these very important concerns and to place them on the agenda of public debate in Australia. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will second the motion to facilitate its debate. The concluding remarks of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) are important. On the first reading of this motion I suspected that we were going to hear from him a doctrinaire attitude. I am pleased that that was not the response he gave to the motion. The motion has some elements in it that I think need much broader discussion in the community. I am sure that some of the points that I will make in the few minutes that I have will interest the honourable member for Hughes and also other honourable members. Paragraph (e) of the motion, `provide guidelines for the operation of agribusiness in Australia', is being addressed by the Trade Practices Commission in conjunction with the National Farmers Federation. The issue has some tangential relationship to this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue should be looked at in the broadest way. I do not think the motion means that agribusiness is bad; of course it is not. A country such as Australia, which relies so heavily on the development of its agricultural industries, needs to increase its efficiency all the time and its ability not only to address domestic markets but also to be competitive on international markets. Recently there has been much public debate-the debate has yet to take place in this House-on one of our biggest agricultural industries, the wheat industry. We are charting a new direction almost in a bipartisan way as to how we will sell wheat to the rest of the world. The changes that are taking place indicate that Australia, along with the rest of the world, has to develop new ways of supplying food to the world. That is the point we ought to start with.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hughes mentioned a report called Food 2000, commissioned by the Bruntland Commission, the World Commission on Environment and Development. It also prepared a report called Our Common Future. In the final report that has now been issued there is much discussion about how to develop sustainable agricultural policies. That means that we do not take too much out of the ground, thereby exhausting its use for future generations. The report identified many problem areas. Until now all countries have focused on output growth. Subsidies that have stimulated production in the absence of demand have been one of the major causes of the present severe problems in the agricultural world marketing regimes. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the United States in 1980, $US2.7 billion was spent on agricultural subsidies. By 1986 it was $US25.8 billion. In Europe, $6.2 billion was spent in 1976. By 1986 it was $21.5 billion. Those figures have blown out even further in recent years, although now there is a world recognition that the continuation of such levels of subsidies corrupts the international food markets. The disruption of world markets hurts the small producer countries that are particularly reliant on specific crops, such as sugar and rice. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to keep the degradation of the resource base in mind. In recent times in this House we have discussed issues such as global warming and its effects, energy use trends-where do we go-and population pressures. We know that the world population is growing. We have also discussed the issue of production over environment. The issue of the soil resource loss is known to all of us who represent rural electorates in this nation. We need to focus far more attention on it. There is the issue of chemical impact. The honourable member referred to the over-reliance on chemicals. This also leads to the degradation of the resource base. We need to develop alternative methods of using scientific knowledge to enhance agricultural production. The development of pheromone technology by the Chemicals and Polymers Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Melbourne is a good example. </PARA>
<PARA> There are forestry pressures. Brazil has featured in this regard in the electronic media recently. Those who read National Geographic would have seen an interesting article indicating that there are major problems in this area. We need to develop sustainable yield forestry policies like we have in Tasmania, where there is a sensible balance between meeting production needs and future needs. Tasmania is leading the nation in those far-sighted policies. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the global problem of advancing deserts. Honourable members are probably aware that 29 per cent of the land area of this world suffers some form of desertification. That is a major challenge. Some 850 million people try to eke out a living in desert areas. There are major problems. There are challenges for us. The demand for food will increase as population increases. There is no doubt about that. The global food chain needs to increase food production by between 3 and 4 per cent a year. There is the global food security issue and the issue of the reduction of distortions in the structure of the world food market. The shifting focus of food production to food deficient countries, regions and households is the aim. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge of increasing food production to keep pace with demand, while retaining the essential ecological integrity of production systems, is colossal in both its magnitude and its complexity. The challenge for us is how we do it. The basis of the motion before us seems to be that agribusiness works against this. My view is that it need not. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australia has to do in a domestic sense is make sure that our broad agricultural policies are not narrowly focused. Agricultural planning and policies must be broadly based, they must be more interrelated with what is happening in the world. Large agribusiness plays a very positive role. What we must ensure-indeed, many of my colleagues will have seen the global study of the Centre for International Economics-is a movement away from the distortions to the agricultural and food processing sectors that are now so big and prevalent not only in this country but also in the United States and Europe. It is not only the agricultural industry that needs reform; this impinges on bankers, industrialists, the unemployed and broader macro-economic policy. The best prospects for agricultural policy reform lie in groups outside agriculture realising their common interest. The real test is substantially changing the political will of governments to reform bad policies. This Government, as indeed, the Opposition, must exhibit the political will to chart a new course in the development of agricultural policies, but that does not mean that we turn around and put a rope around the feet of agricultural businesses because they are going to be the driving force for the development of our agricultural industries. To distort markets the way we have traditionally I think is a backward step. The question is: How do we bring about this reform?</PARA>
<PARA> I think that the honourable member for Hughes, who just spoke, is a member of the committee examining mergers and takeovers. He would be aware, as I am, having been a member of that committee, of the importance of the Trade Practices Act, the questions of substantial dominance test under section 50, the section 46 test of the misuse of market power and the problems needed to balance out between the competing interests of the development of the concentration of ownership and the need to ensure that there is a continuation of competition because it is through competition that there is a full development of markets. Powerful buyers have emerged and there is vertical integration within the agricultural sectors. That need not necessarily be a bad thing. What we have to do is balance off international economic realities about being able to be of a scale to compete and the need to ensure that concentration of ownership does not genuinely work against proper competition. The processing levels and the oligopolies that have been developing are not all bad, but there are mechanisms-this was the point that I was going to make-for dealing with those problems and trying to reach that proper balance. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Trade Practices Act there is a rural guidelines committee which is chaired by the President of the National Farmers Federation. It has on it George Rance, the Executive Director of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, John Primrose of the Trade Practices Commission, and several others. Their task is to develop a discussion paper with a view to developing rural guidelines that can apply and give some guidance to the Trade Practices Commission and explain how they work between those two competing interests. Interestingly, that discussion document is being released today in Canberra. It is particularly significant that it is being released because it recognises a problem that those on the land realise; that is, that they have an inequality of bargaining power and by the use of mechanisms under the Trade Practices Act, such as the authorisation procedures, there may well be an ability for the countervailing power of producers to be enhanced against the larger companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that those issues need a much broader canvassing. The issue of research needs better canvassing. The special Rural Research Council has been in operation and it has been a great success. It recognises that research is important for the development of agricultural industry. It recognises that the education within the farm sector is important for the development of agricultural industry but, most importantly-and the point that I come back to-no-one who reads this motion ought to think that agribusiness is bad. If we want to be competitive in international markets, we must enhance the opportunities for our businesses to be involved in those international markets and any direction of policy which works against that end works against the very best interests of the farm community and every member of the community in this country. There are ways that we can address the competitive aspects and the imbalance of power that may or may not be in the system. The Trade Practices Commission and the farming community have combined to look at those issues. I think that is something that the honourable member for Hughes, who raised the motion, may not have been aware of. Perhaps he ought to be aware of it. He is now aware of it and I am sure that the Government will make every effort to ensure that everyone gets a fair opportunity to compete on those markets that hopefully in time will be uncorrupted by the unnecessary subsidy policies that are being pursued by some of those with whom we trade which have brought us to the situation where international markets and commodities have unfortunately been corrupted. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it shows the importance of ensuring that Australia is represented vigorously in every trade negotiation area throughout the world. We must put our case strongly, concisely and succinctly at every opportunity. We hear little from the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy), but he can be assured that many of us in this place and elsewhere watch with interest to see what progress he is making to ensure that Australia is treated fairly, because we are trying to treat the rest of the world fairly. We support our agricultural businesses in what they do domestically and internationally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with some of the points raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), but I think it is a fact that the mover of the motion did understand a number of the matters he raised. I want to draw attention to one aspect of agribusiness which I believe has caused great dangers to the future of agriculture throughout the world; that is, the agrochemical industry. It had its origins in the early twentieth century and had become a highly profitable industry by the 1920s. In the United States, production of the chemical industry increased some sevenfold from 1900 to 1939, but the greatest increase of all has occurred since the end of World War II with the annual manufacture of chemicals having increased by more than 900 per cent for the 30-year period between 1947 and 1978. It was during that period that the agricultural use of insecticides, herbicides and commercial fertilisers increased rapidly. The green revolution, as it was termed, representing the large increase of crop yields by the use of capital intensive methods and chemical dependence on synthetic pesticides and herbicides, was enthusiastically adopted by the countries with large agricultural exports, particularly those of the Third World.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The chief exporters of pesticides are the agrochemical companies based in Germany, which has 25 per cent of the market; the United States, which has 20 per cent; the United Kingdom, 15 per cent; Switzerland, 15 per cent; and France some 13 per cent. I am indebted for this information which I received from the book entitled Pills, Pesticides and Profits-the International Trade in Toxic Substances published by North River Press Inc. It provides valuable background information on the growth and activities of the agrochemical industry. Dozens of synthetic pesticides are banned or severely restricted in the producer and other industrialised nations, but these are exported for use in Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Health Organisation has estimated that 5,000 people die and half a million people are poisoned by direct contact with pesticides. In the less developed countries there are virtually no laws or any regulatory structures for the control of pesticide imports and virtually no facilities for monitoring pesticide residues in food or in the environment. Insecticides such as parathion and malathion have caused deaths and illness amongst both animals and humans in Colombia, Egypt and Indonesia. In Ghana, lindane, which is a highly toxic pesticide, was responsible for the deaths of fishermen who did not realise that killing fish with the pesticide would mean death for the people who eventually consumed the fish. Misuse of pesticides and insecticides either for the wrong purposes or because of an incorrect application is frequently a cause of illness and death amongst both animals and humans. </PARA>
<PARA> In the late 1940s dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was introduced as the major tool in the worldwide program to eliminate malaria and the initial consequence was a dramatic reduction in the incidence of malaria throughout the world because of the death of the disease carrying mosquitoes. DDT seemed fairly harmless at first, but over time it became dangerous because of its poisonous long life in the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. In the United States all crop uses of DDT were banned in 1972 and all uses, except in certain emergency conditions, were banned in 1973 on the ground that continued use would pose an unacceptable risk to humans and the environment. However, it is appalling to learn that the pesticide continued to be sold overseas. I quote from the book which I mentioned previously:</PARA>
<PARA> Even assuming that exported pesticides are shipped to Third World countries in properly labelled containers, to purchasers who have been informed of the products' risks, with the knowledge and consent of the purchasers' governments, we cannot conclude that workers in those countries, and residents of the areas where the pesticides will be used, have any protection. Informed consent on the part of the purchaser means little if the purchaser is simply a foreign subsidiary of the producing company. Government knowledge of purchases of banned pesticides is of little value if there is no regulatory capability in the importing country to stop the continued importation or prevent the improper use of those chemicals. All of these problems pertain, to some extent, to Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Labelling requirements, for example, apply only to the container in which a pesticide is shipped. But corporations and farmers in many Third World countries now formulate pesticides-mix the active ingredient, or ``technical ingredient,'' with inert ingredients, emulsifiers, baits, and so on-after the products have reached their destination. Local formulation is a rapidly increasing practice in the developing nations. </PARA>
<PARA> In case we become complacent about the Third World's problems, let me make it quite clear that the problems exist in a very real way here in Australia. That is why I wanted to participate in the present debate. On 27 June 1988 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Four Corners program televised a discussion on pesticide contamination of Australian homes and rural areas. The compere of the program, Andrew Olle, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The chemical villains are the same big four that nearly destroyed Australia's beef industry last year, Dieldrin, Aldrin, Heptachlor and Chlordane. Each member of this deadly quartet has been taken off the market in the United States where authorities suspect a cancer link. Their sensibilities have forced our exporters to change their ways, but the big four are also used to treat hundreds of thousands of Australian homes each year for termites. </PARA>
<PARA>The program went on to describe a number of case studies of Australians on farms, and in some cases urban properties, who had found that they had been physically exposed to organochloride chemical pesticides such as dieldrin, aldrin, heptachlor and chlordane, which had resulted in serious physical defects. These included a sore throat, runny nose, sore eyes, nausea, unsteadiness and disorientation. A reporter made it clear that, despite a new State law which banned organochlorides, it was still possible in Perth to buy with ease a bottle of the pesticide. Paul Barry, one of the reporters, said:</PARA>
<PARA>David and Monica Rado grow potatoes on six hundred acres near Manjimup in Western Australia and they also raise cattle, or they did. Till 1981, they sprayed their potatoes with Dieldrin and from then to 1987, with Heptachlor, in each case to kill the black beetle that attacks the crop. What they didn't know was that when they grazed the cattle on these fields, even years after, the cattle picked up the chemical. Then, when the beef crisis broke last year, they found out. Now, some of the best land in Australia lies idle, a wasteland, and the Rados are not alone. In this area, 100 farms are in quarantine and Australia-wide, the number is nearer 900, and most often the farmers will tell you they used the chemical on official government advice. </PARA>
<PARA> The program ended with Andrew Olle saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Paul Barry, and I must say I found his report pretty depressing to watch. I remember doing a similar story for Four Corners some ten years ago, dealing with some of the very issues Paul just raised, like inadequate screening of chemicals, like their careless application, like the fact that chemical build-up had already forced a number of farms to be quarantined. </PARA>
<PARA>I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House acknowledges the essential role that agricultural and veterinary chemicals have played in the development of agriculture in Australia and condemns the proposed Senate inquiry into agricultural chemicals as prejudicial and alarmist. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion, particularly after the remarks of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton). I think I could be forgiven for presuming that the honourable member for La Trobe was directing his remarks to my, at that stage, unmoved motion. I ought to address in this debate many of the honourable member's emotional comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us set in perspective what has happened in agriculture in Australia. One hundred years ago every farmer across the world fed six people. Every farmer produced enough to feed little more than his own family. Today farmers across the world feed 70 people. The change from one farmer feeding six people to one farmer being able to feed 70 people is one of the incredible steps that have been made progressively, particularly in Australian agriculture. We are all, including the honourable member for La Trobe, conscious of the enormous impact on productivity that chemicals have had in farms and home gardens. We are all aware of the essential role that chemicals have played in making each of us, either as home gardeners or primary producers, able to be more productive. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak with some passion on this subject because of my background in the horticultural industry-an industry which has involved, and still does, a high use of agricultural chemicals. Why is that? It is not because horticulturists are fond of using agricultural chemicals; it is because the market has demanded a product that is unblemished and free from pests and diseases. Let us take as an example changes that have occurred in the last two decades in the horticultural industry, particularly the citrus industry. I well recall, as a teenager, having to help pull tents over every individual citrus tree in order to retain cyanide gas inside that citrus tree and kill the disfiguring pest, red scale. My job was to run along and count out the number of cyanide tablets-they were about the size of a bath plug-which were dropped into a cyanide gun and blown into the tent. That was not awfully good for the local wildlife. Birds caught under the tent would flap and die. If the neighbour's dog happened to wander in, he too faced a similar fate. However, that was standard practice until the development of chemicals such as malathion and parathion, which the honourable member for La Trobe referred to, made it possible for people to do away with fumigation tents and, instead, control red scale with a broad-brush chemical attempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the producers nor the chemical companies were happy with that option because of the impact it had on the environment. So today, as a result of cooperation between the chemical companies and the producers, these broad-based chemicals are no longer used. Instead there is a form of regulated biological control. There is a control mechanism: a little wog known as an aphytis melinus is introduced into the orchard. The aphytis melinus is assisted in its control program by the application of a chemical known as white oil. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who will second my motion and speak to it, will be able to give ample illustrations of his own industry-the sheep industry-and the movement away from broad-based chemicals and total dipping of sheep to the pouring on of chemicals for lice control. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, chemicals in agriculture were arsenic-based compounds. Chemicals such as nicotine sulphate and copper-based fungicides were commonly used. These broad-based killing techniques have now been replaced by chemicals that target specific pests. We can take, for example, codling moth. Once controlled by parathion or malathion, it is now controlled by diseases that specifically target the codling moth. These changes did not just happen. They have occurred because pesticide and chemical companies have been prepared to look for techniques for controlling pests that were more biologically sympathetic than the techniques previously made available. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to develop a new product, the chemical companies are required to put that product through an extensive testing mechanism. Research and development costs chemical companies in Australia at least $23m per annum. It takes at least five years to find a new chemical, get it on to the marketplace and put it through the necessary research and development requirements. A test program, which is laid down legislatively, requires every chemical company to develop what is known as a no observed adverse effect-NOAE-level. When a level is achieved which has no observed adverse affect on a human, it must be taken down 100 times before it becomes the acceptable daily intake. The chemical is not available for use on a crop until the level at which there is no observed adverse effect is taken down 100 times. </PARA>
<PARA> In April of 1987 Professor Ames made a comment about agricultural and veterinary chemicals. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are ingesting in our diet at least 10,000 times more by weight of natural pesticides than of man-made pesticides residues. </PARA>
<PARA>If this is the case, we should ask what is the risk to Australian society of the present application of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for the interjection, one that I will respond to in just a moment. If we regard DDT in food as having a relative cancer risk of one, tap water has a relative cancer risk of three, a peanut butter sandwich a relative cancer risk of 100, a diet cola a relative cancer risk of 200, mushrooms a relative cancer risk of 330 and beer a relative cancer risk of 9,300. I restate the simple fact that this has become a very emotive argument, taken right out of proportion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Consider, for example, the issue raised by the honourable member for La Trobe in his contribution when he said chemicals nearly destroyed the Australian beef industry in 1987. Do honourable members know what really happened in the Australian beef industry? The Australian beef industry, unforgivably maybe, exceeded the minimum intake allowed in the American market by 0.03 parts per million of chemical residue in the beef. I do not excuse that. It is too much. But I wonder whether honourable members know what 0.03 parts per million is in real terms. It is half the length of my forefinger in a journey from my home in Adelaide to Canberra. I could not even roll my car out of the garage, in comparative terms, if we were to put 0.03 parts per million in perspective-less than half my forefinger in a journey from Canberra to Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to set the agricultural and veterinary chemical scene in perspective, let us remember that primary producers around Australia currently spend about $500m per annum on agricultural and veterinary chemicals in order to generate a cost benefit. That cost benefit is hard to ascertain, but it is conservatively estimated at being between $3 billion and $6 billion per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) in an earlier and unrelated debate referred to an orchardist he knew who spent half his income on agricultural chemicals. As an orchardist I found that a little hard to relate to, but I am prepared to take his word for it. It matters not; there is a real cost benefit in what happens for every primary producer currently spending money on agricultural and veterinary chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), who earlier interjected about the number of people dropping dead from the excessive use of agricultural chemicals, might like to ponder for a moment the equally real and uncomfortable truth that only three primary producers in Australia have been killed by unintentional chemical use. They were killed as a result of chemical accidents, the spillage of concentrate or ignorance of what those chemicals would do. Only three people in the group most at risk died as a result of their using chemicals.These are not the consumers of Australian food; these are the people using chemical concentrates. Anyone who is involved, as are the honourable member for Wannon and I, in the application of chemicals, knows that the people using them take a concentrate which may well be a little of concentrated chemical and add it to a spray vat or a dip at a rate of possibly one litre in a thousand. That one litre is a very lethal weapon for people to have in their hands. If they reduced the concentration to one part in 1,000 in the spray vat or the sheep dip, and then sprayed it out, it would still represent a far greater hazard to primary producers than to any consumers of Australian food. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should consider the reality. A primary producer sits on his tractor seat spraying out a chemical reduced from the concentrate of one litre to one in 1,000. He sits all day in a chemical mist and fog. Relatively, if the Australian consumer were then to take the apple or orange off the tree and consume it straightaway, his risk would not be anything like the risk the primary producer is exposed to. The consumer does not consume the food for a minimum time of at least two weeks, which is the specified withholding period. Given all this, and given the fact that even at that level of application so few, if any, primary producers actually suffer and all deaths have been as a result of some form of accidental spillage, we should ask ourselves why the fuss? Why this inquiry into agricultural and veterinary chemicals?</PARA>
<PARA> Coincidentally, my desk diary today, Mr Deputy Speaker, had on it a little notation that said, `It is twice as hard to crush a half-truth as a whole lie'. We have heard a half-truth about the chemical industry which is far harder to destroy than the whole lies that may have been enunciated about other industries. The Australian Democrats in the Senate, determined to curry favour with the limited, unrepresentative electoral group they have, have managed to persuade the Government, as a trade-off for their support of the resource rent tax, to agree to this inquiry. The inquiry runs the risk of being an attack on one of the key elements needed to make our agricultural production more efficient and productive. For the sake of 0.03 parts per million, we have a springboard which will be nothing more than a witch-hunt into the Australian agricultural and veterinary chemical industry. We on this side of the House resist that half-truth. We do not want any primary producer or consumer put at risk, but we see a real risk in that of losing an essential tool that we need to help redress our balance of payments deficit. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me talk about apples. I have before me an article of 5 April 1988 from the Advertiser entitled `Apple sales slump after report on chemical use'. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Apple sales have slumped alarmingly in South Australia following a national television program that suggested an apple spray, Alar, may cause cancer . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Apple industry spokesmen are furious about the report. They have accused the program's producers of scaremongering, and say consumers have been misled with `hysterical nonsense'. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> `The bulk of our growers do not, and never have, used Alar, which is a very expensive chemical,' Mr Lockier said. </PARA>
<PARA>He is the spokesman. That claim may be true. However, the report does not say that apple growers have never used Alar. It simply says the bulk of them have not; some of them are using it. I do not know whether the apples which my wife and I buy at Ritchies, a good store just up the road in Frankston, are sprayed with Alar. The employees at Ritchies do not know; they buy the apples from the market. The apples could come from anywhere. So how do I know what I am eating? I do not. How do I know what my kids are eating? I do not. I have a report from Science magazine. It is called `Pesticides and Kids'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>A new study charges that pesticide residues pose an `intolerable' risk to children-</PARA>
<PARA>this report is of a study from the United States-</PARA>
<PARA>Children are exposed to dangerous levels of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables-residues that may lead to cancer or subtle neurological effects-the Natural Resources Defense Council alleges in a new report. Some 5500 to 6200 children may develop cancer later in life from exposure to just eight pesticides during their preschool years, says the environmental group, which calls the risk `intolerable'. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the report. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The worst offenders are some of the foods that kids like best, including apple juice, applesauce and grapes . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Kids may face a greater risk from pesticide residues for several reasons. First, their exposure is greater because they eat more food relative to their body weight than do adults. And second, they consume far more fruit, on average, which is more likely than other foods to be contaminated with pesticide residues. </PARA>
<PARA> Fruits comprise 34% of a preschooler's diet and just 20% of the mother's diet . . . The average preschooler eats six times more fruit, overall, than an adult woman aged 22 to 30, seven times more apples and applesauce, seven times more grape products, and a whopping 18 times more apple juice . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know about that last figure. This is an American article. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>A handful of pesticides pose the greatest risk . . . Eighty-six to ninety-six per cent of the total cancer risk NRDC calculated can be traced to one pesticide, Alar, and its breakdown product, UDMH . . . </PARA>
<PARA> NRDC also found `unacceptable' exposures to four carcinogenic fungicides: captan, chlorothalonil, folpet, and ethylene thiourea (ETU), a metabolite of the pesticide mancozeb. </PARA>
<PARA>All of these chemicals are used in fairly large volumes on Australian farms. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>At least 3 million kids, or 17% of the sample, are exposed to neurotoxic organophosphate insecticides in amounts that exceed EPA's established safe level, or acceptable daily intake . . . These `intolerable' risks arise, says NRDC, because EPA drastically underestimates preschooler consumption of certain foods and has thus set standards that fail to protect them . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is an American article. I would say that the facts are exactly the same here in Australia. I believe we should have an inquiry. I believe it would be good for the farming community, because it would get farmers to look again at what they are doing and cut down the risk to themselves and their own families. They are the ones who have to work in these conditions. In the city we like the products which come to us, but we do not like them full of insecticides. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when I get outside this chamber, this humble apple will be eaten by me and I will enjoy it, but I will be thinking about Alar, with which it could possibly have been sprayed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seconding this motion I would like to commend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) for his excellent and balanced presentation and the way he put the whole issue into perspective. For too long we have had an emotional scare campaign about agricultural chemicals. Because there have been one or two isolated cases, everyone has been branded as irresponsible. I would be the first to condemn someone who was irresponsible with chemicals. Why, with all the scaremongering going on, do we continue to brand all producers as irresponsible? Why do we continue to put this fear amongst people-fear based partly on ignorance; fear often built by people who have a vested interest in pushing a quite different agenda; and fear which, in most cases, is totally unfounded and out of proportion?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take exception to some of the comments of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). He went to some trouble to put forward a case, but I think he admitted at the end that he would prefer to have his apple free of moths and other insects; free of bacteria--</PARA>

<PARA> As the honourable member for Wakefield pointed out, the hardest thing to argue against is a half truth. When the honourable member for Dunkley started his speech-he went into great lengths about the associated risks-the key word he used was `may'. He said there may be a risk, which may lead to an intolerable risk which may cause all these wonderful statistical analyses about the number of people who could be affected. He said it may; it could. In other words, he was describing a half truth. There may be a problem and I would be the first to support him if there were. In the meantime, however, why go around scaring the living daylights out of children and mothers about things which, if kept in proportion, involve far fewer risks than is believed. What about the risks associated with not eating apples? If children did not have a decent fruit intake, I suggest that they would be much more unhealthy and much more at risk than they are from the causes put forward in the American article which was quoted. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dunkley was quick to read an article quoting a spokesman for Australian apple growers who pointed out that the vast majority of apple growers do not use this particular chemical. I would say that now that the chemical has had some publicity, no growers will use it. Farmers are responsible. Farmers have used chemicals over a number of years for the benefit not only of themselves, but also of consumers and the whole nation. As the member for Wakefield pointed out, in 100 years we have seen an increase in the ability of a farmer to feed people, from six people to 70. By any measure, that is a staggering increase in productivity, which has brought with it a staggering increase in efficiency. So it is not only the farmers but the whole community that benefit. The community benefits from cheaper, fresher and a better range of foods-many of which would not be available were it not for the responsible use of chemicals. We ought to keep this matter in perspective and keep this emotional argument out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the use of chemicals in various livestock industries may present some risk. The fact is that the arsenical dips and so on used in, say, the sheep industry have now been outlawed. In fairness to the people who have used them in the past, it must also be remembered that no-one knew of the problems. It is easy with hindsight to make all sorts of wonderful pronouncements and condemn people, but without the benefit of that hindsight how could anyone condemn people for undertaking what they believed were safe practices. It is time we remembered that. There are many things we do today because we believe they are safe and correct, but in 10, 20 or 30 years' time someone may be able to produce evidence to the contrary. In the meantime, why do we condemn the people who have been doing things in a responsible manner? Let me assure the House that all the farmers I know-I include myself in this-are not keen to use any more chemicals than they have to. We use them in a responsible manner. We follow the instructions on the label and we make sure, if there is a withholding period for livestock or produce, that that withholding period is observed. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other point for the benefit of the honourable members opposite: people in Australia, including I am sure every member of this chamber, are extremely concerned about land degradation, about the erosion of soil throughout the countryside. One of the big advances in farming techniques has come about through what is known as chemical ploughing. With the use of short life herbicides and associated ways and means of eliminating weeds farmers can put in a crop without having to plough fields and rip up the soil, which leads to potential erosion. So the use of chemicals has done something very positive for the Australian countryside and for our land care. We should start to look at the positive side of the chemical industry. We certainly have to use chemicals responsibly, we certainly have to make sure they are properly tested and used in a safe and responsible manner. But having said that, we should not be going around using these half truths to condemn chemicals in an effort to gain political capital when quite clearly the whole nation has benefited to an enormous extent from the sensible, responsible use of chemicals in agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to speak in this debate on agricultural and veterinary chemicals, but the Government does not support the motion put before the House by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and supported by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I make it clear right at the outset that no-one in this Government has ever argued that agricultural and veterinary chemicals are not important-indeed, in some cases essential-to the viability of our agricultural industries. But for the Opposition to say that an inquiry into the use of those chemicals-their efficacy, their economic and environmental impacts and so on-is a scare campaign, that such an inquiry is a witch-hunt, is basically preposterous. It is typical of the Opposition's attitude to so many aspects of Government policy. It is a blinkered approach; it is the view that because something exists at the moment and is used in a certain way it must be right and we must not ever think again, reconsider or evaluate the way in which we use a particular chemical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are suggesting that this Senate inquiry simply examine the use of agricultural chemicals in Australia, to review their use and ensure they are being used in a proper way and are making a significant impact to the benefit of Australian agriculture. To kill this view that there is some witch-hunt or some scare campaign involved in this Senate inquiry, let me read from the terms of reference of the inquiry. The Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia is to inquire into:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the adequacy of arrangements under the legislation relating to agricultural and veterinary chemicals for administration and co-ordination systems for agricultural and veterinary chemicals;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the efficacy of chemical, non-chemical and integrated management systems; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the economic, social and environmental impact on Australia of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and their alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA>If anyone seriously suggests that those terms of reference represent an attack on farmers, an attack on agriculture and an attack on agricultural chemicals, that is nonsense. This is a sensible inquiry established by the Senate to look sensibly, responsibly and rationally at the use of chemicals in agriculture. The Opposition says there is basically no need for this sort of inquiry, but let us have a think about what has occurred in Australia just in recent times. Because of chemical residues we have put at risk our beef industry with export income worth more than $1 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wannon says it is fixed, but the fact is there was a problem with chemical residues; there was misuse of chemicals; and Australia's food reputation was damaged on international markets. Those things are undeniable. The Senate inquiry will be investigating whether there are other cases of misuse which could have a similar impact on Australia. The honourable member for Wannon shakes his head again. It demonstrates this paranoid approach of the Opposition, that the status quo must be maintained at all costs-because something exists now it must be right. All the Senate inquiry will be doing is looking at the use of chemicals to see whether it is good or bad, economic or non-economic and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) mentioned the recent problems with some apple sprays presently in use in the United States, New Zealand, Canada and in fact Australia. In particular he referred to the chemical Alar, as it is known by its trade name. Its chemical name is daminozide. This chemical is under review in New Zealand, and there have been press reports that its use in that country has been banned. I am told that those press reports are not accurate and that some newspaper reports have been quite misleading. The chemical is approved for use in a number of countries-including the United States, New Zealand, Canada and Australia-and there are relevant maximum residue limits in place. Australia has had access to all of the available toxicological data and it will receive reports of studies currently being undertaken. The National Health and Medical Research Council will evaluate that information. At the moment, on the basis of all of the evidence available to the Government, there is no identifiable substantive danger in the use of that chemical. I should say that its full name is metabolite unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, or UDMH. I simplified this for the benefit of honourable members in the House. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the reference of the honourable member for Dunkley to apples, I eat a number of apples and my children, as many children do, drink a fair bit of commercially produced apple juice. While I fully understand and recognise the need for a viable agricultural industry-I am really an economic rationalist-I also have a right as an ordinary consumer, as all consumers do, to believe and understand that the food we eat is as pure as possible. That is the only issue. The Government is not suggesting in any way that through this Senate inquiry there should be some scare campaign or witch-hunt. We are trying to reconcile, on the one hand, the use of chemicals-which I agree in some industries has led to astronomical gains in productivity and which are absolutely essential to agricultural industries-with, on the other hand, the fact that there is a growing concern and awareness in the world that through the use of chemicals and other things in our environment we are poisoning the world's environment. People have a right to expect that their food will be as pure as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pure and safe. That is what is at issue. Government members of the country task force set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have met with members of the Senate Committee. We have represented to that Committee the views of farming organisations and we have made it clear that we do not want the ratbag element, as the Opposition calls it, to dominate the work of that inquiry. We have every confidence that it will not dominate the work of that inquiry and that it is sensible and rational to examine these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), who is in the House, has taken a keen interest in this debate. I was talking to him previously about this issue because he has a deep concern for both the farmers in his electorate and the consumers who eat the food produced by those growers. He reminded me of the damage that has been done in the past through the inappropriate use of agricultural chemicals. He mentioned in particular the use of dieldrin. On hundreds, if not thousands, of acres of land in the Kinglake area of his electorate the soil has been poisoned through the overuse of dieldrin in decades past. That land is so poisoned that it will not be able to be returned to any form of agricultural production for years, if not decades. Some of the chemicals that have been misused in the past-sure, on the best available evidence-are extremely toxic. Dieldrin is one of those. I do not need to remind honourable members that the misuse in the United States of America of the chemicals dieldrin and DDT was responsible for the wholesale eradication of many bird species as a result of their eating the wheat and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to be careful in our use of chemicals. That is not an unreasonable thing to say. It is hardly a scaremongering or a witch-hunt type of statement. We on this side of the House recognise that most farmers-and my parents farm-use chemicals carefully and do not overuse them. But they rely on advice which is provided, and sometimes that is not the best advice available. All we are saying is that there is a commonsense approach behind this Senate inquiry. Let us recognise that agricultural chemicals have been good for agriculture, but let us also recognise that times change and that it is prudent to review the use of those chemicals. If we can make less use of toxic chemicals, I think that is a good thing. That is all that is suggested in this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that we on this side of the House have a strong view about the importance of agriculture to our economy. We fully recognise that agriculture is vital to Australia's future but, as we have already seen from some of the problems that have arisen in the beef industry, there is a need for our export produce to be as pure and as safe as possible. Australia can improve its export markets by developing an international reputation for good, high quality, safe food. There are economic benefits in this for Australia. We are quite sensible about that. We recognise the value of agriculture. We recognise that chemicals have transformed productivity and output in many industries. However, at the same time we want to ensure that chemicals are not overused and that we can monitor their economic, social and environmental impact. That is all the Senate inquiry is doing. We think it makes good sense and we on the Government side of the House strongly support it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the present Government's program to educate the Australian population with regard to AIDS should be redirected more towards preventing the disease through changing lifestyle patterns of risk groups in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first diagnosed a few years ago there has been a general awareness amongst the general public and the scientific community that this is potentially one of the worst diseases ever to afflict mankind. To date over 80,000 people in the United States of America and over 1,200 in Australia have been diagnosed as having AIDS. So far no cure has been found. Everybody who gets the disease dies and the numbers getting it are increasing daily. Some have even likened it to the major plagues of old. However, unlike those plagues, when everyone lived in fear of infection, this is the first plague in history when it appears that most of us can live amongst infected people yet have no fear of catching the disease providing they do not indulge in certain lifestyles, such as male homosexuality, sharing dirty hypodermic needles, and certain types of promiscuity. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I believe that the Australian population is not being told the full story. The information we are being fed is at least partially, if not totally, distorted. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard some tables to which I will speak.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Tables 5, 6 and 7 are from The Lancet of 14 February 1987. I regret to say that the Government and especially the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) are responsible for the situation we are in today. The information being provided through the Government's so-called AIDS education program ignores traditional medical practice and procedures based on sound and conclusive research. This is leading to unnecessary deaths in the community. The Government is substituting a heap of demedicalised nonsense designed to protect the homosexual community from embarrassment or blame rather than facing the medical facts of this disease and getting on top of it in a rigorous, scientifically correct manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian figures for AIDS are up to date as at 25 March of this year. They show that 1,270-odd people have been diagnosed as having AIDS. Of that total, 91.2 per cent, or 1,158 people, are male homosexuals; 6.3 per cent, or 80 people, are intravenous drug users, have been infected through blood transfusions or are haemophiliacs; 1.2 per cent are in an indeterminate category and number 15; and only 1.3 per cent-that is, 17 people out of 1,270-are heterosexuals, and there is even a suggestion that some of these people may have indulged at some stage in anal intercourse. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that these official government figures tell us a number of things. They tell us, first, that we are all at risk but that we are not equally at risk. It is true that, the disease having an incubation period of seven to 10 years, we are seeing only what the infection pattern was many years ago. However, this pattern still holds true today. The incubation period for HIV infection is much shorter. The recent figures for HIV infection patterns, which are provided in the tables I have incorporated, show that there has not been much change. </PARA>
<PARA> The advertisement in which the Grim Reaper-someone who looked like the Treasurer (Mr Keating) dressed up in a shroud-was shown rolling bowling balls down the alley and knocking over a family-type group was quite deceptive. I believe it was false advertising. The more recent advertisement, which shows many couples in bed-I presume they are heterosexual couples-is, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said, absurd. Again, it presents a totally false picture. </PARA>
<PARA> The tables I have incorporated clearly show that the overwhelming number of people infected with this disease are homosexuals. Further, they show that AIDS is not just a homosexual disease: the infection of homosexuals is confined totally to male homosexuals. Not one lesbian in this country has yet been affected with AIDS. All the infected homosexuals are males. This leads one to suspect very strongly, and I will back this up later with evidence provided in the tables, that the disease is transmitted largely through anal intercourse. The heterosexual spread is very low. As I said, only 17 people in Australia have been diagnosed so far. That is about one in one million of the population. The risk is there, of course, that heterosexuals can pick up the disease. We may even see an increase over the years up to possibly even as high a figure as 4 to 5 per cent of the AIDS infected population. But it will still be low in relation to other groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Many innocent people have died so far from this disease. As I said earlier, 80 people have died through blood transfer, such as blood transfusions, et cetera. Fortunately, that has been almost totally corrected. There have been 10 cases where the victims have been less than nine years old. Some of those children, I guess, would have picked it up in utero. Haemophiliacs have died. If one person had died in this country, say, through a uranium accident, we would have 100,000 marching out in the streets. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go into the reason why I believe that the disease is anally transmitted. The virus, of course, has to cross from the donor to the recipient. It has to enter the bloodstream. Anyone with any knowledge of biology will know that the bowel wall is not designed to do what homosexuals do with it. Government members may laugh at this, but it is a very serious matter. The bowel wall consists of very fragile columnar epithelial cells. It is rich in blood vessels. It is not designed to suffer the traumas homosexuals put it through. Thrusting creates little tears in the bowel wall. The bowel wall is unlike the vaginal wall, which is designed to take those sorts of traumas. Thrusting in the bowel wall creates many bleeds, called petechial haemorrhages. This allows the virus more readily to come in contact with the bloodstream. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other technical reasons which enhance infection in the lower bowel, which I will not go into. The bowel is an ideal environment for transmission of the disease. I know that Government members find this particularly funny, and are rolling around in the aisles with laughter; but it is a very serious matter. I would like to talk about some figures which were published in the Lancet in February 1987 and which dissect these sorts of figures further. The Lancet is a very reputable journal. It is possibly close to being the top medical journal in the world. Twelve authors contributed an article from four universities-the University of California, the Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore, the University of Pittsburgh and the Howard Brown Memorial Clinic and Northwestern University in Chicago. The authors took a very large sample of male homosexuals-two and a half thousand. They took the participants' homosexual history for six months before and then they tested them. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who tested sero negative for HIV, which is the virus in the bloodstream, were followed for a further six months and then tested for HIV again. They came up with some amazing figures. Of the 646 who had not practised receptive anal intercourse in the six months leading up to the first test or in the six months previous to the second test but had indulged in other practices, such as insertive anal intercourse and the other things that homosexuals get up to, only three were HIV sero positive. That is one-half of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of those who in that previous 12 months period had not indulged in anal intercourse of any sort whatsoever-there were 220 of those people-not one developed an HIV positive test; that is, zero per cent. But, of those 548 who had indulged in receptive anal intercourse with two or more partners in the six months period before and after the first test, 58 came up positive for HIV. That is 10.6 per cent of that sample. That is an horrific figure. It goes to show to anyone who looks at those figures that, outside of blood transfers such as blood transfusions, the disease is transmitted mainly through anal intercourse and, in particular, receptive anal intercourse. I believe that the Australian population should be told that. </PARA>
<PARA> The article concluded that receptive anal intercourse was the only significant risk factor for sero-conversion to HIV. The risk factor of this happening increased from threefold, for those who had one partner indulging in receptive anal intercourse, up to 18-fold, for those who had five or more partners. In fact, a further breakdown of the figure for those who had been indulging in this practice and reduced their number of partners shows that the number fell to 3.2 per cent testing positive. Of those who had stopped it in the past six months before the second test was done the number who were testing positive had fallen to 1.8 per cent. Those figures, I believe, are just overwhelmingly conclusive. Any fair dinkum, responsible program must stress the hazards of this practice of receptive anal intercourse. </PARA>
<PARA> The article went on to tests of other practices that homosexuals get up to, such as fisting, rimming, dildo use, the use of douches and enemas, and so on. They found that they had little or no effect, with the possible exception of douches and enemas. I guess that that is probably because these later practices remove the protective mucous lining from the bowel wall. It is instructive to look at the lifestyle patterns of homosexual groups, as it shows the urgent need for them to modify their lifestyle habits. Some homosexuals in Australia already have done so, due to the publicity that has been given. But there is still a need for more of these facts to get through so that more homosexuals will be encouraged to change their lifestyle patterns. It was interesting to note that in the last study I quoted, of 2,500 homosexuals, the average age of those who were tested was about 30 years; the average length of time these people had been indulging in these practices of anal sex was about a decade, although some had been doing it for 58 years; and the average number of different partners over the previous six months was 10. It varied from one different partner up to 500 or so. In fact, some had had more than 1,000 different partners over the previous two years. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a higher percentage-64 per cent-amongst those who sero converted to HIV of those having gonorrhoea. There was a higher percentage of those having rectal gonorrhoea. The figure came out at 28 per cent on average. There was even a higher percentage of those showing perianal bleeding during the previous six months. That figure came out at 31 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In another table in that particular article the authors showed that those who had not indulged in receptive anal intercourse for six months before testing numbered 984 and only nine of those sero converted. That is 0.9 per cent; less than one per cent. In other words, it is rare for anyone to sero convert to HIV if they have not been indulging in this practice for the previous six months. In fact, of those nine, six had been indulging in receptive anal intercourse in the six months before that. There was a steady increase in the percentages of those converting to HIV which rose with the number of partners they had been with. In fact, of those who had more than five partners in the previous six months-that particular group numbered 220 people-30 tested positive. That is 13.6 per cent. So, there is a very strong correlation, which cannot be denied, between receptive anal intercourse and those sero testing positive for HIV and also between the number of partners they have had and those sero testing positive. </PARA>
<PARA> On this last point, the Government has been diligent and has put that out in the literature. I commend it for that. I would hope that it would extend that to those other figures. As we know, of those who test positive for HIV, about 35 per cent-the figures vary-will probably go on, in a seven to 10-year incubation period, to test positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Of those, so far, 100 per cent will die, which is very sad. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this information has to be spread not only about the number of partners-which the Government has done-but also about the types of practices homosexuals indulge in, so that these people can have stressed to them the risks that they are taking. We should tell them about the need to abstain from anal intercourse, particularly receptive anal intercourse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's solution to date has been centred around giving the impression that we are all equally at risk. We are all at risk, but not equally. The Government is exhorting people, instead, to use condoms. It has done nothing about changing or attempting to change the lifestyle patterns of the group most at risk in the community. The pamphlet put out by the National Advisory Committee on AIDS asks: `How can I catch AIDS?'. The answer is, `By having unsafe sex. Unsafe sex is having more than one sexual partner and not using condoms'. There is no mention of anal intercourse. The pamphlet asks: `What is safe sex?'. It replies, `Safe sex is having sex with someone who does not use intravenous drugs and share needles and does not have another sex partner'. Again, there is no mention of the crucial factor by which the disease is transmitted. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways Australia has gone condom culture mad. We are advertising condoms on the sides of buses and in pamphlets, some of which are quite inane and offensive. Some pamphlets, such as those put out by the New South Wales AIDS Council, could only be described as pornographic. I have those pamphlets here if honourable members want to look at them. There is no need for this. I believe that we are attacking the AIDS problem at the wrong end. I say that in all sincerity. To recommend condoms only is wrong. That should be a recommendation of last resort. If we look at the figures in Choice magazine of January 1989, we see that, of the 7,000 condoms tested to bursting point, less than 200 failed, just under 3 per cent. But perhaps under anal intercourse conditions a more traumatic stress would be put on condoms. In some tests-not all-up to 10 per cent of females have become pregnant while using condoms, even though females can become pregnant on only four or five days out of an average 28-day cycle. The percentage of homosexuals who use condoms for anal sex who get AIDS could be much higher. </PARA>
<PARA> It is irresponsible of the Government to put so much emphasis on the use of condoms and not mention the dangers of anal sex, particularly receptive anal sex. People are losing their lives because of the Government's program. We have known the facts for a long time. Many tests have been done. The Government is not telling the people the truth. Why are people not being told the facts? Almost no effort is being made to change these people's lifestyles. The Australian National Council on AIDS and the National AIDS Forum seem to be stacked-if one looks through the list-with homosexuals who have a predilection not to convey the correct information. I do not blame all homosexuals, but homosexuals who have this fixed idea seem to be members of these bodies. Even many of the members who are not homosexuals seem to want to be mouthpieces for the line that is being run. I hasten to add that there are some excellent people, too, on this Council and Forum. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be a rush in this country to demedicalise this disease, to save the homosexual lobby from embarrassment and blame, to ensure that homosexuals do not have to change their lifestyles. The experts, the medical people, who want to treat this disease properly and inform the Australian people correctly, in a scientific way, are constantly being overruled. Why is the Government doing this? Why is the Minister doing this? Why would he want to do it? Why is he so sympathetic to the homosexual lobby? Why is he stacking these committees and his advisers, rather than giving out the proper information that I believe the Australian people should be hearing? People are asking what the Government's motive is for doing this when the evidence is overwhelmingly to the contrary of the line the Government is taking. There have even been suggestions that the Government, through the Minister, has moved to suppress stories in the newspapers. I hope that that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite the Minister to explain why the proper AIDS information is not coming through and why there is a cover-up and to refute the claim that he is trying to do this. Until this is done, nobody in this country can have full confidence in the Government's AIDS education program which is so vital to the containment of this disease in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where does one begin after the speech we have just heard? The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) has moved:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the present Government's program to educate the Australian population with regard to AIDS should be redirected more towards preventing the disease through changing lifestyle patterns of risk groups in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was exactly what the Government was trying to do. So many suggestions made by the honourable member opposite were fallacious that I must ask, as I have done: Where does one begin? Let us consider where the disease started, Africa. In Africa it is principally a heterosexual disease, not a homosexual disease. It has come to the Western world as a homosexual disease, but we need to consider that the great risk to the vast majority of Australians, who are heterosexual, as the honourable member so rightly pointed out, is that it can become a heterosexual disease in Australia. The Government needs to consider earnestly its campaign against this disease-this disease for which we only have prevention; we have no cure at this stage-and the way in which that campaign is initiated and developed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important for us to recognise when we are considering diagnosed cases of AIDS, not people who are HIV-positive, that the figures cited by the honourable member opposite reflect the state of play some years ago. The recent trend has been a significant improvement in the figures for homosexuals compared with other groups in the community. I will quote scientific research and evidence to substantiate that. </PARA>
<PARA> One needs to look at what the Government has done. Three objectives are outlined in the Government's Green Paper AIDS: A Time to Care, a Time to Act. The objectives are, firstly, to minimise the transmission of the virus and, secondly, to support, care and treat people infected by the virus. I do not think the honourable member would disagree with that objective; he nods his head. The third objective is to educate and prevent the infection of people who care for HIV-infected individuals. Again, I think the honourable member opposite would agree with that. The objectives are clear. The Government's direction is clear. If we look at the guiding principles we find, under `Education': `Education measures and prevention programs can bring about behavioural change and minimise transmission'. That is what we are trying to do. To suggest that that should be the full direction of the Government's course of action is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> We have tried, and we continue to try, to change people's habits in respect of smoking and alcohol use, but it is a difficult thing to do and it takes time. During that time we have to make sure that the rest of the population are adequately informed so that they do not get involved in high risk behaviour which could lead to the transmission of the disease throughout the rest of the community. I do not like to say `the rest of the community' because we are all part of one community in Australia. In a sense it is everybody's problem and it should be everybody's problem. The alcoholic who is treated in hospital receives the benefit of my taxes, although I may not be an alcoholic or wish to be. We should apply the same standards to someone who suffers from HIV infection, or from any medical condition. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government's program in 1988-89, $11.6m was directed towards community organisations and State and Territory governments on a dollar for dollar basis, including a substantial media campaign. The basis of that campaign is to educate the public so that people understand the problem and the mode of transmission and are able to make an informed choice about their behaviour. There are limited resources for such a campaign. We understand that. So the campaign and the money behind it are specifically directed to high risk groups-the gay community, the bisexual community and intravenous drug users. I accept the information the honourable member opposite has given us. We need to understand that the best way to get to those groups is through community development programs and there is a need for money to be directed there. That has been done and the results are quite pleasing. There has been a significant improvement in the behavioural change amongst those high risk groups. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern, and the concern of many of us on this side of the House, is that there can be a spreading of this disease into other groups in the community whose behaviour is considered less high risk. It is particularly of concern that we have an all-round program-indeed a mosaic-in our response to the AIDS problem and to HIV infection. That is what this Government is trying to do. The suggestion by the honourable member for Parkes that the direction of our campaign is unscientific and that there is some sort of a cover-up is absolute nonsense. I sit on a liaison group for AIDS within this Parliament. Members of both sides of the House are members of that liaison group. We discuss the information openly. Generally in most areas there is a bipartisan view, but what do we find today? We find the honourable member for Parkes, the civil libertarian, saying, `It is okay, we won't have the Australia Card because that will allow the tax avoider, the social security defrauder or the illegal immigrant to get around and do his best. But God forbid what people might want to do in their personal behaviour in the intimacy of their own home, or whatever. The Government should, in some way, control that'. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member opposite had a particular interest in unprotected anal intercourse. In Sydney and Melbourne there has been a significant reduction in that activity amongst gay and bisexual men. Data from the social aspects of prevention of AIDS, study A, show that more than half the men interviewed had reduced their number of sexual partners and sexual contacts and a significant shift was reported towards sexual practices which were promoted as safe. The Sydney AIDS project study of 1,000 homosexual and bisexual men has revealed that the rate of new infections in men in this group has decreased since 1985 from 4 per cent to one per cent. There has been a significant change in the behaviour of the high risk group as a result of our policies and the emphasis that has been given to those groups. The honourable member is saying that we should direct it even more towards them. I am saying that the great concern amongst us is that there is a spillage occurring now and there needs to be amongst the general population, as there always needed to be, a better and greater understanding. I suppose the honourable member would say that the community does not want that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look closely at the NACAIDS study which was commissioned by the Department of Health at the beginning of this proposal. When presented with a problem the first thing that has to be done is that it has to be defined. This study was undertaken with a view to defining what the community's views were. The question was asked as to whether or not people thought it was a good idea that the Government should be involved in a massive educational program. Ninety-nine per cent of the people-we never get 99 per cent in any survey-said that it was a good idea; 97 per cent said it should be aimed at everyone. Ninety-seven per cent of the people said, `We want a program that is aimed at everyone. We want more information; we want to know'. The honourable member for Parkes is suggesting that we should all hide and deny that the problem exists. It is not our problem, it is the problem of those dirty people. When we talk about drug abuse in this country we talk about people whom we do not like using drugs we do not use. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing applies to this problem. It is not right. Ninety-seven per cent of Australians thought that it should be aimed at everybody. Eighty-six per cent had no objection to explicit advertising and the programs, the promotion of the use of condoms and the sorts of things that the honourable member is objecting to. Eighty-four per cent thought that increased sex education for children would help contain the spread of AIDS. These are children in every classroom in Australia, not just those we could perhaps identify who may become deviant or what the honourable member would call deviant. God knows how we are going to identify them. Eighty-four per cent of Australians thought that there should be sex education in our schools and 93 per cent had no objection to including AIDS prevention education in the school curriculum. Maybe it is different in the electorate of Parkes, maybe there is some sort of fascination with sheep, but certainly that is not the case for the vast majority of Australians who take a different view. If we look at further research, it is very interesting to note that there has been a marked increase in condom use and a sharp decline in sexually transmitted diseases and gonorrhoea amongst female prostitutes. This is another high risk group in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The direction of our campaign towards the broader community, with particular emphasis on some of the high risk groups, has been successful and it is increasingly being shown to be successful. I think that we are seeing behavioural change. As I mentioned earlier, it is not an easy thing to introduce. We have tried it in respect of many other health campaigns. It takes time. The most important aspect is that those groups are not alienated and the suggestion that we should be alienating homosexuals is absurd, it is counterproductive and it will not work. But honourable members do not have to take my word for it. Let us look at a leading article in the Medical Journal of Australia of 3 April 1989, which is pretty contemporary. It is not written by someone who is a captive of the gay lobby. Anthony Pinching, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Immunology at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Measures must be taken to outlaw and to prevent discrimination which, quite apart form its personal impact, serves as one of the greatest threats to public health by alienating the very persons whose help is needed to contain the spread of HIV. </PARA>
<PARA>He also suggests that one of the problems in low incidence areas-areas where there is a low incidence of AIDS-is that in actual fact the denial that occurs in those places puts back the cause of spreading information amongst the general population as to the nature of this problem, the nature of the transmission, and the best way we should deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA> An article appeared yesterday in the West Australian newspaper. A report on AIDS cases in Western Australia showed that there has been a 22 per cent fall between 1984 and 1987. It is interesting to note that the suggestion was that the fall in the number of cases of AIDS being diagnosed-that is the AIDS syndrome being diagnosed, that is not HIV positive infected people-is probably as a result of the fact that these people are caring for themselves better as a result of the education program that has been undertaken. But the very concerning evidence, the matter that concerns me most, is that the study found that women made up 7.5 per cent of reported cases in 1987 and heterosexuals made up 5.4 per cent. In 1984 no cases in either group were reported. We find that there has been an increase amongst women and amongst heterosexuals. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not have to be top of the class to realise that what is happening overseas is perhaps five years ahead of what we are seeing in this country, and certainly the things we are seeing in New York. We are finding that 30 per cent of those people presenting with HIV positive infections are intravenous drug users and not homosexuals, and the majority are heterosexual. So the concern clearly is that the disease can infiltrate-if I can use that word-but it is something for the whole community to be concerned about. Clearly we need to care about those people who suffer from the disease and there needs to be constant and vigilant attention paid to that aspect of dealing with this disease. We need to care for those people. We need to be careful about those who care for those who suffer and the prevention methods; we need to look at the law which discriminates in some areas against our preventing transmission; we need to look at the law as it relates to prisons; and we need to look at the law as it relates to intravenous drug use. But, more important than that, people need to know and to be armed with the information so that they can best decide on the sorts of behaviour and patterns of action that they will take. The suggestion that we should all forget about it because we are not affected, we are above it, and we are in some way superior because of our behavioural patterns is a nonsense. It is hypocritical, inaccurate and creates more of a problem than it supposedly solves. Finally, I will quote once again the leading article in the Medical Journal of Australia. Dr Pinching states:</PARA>
<PARA> The initial social responses to AIDS were characterized by an enhancement of the divisions within communities and an increased alienation of the groups that already were regarded as being separate from the mainstream of society. Concepts of national or regional boundaries were reinforced. Individuals looked inwards and talked of `them' and `us'. Attitudes and approaches were painfully parochial. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise today to debate the genuine grievance felt by all pony clubs throughout Australia due to an anomaly in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as amended. Over the past six months my office has been inundated with petitions from pony clubs right around Australia from as far afield as Roebourne and Bunbury in Western Australia, Devonport in Tasmania, Mount Gambier in South Australia, to the far north of Queensland and the Northern Territory, not to mention those pony clubs of Camperdown, Drysdale and Darlington, to name a few, which are within my own electorate. The depth of feeling on this issue is surprisingly widespread and intense; the reason being that currently some 33,000 children and their parents are being discriminated against by virtue of an outdated distinction in the Income Tax Assessment Act. The distinction, which relates to the difference between human and animal sports, originated in 1917 when the then State Premiers, seeking funds to finance their war effort, requested the Treasurer to assist them to end the regime of undesirable galloping, greyhound and trotting proprietary clubs. As a result, all clubs, whether non-profit or proprietary, were subject to tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The application of the principle of mutuality, which applies in the case of pony clubs, recognises that a person's income consists only of moneys derived from sources outside himself. Accordingly, subscriptions, contributions and other receipts from members of the clubs are excluded from the assessable income of each club. However, income from outside investments such as bank account interest, donations from non-members, dividends and shares, et cetera, is assessable. This, in effect, constitutes the present grievance of the Pony Club Association of Australia and its constituent clubs. It will be shown later that the income from such investments is so minimal that it is worth 10 times as much to the individual pony clubs which operate on minimal budgets as it is to the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The present section 23 (g) dealing with the exemptions under the Act was introduced in 1952 following a recommendation from the Spooner Committee. This effectively established the distinction between human and animal sports on the one hand, and sports where human beings are participants on the other-a distinction which has continued since that date despite the rationale for the difference having disappeared long since. A report of the Taxation Review Committee-the Asprey Committee of January 1975-pointed to the difficulty of categorising sports to determine whether or not they come within section 23 (g) of the Act and made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>In any case, all sports provide recreation to participants and spectators, and it has become difficult to draw any distinction, on the basis of degree of commercial activity involved, between the sports in which human beings are the sole participants and other sports . . . The Committee sees some force in the arguments which would support an extension of the exemption of sporting clubs and associations. But it would take the view that questions as to what societies and/or associations should be exempt are matters of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, I ask the House to record this grievance and the following arguments I raise on behalf of the pony clubs throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If the assumption is made that for every child affected that child's parents are similarly affected, we are talking about some 100,000 people throughout Australia, excluding all those involved in the administration of the pony club movement. The simple fact is that these 100,000 people-the children by active participation, the parents by association-are involved in a community service voluntary youth organisation which is healthy, educational, sporting and non-profit making. Membership is restricted to young people under the age of 21 years, but such is the strength and enthusiasm of the movement that many continue their association by assisting the club in administration and/or by instructing young riders. </PARA>
<PARA> The inherent worth of the pony club movement to local communities and society in general is illustrated by the aims and objectives of the movement worldwide. Those aims are: to encourage young people to ride and to learn to enjoy all kinds of sports connected with horses; to provide instruction in riding and horsemanship and instil in members the knowledge for the proper care of their animals; to promote the highest ideals of sportsmanship, citizenship and loyalty, thereby cultivating strength of character and self-discipline in members. If one considers the aims and objectives of similar voluntary youth organisations, such as the scouting movement and the Girl Guides Association, it is apparent that the pony club movement is just as character-building and, like the scouting and guiding movements, it teaches those involved to care for and be attuned to the needs of others-be they other persons or the animals they ride. </PARA>
<PARA> The social benefit and cost advantages of encouraging young people into sporting activities such as this must also be considered. Compare the cost benefit of providing tax exemptions to this group with the millions of dollars spent each year by the Office of Corrective Services, the judiciary, and all the ancillary services which are used to encourage, deter and discipline Australian youth who have not channelled their energies into productive activities such as sporting youth organisations. I suggest it is difficult to be involved with animals, especially horses, without one's finer sensibilities being affected. This is especially the case with growing children. Encouraged and instructed in the right way, this can only lead to a more caring and compassionate human being which in turn can only benefit society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> In an increasingly violent world in which child delinquency is daily increasing, associations such as the pony club movement should be receiving as much encouragement as possible from the Government. It is through the promotion and growth of organisations such as the pony club movement that average Australian children will benefit. I stress the term `average' because the majority of those presently involved in the pony club movement come from middle-income families who have sacrificed their own comfort for the ultimate benefit of their children's development. Indeed, there are many children who fund their own membership of local pony clubs. Taxing such associations serves only to alienate the movement from those who struggle to remain active members despite increasing membership fees. I point out that the clubs are self-funding bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The competitive aspect of the pony club movement is perhaps one of its most important qualities. Gymkhanas, showjumping, horse trials and combined training days provide opportunities for members, often from widely separated areas, to interact, compete and achieve distinction for their skills in horse management. It is a measure of the pony clubs associations success that qualifications obtained in this manner are classed more highly in an educational and employment sense than any similar skills obtained from technical and further education throughout Australia. It should be remembered that some of the world's best Olympic riders, such as the Australian Gold medal winning Roycroft family, began their careers in the pony club movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office has been unable to estimate the annual revenue from the 209 pony clubs throughout Australia. However, unofficial estimates from the Office put the annual revenue of the combined categories of pony clubs, aero clubs, other clubs in the fields of aerobatic, autocycling, driving, equestrian, carting, motor sports, polocrosse, power boats and rodeos at approximately no more than $100,000. Of this the combined revenue from pony clubs is estimated to be less than a quarter of the total. The current revenue according to the Federal Government is therefore minimal and of little consequence. Informal discussion with the Taxation Office leads me to the conclusion that the taxation of pony clubs, apart from being of little financial value, is furthermore a waste of the Office's time and energy. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the exemption section of the Income Tax Assessment Act was amended to include the following clause on behalf of the Victorian Racing Club. Section 23g, subsection 4 reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a society, association or club established for the encouragement or promotion of animal races . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It seems somewhat inequitable and incongruous that the pony club movement should be unable to receive the benefits of the same exemption when the multimillion dollar racing industry in Australia has enjoyed such benefits since 1 July 1985. I repeat that the pony club movement is a non-profit making association, entirely self-funded, with limited access to capital, and consequently is restricted in its ability to raise funds compared to commercial enterprises. Exemption from Federal income tax, including the related costs of compliance, would provide valuable assistance to enable further development of the movement and would be a significant incentive for membership fees to be kept to a minimum. It would enable the continued involvement of as wide a cross-section of the community as possible in the Australian pony club movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, Australians today work in a more aesthetically pleasing environment than was the norm in decades past. As new office blocks, professional offices and factories are designed and erected, consideration is given to such aspects as airconditioning and colour, while even in older buildings staff rooms and facilities are provided to allow workers to break away from the work routine. Although there are very bad patches in the field of occupational health and safety-and this is the case in some areas in Queensland-many employers are now considering these measures. In most States there is legislative backing. Regrettably this is not so in the case of some sheltered workshops for disabled people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over 11,000 Australians with a disability attend sheltered workshops, the majority of whom have mild or moderate intellectual disabilities. There are 313 sheltered workshops funded through the Federal Government's disability services program. Funding is paid to organisations to provide and oversee the workshops. In 1987-88 Queensland was allocated a total of $19,415m for activities under the Federal disabilities services program (DSP). Of this, some $7.470m was provided to the Endeavour Foundation, which is the largest provider of services funded under the DSP in Queensland, accounting for 45 per cent of such services. These services include 24 sheltered workshops and 24 activity therapy centres. The majority of the workshops may enjoy excellent conditions. I know of some which have a reputation for being well run. Some, however, are causing me, and others closely connected with their operation, grave disquiet. </PARA>
<PARA> Sheltered workshops were introduced in 1969 and were expected to provide training for employees to enter competitive employment and long term supported employment, with reasonable rates for employees not likely to succeed in competitive employment. Many disabled people have found the opportunity to work on jobs such as the assembly of small parts far preferable to unemployment and undoubtedly they enjoy the contact with work mates. Carers have also been freer to pursue personal activities. But there is widespread feeling that much more could and should be done to meet the original objectives of the workshops. There has been extensive criticism of the unchallenging and inappropriate nature of the work, the low level of wages paid, poor conditions and lack of access to work opportunities, particularly competitive employment. People with disabilities in sheltered workshops receive from the Department of Social Security a sheltered employment allowance which is paid at the same rate as the invalid pension. They then receive earnings for their 35 hours work. </PARA>
<PARA> Data from the Department of Community Services and Health disability census in 1986, which surveyed service providers, indicates that in 1986 the average wage of sheltered workshop employees was $27.35 per week. Social security data indicates that it was $22.41 per week at 1 April 1988. But I am informed that in the Northgate workshop within my electorate disabled people working 35 hours a week were receiving $4, which has now been raised to $8 per week. While disabled people are receiving such a pittance for 35 hours work, a blot exists on Australian society. This takes away a person's dignity. Some disabled people would wish for calm repetitive work, using only their hands, and they should be able to choose this. Others need more stimulation to bring their potential up to optimum and thus lead a satisfying life. No-one should be required to change. But my information suggests that there are many who would welcome the change and who feel locked away from society in appalling conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Northgate sheltered workshop run by the Endeavour Foundation, it was discovered some months ago that the disease hepatitis B was present among workers and staff. Staff members advised the management of the presence of the disease and informed them that at least three of the disabled workers were carriers of the virus. Staff at the workshop made repeated requests for vaccination serum to stop further contraction, but after five months no action was taken and it was only after staff met with the Miscellaneous Workers Union that serum was provided. There is a cost factor involved, but so are people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Following a meeting with representatives of the foundation, workshop staff, union officials and officials of the Department of Community Services and Health which funds the Foundation, I was reassured that steps would be taken to rectify this situation. I was left with the impression that decisive action would be taken. I was therefore very disturbed when I realised a week later that the management did not intend to offer a screening process to the clientele to see if any others were unfortunate enough to have the disease. A brief note was sent to parents or guardians of the workers, providing brief information on what they or their parents could do to safeguard their own health. This is not the action I expected of people who hold the privilege and special positions of trust as providers of services aimed to assist disabled people. I felt seriously let down. Surely personal interviews should be held to outline clearly the risk of hepatitis B and the people should be covered. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to outline other serious allegations made to me, clearly and concisely, because people who are already coping with a dis- ability and those providers who are doing the right thing need all of the support that they can get. I will not quote names as I wish to protect the privacy of identities, but each allegation has been put to me directly by the disabled people affected, by parents and by workers; and they are very anxious that these matters be looked into. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the hepatitis B situation which I have outlined, I arranged to meet with parents and staff workers from Northgate Sheltered Workshop on 20 April. I have been informed that parents would like to speak to me alone. Staff have informed me that some parents are frightened to speak out in the presence of Endeavour Foundation administration because of a past incident of victimisation of handicapped workers who in any way criticised the administration. This no longer happens but evidently older people cannot get over the fear that it will happen. Others are afraid that they may be considered disloyal or they may feel grateful for what has been done for them but they have concerns which they want to convey to me privately. It is surely the right of these people to express opinions outside the hearing of Endeavour administration. However, I have been informed by the State manager that parents cannot speak to me at that meeting without his being present. I have further been informed by staff that an emergency meeting has been called by members of the State administration to speak with some parents before they meet with me. Another authoritative source has confirmed that people with concerns are afraid to make them public and in the past any attempt at criticism has been met with charges of disloyalty to the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other serious concerns regarding human rights of people working at sheltered workshops and I regret that I will not be able to outline them all. One man, Mr A, was admitted to Endeavour Workshops suffering from severe epilepsy. His intelligence is at normal level. He was grateful he was allowed to go into the workshop as it was the only place he could go at the time. However, after working at two sheltered workshops his skills reached too high a level to continue and he was employed as an assistant supervisor for $40 per week at a sheltered workshop in Brisbane. He ran three packaging benches and did all the jobs done by the supervisor who was on full pay. During this time he continuously applied for a supervisor's job but on each occasion someone else got the job regardless of the fact that Mr A successfully was undertaking full duties at cut rates. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask permission to incorporate in Hansard a breakdown of figures showing the amount paid to disabled people in workshops State by State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr A is distressed that he was continually passed over and asks why he was not considered for the job. Three people were employed in positions for which he applied while he was working there full time for $40 a week. Eventually he left the workshop and is now employed full time in private enterprise. The discrimination shown here is entirely unacceptable from a Commonwealth funded provider of handicapped services or in fact any provider of handicapped services. There is a moral responsibility involved which has been breached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another serious matter is that of alleged breaching of confidentiality of Mr A's health file with Endeavour. He told me today that he and his wife had applied to Endeavour Foundation some weeks ago to be given access to their own file. This application was refused on the basis that it would breach confidentiality. Yet a couple of weeks after the person concerned was refused his own file, statements were made in a Brisbane newspaper quoting a State member of the Legislative Assembly who gave information about Mr A which he believes could have come only from his Endeavour file. He claims she did not know him and as far as he is concerned there is nowhere else she could have got the information she used except from his file. I will be taking this matter up with Mrs Berys Nelson. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not have time to outline all the matters of concern. I do have time to say I am deeply concerned at the implications of the stories told to me. People have sought me out only after hearing of my interest in the hepatitis B issue in order to give me details of what can only be described as abuse of trust. I did not come to this public forum as a first means of attacking these problems. I contacted the Endeavour administration, Department of Community Services and Health staff and, most importantly, the disabled people themselves. It would appear, however, that my attempts to speak in good faith and away from the public gaze with the disabled people and parents who wished to speak to me have not been appreciated; but rather they have been abused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, my grievance relates to the Hawke Government's neglect of middle Australia. I refer particularly to the tax burden which wage and salary earners are shouldering. Many commentators have demonstrated beyond question that this tax burden is an unprecedented one and yet one of which the Treasury itself warned the Government in preparing documents for the famous tax summit of 1985 which, as we know, was not just a political disaster but a great disaster for all pay as you earn taxpayers. I refer particularly to excellent articles by Mr Daryl Dixon, in particular those that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 13 and 14 February, in which he has shown that the Government has failed to heed all the warnings of its own Treasury for four years. We have a situation now, Mr Deputy Speaker, where we are moving towards an extremely unequal Australia-an Australia in which restraint with equity to which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has referred has produced restraint but great inequity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Official figures show that income distribution is now less equitable than when the Hawke Government first won office in 1983. The top 10 per cent of income earners now receive 28.4 per cent of all income in Australia while middle income earners have gone backwards. An extra 700,000 Australians have slipped below the poverty line since 1983 and today 2.6 million people, one in every eight households, live in poverty. Also, 440,000 children are being raised in these conditions and are being denied a fair start in life. More than 60,000 people live on the verge of homelessness and 40,000 sleep in refuges, in emergency accommodation or in the open. The Australian expectation of a roof over one's head has slipped beyond reach for 100,000 people. The number of people on public housing waiting lists has gone up by 50 per cent since the Australian Labor Party took office in 1983 to 160,000 people. Australia now has a permanent underclass of nearly 600,000 unemployed people of whom 100,000 are teenagers seeking full time employment. We know also that the suicide rate amongst teenagers has risen dramatically over that period and, of course, the two are related. </PARA>
<PARA> Next Wednesday night the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will be presenting his economic statement on the taxation situation. Tax cuts are promised and tax cuts are certainly needed to favour middle and low income earners. It is the middle income group, particularly those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners and those on low incomes, salaries and wages, who have had to bear the restraint which has been imposed as living costs have soared. The majority of Australians have had declining living standards but, of course, some have been doing very well indeed. I do not begrudge executives being paid what they are worth or what the marketplace gets for them, but there is no doubt that executive salaries have risen at a time when other wages and incomes have been reduced in real value and considerable inequities arise because of that. Moreover, it is those people with those high incomes who are importing the luxury goods which are helping to aggravate our balance of payments situation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also good to see that company profits have risen. Net profits are, in fact, up 37 per cent in the first half of this year, but it is disturbing in the extreme to see that some of those companies have made that profit at the expense of their obligations to pay their tax as corporate citizens of this country. If the tax system is such that it is forcing them in the interests of their shareholders to go to tax havens, then the tax system has to be changed, but the companies themselves are letting Australia down by using tax havens and the Government is letting Australia down by not shutting off the access to the tax havens as, indeed, it has promised to do. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of brain power, as the Commissioner of Taxation himself has warned, has been spent trying to detect people who are going to tax havens. The Government has loved making reforms to the taxation system by press release; by announcing that as of the date of a press release a certain practice would be eliminated and would be the subject of legislation later. That is not retrospective legislation when warning is given of an operative date of legislation. It does not matter how late the legislation is, that legislation is operative from the date of the press release. The Treasurer has not done that in respect of tax havens and that is a great indictment of this Government as many of its corporate friends, such as the Bond Corporation, continue to avoid their obligations as taxpayers and we-the rest of the Australian taxpaying community-pay for that. The Government has made no effort whatever to cut off that abuse of our laws. It appears that the Government has known for at least four years the extent of tax sheltering activities; yet no legislation has been introduced and apparently no legislation is contemplated, at least to be operative, before the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Treasurer is always talking to us about the `big picture'. In painting that big picture, he has forgotten the little people and has associated and identified himself too much with some of those high-flying business people who have used their income from tax shelters to buy up productive and effective Australian companies, taking them into tax shelters again to make more money to buy up more companies and thus to avoid their corporate tax responsibilities. In doing so they impose more tax burden upon us. Indeed, it is interesting to read the Prime Minister's maiden speech on 26 November 1980 when he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The highly privileged have been allowed further to enhance their privilege by escaping their obligation under the law to pay tax while the relative tax burden has been remorselessly increased upon members of the middle and low income groups who have little opportunity to evade their obligations . . . It will be precisely those who avoid the law to their own great financial advantage who will be loudest in their condemnation of these wage and salary earners . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those words have never been more true than they are now under the Hawke Government. Some of its corporate friends have done exceedingly well under the Hawke Government at the cost of the electors of Wills and other people whom the Labor Party claims to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's election pledge to eliminate child poverty is coming under increasing scrutiny and it is clear from the figures I quoted that child poverty has increased. If one looks at the statistical evidence, one finds that more than 70 per cent of total tax collections come from taxpayers with incomes of less than $45,000 a year. Again, Daryl Dixon points out that the only lasting beneficiaries of the tax cuts have been the highest and some of the lowest income groups, the latter benefiting from the family package. Some of the lowest income groups at least have been relieved of some of their burden, but it is the middle income earners overwhelmingly who have suffered. In fact there has been an effective increase of 10 per cent in the total personal income burden for middle income brackets. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have the crisis in the housing industry. We have the crisis for first home owners in particular. The famous housing summit did nothing to relieve that situation. I commend to the Government an article by Ken Davidson in the Age of 23 February in which he thoughtfully outlines alternatives to several aspects of the Government's policies. In particular, he outlines ways in which we could encourage people to direct their investments into the more productive areas that we need to increase the infrastructure of this country, to increase its productivity and profitability so that we can employ more people and export more goods and services and, at the same time, ensure that those who save do so in ways which are beneficial to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly commend the Government to do a rethink. It is increasingly tired; it is increasingly ineffective. We will be watching next Wednesday's statement with great interest to try to make sure that we get restraint with equity instead of a situation in which those who have suffered for so long lose their real disposable income and find that, wherever they turn, life becomes harder for them by becoming better for others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday, 3 March of this year, my friend and colleague Pauline Toner died after a long battle with cancer. She had been the State member for Greensborough since 1977. Pauline was only the second woman member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to win a seat in the Victorian Parliament. Before entering Parliament she was the first woman councillor in the Shire of Diamond Valley and the first woman Shire President of Diamond Valley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I first met Pauline on the occasion of her success in the 1977 by-election following the death of Monty Vale, who was the then Liberal Party member for the State seat. I took her place on the Diamond Valley Shire Council and followed her as Shire President and ultimately into politics. In 1979 Pauline became the first woman ever to sit on the Victorian parliamentary front bench and in 1982 the first woman Cabinet member in Victoria's history. She held the portfolio of Minister for Community Welfare Services from April 1982 until April 1985. A member of the Australian Labor Party since 1968, Pauline was the current Senior Vice-President of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party, as well as being a Federal and State conference delegate. </PARA>
<PARA> Pauline had five children in seven years and had studied for Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education degrees while she brought up a young family with her husband Brian. Born in Horsham in 1935, Pauline will be sadly missed by her family and friends and within the ALP and her local community. She was a most unique woman. She was always a feminist, but a feminist who never once mentioned the word `feminism' in regard to herself or her own activities in politics. She was first and foremost a friend and a colleague. There are many members of the Australian Labor Party today who owe a great deal to Pauline. She was only a young woman-only 53-when she died, but her value and the reason why people such as I will always remember Pauline and she will always be a part of my life was that she brought people into politics, she educated people about politics and she left a succession in politics that will remain long after she has gone. </PARA>
<PARA> The by-election campaign in the State seat is currently on. It is a by-election which the Australian Labor Party is going to win. The seat is held only at 56-odd per cent in two party preferred terms and one would have thought, quite frankly, that, with the Victorian Economic Development Commission and other current critical issues running in Victorian politics, the Victorian Liberal Party would have a fair show of winning such an electorate in a by-election. It is a fairly unique area of Australia. It contains probably the highest number of tertiary qualified people of any electorate in Australia. It is an electorate of high family incomes and high car ownership and a very thoughtful electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Australian Labor Party is going to win the by-election because of the legacy of Pauline. The work she did in the area, both as a councillor and as a State member of parliament and, more importantly, as a member of the general community, is reflected in the fact that people will continue to support her successor, who is Sherryl Garbutt. Sherryl in fact worked for Pauline for seven years as her electoral secretary and knows the electorate probably as well as, or better than, Pauline did, being in the office perhaps more often than Pauline was, with her parliamentary commitments. So Pauline's work will not go unremembered and the local electorate well understand that a vote for Sherryl Garbutt is a vote for the continuance of the work that Pauline did. Sherryl is an extremely well-known person. </PARA>
<PARA> One must contrast the Australian Labor Party approach in the area and the Australian Labor Party campaign for the by-election with the ineptitude of the Liberal Party in Victoria. It really seems to learn nothing. Of course, the candidate that the Liberal Party in Victoria has selected is Mrs Neil Brown. Perhaps the fact that it has chosen that lady is one of the reasons why it is going to be defeated in the by-election. The reality, of course, is that Margaret Brown was not chosen by the local Liberal Party branches; in fact, Margaret Brown was chosen by Jeff Kennett and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). She was deliberately picked and chosen despite the wishes of the local Liberal branches. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the Opposition say, `Rubbish, rubbish!'. Let me give them a few facts on what is occurring in an area they know nothing about. The Liberal Party candidate in the State elections in September of last year is a councillor in the Shire of Eltham, Councillor Bob Manuel. Councillor Manuel owns several real estate properties in the area, and honourable members might be surprised to learn that on one of those properties owned by the Manuel family there sits today a very large street sign calling on people to vote for Sherryl Garbutt, the ALP candidate. That is what the local Liberal Party branches think of Jeff Kennett and the honourable member for Kooyong's imposition of the candidate upon them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, even more importantly than that, Mr Tony Kennett, who is no relation to Mr Jeff Kennett, I might add, but is the president of the local Liberal Party branch, has resigned in disgust at the imposition of candidates. The reality is that typically, as Liberal Party people tend to do in campaigns, the first thing they are doing is running `honesty in government'. Let those who are interested in the Liberal Party campaign and the claims of Mrs Brown as to where she stands in local communities read the local newspapers and the hundreds of letters in the local newspapers which have totally refuted the nonsense she ran with-letters written not by the Labor Party, I might add, but by local community groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I was disgusted, when in a newspaper report I read that Mrs Brown wanted to follow in the footsteps of Mrs Toner. What an insult to the memory of Mrs Toner. Pauline Toner fought against everything that Mrs Brown stands for. Is there any end to the cynicism and the dishonesty of Liberal Party members in a campaign? Is there any end to it when they would even try to use the name of a deceased Labor Party member for the area? Pauline fought vigorously, for her entire life, against everything that Mrs Brown and her fellow silvertails in the Liberal Party represent. She fought against elitism; she fought against vested interests; and she fought against privilege for the few. She was a person of enormous personal integrity and compassion. She had a strong sense of social justice and she fought for her community. Yet the Liberals would use her name. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kennett bought in. Mr Kennett had the gall to say that in the election last year the people of Greensborough voted for Pauline Toner out of sympathy. Could one believe that any person would say such a thing, when the reality was that very few people realised that three years ago Pauline Toner suffered from breast cancer, had an operation, and was given a total clearance on that illness. In fact, it was only late last year, after the election, that secondary signs of cancer first appeared. Yet Jeff Kennett would stand up and say that the local electorate voted for her in sympathy. It is galling for me as a friend of Pauline Toner's to stand here and listen to the Browns and the Kennetts of the world say such things. </PARA>
<PARA> After the 15th, when the Labor Party has won this by-election, it is a test of Jeff Kennett's leadership. He and the honourable member for Kooyong chose the candidate, and when she is beaten Jeff Kennett's leadership is on the line. The local Liberal branches did not want the lady who was imposed upon them as a candidate, and I would like to see what the Liberal Party does after the 15th, after the election, when Labor is returned, and what happens to Jeff Kennett. Even John Howard was told, `Do not come into the by-election campaign'. Howard was told, `Get out'. The Prime Minister is coming next Saturday. We do not hide our leader. We are going to bring him right into the by-election. The Prime Minister will be there next Saturday morning. We will win the election. We will win it proudly in memory of Pauline Toner. </PARA>

<PARA> Today I wish to speak about the floods in the Nyngan region, which is in my electorate of Parkes. I spoke about this matter and the difficulties people are experiencing the night before last, but I make no apology for raising the topic again because I believe that the plight of these people and their livestock in this region of my electorate needs as much publicity as it can get. The national publicity has been concentrated on the damage done to the eastern coastal areas of Australia and the people of Nyngan are, to some extent, being overlooked. Many properties up there have been affected-about 80 or 100 in all-and about 10 or 20 are in very serious trouble. That may not sound like a great number but I remind honourable members that some of these properties are very large and carry many thousands of sheep. In fact some of the properties up there are bigger than some Federal electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> The rain that fell there a few days ago was very unexpected and there was no meteorological reason for it. There was absolutely no warning or precedent for this type of fall. I spoke to one fellow who said he had never seen anything like it, or even half as much, in his whole lifetime. The rain fell in particularly heavy quantities over an area of about 40 to 50 kilometres by 100 kilometres-about 5,000 square kilometres. Up to 16 or 17 inches were just dumped on this very flat country in the Nyngan area-mainly around the north of Nyngan, but stretching up to Coolabah, down into the Warren area and also in the area south of Gongolgon. Gongolgon is a little town south of Brewarrina. </PARA>
<PARA> Many stock, particularly sheep, are stranded and have been left standing in water for days. No one seems to know the exact procedures that should be followed. I believe that once this experience is over we need to draw up a natural disaster manual so that all this experience can be tabulated. It should include the experiences that people have had and detail what is needed so that a better program of assistance can be run next time. It should set out what needs to be done, what advice needs to be given and that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline some of the problems. As I said, we have sheep still standing in water. About 40,000 sheep have been standing in water for five days or more now and one wonders just how long they can survive. We have the problem of how best to shift them. It was thought earlier that army ducks might be the best method, but they need either about five feet of water to stand in or firm ground, so they have not proved to be successful. There has been much discussion as to whether helicopters could lift the sheep out. I know that Chinook helicopters can lift about six tonnes or more and I think that they could be useful, though at this stage the authorities seem to think they will not be suitable. I will return to that point later. At present the sheep are being moved out-up to eight or 10 at a time-in small, flat bottom boats and that is very time consuming. Efforts are also being made to swim some of these sheep out, and honourable members can imagine the difficulties with that. We also have the problem of how best to feed these sheep. At the moment we have an Army Chinook helicopter up there, and I am very grateful to the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) for sending it. It put out 770 bales yesterday afternoon in its first four circuits and another 420 bales are on the way. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many problems when sheep stand in water for a long time. One of those is with their feet. After a number of days they become very soft and the hooves will disengage themselves from the coronet and fall off. This is particularly so when they stand in the black soil that is prevalent in that area. If the sheep move, the soil will suck the hooves off them. There are also problems with a few heavily pregnant ewes which have pregnancy toxaemia. This problem has arisen as a result of the particular physiological metabolism of sheep. They have very high demands for fructose late in pregnancy and some of the sheep can become low in glucose which is needed for brain activity and they just go quite silly and die. The main problem, of course, is the weight of the fleece. If the fleece is long and absorbs water some of the sheep will be carrying an extra 20 or 30 pounds of weight and they can only stand up in water so long with that extra weight. They become very tired after a while, they go down in the water and they finally lose the will to live and drown. That is a major consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked to some of those farmers on the telephone and they have described the experience of driving these sheep through the water. They try to use bikes where the water is not too deep and they try to use horses. Much of it has to be done on foot and, of course, one does not have the benefit of sheep dogs, which are so vital in that part of the world. Driving sheep on foot can be quite a procedure. Farmers scatter the sheep, send them off and then get the others to follow them in single file. It may take all day just to move a few sheep a short distance. So those are some of the problems. Of course, from about now on we have the problem of fly strike. In temperatures of 27, 28 or 29 degrees centigrade the fleece is so moist that the flies lay maggots and those maggots will eat the sheep alive within the next day or two in some instances. That is very regrettable. There will be an enormous demand for chemicals such as vetrazin as soon as everything starts drying out. In these cases we need spotting helicopters in order to inform farmers where their sheep are. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall read out some of the notes I made of these conversations with farmers. Stuart McAlpine, from Tubba Villa, Coolabah, has 5,500 sheep. All are at high risk and he needs them to be lifted out if possible. Tom Yabsley, of Murrawombie, Coolabah, has had 12 inches of rain and his stock, including his stud bulls, is at risk. However, his situation is not too bad because he has some high land. John Fisher, of Colane, Nyngan, had 14 inches of rain on his property, the most he has seen in his 63 years of life. He is particularly keen to see fodder drops arranged. Lionel Kennedy at Benar, Nyngan, has 5,000 sheep at the point of lambing. He has lost a few hundred and the water is too deep for the sheep to walk in. The only way he can reach them is on horseback but that is very dangerous and slow. The other day he spend five hours rescuing 80 sheep, but what are 80 out of the several thousand? Michael Kennedy at Killarney, Nyngan, has had 16 inches. A drover who was shearing at his place, and who has sheep on the road, has lost hundreds of them. Michael Kennedy has no way to move around his property properly because of the rain. But Richie George at The Corners, Nyngan, has has 15.5 inches. John Modra has lost $5,000 or $6,000 worth of fencing alone and his dams are filled up with silt. He has little or no insurance because it is too prohibitive to take out. He has also highlighted other losses. The list goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> I praise the community at Nyngan for the work that has been done. Geoff Wise, the district veterinary officer, has worked night and day. David Lister, the chairman of the Pastures Protection Board, John Hoare, the president of the shire council, and all those associated with the shire should be praised for the work that they have done in the general community. The stock and station agents have been on the phone day and night organising matters and helping their clients as much as they can. Last night I spoke to a man called Mac George who told the story of how in the mid-1970s sheep had been in water for two weeks. Their hooves came off and in the end when the farmers tried to move them out of the mud onto higher ground, the sheep ran back again to the soft ground because of the pain of their feet without hooves. They just lost the will to live. They would not even feed and in the end the farmers had to shoot 3,000 sheep. This is the sort of tragedy that will affect these people in the next few days as things dry out a bit. They will be faced with fly strike, sheep losing hooves, sheep bogged in mud and the terrible depression that comes from losing thousands of animals worth $60 or $70 a head. So several tens of thousands of dollars will be lost by most property owners in Nyngan. It is a very tragic situation and I hope the people of Australia will recognise it. I hope that the help that should be given will be given to and alleviate the plight of these people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We move from the question of sheep to another flock in a sense-that is, homeless youth. In my 10 minutes I want to raise some issues relating to income support for homeless youth. This is a very sensitive matter but we need to talk about it. When the Burdekin report of the national inquiry into homeless children by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, entitled Our Homeless Children, burst onto the scene there were predictable responses. It was front page news around the country. There were those, of course, who shed crocodile tears and blamed the Government for not carrying out its promise that no child would need to be in poverty by 1990. Then, of course, the issue-at least in the public mind-died, but the work goes on. It is a very serious issue and it is one that we are now addressing and will continue to address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposition that I put today is that a child who has left home should apply for maintenance from the parents. That is, the family should continue to support the child where possible. There should not be the obvious and total mechanism that once the kid has left home, then he, perforce, or she, perforce, must be looked after solely by the state. That may seem a harsh measure but let us put it into context. We have at present a Family Law Act and a system for the recovery of maintenance through the Child Support Agency. This means that when a family breaks down and there is a divorce in process, or completed, the Family Court can come into play and say that the non-custodial parent, usually the father, will pay $X a week-$30, $40, $50 or $60 a week-to the child who is with the custodial parent, normally the mother.</PARA>
<PARA> We ought to apply that same philosophy and probably use the same mechanisms when a child leaves home. When a child runs away from home, we must maintain that signal to the family that, no matter where the child is, it is still the family's responsibility to look after the child. The mechanism we need to use is, again, the Child Support Act and the Family Law Act. I would not raise this sensitive issue if I did not believe that the Commonwealth had a proud record of expenditure and support in the area of youth homelessness. We understand that through the family assistance supplement (FAS) scheme we now make payments to 350,000 young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the matter of youth refuges and the housing of these poor kids who find themselves outside a family. When we came to power there were 50 refuges in this country; there are now 500, so no-one could dare suggest that we have not done a great deal to try to solve the problems of youth homelessness. We are now suggesting that we are getting to a far more sophisticated area. I would suggest that next we have to attempt some recovery, some maintenance payment from the parents themselves. The current position with the Family Law Act is that a child does have the right to apply for maintenance from his or her parents, but at the moment on an application through the court, there is a broad discretion. For instance, the making of an application for maintenance by a child will often, in practice, put at issue the custody and guardianship arrangements for a child. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a 17-year-old who refuses to live at home because of the persistent violence of his or her parents might apply for maintenance. In such a case the court could well conclude that the custody of the child should be removed from the parents. The level and type of maintenance to be ordered would depend on the type of custody arrangement ordered. Another example would be where a 12-year-old left home because of a dispute with his or her parents over the parents' refusal to permit the child to smoke. Although the child could apply for maintenance, the court would be likely to do what it could to encourage the child to return home rather than order maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suggesting therefore that the court must eventually turn its mind to allow applications by children against the parents for income support. I know that many of the families from which children have run away do not have a great deal of income. A lot have only a single parent who may be on benefits herself. We are not asking that we draw blood out of a stone, we are simply saying that where there is an ability on the part of a family to pay for that child, then I think we all have the right to ask for income support from that family. We have a system at the moment, with our 500 refuges, whereby a child can run away from home and hopefully find a refuge nearby. I am thinking of the refuge of Tandara in Redcliffe, in my electorate, which does a sterling job. I have spoken to the youth workers there about this concept and they are quite favourable towards it because they are saying so many children, usually aged 15, 14 and even younger, reach them who do not have access to the young homeless allowance, I believe, because they are too young, but they do often get the Jobsearch allowance. If we could, through our youth refuge system, give some support to those people, put them in touch with a social worker at the Legal Aid Commission and then use the Legal Aid Commission to allow them to apply for maintenance through the Family Court or the Magistrates Court, then I believe we could get some money flowing from the families to support these children who for whatever reason, and often I might say for the very worst reasons, have been abused. Money should flow from the family to support those children. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is all about signals. The signal is that no matter how dispersed that family is there is ultimately a responsibility on the part of the family to at least keep in touch, even if it does not know the exact address of the child, and to attempt to make some supporting payment. That is the philosophy we have used in family law. We are saying to so many non-custodial parents these days that they must continue to pay maintenance for the children which they have reared. They cannot avoid that, and we will use the tax system and the Child Support Agency in order to ensure that they continue to support their children. I see the situation where a family, a husband and wife, may still be together but where one child has left, as being analogous. I think the family still has to make some effort to support that child. I believe we have mechanisms through the child support agencies and through our refuge system to do that. That would not be easy, administratively it would be difficult. Here, if you like, there may be some trade-off. I believe the Commonwealth can look seriously at ensuring that where children enter a refuge or make application to the Department of Social Security they should be supported quickly. When they make that application for a youth homeless allowance or Jobsearch payment, that payment must be made as quickly as possible. But at the same time perhaps an application can be made for support from the family. We should get into a situation where we try as much as possible to gain some continuing support from the family at the same time using the Commonwealth to support that child. It is a very complex area. It is a very sensitive area. It is one that we all need to think about and to debate at great length. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, my two youth workers at Tandara, Redcliffe tell me that they barely have enough time simply to administer the place where they work. They need two on deck all the time to make sure that the place is not wrecked. We certainly need to support those people a little further so that they can bring further support services to the children-to get them up; to get some social workers in-house and to try to get some family reconciliation which, I understand, does not happen all that often. We simply do not have the numbers of workers to try to reconcile families. That shocks me somewhat. Perhaps we can have a trade-off whereby we increase the means by which we get support from the family but also Commonwealth support to try to reunite families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With Mother's Day just around the corner this grievance debate provides an appropriate opportunity to share with the House the story of a mother living in my electorate of Casey. It is a story about a women's lone and lonely struggle to provide a decent, secure and loving home for her six children, three of whom have had special problems including one with spina bifida and one with Bell's palsy. It is the story of a woman who made a conscious decision to put motherhood first; who decided her primary concern and responsibility were to care for her children and ensure that they had the necessary education, guidance and support to enable them to become responsible and contributing Australian citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of this decision and despite the fact that she has achieved her objectives in so far as the children are concerned, she is sadly disillusioned as to her perceived worth, both as an individual and as a member of the community. Why? Because an uncaring government, an inflexible bureaucracy, has stripped her of self-esteem and condemned her to live in poverty. Dylan Thomas once observed, `I have achieved poverty with distinction but never poverty with dignity. The best I can manage is dignity with poverty'. My constituent knows what Thomas was talking about. Fourteen years ago she was faced with the daunting prospect of coping alone with all the responsibilities of parenting and providing for her family. At that time her children were aged from 12 to two years. Life has been a continual battle ever since. She has managed to survive, but only just. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, my constituent's total income from all sources was $6,661.20. Her four older children had left the family home and were making their own way in the world. Her two teenage secondary school student daughters, who still resided with her, received a separate income of $3,640, made up of Austudy payments of $2,600 and maintenance payments from their father of $1,040. My constituent has kept meticulous records of their combined household expenditure. Of her $6,661, $4,073 went to pay council and water rates, gas and electricity charges and mortgage repayments. That left her with a balance of almost $50 a week. With this grand sum she had to cover necessary weekly expenses, including the cost of medication not covered by the national health scheme; food and household items; insurance; travel expenses; clothing; repairs to her house and to her household appliances; and other sundries, such as stamps and birthday and Christmas gifts for her children. All of this on less than $50 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Her problems are compounded by the fact that due to a chronic debilitating illness and a serious nervous disorder she is unable to find employment. The option of generating any extra income is simply, and quite genuinely, unavailable to her. She cannot do many of the things that most people take for granted. She cannot afford to visit her mother and family in New South Wales. She cannot afford to visit a hairdresser or buy cosmetics. Outings to the theatre or cinema, or any form of entertainment that is not free, are all in the `not possible' category. She cannot even afford to invite friends to dinner. There is no money available to pay for much needed major repairs to her home: the toilet leaks, the faucets are worn, the shower recess is unusable, the bathroom floor has rotted through, the hot water service has a faulty switch and there are faulty power points which cannot be used. Her oven broke five years ago. The floor coverings and window blinds have worn out. The roof needs major repairs. The quotes for repairs to the bathroom alone exceeded $2,800, more than her entire uncommitted income for the year. She examined the possibility of renegotiating the mortgage on her home to cover the cost of repairs but, with increasing interest rates, the payments were beyond her financial capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> Her daughters agreed that from their incomes they would be responsible for paying all their own expenses, including the cost of their own food, school books, uniforms and other educational costs, such as excursions and camps, clothing, footwear, dental expenses, hair care, travel, recreational activities and all the other bits and pieces that are part and parcel of being a normal teenager. </PARA>
<PARA> In June last year, my constituent received notice from the Department of Social Security that she was to be deprived of some small pension increases to which she had previously been entitled. The sum involved was something in the order of $4 a week-not a lot for most people but a significant amount to anyone endeavouring to exist on a restricted budget. Why did the Department take this action? Because her former husband pays maintenance for his daughters. After a prolonged and fruitless battle with Social Security she wrote me an impassioned plea for some sympathy and understanding. I would like to read some excerpts from her letter. She wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> It was my daughters who received maintenance from their father, not I. But it was taken into account in their income and also in mine by the Department of Social Security, and my pension was effectively reduced as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not spend the maintenance money or benefit from it. I just received it on my daughters' behalf. It could only be spent once-and was spent by them. The Department's claim that I received maintenance was totally incorrect. I do not. I have never received maintenance for myself. Never. </PARA>
<PARA>Her letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I helped elect this Government. It was the first time in my life I have ever voted labour-and to my regret. </PARA>
<PARA> I did so because Mr Hawke gave me the impression of being a fair and wise counsellor during his years with the unions. I really believed him when he said `a fair go for all Australians'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the job I have been doing for the past 27 years is a very important one. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, I'm talking about motherhood, and raising responsible, respectable young adults who are to be the future of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I didn't choose motherhood, it chose me. Nevertheless, when the responsibility came, I stuck with it. </PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Hawke and Mr Keating have underestimated my value far too speedily and easily. Perhaps they think that motherhood has such a lowly connotation in this day and age that it need not be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> By depriving me of my pension increases the Government has dealt me a personal body blow from which I may never recover. In effect, the Government is saying to me that I am a person of no account. They have rendered me valueless. They have caused me to become a beggar hidden behind walls in a desperate bid to survive without cheating. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to get support without resorting to begging. It is so humiliating and dehumanising to be continually pleading one's poverty, to have to depend on others for handouts and charity. I have even tried selling what few valuables we have, but no-one would give me a decent price. </PARA>
<PARA> I'm not asking for anything but a `fair go'-not only for myself, but for others in the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA>My constituent's predicament, and that of thousands in the same or similar circumstances, is accurately summed up by a line from an editorial in the Sunday Telegraph of 11 December last year:</PARA>
<PARA> Both Mr Hawke and Mr Keating have spent too much time on macro and micro economics and paid too little attention to the human effects of their policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Had my constituent thrown in the towel and walked away from her family responsibilities, it would have cost the Government literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to provide the necessary care for her children. But she did not do that. And what does the Government do to acknowledge her efforts? Again I quote her own words:</PARA>
<PARA>They tell me I am just another casualty, another burden, another number, the least of the least . . . so give her the least . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It was John Kennedy who so wisely reflected:</PARA>
<PARA>If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not arguing here against profit or wealth. I am simply asking, as my constituent has asked, for `a fair go', for some recognition of her real worth to the community through her continued dedication and comm- itment to her role as a mother. </PARA>
<PARA> She has done an amazing job against enormous odds. Despite the impression she has gained as a result of the insensitive actions of a heartless and unsympathetic Government, I want her to know that her efforts and sacrifices are appreciated by those who believe that the family is still the most important unit in our society and that being a good and responsible parent is an achievement of which she can be unashamedly proud. Although a little early, I would like to wish my consistent a very happy Mothers' Day. She certainly deserves it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to lend what support I can, and what commendation I can, to an operation which will be taking place in Adelaide this coming weekend. It is a joint operation between the Adelaide newspaper The News and KESAB-Keep South Australia Beautiful-in what they call `The clean the scene weekend'. It involves, this Saturday and Sunday, thousands of Adelaide volunteers taking to the streets, the beaches, the parks and the waterways of Adelaide-one of Australia's most beautiful cities and personally, I think, the most beautiful-to keep that State and that city as beautiful as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What they intend to do is to clean up litter and to improve the quality of our urban environment in Adelaide. My contribution to it will be to volunteer myself, with a number of members of my political party-the Australian Labor Party-to clean up the beaches in my own electorate. I have, as you have, Mr Deputy Speaker, some of the most beautiful beaches in Australia in my electorate of Kingston. We plan to clean up the beach at Port Noarlunga, from the jetty north, to keep it as spectacular and clean as it deserves to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give my commendation to the volunteers who are going to be giving up their time for that enterprise in a way which follows on from the campaign which took place in Sydney not so long ago when a number of volunteers collected something like 3,000 tonnes of rubbish from around Sydney Harbour over a weekend. As you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that rubbish varied from the absolutely revolting-drug syringes, condoms and so forth-and the very bulky-car bodies, car engines and so forth-to just a whole lot of the detritus of modern civilisation-plastic wrappings, gladwrap and a great amount of non-biodegradable rubbish, which volunteers were able to collect and to send away. It seems to me that this is the kind of thing that a local newspaper can do very well. I am not always in agreement with the political views of some of the Adelaide newspapers, but certainly the way that the Adelaide News has helped to mobilise community opinion and to organise that `clean the scene' weekend is something that deserves everybody's support. I do encourage anyone who may be listening to this broadcast to get out there on Saturday and Sunday and give an hour or a couple of hours of his time to help to clean up our own environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of urban refuse is becoming a genuinely major problem in Australia. In some recent studies in Victoria, for example, it was found that every man, woman and child generates something like 800 kilograms, that is, nearly one ton in the old measure, of garbage every year. That amount is growing. The amount of household garbage being collected in Sydney, for example, is increasing at a rate of about 8 per cent a year. While it is one thing to clean up some of that garbage which is thrown away, and that is certainly a start, what we really need to do is to look to a more permanent future solution by placing a greater emphasis on the recycling of garbage. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia, the State Government has taken steps which are somewhat in advance of those in the rest of Australia by having container deposit legislation. That legislation was passed in 1975 and amended in 1984. It has resulted in rates of recycling of something like 85 per cent for bottles and 90 per cent for cans. That is well over twice the national average. We can certainly see the results of this if we are driving from, say, Victoria to South Australia. In Victoria, or in New South Wales for that matter, all along the roads we see stubbies and cans. Every 20 feet, 30 feet, or so there is a can or a bottle by the side of the road. When we get over the border into South Australia, where deposit legislation applies, without a word of exaggeration the sides of the road are very clean because kids can get so many cents per can or so many cents per bottle and they collect them and take them back because deposit legislation applies. I do think that the South Australian legislation is something which deserves to be copied by other States because it does lead to a very much cleaner environment than we have in some other States. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, even without that sort of legislation, efforts to achieve recycling of paper have resulted in nearly a 50 per cent paper recycling rate. It is stupid to burn paper, for example. It is far better to recycle it. I know that the Victorian Government is hoping to increase its recycling rate to 55 per cent quite soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I condemn the Hawke Government for its inept handling of the Wesley Vale issue. As a result of the way in which the Federal Government handled that issue, Australia has lost a very valuable investment that would have been worth $1,000m as a new industry to be developed. It would have employed in excess of 500 people on a permanent basis. It would have provided a very valuable stimulus for the economy in Tasmania and for the nation generally. But, because of the way in which the Hawke Government handled that proposal put forward by the developers, it is now lost to Australia and, along with it, all the rest of the investment. It was lost because Senator Richardson, in particular, wanted to be a political rambo. At no stage was Senator Richardson dedicated to trying to have industrial development for this country. He simply wanted to prove that he was a political master over the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Robin Gray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The great shortcoming of the Federal Government is that it does not have any guidelines or rules for industrial development. I strongly urge that the Federal Government should have rules for the development of manufacturing industry in Australia. If it does not very quickly get such rules and guidelines, we will lose further valuable investments for this country. Any potential investor has no idea what this Federal Government wants and how it is likely to react to any proposal that is brought forward. I strongly urge the Federal Government to have such guidelines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to share with honourable members parts of a letter published in yesterday's Adelaide Advertiser and written by a women who lives in my electorate. The letter is headed `Grey Matter, not Grey Power'. She says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Using the label Grey Power when referring to any group, regardless of political persuasion, constitution or beliefs . . . is not only confusing and unclear to many people, but also misleading . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Does anyone have any idea what Grey Power really stand for: what are their aims and policies; what do they hope to achieve for the older people of this country . . . ?</PARA>
<PARA> Do they think the label Grey Power equates them as the logical party to capture the greying population's voting power? What do they aspire to? Are they addressing the `bread and butter' issues and really concerned with issues that affect the everyday lives and future of people retiring and retired, as well as those on low, fixed incomes?</PARA>
<PARA> Or are they ambitious powerseekers whose views, values and motives are not purely directed towards the improvement of the quality of life for the average retiree or low-income person?</PARA>
<PARA> Have they shown their concern by attending regular meetings over the past few years to discuss the state of our nursing homes, retirement villages legislation, home and community care and the problems the elderly have in coping with medication and the changing `free list' in this health area?</PARA>
<PARA> Grey Power may not be the answer to all older citizens' problems. But if older citizens use their grey matter and think about who they vote for-not just vote blindly as a loyalty to a party, but think which one offers the best for them and this country-I reason grey matter is what will make a difference in the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At last a journalist, Ken Davidson, has had the responsibility to discuss the wheat issue in terms of its effect upon the 40,000 wheat growers and the significance for the Australian Wheat Board as the marketing arm of those growers. It is indicative of our national media that the impact of government decision-making today is seen in political content only. In contrast, John Hyde's article on the wheat industry in the Australian is an indication of what is wrong with the wheat debate, and it is not the Australian Wheat Board. Even the most ignorant of political commentators has not had the audacity to say that the Wheat Board and the wheat industry are thoroughly inefficient. John Hyde's admission that he has sold weeds as wheat and grown varieties of a poor quality when others were available makes me, as a wheat grower, pleased that he is writing and not seeding.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to support the efforts of a school in my electorate, the Hackham West Primary School, and particularly of Don Riches, and the children he teaches in the grade three class there, in planting Australian native trees in my part of the world. Don's class has a very large number of seeds planted and trees which they have grown are now planted all over the school yard, and they are going on from there. At a ceremony the other day I gave them some golden wattle seeds. As you know, Madam Speaker, the golden wattle has recently been declared the Australian national emblem. The children will be planting those seeds and shortly they will be transplanting the seedlings to permanent places in their large and attractive school yard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to commend the efforts of Maurice Horsnell, with whom I was, once upon a time, more years ago than he or I care to remember, at the Norwood High School. Maurice is now the principal of the Hackam West Primary School, and has given his full support to these efforts. In days when we are worried about the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer, it seems to me that teaching children the importance of planting trees is the most public-spirited act that one can do, and Don Riches and Maurice Horsnell are really doing a tremendous job in getting this kind of message across to young Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I had occasion to criticise the morality of some of our corporate citizens in the way in which they use tax havens to avoid their corporate responsibilities to Australia. I want now to praise Mr Justice Brooking of the Victorian Supreme Court, who recently made a judgment which established a policy for dealing with breaches of commercial morality. I praise him very much for his action. He said that one of the conflicting commercial interests could have access to the books of another but must provide a summary of information so gained to the National Companies and Securities Commission so that the public interest could be examined by that Commission and, as a result of those investigations, charges may be laid. He made it clear that he was not prejudging the situation, but that the public interest had to be protected and it was not sufficient for the courts to examine commercial matters just on the narrow grounds currently before them. That is a misuse of the courts and a misuse of legislation and no parliament can possibly anticipate or keep up with the smart people in the legal and commercial worlds. I praise the judge for formulating such a policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I presented to the House a petition drawing to the attention of the House the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, especially food, to the millions of people throughout the world who so desperately need this assistance. The petitioners prayed that the House instruct the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to have the matter raised in the United Nations General Assembly with a view to publicising the anxiety of the average Australian at the lack of progress in attending to these matters, and with particular concern at the lack of food for the starving people of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

She is Sister Elizabeth Berridge of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart. Her concern is so great that she travelled to Canberra today to be in the Parliament when the petition was tabled. As long ago as June 1987, Sister Berridge pointed out to me some of the appalling figures distributed in a 1987 document of the Australian Council of Churches called Simply Not Enough, which pointed out the terrible inequalities in the world and the terrible distress caused to all those people who simply have not enough food to eat. I commend Sister Berridge and all the concerned citizens of Australia who care so much about this issue and people throughout the rest of the world who are in need. I commend to the Government that it take up the suggestion of those petitioners this morning and have the matter raised in the United Nations General Assembly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Statistics from the Parliamentary Library and also sourced from the December publication of the Australian National Accounts reveal that in the year 1987-88 Australians spent a staggering $20.6 billion on legal gambling. The figures for illegal gambling are, of course, unknown and would inflate the $20.6 billion even further. This $20.6 billion compares with $3.2 billion spent on tobacco and a little over $8 billion spent on alcoholic beverages. The combined alcohol and tobacco figures are a little over 50 per cent of the gambling figure. What is astonishing is that Australians decided individually that they could do without, or risk at odds unlikely to succeed, individual sums which added up to $20.6 billion or about 25 per cent of the Government outlays that year. Ironically, this is not a measure of prosperity. Historically, gambling rises in times of economic difficulty. With little to lose, the people of Australia are risking much in the vain and desperate search for economic prosperity. Only a government that recognises initiative and rewards productivity can hope to meet their ambitions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have here the latest in gimmickry and public relations activity from the Hawke Government. This little capsule was sent out by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) under his responsibilities for administering the new changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. It is 10 inches long-or 25 centimetres, for those who are up with metrics. It was sent out by Australia Post to some 30,000 doctors, we were told, and over 5,000 pharmacists in Australia. The cost is not yet clear, but it is apparent that it would be somewhere between $40,000 and $50,000. The amazing thing about it is that this is the fourth time the same information has been sent out to pharmacists. They are outraged.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make an appeal to the Premier of Queensland, Mike Ahern, to end his attack on low income families in that State-those families which receive the Federal Government's family assistance supplement and which live in Queensland Housing Commission homes. The Federal Government gives $55 a week to a family with two children, but the State Government in Queensland is taking $8 of that $55 by increasing the rent on Housing Commission homes. If the State Government wants to help people in that State, it ought not to be putting a 15 per cent tax on children and a 15 per cent tax on the family. The rents being charged in that State ought not to include the family assistance supplement as part of the gross household income. It already takes about 23 per cent of all the income of people in Housing Commission homes and it is doing nothing to address the poverty of people in the low income groups. There are some 29,000 homes in the Housing Commission stock in that State and my estimate is that somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 families are being affected by this special indirect tax that the Queensland Government is putting on low income families. It ought to stop. It is disgraceful. It should not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The State Government ought to be working with the Federal Government to address poverty in this nation so that no-one needs to live in poverty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Deputy Prime Minister to report to the House on his visit yesterday to the Cyclone Aivu disaster area in northern Queensland. Can the Minister assure the House that the Commonwealth will support fully the disaster relief efforts?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1132" SPEAKER="Bowen The Hon L.F." NAMEID="ZE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSFORD-SMITH" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In company with the honourable member for Herbert, I visited the Aivu disaster area. The area concerned is immediately south of Townsville. I am aware that the honourable member for Dawson is also visiting the area. I did that at the request of the Prime Minister. It should be said at the outset that it is deplorable to see an article in the Sydney Morning Herald suggesting that the Prime Minister's absence was due to some improper conduct on his part. Let me make it very clear that the Prime Minister invited me to go on his behalf because he had an obligation, a commitment, to farewell the Australian armed forces contingent which was setting out on its most important mission to Namibia. It is the largest contingent of Australian soldiers deployed overseas since the Vietnam war. I think everybody would understand the reason why the Prime Minister had that obligation. I know that the Leader of the Opposition also attended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cyclone was one of major force, equivalent to that of Tracy. Fortunately, it crossed the coast just south of Townsville. Had it crossed at Townsville it would have caused massive damage. However, it caused extensive damage to a number of areas such as Ayr, Home Hill, Brandon, Giru, Mingela, Ravenswood and others. The damage was to the sugar crop in particular, but there was also damage to homes and business areas. I pay a tribute to all those who took part immediately in assisting those who have suffered as a result of the damage. There was one fatality but it was due to drowning. It was one that perhaps could have been avoided if the person concerned had availed himself of assistance offered. That is regrettable. However, there were no real casualties and that is very fortunate.</PARA>
<PARA> The real issue is that the emergency service personnel were there in time to deal with the issues. The forecasting of the cyclone was very accurate as to its point of entry and, accordingly, the emergency services were well prepared. The Army deserves the highest praise. It has sent 135 soldiers to the area and has done magnificent work. It has worked day and night and has provided no end of assistance to the people concerned. I think some 400 tarpaulins have already been used. We must also praise the emergency services of Queensland and the police in those areas, who have worked incessantly throughout the whole period.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been damage to the sugar crop and buildings, but the operation has been handled so efficiently that I would think by this weekend most services will have been restored to normal. There are problems from the point of view of lack of power and lack of adequate refrigeration and electricity. However, I understand that all those will be catered for by next Saturday.</PARA>
<PARA> The question usually raised at this time is what the financial commitments of governments will be. State governments have primary responsibility, but it is significant that the Commonwealth government is always able to give, and does, substantial assistance when national disasters take place. In other words, there is a scheme whereby assistance is given by the Commonwealth on a 75 per cent basis when a State reaches a certain level. The State of Queensland has reached that level. As a matter of fact, it appears that Queensland always reaches that level, whether there is a drought or a flood. There are substantial problems in that State from the point of view of droughts, floods, storms and cyclones, and the Commonwealth makes a substantial contribution. I also pay tribute to the Natural Disasters Organisation-Captain MacDonald, who was responsible for coordination-and the emergency services people in Townsville, who organised the whole of the relief program.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the intensity of the cyclone and the problems that might be faced with flooding, a remarkably successful operation was carried out by all concerned-not only by the Army and the Air Force but by all those who participated. So when we talk about monetary assistance from the Commonwealth we should also mention the services made available through service personnel. For the benefit of the House I table a list of the payments made for natural disaster relief. I think the list encompasses Hansard's requirements. Madam Speaker, if you see fit I ask that they be incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I ask: What is the Government's response to Vietnam's announcement of the withdrawal of its troops from Cambodia by September 1989?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1134" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government-as do, I am sure, all honourable members in the House-welcomes the announcement that Vietnamese troops will be withdrawn from Cambodia by September this year. We express the hope that that stated intention of withdrawal will be completed in the time frame that has been announced. There is no doubt that this will represent an enormously hopeful step in the tragic history of that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We note that Vietnam proposes to re-convene the 1954 International Control Commission to supervise the withdrawal and the cessation of military assistance to the Cambodian factions. As honourable members would be aware, Australia has consistently called for the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia because we have seen that as a necessary pre-condition for any settlement in that country.</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and I recently had discussions with a number of the parties involved in the Cambodian problem. During my recent visit to the region I indicated to Prime Minister Chatichai that in view of Australia's longstanding interest in and concern about this matter we were prepared to take a constructive approach to Australia's possible involvement in those settlement processes if such involvement was sought by the parties most directly concerned in the resolution of the conflict. It is a measure of Australia's standing in the region and the work of the Government since 1983 that Thailand wants Australia to participate in that peace process. While there are still difficulties which need to be resolved, we remain hopeful that all parties will make continued and determined efforts to advance the peace process. The need for an agreement among the Cambodian factions remains of fundamental importance if a permanent and peaceful resolution is to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the fact that the Vietnamese troops are now going to be on their way out of Cambodia is yet a further demonstration of the way in which the international situation is moving in a positive direction at the moment. I have said-I was very interested to hear Mrs Thatcher say something very similar yesterday-that we are living in very hopeful times. It is important in these circumstances that Australians should adjust their vision to these far-reaching and rapid changes, that we should look ahead and think positively.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that it is unfortunate, but nevertheless predictable, that according to press reports today the Opposition parties are preparing yet again to prescribe for this country an irrelevant and indigestible dose of backward thinking on foreign policy, consistent with their approach on every matter of importance to this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his interesting question. I would be delighted to inform him and the House of the most recent figures released, indicating that the level of unemployment in Australia has fallen to 6.2 per cent, which the Prime Minister will be pleased to hear in relation to his seven-year comparisons is the lowest level of unemployment for seven years. It is perhaps important to remember that when we came to office the unemployment rate was hovering around 10 per cent; there was double digit unemployment. We have been able to reduce the level by almost 4 percentage points. This is part of a consistent decline which has occurred during the period of this Government. It is also important to remember that, while we talk about statistics, behind the statistics lie real people who have gained an opportunity to get into the labour market and who have therefore obviously been relieved from a position of near poverty as a result of their inability previously to get into the labour market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now give some of the more specific figures. In the March quarter of 1989-it is always important to look at the trends in quarters rather than just month by month-the seasonally adjusted unemployment level fell by 7,800 to 539,000 people, which is 59,000 or almost 10 per cent less than the same quarter a year ago. Employment has risen by 1.2 per cent and the labour force participation rate has increased from 62.4 to 62.8 per cent. The number of teenage unemployed looking for full time work has fallen by 4,200, or 17.4 per cent less than it was in the same March quarter of 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 the Government has seen the creation of 1.3 million jobs or a growth of 21.1 per cent. Two-thirds of that growth has been in the area of full time employment. The rate of unemployment has been reduced by nearly a third and there has been a reduction by half in the number of teenagers out of work and looking for a full time job. There has been a rise in labour force participation from 60.6 per cent to 62.2 per cent and a rise in female participation from 44.8 per cent to 51.5 per cent. This speaks volumes for the success of the Government's approach, bearing in mind the parlous situation in which we found the labour market when we came to office.</PARA>
<PARA> When we look at what happened in the few years before we came to office, we find that from 1979 to 1983 unemployment actually went up by 280,000, representing an increase of 68 per cent. Between 1984 and 1989 the unemployment figure has actually come down by a staggering 22 per cent. It is perfectly clear that the coalition parties are the unemployment experts and the Australian Labor Party is quite clearly the job creation expert.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of allegations which have been made suggesting that there has been some fraud or corruption on the part of officers of the ACT Administration. As the responsible Minister, I completely reject that assertion, particularly the assertion that at senior levels in the ACT Administration fraud and corruption are common.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me outline the facts. The ACT Administration last year, like other Commonwealth departments, was required to adopt new and special strategies to combat fraud in its operations. It therefore established an investigations unit to promote anti-fraud strategies and encourage greater staff awareness of the means of combating fraud. The way that unit operates is to conduct preliminary investigations. If matters are specifically drawn to its attention, they are referred to the Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot emphasise too much that the great bulk of these investigations is concerned with fraud by members of the public against particular departmental operations and services. Suggestions were made in today's Canberra Times that one investigation involving false invoices for concrete and other civil works had resulted in a series of charges being laid. The suggestion in the article that that was evidence of considerable corruption at every level of the administration is a breathtaking allegation without any kind of substance at all. It has been my practice as Minister to refer any allegations of improper conduct or fraud to the appropriate authorities. Whenever such an allegation is made the person who makes the allegation is asked to refer it either to me or to the appropriate authority.</PARA>
<PARA> During the recent ACT election, such allegations were made by one candidate, a Mr Collaery. I asked him to provide me with information. He did so. I referred that to the appropriate authorities for investigation and they provided advice that there was no basis upon which any prosecution could be made. I table that correspondence as evidence of the general practice.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that I believe it is important, for the purposes of community satisfaction, that where these generalised allegations of fraud or improper practices are made, they ought to be dealt with specifically and in a way which protects the reputation of the many thousands of dedicated public servants who can be caught up in a generalised smear.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that there are approximately 17,500 employees in the ACT Administration. At the present time there are three investigations into complaints about three separate officers. That being the case, there is no possible foundation for the generalised assertion which has been made and I repudiate that assertion.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr HAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In deference to the honourable member, I appreciate the thought behind the honourable member's question. He has discussed Aboriginal affairs issues with me on a number of occasions and he has shown quite an interest. The point he raises is quite a detailed and complex one, as he would appreciate, but in recent times, particularly whilst I have been the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, we have been attempting to put in place and have now put in place in a substantial number of areas actual plans and strategies developed by the communities together with the Department and other agencies. The problem raised by the auditor is longstanding. It is a product of a system that has been in place for a long time. As I said in December 1987, the system needs substantial overhaul. This is not a criticism of the work force employed in the portfolio area. The system has been created and developed over a long period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The short answer is that we are working on programs and policies which will address substantially, under the new structure, the questions the Auditor raises. In the interim, we have been moving in that direction as best we can, without disrupting the communities involved, to address the questions raised by the Auditor. The point which the honourable member raises is very important and is one which we have been attending to and will continue to attend to until such time as we get it exactly right.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make the point that this company trades Australia- wide. I have had a number of complaints from Queensland, including one from the Attorney-General of Queensland asking me to guarantee that some action will be taken under the Trades Practices Act. There are State laws which can be used, but of course Queensland has not got the laws. There can be State prosecutions in Western Australia, but they do not operate in respect of the area about which the honourable member is concerned. There can be laws dealing with fraud, misrepresentation and matters of that nature. It appears that Queensland has not got fair trading legislation. A recent editorial in the Courier-Mail commented:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Stories of consumers being ripped off do seem to emerge in this state with monotonous regularity.</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Queensland has had to rely largely on publicity, rather than having power for tough prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter has been considered by the Trade Practices Commission because the Commission can take an interest on the basis that there would be an infringement of the Trade Practices Act, according to the criteria of what is called misleading or unconscionable behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA> This particular firm apparently advertises `fixed price' contracts. Many home buyers, particularly first home buyers, think that that means a fixed price. However, there are many unusual conditions in the contract. If the building is not started within 60 days, the price escalates. It is no surprise that building never starts within 60 days, so the price continually escalates. People are bound by a contract which has no fixed price in it. I am delighted to see the honourable gentleman opposite nodding his agreement. It is well known to Queenslanders. There have been many complaints about this particular organisation. I welcome the question by the honourable gentleman and make the point that the Trade Practices Commission is investigating these complaints. If we can get enough evidence there will be prosecutions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to the fact that the discriminatory grants to the Northern Territory land councils from mining royalty payments have increased from $700,000 a year under the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Minister Holding, to $4.9m a year since the present Minister took over the portfolio. I ask the Minister: How does he justify these grants for the administration of land councils when the funds involved would have otherwise gone to addressing the pressing needs of health, housing and education in these communities? Secondly, is it not a fact that the buying of political support in this way has fostered local dissatisfaction-perhaps the honourable member for the Northern Territory can tell us something about that-and support for smaller land councils? Thirdly, will the Minister advise the House when he intends to release the annual reports of the Northern Territory land councils?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a fairly long question; I am not sure whether the honourable member knows what he is asking. It is a well-established fact that members on the other side do not like the Northern Land Council, and I suppose it is fair and understandable that they come in here and give it a bit of a crack around the ears. The funding given to the council is in order, and is audited accordingly. So there are no relevant questions to be answered about audits and annual reports. We know the honourable member's attitude to the Northern Land Council and in fact to any other progressive thinking Aboriginal organisation. I used to serve on a committee with him, so I know what his attitude to these people is. It is a longstanding view, and on this occasion he has chosen to give them a bit of a biff around the ears. As to what is termed in the media and by others as the breakaway land council proposals, the establishment of new land councils in the Northern Territory, I established a review of that. That is well documented. The report arrived in my office yesterday. I will be making judgments on that preliminary report in the not too distant future. Everything in regard to these requests for new land councils has been done in the proper way. I will not be bullied by people in the Senate, I will not be bullied by people using the media, to try to force the issue. There is a proper way to do these things, and that is the way they will always be done.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In view of the forced eviction of three Chilean leaders of the National Telephone Union from the Australian Embassy in Chile, is the Government concerned that Australia will be viewed by the international community as inadvertently condoning the activities of the Bond Corporation in its insensitive treatment of the Chilean Telephone Company (CTC) employees, particularly as I understand the unionists were subsequently savagely beaten by security authorities? Would it not be appropriate for the Government to use its influence with the Bond Corporation to have the dismissed employees reinstated and retrained in alternative skills, as is Government policy in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In February this year the Australian Embassy in Santiago was occupied on two occasions by members of the telephone union Sinate, one of the 18 unions involves in the Chilean Telephone Co., in which the Bond Corporation has a controlling interest. The unionists were seeking, amongst other things, to involve the Australian Government in their dispute with CTC management over retrenchments. The issue, which is a labour dispute, is essentially a matter between the registered unions and the management of CTC-a private company registered and operating in Chile. The Australian Government regards the occupation of the Embassy as illegal, disrupting the Embassy's normal activities and placing Embassy staff at risk. On the first occasion that the Embassy was occupied the unionists voluntarily left after 29 hours, but on the second occasion they refused to leave after a four-day sit-in. The Embassy, acting under instructions, arranged for the unionists to be conducted from the Embassy by six guards from a private security firm contracted to handle security at the Embassy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Contrary to public statements following the second sit-in, I am advised that the security guards were not armed and that the three unionists were neither blindfolded nor gagged. I am further advised that they were not detained, interrogated or in any way maltreated. Of course the Australian Government regrets these incidents but regards the actions taken by the Embassy in Chile as necessary and appropriate in the circumstances, and fully consistent with the stand that Australia has taken in respect of human rights in Chile.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity the honourable member for Canning has given me to answer this question. I can understand his concern about it because he has applied his efforts very effectively to secure for his electorate in excess of $11m, including about $5m for local government. I understand that there is some arrangement between the Country Shire Councils Association in Western Australia and the Western Australian motorist organisation to do what the honourable member for Canning has referred to as a possibility. I think it is petulant, childish and very possibly illegal. It is very likely that it will also be counterproductive. Under the provisions of the Australian bicentennial road development program there is a requirement that local authorities maintain the signs put up to indicate to people in the community the nature of the program and, in addition, that no signs should be placed adjacent to ABRD signs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would not like the funding for local government in Western Australia or in any other State to be placed in jeopardy, but some type of legal obligation could be placed on us to ensure that the provisions of the law relating to such road funding programs were kept intact. The unfortunate thing is that all local authorities-the 850 councils over the whole of Australia-know that under the road funding program the Federal Government has taken the opportunity to index the funds for local government to make sure that the value of those funds is retained in real terms. So why an exercise of this kind should be undertaken I do not know. During the six years of the Hawke Government the amount that has gone to local authorities over Australia for local roads has been increased in real terms by almost 10 per cent. This is a very foolish and, as I said, very likely counterproductive and very possibly an illegal exercise for the organisations concerned to undertake. I hope that they rethink this politically motivated exercise and that the local authorities do not participate in it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose the following matter of public importance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of Government policy and the collapse of effective administration in Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is founded on three grounds: the collapse of effective administration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio, which is to do with Australia's most disadvantaged cultural group; the abject failure of Government policy in this area; and the failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to act responsibly in response to the crisis in public administration of Aboriginal Affairs. Never since the Commonwealth became involved in Aboriginal matters have Aboriginal Australians been treated as shabbily as they have been by this Government. First we had hopeless Holding and now we have hapless Hand: hapless because of his maladministration, hapless because he will not listen and hapless because his policy is in tatters. His judgment is flawed, his administrative skills are pitiful and his personal management abilities are abysmal. We also have a Prime Minister who has delayed and procrastinated in regard to the difficulties of the chaos and shambles in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, if not swept them under the carpet. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are terrible twins, as the honourable member for Menzies suggests. As we have already heard, the policy directions of this Government were described in a report of 9 March as being out of date, unrealistic, irrelevant, immeasurable, ambiguous and too narrow. What an indictment. This Government has been in office for over six years, and statements such as this are still being made about the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. The report went on to say that the portfolio is budget driven rather than policy driven. Here we have a Government and a Minister who do not have any set policies which will contribute to the welfare of the Aboriginal and Islander people in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Accountability has become virtually non-existent in this portfolio. The recently released report of the special audit into the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) shows a portfolio in deep crisis. It is interesting that the Government brought it into the House right at the end of the last session. I just want to go over and highlight some of the issues which were raised in it. The Department was unable to confirm that funds it provided for over 1,700 projects had been expended on the purposes for which they had been provided. Of course, we heard in Question Time today that 783 grants, worth over $67m, remain unacquitted. The total, which is not known, could well exceed over $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> Compliance with grant conditions was found to be inadequate for almost all grants examined by the Auditor-General-grants ranging in value from $35,000 to over $2m. Thirty-eight per cent of DAA hospitality expenditure directly contravened guidelines. A sample of eight senior officers-ASO7 and above-showed that five did not maintain any attendance records. A senior officer put forward his own daughter as a member of a delegation from an institution with which she had no association. Supervisors were endorsing staff members' attendance records without any check of the calculations or days. There were serious defects in Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) enterprise projects, the outcome of defective approval procedures and management controls. </PARA>
<PARA> The portfolio is in a shambles and the question has to be asked, `If Westminster responsibility means anything, is this Minister culpable?'. He has undermined his own administration to the detriment of the Aboriginal and Islander community. He has been non-existent as a legislator. He has been a disaster as an administrator. He has been a disaster for the Government by repeatedly misleading the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. The Minister is going to say, `I am coming in here and I am doing the things which you have highlighted in the last six months in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and other areas of my portfolio'. We warned the Government about the difficulties in a minority report back in May 1985. This is what we said:</PARA>
<PARA>We recommend that there should be a comprehensive judicial inquiry into the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1985. It has not happened. We went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee became aware of the possible commission of criminal offences, the occurrence of serious administrative malpractice and gross mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, four years later, the same things are being said. The Minister will suggest that ATSIC is going to solve all these problems. We have had this Government's administration in Aboriginal affairs and it gives nobody-not this Parliament or the Aboriginal people-any confidence that any structure proposed by this Government will solve the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, but very early on in this Minister's reign as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he actually deleted a key accountability condition from the Department's grants guidelines. The clause gave the Minister the right to suspend funding an organisation where a person holding office is not a fit and proper person or is acting in a manner prejudicial to its interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister deleted, took out, accountability. No doubt, that is one of the reasons why there is the mess that we see today in Aboriginal affairs. It was an eminently defensible check if one believes in accountability. The Minister removed it. The Minister did not want to have the power to be able to protect an organisation and its client group from a person who was unfit for his or her office. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Auditor-General-in a touch of understatement-suggests that in view of the findings of the audit the Government and the Parliament may wish to review the business enterprise provisions in the ATSIC Bill. So, even the Auditor-General is saying that there ought to be another good look had at this proposal by the Government. The bunglings and shambles in the administration of Aboriginal Affairs could never be so debilitating as under this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the morale and the sackings which have occurred in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. This Minister has shown a total lack of interest in the administration of his portfolio, his agenda was radical reform. He was not going to allow himself to be distracted by the Sir Humphreys of this city. During the early months of his administration, the Minister did not even speak with the Secretary of his Department. There was a period when he went for over three months without discussing matters with the Secretary. The Secretary even had to justify appointments to the Minister's Senior Private Secretary. That was the situation which had arisen in Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth pays millions of dollars for policy advice, yet this Minister prefers to take his advice from the Northern Territory land councils and hired consultants. The Department did not even consider the ATSIC legislation before it was tabled in the House. Maybe that is one of the reasons why the legislation is in such a mess. The Minister shuts out his Department; he ignores it. Not only that, but when submissions were made to the Minister he did not even acknowledge them, as in the case of the ADC Board's submission on ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA> When agencies in the Minister's portfolio were criticised in the special audit report, the Minister did not defend their record. He claimed the Pontius Pilate defence-he washed his hands, saying that he had no control and that they were self-destructing anyway. What an indictment of a Minister. Here is a Minister who needs to be building up the morale of his Department so that it might be able to do something for the Aboriginal people, but the Minister shows no confidence whatsoever in his Department. The record shows that it has been the Minister who has been destructive in this whole affair, not the coalition. The coalition has been calling this Government to account in Aboriginal matters. The Minister dismissed eight Aboriginals, the most senior Aboriginal people in administration in this country. They were dismissed from the ADC board for not supporting his proposal. He failed to give them any reasons for their dismissal or even to thank them. That is the sort of personnel relations this Minister has with his Department. He failed to defend the integrity of the ADC as a statutory authority when the Chairman and the General Manager were abused by the new board and, of course, we all know that he sacked his departmental head. </PARA>
<PARA> The chickens have come home to roost. There has been a massive exodus of senior and experienced staff from the portfolio. Since July 1988 more than a dozen senior staff have left the Department and the Commission, including the departmental secretary, a deputy secretary, two ADC general managers and a deputy general manager. In February alone 14 staff at all levels left the ADC within the first two weeks. That means that there would be a total turnover in that area of the Minister's portfolio within one year. The former Acting General Manager of the Aboriginal Development Commission in an open letter to staff has noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Restrictions on the permanent filling of positions are causing considerable stress to many staff who are required to work long hours to ensure an efficient delivery of service to our clients. </PARA>
<PARA>According to Mr Wyatt, Mr Bill Grey, the new Secretary to the Department, has acknowledged a similar effect in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Let me read out an independent description, in a letter from which we have already heard parts:</PARA>
<PARA>Morale is at an abysmal level, and members despair of ever being able to do their jobs properly. They have inadequate resources, especially of staff, to adequately deliver services and programs to the clients. There are . . . alarming rates of resignation and sick leave . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real and extremely urgent need for some stability to be put back into the working lives of members in the DAA and ADC. It is unambiguously clear that when, or even if, ATSIC ever gets established the vibrancy and enthusiasm desired for the new organisation must necessarily be absent as spirits are now so low. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need for decisions to be made about the shorter term administration of the DAA and ADC. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter did not come from a Liberal Party stooge. It came from Ann Forward, who is the National President of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association and a member of the national executive. Ann Forward is simply trying to get this Minister to give his portfolio a fair go. The implications of the latest Forward letter are a salutary warning to the Government. The portfolio is so demoralised that not only is the ATSIC reform package unachievable but also the very viability of Commonwealth administration of Aboriginal affairs advancement programs is threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government's legislative program in Aboriginal affairs is in absolute tatters. This Minister has brought forward only one proposal in his period in office. The Minister has failed to proclaim the land rights legislation which was passed in May 1987, preventing Aboriginal people from owning land in certain areas in the Northern Territory. The coalition policy on ATSIC is very clear. It is interesting to note that this legislation, which this Minister is pinning his hopes on, is now undergoing radical surgery. The recommendations of the Senate Select Committee are very close to the coalition's policy. I suggest that the Minister heed those recommendations and take up those policy suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government's policy in this area, of symbolism, separatism and perpetual guilt, has absolutely failed. It must be asked how long this Prime Minister will allow this discredited Minister to bungle the administration of disadvantaged services to the most disadvantaged cultural group in our nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yet again we have had to listen to a performance by a person who, quite frankly, has no appreciation or understanding of the portfolio area. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has shown that time and time again. One of the quotations he used-he hung his hat on it a lot-cannot in fact be attributed to the Auditor-General; it is in the Auditor-General's report, but it refers to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs setting up a working party to look at the very question the honourable member was talking about. So he has not even read the Auditor-General's report correctly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member refers to a lack of legislation. In December 1987 we brought a proposal into this place by way of a major statement. I had been only a few months in the job. That statement attempted to address what is a tired and worn out system of administration in the portfolio area. Since December 1987 I have striven to bring about the necessary changes to improve the service delivery to Aboriginal people in this country. I have insisted on accountability at all levels. There has never been applied the degree of accountability-or been such a desire by anyone to apply it-that I have applied in this portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The honourable member, along with his colleagues in the Senate, has been engaged in this exercise. He comes in here today expressing concern about the work force in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. How dare he come in here and say that! His Party during the last six months has accused so many people of so many things with little proof for its accusations. He has no understanding because he has hardly ever been in an office of the Department. He is considered an absolute joke amongst the departmental work force because of his lack of understanding. One has only to read the honourable member's press releases-indeed, one ought to read them-to see that he is so out of touch. They are written by him or someone else who has no appreciation of Aboriginal affairs. The honourable member never worries about hurting people's feelings, let alone the innocent, particularly the officers of the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member quoted a letter today from Ann Forward. Big deal! Last year he quoted another letter from Ann Forward which was leaked to him. The letter quoted today is no news to me. The letter deals with the question of morale. The honourable member should have listened to what I have been saying about work force morale in my Department. I go out and talk to the workers where they do their jobs. The people, the workers, are most crooked on those cowards, those abysmal human beings, who sneak in under the door of this place and under the door of the chamber over there and make all sorts of accusations about my work force. It is not fair. That is why morale is so low. </PARA>
<PARA> Again we have a Senate Estimates committee meeting with 400 or 500 more questions slapped on the table with a week's notice, causing people to have to work day and night, interrupting the flow of program delivery because of the increased workload. It is the design of honourable members opposite to disrupt program delivery. The honourable member has made no secret of that. He has been bragging for about three weeks about how he is going to destroy me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite have been making all sorts of accusations about how my head is on the block again. I have news for them. My head is not on the block. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) is going to happen because the present system is tired and worn out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The work force is striving, like no other department, to maintain a system that is tired, a system which was inherited, and which has developed over the years but which does not meet a whole range of needs. I agreed on the point raised by a National Party member, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), at Question Time. We are striving to meet the suggestions made in the Auditor-General's report, suggestions such as that there be more involvement of people, the development of long term and short term strategies and plans for communities and organisations. That is an ongoing process. If one looks at the record while I have been the Minister one will see that it is one of the gains we have made. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) will know from our travels around the community as members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, it was obvious to everybody that the system was not working. The Standing Committee is still recognising the need for more and more to be done. We have new strategies and programs. We have sat down with the communities in the Torres Strait. We have sat down with the people in the central reserves. We are pumping money into those reserves, but not in a way that means we will have to go back in four years' time and fix it all up again. We are combining the employment, education, health and housing programs of government and pulling them all together. We are totally involving Aboriginal people in the development of those programs. That is where the system has not been able to cope. That is why we are moving into a new era. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of 1978 to mid-1987, alluded to in the report, are a product of the past. If the honourable member opposite wants me to go through the performance blow by blow of the problems faced by every Minister in this portfolio, if we could get an hour or so, I would be happy to do it. Just as the honourable member, in a cheap political way, points the bone at me and says `This program failed under you, or failed under someone else', I could do the same to him. Aboriginal affairs is an incredibly difficult area to work in. It is an incredibly difficult area to administer in terms of government and programs. The most important thing is that the new policies we are trying to get through the Senate do get through. And we will get them through the Senate, because it is proper to involve Aboriginal people in the development and implementation of programs that affect their lives. That is what we are trying to do. That is what has been missing. That is why there have been so many failures-because people from the Parliament have gone out on a few hours visit, walked around with the latest fashionable hat on, had a look at the area and said, `Golly, we have to do something about this'. They come back, pressure the Minister, heap a bit of abuse on the Department and the next minute something is done. We are trying at all levels and especially at the community level to involve Aboriginal people in the development of the programs. We will get away from decisions made at a central level, where there is not enough flexibility, to those programs which work better in the relevant areas through community involvement. That is what we should all be trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mind members of the Opposition getting up here at Question Time and having a bit of a swipe at me about what the Auditor's report says. I encouraged the Government to obtain all those reports. I want the whole lot out on the table. If members of the Opposition were smart, they would have done the same thing because the history of Aboriginal affairs is littered with mistakes. But by golly, I have to say that most of those mistakes were not made by Aboriginal people. They were made by people who thought they knew best and inflicted ideas and programs on them. Those days have to change. So all of these reports that have been obtained-the Auditor's report and the Public Service report-should all be put on the table. Let us have a look at them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we are moving into a new era. There has not been one amendment from the honourable member for Braddon. We had a debate on one of the most far-reaching pieces of legislation ever introduced into this Parliament, to quote a prominent journalist in the gallery. We had not one suggested amendment coming from members of the Opposition, but there was total opposition to it. For the members of the Opposition there was nothing good in it at all and there was no way it could be improved. Then it gets held up in the Senate. We have been through the report of the Senate Select Committee that was developed over a six-month period. I do not want to be too critical of members of the Senate. They are a much more reserved and quieter bunch than we are, but they were a bit selective about where they went. They did not travel everywhere. They certainly never did a fraction of the travel I did, but I respect their right to conduct their affairs in their own way. They have conducted their affairs in their own way and have brought down a report. There is no great problem with that. We have had a look at the report. I am an accommodating person. I have said to this character, the honourable member for Braddon, time and time again, `If you have a problem, Chris, come and have a yarn'. The honourable members in that little corner over there are knocking on the door every day. They come in and want to fix up the problems for the people they represent. That is the difference, mate, between them and you. The honourable member does not represent Aboriginal people in this place. I disagree with members of the National Party on policy, but by golly if they have a problem in their electorate they are into my office like Flynn and they try to get the problem fixed up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was talking about the approach of people who have a lot to do with Aboriginal people and the difference in their approach to that of the honourable member for Braddon. The honourable member talked about the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). That is extraordinary and something that I cannot understand, given the approach of members of the Opposition to the ADC. They have constantly told me, `Don't put a glove on the ADC'. I have had resolutions through the Senate condemning me for my attacks on the ADC-which have never really been attacks. Whenever I have moved to do anything there has been the rumour around that I am moving to do something in the ADC. If I talk to somebody in it, comment is made by the Opposition. To quote Senator Peter Baume-I think I can do it off the top of my head-he said, `If it is not losing money, don't touch it'. That is what he said on the radio the morning after the Senate report came out. For God's sake, members of the Opposition should have a look at that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, it is totally wrong for the commissioners solely to be blamed for the mistakes of the ADC. We do not want to do that. It is also wrong to blame the work force of the ADC. I have been trying to tell members of the National Party and the rest of the country that the system operates on two parallel structures. In communities or towns there is an ADC officer on one side of the passage and a departmental officer on the other side of the passage. That is a crazy waste of resources. This is not a good utilisation of resources. That is what I tried to tell members of the Opposition in December 1987. Over there, through your friends in the Senate, I have been prevented from improving things. The people on the Senate Select Committee could have come to me with every single recommendation they made. They could have said, `Look, Gerry, this is not the right way to go. We reckon that if you do this or do that it will improve the legislation'. They did not do that. They were engaged in an exercise of holding up the legislation. They do not care about the portfolio; they are trying to denigrate me and get my scalp so that the honourable member for Braddon can get a score on the board. That will not happen either. The fact is that the programs are now working better, there are more of them, and they will continue to improve. The Auditor's report will be addressed, as it has been addressed in other years by other Ministers. All the matters mentioned in the report from the Department's point of view will be addressed. I look forward to next week as I will be able to speak a bit more freely about the report when I make a statement with the Prime Minister which goes into the future of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that worries me is that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) said the other day, `God help me if I get Aboriginal Affairs or Veterans' Affairs'. Three members of the Opposition stood outside the door and said, `If Howard rings me up and offers me Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry, I am not going to take the job'. That is what members of the Opposition think about Aboriginal affairs. They are never going to be given an opportunity to get the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure today to discuss this matter of public importance. It is important for us to understand that the public generally is very concerned about the administration of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio by the Federal Labor Government. The matter of public importance states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The failure of Government policy and the collapse of effective administration in Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>I put to the House and to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) that the main reason for that is that the Labor Government has diverted an enormous amount of attention from the proper administration of Aboriginal affairs to setting up its new arrangements with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, which the Aboriginal people do not want. As we know, the Minister has travelled throughout Australia. I have not heard of any group that is interested in the sorts of arrangements that the Government has put forward. Not only that, there is also the proposed treaty which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seems hell bent on putting forward. While the pair of them continue to go around this nation proposing this sort of nonsense, the administration of the portfolio will continue to collapse in a heap. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately for the Minister it starts at the top because he has had to sack Charles Perkins, the leading Aboriginal administrator of this nation. He has actually been dismissed by the Minister. Why was he dismissed? Because of his incompetence and the fact that his administration was full of misspent moneys and back scratching, et cetera. I am not saying that that applies just to Aboriginal people; it applies to all of us. We can all get involved. I think it is a sad indictment for one of the leaders of the Aboriginal people to be dismissed by this Government. He was dismissed because of his incompetence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true. Those are the facts. It is very sad that the Government has placed these leaders in such a position. The Minister continues to go down the track of centralising Aboriginal administration and it cannot work. It does not work for the rest of Australia's administration. In this vast country we have a States arrangement. I agree with the Minister that it is impossible for one person to administer his portfolio effectively. It is absolutely impossible for one human being to do so. One cannot travel throughout the length and breadth of this nation and into the Torres Strait and have effective control over the hundreds of millions of dollars that are granted to Aboriginal affairs by this Parliament. It is important that the taxpayers know and understand that hundreds of millions of dollars are involved. In fact, this financial year there has been a $467m allocation through the Department to look after those people whom the Parliament has selected to help. When one thinks about it one realises that there are not many Aborigines in Australia. The census tells us that there are about 70,000 adults. There are probably a couple of hundred thousand altogether-men, women and children. Yet we seem to be hell bent on trying to rectify their social problems with money and it does not work. The Minister knows it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have now entered my ninth year as a member of this Parliament. I have been a continuing member of the House Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, which was one of the first committees formed by the House of Representatives. There are now many other committees. I am probably the longest continuously serving member of that Committee. I have continued to take an interest in Aboriginal people not only in my electorate but throughout Australia. I know some honourable members will argue that I am a hard right winger, et cetera. I probably am. I have been brought up in a bush environment where one has to be a bit tough. I can tell honourable members that most Aborigines are the same. They are not fools. They do not wish to be governed from Canberra. They like to look after their own affairs at a local level. That is where the States play their part. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is half a million dollars being spent by the Federal Government; we must also add the moneys that every State spends on looking after Aboriginal people. We are looking at about $1 billion. Obviously not all of that will be spent wisely. It is important to understand that many good projects are under way. Of course, we in politics always highlight the bad ones because they are the ones that come to our notice, and I have been to see the Minister about a couple. The coalition is totally opposed to a treaty. We think it is an absolute nonsense. We support the one Australia concept. If we are to pursue the reverse apartheid line in this nation, we will tear ourselves apart. A treaty will do absolutely nothing for Aboriginal people. The Prime Minister seems to be even more keen on a treaty than the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is. God knows why. I cannot see how it will benefit Aboriginal people. Most of them do not even know what it is about. </PARA>
<PARA> Over and above that, the Government is trying to set up a new semi-parliament arrangement, making regions over and above our existing electoral regions. I am the person elected to represent all the Aboriginal people in the electorate of Maranoa. I do that in this place, nobody else. We do not want a so-called pseudo-Aboriginal-he has to be an Aborigine to be their representative-coming down here. The Aboriginal Development Commission is to be disbanded. An important matter which I press continually even on my side of politics is that if representatives are to be elected-not that I support the concept-the elections must be compulsory. Ever since we started funding Aborigines to the extent that we do-most had seen no more money than the basic wage-funding has been rolling into their hands. Some of them have no concept at all of handling the sort of money the Government parcels out to them. Then we wonder why the whole thing falls in a heap and nothing happens. </PARA>

If I decided to set up a commission in Maranoa, put a ring around a group of people and told them that they had to look after their own affairs, although no other section did it, they would make a mess of it too. It cannot be done. I would have thought that the Government would have learnt its lesson from our original set-up. It did not work. People ended up dropping themselves through the roof in Canberra, busting the safe open and pinching money and whatnot. Blokes such as Sugar Ray Robinson in my electorate are elected. Only about 20 people come in on polling day. The rest are manhandled out of the district or driven out of town on the day the election takes places. Unless there are compulsory elections, reasonable Aboriginal people will not be elected. There are a whole lot of standover merchants and rebels within the organisation. Most of the people who are elected are the stirrers in the communities. They are not the reasonable, decent Aboriginal people. There are hundreds of them out there, most of whom are very disappointed with the leadership that is offered.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is most unfortunate that the failure of Government policy has been largely brought about by the attitude of those opposite. Every time something new is put forward by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) or the Government it is derided and criticised by those opposite. As the Minister said quite aptly in his speech, there has not been one positive amendment or thought put forward in that regard by the shadow spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), or by the Opposition since the Minister has held the portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this issue goes back to August 1988. In this very place, on the first day this House met, in an attempt to acknowledge the prior occupation of this country by Aboriginal people and their subsequent dispossession by European settlers, we could not get bipartisan support from those opposite. It is interesting to note that the criticism of those opposite and the Opposition's approach to that motion did not flow just from the Government. Eminent church leaders throughout this nation roundly criticised Opposition members for their approach. Aboriginal leaders and many in the community not connected directly with the Government criticised them for their approach. It is not surprising that the attitude of some of those opposite comes through with the Opposition's approach of knocking everything the Government puts up in relation to Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very pleasing to see Aboriginals sitting in the gallery in this place today. I know Clarrie Grogan and Mick Miller personally. They have worked over many years with governments of different persuasions to better the lot of Aboriginal people. When they sit in this place and see the pathetic attitude of those opposite, they must feel that it is no wonder the whole Aboriginal issue is one of turmoil. We can consider, for example, the actions of those wandering around the country trying to torpedo the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). I refer, in particular, to Senator Boswell and the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Katter. When Senator Boswell addressed Aboriginal councils in far north Queensland he told them that they should pass motions divorcing themselves totally from the ATSIC proposal. He got to the stage of arriving at these council meetings with prepared press statements. He would stick the statements under their noses and say, `Get that through and we'll get a run all over Australia with it'. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of the Opposition is unfortunate. Aboriginal people are beginning to understand that those opposite have no views on Aboriginal issues. I found it rather enlightening that, when addressing the Hopevale Community Council, that luminary Senator Boswell said, `Look, I'm here today to address you on ATSIC, on Aboriginal matters. Whilst I'm not very good on Aboriginal matters, I'm better than anyone else the Opposition has down in Canberra'. That is the sort of attitude of those opposite. I see also that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) has taken some interest in this debate. In an article headed `Hewson: High Flyer with the Magic Touch' in the West Australian of 21 March, the honourable member for Wentworth is reported as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't mind starting at the bottom: If you go into Parliament you expect you might have to start on the back bench or in a junior ministry . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I live in fear of some ministries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He then mentioned the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. That is the attitude of those opposite. We can find numerous such examples in the media. Senator Sheil, for example, referred to `black bludgers and stirrers looting the nation'. Unfortunately, that is the attitude of those opposite. It is high time that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) pulled his troops into order in relation to Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of public importance talks of the collapse of effective administration in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA). Senator Tambling has roundly criticised DAA's staff and officials. In addition, Senator Crichton-Browne attacked the DAA staff at Geraldton. Senator Tambling attacked the DAA staff at Katherine in the Northern Territory. The shadow spokesman for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon, spoke about a lack of confidence and confusion existing within DAA officials. </PARA>
<PARA> The National President of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, Ann Forward, will certainly have to lift her game. How would anyone with any ability in the position of National President leak such a document to the shadow spokesman? It was done last year and he made a mess of it. He made a mess again today. If the organisation has a gripe and it does not want to speak to the Minister, it should get someone with some competence or ability to represent its thoughts and views in this place. Morale is low in the DAA. </PARA>

However, if honourable members opposite run around the country acting in the way they have over the last 12 or 18 months and continue to do so, they will never get any morale into the Department. Neither will they get any support from the Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted some of the comments of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron). He cannot even get the title of ATSIC right. He called it `Aztec'. He talked about centralisation of powers. The major thrust of ATSIC is to get decision-making into the regional areas, not centralise it in Canberra. The honourable member does not even know that. Honourable members should bear in mind that the matter has not come up in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, so the honourable member may not have had the opportunity of reading the legislation and the Senate committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this note: The worst possible outcome for Aboriginal people would be for us to sit here in this place and carry out a slanging match. The criticism that has been poured on those opposite with respect to their attitude to a number of Aboriginal issues does not come solely from this side of the House. As I said earlier, eminent church leaders have roundly criticised the Opposition for its policies and its attitude to Aboriginal affairs. Eminent Aboriginal leaders and members of the community generally have made such criticism. Any criticism being made does not come solely from this side of the House. That is a very telling factor because, if church leaders and other members of the community also criticise honourable members opposite, as I said earlier, it is high time the Leader of the Opposition got his troops in order. I assure the shadow spokesman on Aboriginal affairs that the the Leader of the Opposition will not get the number wrong the next time he rings him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the Committee's 296th report entitled The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament-Reform of the Australian Audit Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-It gives me enormous pleasure to present this report. The inquiry which led to the report was the first comprehensive governmental or parliamentary inquiry into the Australian Audit Office since the Office of the Auditor-General was established at Federation in 1901. I note with great pleasure that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, and the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), were both participants in the Public Accounts Committee during the period of this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 88 years since Federation government and parliament have changed dramatically and the purpose and conduct of audits have also been transformed. The Committee examined the role of the Australian Audit Office and the Auditor-General in the light of those changes. I stress that the report stands as an objective assessment of the need to reform the Audit Office and is above party political considerations. The Committee believes that the report will be an enduring contribution to the reform of parliamentary democracy in Australia. It is a document relevant to the reform of the Audit Office, not just at the Federal level but in the States, the Territories and prob- ably in other jurisdictions as well. It is a document unashamedly of the Parliament, for the Parliament and the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference for the inquiry were to investigate, first, whether the Australian Audit Office had kept pace with developments in regard to the public audit function in the States and Territories and in com- parable countries. This question was answered with a conditional no. Second, the Committee inquired whether current arrangements guaranteed the independence and resources necessary for the Australian Audit Office to fulfil its role as determined by the Audit Act 1901. The answer to this question was no. It must be pointed out that the reasons for these negative answers were largely outside the control of the Auditor-General and the Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General and the Australian Audit Office are responsible for reassuring Parliament that all governments' financial management and financial statements are sound. Considering the billions of dollars that the Commonwealth Government collects, manages and spends on behalf of all Australians, such reassurance is the foundation of the citizens' belief in government. Without the Auditor-General's examination and reports on Commonwealth accounts, Parliament, and ultimately the Australian people, have less reason to feel confident of any statements of a department or statutory authority about its income and expenditure. Therefore, a strong and independent Auditor-General and Australian Audit Office are fundamental to the credibility of audit opinions and the effectiveness of the Auditor-General and his staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Independence has a diminished practical value unless the Auditor-General has the human and material resources to exercise his responsibility. This report addresses the resources question by comparing three approaches to determining how many resources an Auditor-General requires. In theory, either the Auditor-General, Parliament or Government can determine how many resources are necessary for audit. The inquiry compared and contrasted how these approaches worked in different countries. It concluded that the least desirable basis for maintaining the Auditor-General's and the Audit Office's independence and resources was where the Executive Government determined audit resources. Australia is one of the few comp- arable countries in the world where Government has such influence over decisions on audit resources. The ideal situation is where either the Auditor-General makes a professional decision on how many resources are necessary for him, or her, to be able to give an opinion on a government's accounts or where Parliament makes that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canadian Auditor-General has a very great discretion over how many resources he needs. The Committee rejected this model for Australia as unsuitable. The Committee's recommendation was for Parliament to decide how many resources it wanted to allocate for audit. This approach has been adopted by the British Parliament in recent years with the support of both Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General audits the Government's accounts on behalf of Parliament and through Parliament, as I have said on behalf of the Australian people. The Committee believed that, fundamental to reform of the Australian Audit Office, was a more open and clear acknowledgment by Parliament that this was the case. Consistent with this emphasis, the Committee recommended the establishment of an Audit Committee of the Parliament comprising Government and Opposition members and senators and a representative of a minority party, if any, in the Parliament, and chaired by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives alternately. The Audit Committee of Parliament will advise the Auditor-General on Parliament's audit priorities and make recommendations to Parliament on the Audit Office's resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the question of human resources, the Audit Office has, as we all know, many very talented staff. However, in recent years it has lost many able personnel because the salaries of senior and specialist staff have lagged behind incomes available in the private sector. For example, the Australian Audit Office staff member responsible for the audit of the Commonwealth Bank earns from one third to one quarter the income of private sector auditors in charge of the audit of Australia's other large banks. Yet, of course, there is no evidence that the standard of the Commonwealth Bank's audit is any different from private sector audits of large banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Salary differentials between experienced auditors in the private and public sectors are now so substantial that the Audit Office is also having difficulty in recruiting junior staff. Thus, there are two problems. One is how to attract young, new staff and the second is how to maintain senior staff. It is so difficult for the Audit Office to recruit and maintain staff that Parliament must be made aware of the dangers that the current circumstances create for the strength and capacity of the Audit Office. The Committee recommended that the best way to overcome this problem was to establish the Australian Audit Office as a statutory authority, and to give the Auditor-General the authority to determine the terms and conditions of the employment of staff. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of the relationship between auditing and the Auditor- General and a more efficient public sector. The practice of auditing has evolved so that auditors now have techniques to analyse how efficiently government programs are managed. The authority to conduct efficiency audits was introduced into the Audit Act in 1979, following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. Internationally, efficiency audits, or value for money audits as they are sometimes called, utilise a very large part of the General Accounting Office's resources in the United States; while in Canada and the United Kingdom, approximately half of the resources of the national audit office are dedicated to efficiency audits-that is 5 per cent on comparable jurisdictions. By comparison, the Australian Audit Office devoted 6 per cent of its resources to efficiency audits in 1987-88. No witness before our inquiry recommended that this state of affairs should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> To demonstrate the importance of efficiency audits, I recall that one prominent participant in our inquiry made the point to the effect that where an auditor enters an institution to conduct a regularity audit, the person behind the cash register feels under pressure. But where an auditor arrives to conduct an efficiency audit, the permanent secretary or head of the organisation gets nervous. </PARA>
<PARA> A situation wherein only 6 per cent of the Australian Audit Office's resources are set aside for efficiency audits is not compatible with a commitment to increase public sector efficiency. Accordingly, the Committee recommended a major change in the Audit Office's orientation. There can be no reduction in resources for financial and compliance auditing. Therefore, the only way in which more resources can be allocated to efficiency audits to improve public sector efficiency is if more resources are allocated to the Australian Audit Office. The Committee has recommended that an additional $3.1m-a very modest amount-be allocated to the Audit Office in 1989-90. This will increase to an additional $15.7m within five years. Consequently, by 1994-95 approximately 50 per cent of the Australian Audit Office's resources and effort will be for efficiency audits. The effect will be to place increased emphasis on maximising the efficiency of the public sector and so make our Audit Office comparable to other audit offices around the world. I stress that despite differing views held by Committee members on the role and size of the public sector, we are on common ground in believing that whatever the role and size of the public sector it must be both efficient and accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I turn to an issue which lies at the heart of the inquiry, namely the relationship between Executive Government and the Parliament. The year 1988-89 is the 300th anniversary of the drafting in London of the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights was one of the foundations of parliamentary democracy, not just in the United Kingdom but in many other countries around the world including Canada, New Zealand and Australia. One achievement of the Bill of Rights was to assert Executive Government's accountability to the entire Parliament. The 1866 Exchequer and Audit Departments Act of the United Kingdom, on which the Australian Audit Act of 1901 was based, was another milestone in evolution of the accountability of government to Parliament. Indicative of the importance of the Audit Act of 1901 was the fact that it was the fourth Act to be passed by the first Australian Parliament. The report of the inquiry into the Audit Office points to the next step forward to strengthen the public sector's accountability to the Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Political activity in the twentieth century in Australia has been characterised by the increasing domination of Parliament by Executive Government. This increasing domination has occurred whichever political party or coalition has been in power. The results of the inquiry into the Australian Audit Office provide Parliament with an opportunity to strengthen the accountability of Executive Government to Parliament. For this purpose, the Committee has recommended repeal of the Audit Act 1901 and its replacement by two laws-a new Audit Act and a new Financial Administration Act for the Commonwealth. New audit legislation will be a cornerstone of relations between Parliament and Government for the remainder of this century and into the next. It is my deepest hope that this report will be the catalyst for that reform. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> As I look around the parliamentary chamber I notice that most of my colleagues present have had an interest in public accounting. I notice that in the advisers' gallery there are two people, both associated with the Public Accounts Committee report that has just been tabled. As I sneakily look up at the public gallery I even see senior officials of the Auditor-General's Office. But the numbers are not large. Now that the broadcasting of Parliament has gone off the major Australian Broadcasting Corporation stations, I wonder whether anybody might be listening at home.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do make the point, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the future of this nation and this parliamentary democracy depends upon the young people listening to this debate. Their future will very much depend upon whether we have been able, within our parliamentary democracy, to re-establish effectively this Parliament's authority over the Executive. As one looks at the framework of this report one finds that even the parliamentary watchdog is in the hands of the Executive itself. The appointment of the Auditor-General is in the hands of the Executive Government. The amount of money that the Auditor-General has available to carry out his functions is in the hands of the Executive Government. Look at the position of the parliamentary committee that has responsibility for looking at the way in which the Auditor-General undertakes his work. Even it has been severely strapped for resources, such that its members are continually faced with the embarrassment of not being able adequately to deal with the information that comes before them about the way in which the Executive, itself, functions. Finally, even the way in which responses are made to Public Accounts Committee reports is in the hands of the Executive Government. It is not even in the hands of Cabinet; it goes beyond that, to the departments of state. Responses to reports of the Public Accounts Committee are in the hands of the Department of Finance. We have found recently, after inquiry, that the Department of Finance coordinates responses, but it is largely a post-box function whereby very junior officers in the Departments tell the Committee, if we read between the lines, that what the Committee's recommendations are about is of little consequence. This is a very serious situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I played to the gallery earlier I wondered whether this report would really be seen as significant enough for the Cabinet to take it on board and respond. It is a particularly important document. It is crucial to the independent role of the Parliament that its recommendations be picked up. Accountability is dependent upon resources and also upon the Parliament itself asserting, as this report does, a role for the Parliament in the way in which the Auditor-General functions, the resources that are available to him and the nature of the appointments that are made. They are the crucial aspects of the report before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take honourable members through the report because it contains some important pieces of information. Honourable members often assume that one of the principal functions of the Auditor-General relates to the scrutiny of the accounts of government departments and involves reporting upon whether the money is spent properly-compliance auditing as it is called. In recent years we have seen the development of a new form of auditing, efficiency auditing. In the last 10 years performance audits, as they are called in some places, or efficiency audits, as we know them, have made an increasing contribution. It was thought that they would play an important role in looking at the way in which government departments operate and bringing about efficiencies, but the fact of the matter is that the Auditor-General still has to carry out his compliance audit function. The resources available to him enable him to carry out that function but little more. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the importance of efficiency audits-the tables in the report provide a great deal of information about the gains that have been made through the efficiency audit process-the Auditor-General has had little in the way of resources to allocate to them. The consequence of that is that very large programs involving income or expenditure greater than $10m can be expected to be the subject of an efficiency audit only once every 40 years. Table 17.2 refers to the effects of current resources available. It shows that statutory authorities have the prospect of being the subject of an efficiency audit once in 54 years. I wonder how many honourable members will see efficiency audits of every statutory authority. One would have to be the grandfather or the great grandfather of the House to see that. The prospect for government departments is once in 48 years; and, for departmental outriders-a slightly better performance-once every 20 years. I wanted to emphasise that because this whole question of resources, of the ability of the Auditor-General to undertake his scrutiny role for this Parliament, can be shown to be severely affected when we look at that very basic information. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other matters are addressed in this report. We can follow it through very easily if we look at the recommendations, which are set out in a form that is very easy to follow. We recommend in the legislative area that `the Audit Act be repealed and replaced with two new laws, a Financial Administration Act and an Audit Act'. We recommend that a parliamentary committee-not the Public Accounts Committee, whose role is sacrosanct-`be established to advise the Auditor-General on Parliament's audit priorities and to consider its finances in detail'; in other words, to give the Parliament a role in determining those resources. As the honourable member mentioned, such a committee would be bipartisan, its membership consisting of the President of the Senate or the Speaker, alternating each year; the Minister for Finance; the Public Accounts Committee chairperson; the chairperson of the House of Representatives committee which uses Australian Audit Office reports; the chairperson of a Senate committee which uses Audit Office reports; three members of the Opposition; and a parliamentarian who is a member of a minority party or, if there is no such person, a member of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the committee nominate its chairman, along with the Minister for Finance and one person nominated by the Leader of the Opposition, to consider who should be appointed as Auditor-General. The whole question of the person involved ought to be outside the Executive area. It should not just be a matter of the Prime Minister making a recommendation but a Governor-General's appointment in which the Prime Minister receives advice from a bipartisan group. It is proposed that the appointment of the Auditor-General be for 10 years, a sacrosanct period, or until he earlier reaches retirement age. </PARA>
<PARA> We also addressed the question of resources and the way in which they should be dealt with. We dealt with the Auditor-General's mandate and with the question of performance audits and how they might be made more effective. We dealt particularly with the Department of Finance and its responsibility, particularly in matters of the Ministers' reports and the availability of that information to the Parliament through the Public Accounts Committee. We dealt with the audit of section 96 grants to State and Territory governments and with the way in which reporting generally is carried out. We dealt with the question of privatisation, in effect. Our view was that the Auditor-General ought to have the pre-eminent role in relation to the audit function but that that ought not to exclude private firms carrying out audit functions-firms chosen not by government statutory authorities, companies or departments but by the Auditor-General, their supervision being in his hands. The choice would be his. We called for the publishment of criteria on which the decision to employ private auditors on a contract basis might be based. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to establish better relationships between the Auditor-General and the private sector and made suggestions in relation to that. We also suggested that the Auditor-General should be subject to an independent audit of his own operations and made recommendations on the way in which that appointment ought to be made. Finally, and rather incidentally, we made the suggestion that as a symbolic matter the Audit Office ought to be related clearly to the Parliament and not to the bureaucracy. We suggested that the Australian Audit Office should have a new building, called Audit House, either within the Parliamentary Triangle or on State Circle adjacent to the new Parliament House, thereby establishing a clear relationship with the Parliament for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA> We have highlighted in this report a number of weaknesses, I want to mention one other. The efficiency audit concept is a very important one. The way in which and the frequency with which efficiency audits are carried out is very important. The fact that the Auditor-General is the subject of scrutiny by the Department of Finance in relation to his own resources is significant. In the preface to the report the Committee-not me personally-said:</PARA>
<PARA> Another weakness highlighted during the inquiry was that the Department of Finance was the principal adviser to Executive Government on the resources that should be allocated to the Australian Audit Office. This was so even though the Department of Finance was the Audit Office's most important auditee. The AAO appears to have been constrained in its efficiency audits of the Department of Finance because of this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Audit Office appears to have been constrained in its efficiency audits of the Department of Finance because of this arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office had never conducted an efficiency audit of any aspect of that Department's operations, despite the centrality of the latter to the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commonwealth sector. Nor had efficiency audits ever been conducted of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury or Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those matters are significant and ought to be taken on board. In judging the way in which this report is responded to, the power of those vested interests ought to be kept very much in mind. The response to this report ought to be in the hands of the Parliament itself if we are to get the recommended reforms put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make one other personal comment. I mentioned the advisers boxes before. Dr Paul Nicoll, who helped us greatly in relation to this report, is present. I thank him on behalf of the Committee for the work he put into the report; it is referred to in the preface. I thank the other members of the staff, particularly Laraine Brennan, who is mentioned in the report, who were also instrumental in helping to prepare it and in ensuring that we were properly informed and who assisted in preparing this monumental document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I rise, with a great deal of pleasure, to support my two colleagues who have just spoken. The Public Accounts Committee report No. 296 has an intriguing title, namely The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament-Reform of the Australian Audit Office. In fact, that is the case: the Auditor-General and his Office are the allies of the people and the Parliament. I commend the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), for his excellent tabling speech. I thought that it was first rate; it led the way on a number of points and I do commend him for it. I also commend the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) for his contribution. Unlike the honourable member for Dundas, I will not play to the gallery and look up at the school children there--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, they have gone, have they? They heard the honourable member for Dundas speak and away they went! Goodness gracious, that is no recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To the people who are listening to this debate and the Australian people in general the Australian Audit Office is totally remote. They do not know what it is; they have probably never even heard of it. It is completely unknown. Yet it is of vital importance to every Australian citizen because it is the watchdog of the people and the watchdog of the Parliament in terms of the financial management of the billions of dollars spent by any government. It is the watchdog of the financial statements and all the activities of government. Therefore, it has incredible importance for every single Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that importance, it is imperative that adequate resources be made available to the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General must be independent, so he must have adequate resources. Without sufficient resources, independence is meaningless; it means nothing at all. The Auditor-General has a basic disability-he cannot pay enough. He cannot pay his senior officers anything like what they would receive in private industry. Salaries are way behind and, as a result, too many-not all, of course, but too many-talented and brilliant people have been lost to private industry. Fortunately, the Auditor-General still has a great many talented, brilliant, hard-working and excellent people who are doing a fantastic job. But the upshot is that, if the Auditor-General cannot pay enough in a very competitive market, as well as losing senior people he will have difficulty in bringing in the best young brains. He must be able to pay them too. It is appropriate that the Parliament and the Government should address the question of providing adequate financial resources to the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to commend report No. 296 to the Government. I hope that it will accept and implement all the recommendations put forward in a totally bipartisan fashion by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on behalf of the people and the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of a Military Police Complex at Green Hills, Liverpool Military Area, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work now before the House is for the construction of a military police complex at Green Hills near Holsworthy. The complex will provide new living and working accommodation for several military police units currently housed in substandard accommodation at Ingleburn. These military police units include a special investigation branch, a military corrective establishment and a military police school. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing military police complex at Ingleburn is spread over an area of 30 hectares and comprises more than 80 mainly weatherboard buildings. Most of these date from World War II and can no longer be economically maintained or renovated. The poor standard of these current facilities as well as their dispersed layout has an adverse effect on the training, morale and operational effectiveness of the various military police units. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed complex at Green Hills will provide modern and efficient facilities. It will comprise four main building groups arranged around a parade ground. There is a centralisation and sharing of some facilities; however the planning has also taken into account that four distinct units will be stationed at the complex. Each unit has its own character and its own range of functions, and reports to different commands within the Army. </PARA>
<PARA> New facilities to be provided for the various units will include, firstly, headquarters and administrative offices; secondly, operational and training areas; and, thirdly, a separate secure compound for the military corrective establishment, including cell blocks, its own parade ground and recreation facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a sharing of common use facilities, such as a mess and canteen; living-in accommodation for a total of 40 students and 20 staff, and sports facilities. The estimated cost of the proposal as recommended by the Committee is $12.3m at May 1988 prices. This cost, updated to March 1989 prices, is now $13.17m. So, subject to the approval of the House to proceed, we intend to call tenders in mid-1989. Construction of the facilities is expected to be complete by early 1992. During this construction period, the on-site work force should peak at about 60 persons. I thank the Public Works Committee and its chairperson for their consideration and support for this proposal. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will support this motion. It is important for the Public Works Committee, when examining proposed projects of this kind, to look carefully at their construction costs. It is difficult for the Parliament to know whether the Government's public works program is proceeding in the most efficient way. I have often argued on this side of the House that much greater use should be made by the Government of the private subcontracting system. It is important that this point is continually emphasised. I would like the Public Works Committee at some stage to take out a general reference looking at the totality of the Government's practices regarding construction projects of this kind. In the past the Government has been taking on private sector builders to proceed with the projects. We would like to see the subcontracting system operate in the public sector as it operates in the private residential market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) claims that that is what the Government does it is to misunderstand the way that the totality of the building industry works. As the Minister points out, these projects are put to the private sector under tender. This is an important point. It is alleged that at present only between 30 and 40 per cent of all Commonwealth expenditure projects worth more than $2,000 are being gazetted. That is a major problem. It is not an exclusive reflection on the Minister who has brought this project before the House; it is a reflection on the whole of the Ministry. It is a matter that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) needs to investigate quickly. If between 30 and 40 per cent of all such projects pursued by this Government are not gazetted, many small businesses in this country are missing out on the opportunity of tendering for government business. That is a serious matter. It is a criticism that comes, not only from the small business community, but from the broader business community. It is a reflection on Ministers' inept administration of their departments in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA> But, as I said, the Opposition supports this motion. We hope that the military police complex at Green Hills in the Liverpool military area will go ahead successfully and contribute to the efficiency and welfare of the military police in the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity of leading the debate on the second reading of this package of Appropriation Bills-Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1988-89 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1988-89. The Opposition will be supporting the Bills as they are Budget Bills but I foreshadow that I will move an amendment at the end of my remarks commenting on the extent of the Government's economic mismanagement. The purpose of these Bills traditionally has been to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for the current financial year under Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. These appropriations are usually required to meet commitments that have been approved by the Government since the Budget as well as requirements of an ongoing nature. There are a number of reasons why this might occur, but the principal factors underlying the requirements are usually some unavoidable cost and price increases or other parameter changes that have occurred since the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bills total additional gross appropriations of $683.9m. There is also a figure of $425.7m of savings, giving a net increase in appropriations for the year of $217.8m in expenditures, which is roughly 0.3 per cent of the total amount of estimated outlays for this year. Whilst this tends to be a fairly traditional procedure in the course of any financial year, there are some interesting points in regard to these additional appropriations which I am sure will be taken up by many of my colleagues in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make one or two general comments. Firstly, I draw attention to the fact that the savings of $425m-odd that are identified are not really substantial savings. In many cases they are deferrals, as distinct from formal cuts. In that sense they are indicative of what has become an increasing expenditure mode on the part of this Government. The Government has made much of the fact that it has set out to restrain the size of the Commonwealth public sector and to cut its own expenditure. But, as is the way these things are normally produced and misrepresented by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the extent of any restraint has generally been exaggerated. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent experience, for example, there was a significant shift to an expenditure increasing mode in the last Budget, to which these appropriations relate. Over and above last year's May statement the Government announced a net increase of expenditure of some $400m. On a couple of recent occasions in the media and elsewhere the Treasurer has promised to increase expenditure further in the context of next week's economic statement which, as we have just heard, is to be brought down in this House on 12 April. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important when we look at the Appropriation Bills to attempt to provide some sort of background to these additional appropriations. We are helped in this regard by the recent release of the December quarter national accounts which, to my mind, confirm quite simply and quite dramatically the extent of the Government's economic mismanagement. In simple terms they show an overheated economy with a worsening balance of payments and inflation problem. This should not be treated as lightly as it has been by the Treasurer and other economic Ministers in recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> The key points of the national accounts data that were released on 3 April were several. Firstly, there is clear evidence that demand is rapidly outstripping supply. Demand has actually grown through 1988 by about 8.2 per cent. Production, on the other hand, has grown by only about 4.2 per cent-a 4 per cent gap between demand and supply. Not surprisingly therefore there has been a significant increase in imports. We are told that imports have gone up by about 21 per cent in the year 1988 at a time when our exports have actually fallen by about one per cent. So there is a direct and a very important link between the extent of the domestic overheating of the economy or imports and the balance of payments. Much of the overheating, I would suggest, as I have done on previous occasions, is the direct responsibility of the Treasurer's tending to play politics with interest rates and monetary policy, as was the case throughout 1987 and into early 1988 on top of what internationally was a commodity price boom for us and with the lingering effects of the 1985 and 1986 devaluations to boot. </PARA>
<PARA> Any first year economics student would say that if that configuration of factors is put together-the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, has nodded in confirmation-we should not be surprised if the economy overheats dramatically. That is precisely what we have evidenced in the 8 per cent growth in demand in the course of last year against increasing supply constraints. Not surprisingly we have had a substantial increase in the magnitude of our balance of payments problem. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Treasurer is directly responsible for that overheating. He started the process by forcing interest rates down prior to the July 1987 election and again in the lead-up to the New South Wales State election in the latter part of 1987 until that election took place in mid-March of 1988. That desire to drive interest rates down is now coming home to haunt him and the Government in terms of the magnitude of the balance of payments problem and in the acceleration of inflationary pressures which were also clearly evidenced in last week's national accounts which showed the gross domestic product deflator, which in the past has been one of the Treasury's preferred measures of overall inflationary forces in this country, growing at 9.1 per cent through the calendar year 1988. So there has been an overheated economy, demand outstripping supply, sucking in imports, underwriting a rapid expansion of inflationary forces, and all in a lead-up to a statement next week which promises to be even more stimulatory and expansionary in an already dramatically overheated economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to put some interpretation on those fairly stark pieces of economic data. I think probably one of the most authoritative and honest assessments of our recent economic performance in this country has been offered by the Governor of the Reserve Bank in recent days. I suggest to this House that the honesty and openness of the Governor stand in very sharp contrast to the views that, up until that stage, had been put by the Treasurer. The extent of the disinformation that has been practised by this Government in relation to economic developments is nothing short of staggering. I think that the Governor's honesty should be emphasised and particular attention should be drawn to it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I found it interesting earlier this week when the Treasurer was challenged about the Governor's remarks that he made the following statement-I quote from Hansard of 4 April:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that things the Governor said last week are entirely in accordance with policy. I endorse everything that he said last week, which the Governor well knows. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it would be interesting to go through some of the Governor's remarks against the background of the Treasurer's comment just to see the extent to which the Treasurer has now come in endorsing that much more open and honest assessment of the parlous state of our economic circumstances. The Governor made a number of key points in his address to the Businessman of the Year presentation of 29 March at the Regent Hotel in Sydney. The first point is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Growth has been so rapid as to be seriously under-estimated by the policy makers. </PARA>
<PARA>There should not be any doubt about that in the sense that most of the major growth-related statistics in this country are outstripping Budget time and earlier expectations as announced by the Treasurer. It is important. The Government underestimated growth. The Governor goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Economic policies were designed for a less exuberant situation. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that the Treasurer now agrees with this. Economic policies were designed for a less exuberant situation. That is, his economic policies are wrong. They are quite inappropriate to the dramatically overheated Australian economy that is before us at present. The Governor goes on to point out that while there are some positive features in unexpectedly rapid growth, he issues a sharp warning:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . an over-blown economy is just unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not hear that sort of objective, open comment on the part of the Treasurer-an overblown economy like ours being described by the Governor of the Reserve Bank as just unsustainable. The Governor goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> In broad terms, we could say that the unexpectedly powerful economic growth has cost us a year in the strategy for winding down price increases and improving the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that the Governor of the Reserve Bank has taken that opportunity to draw attention to the fact that this Government has not displayed any sense of urgency; in fact, it has displayed an alarming sense of complacency about the magnitude of the problems before us and the extent to which its policies have fallen off the pace. We have had an enormous amount of trouble getting the Treasurer to tell us something about his revised Budget estimates for this year. The Budget estimate for the current account deficit is now looking like coming in at about $14 1/2 billion or $15 billion. Indeed, implicit in the Governor's speech was an estimate of $14 1/2 billion for the current account deficit this year, dramatically above the $9.5 billion current account deficit that was forecast by the Treasurer in the Budget last August. Similarly, the inflation rate was expected by the Treasurer to fall to 4 1/2 per cent this year. But the national accounts tell us that the broad measures of inflation, in the year to December last, was running at a bit over 9 per cent and we know that the consumer price index is somewhere between 7 1/2 per cent and 8 per cent. That process, the fact that economic management has been allowed to slip through the Treasurer's fingers, has cost us a year, the Governor says, in the strategy for winding down price increases and improving the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see, by implication of the Treasurer's remarks in the House earlier this week, that he accepts that he has lost at least a year in terms of winding down price increases and improving the balance of payments. The Governor took a very positive response having identified the magnitude of the problem. He then went on in his speech to pose the question: What is to be done? He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We need do claw back lost territory-</PARA>
<PARA>that is an appropriate description of the Treasurer's performance in the last 12 or 18 months-</PARA>
<PARA>to bring spending and production into better balance. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . to damp down spending. </PARA>
<PARA>He points out, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The policy setting has tightened, but are we doing enough, quickly enough? Will it work?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer now spends most of his time, whenever he speaks in response to questions like that, with a standard pat answer saying, `Look, you don't have to worry, there is plenty of monetary adjustment in the pipeline. It is all working, everything is going to be fine'-what I have been calling the don't worry, be happy strategy. `Don't worry, things are going to come good. Don't worry, we have done enough policy adjustment. Don't worry, interest rates aren't going to go any higher. Don't worry, we have an investment boom'. And so he prattles on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor goes on to point out some very real reservations about the extent to which he is concerned that maybe it will not work, maybe there is not enough policy adjustment in the pipeline. To quote him quite explicitly:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past month or so, there have been some tentative signs of moderation in the strength of demand. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all we have got-tentative signs. Nothing like that it is all in the pipeline, it is all happening, the runs are on the board and the sort of language the Treasurer uses-just tentative signs of moderation in the strength of demand. He warns:</PARA>
<PARA> It is too early to say that a downturn is at hand. </PARA>
<PARA>What does he mean here? He is raising the prospect quite explicitly that the Government has not done enough. Does the Treasurer really say that? Is the Treasurer really prepared to admit that he has not done enough, because that is the way I read what the Governor is saying. If he has not done enough in terms of the Government's economic strategy, there is an implicit suggestion that there will be more pain to come: even higher interest rates, which is the only instrument the Government has. To my mind, if it is too early to say that a downturn is at hand, it begs the question just how much further interest rates may have to go before the job is done-in the Governor's terms. Indeed, the Governor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We will have to hold to the tougher policies until it is clear that results are on the board. </PARA>
<PARA>To my mind that suggests that not only do we now have very high interest rates by historical standards but there is a very real risk that they may go even higher and that they will stay higher quite a lot longer than anybody on the Government side has been prepared to come into this House and suggest up until this stage. The Governor issued a couple of other warnings. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> This might well entail further turbulence and take a bit longer than expected earlier. </PARA>
<PARA>He was admitting quite explicitly that the adjustment process could take quite a bit longer than expected and, presumably, than the Treasurer had been saying up until this week. The Governor also warned:</PARA>
<PARA>It is also important to realise-</PARA>
<PARA>this was, if anything, a direct statement for the Treasurer's benefit-</PARA>
<PARA>that we can't keep the economy in a permanent state of sedation in order to keep the current account and inflation in check. </PARA>
<PARA>He was really saying that the problem is not simply one of macropolicy adjustment. It will not be enough just to increase interest rates and hope that that will pull back domestic demand and reduce the pace of imports. There is another dimension to the problem that has not received sufficient attention by the Government. We must have additional policy adjustment at the microlevel. The Governor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The longer-term objective is maximum non-inflationary growth. Cooling the economy-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, putting it into a state of sedation-</PARA>
<PARA>is an essential but not sufficient condition-</PARA>
<PARA>for the job to be done. The statement `an essential but not sufficient condition' for the job to be done is very important. Even though all the Government is doing at this stage is trying to get by with a sole reliance on monetary policy and higher interest rates, the Governor warned, firstly, that that will not be enough and, secondly, that it misses the whole dimension of the magnitude of the problem, namely, the extent of needed micro-economic reform. In his words:</PARA>
<PARA>We need to press on with more constructive policies-to switch investment growth into export and import-replacing industries, to save more to finance investment, to sustain our international competitiveness and to raise productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are all words that Government spokesmen have offered on occasions, but I suggest that none understand them. They certainly do not understand the magnitude of the policy adjustment that is implied in those remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at some of the areas where structural adjustment is required. What is the Government's policy on the labour market? The Government seeks more centralised wage determination, greater concentration of union power, more wage increases quite unrelated to productivity, and so on-quite the opposite of what will be required, in the Governor's words, `to sustain our international competitiveness and to raise our productivity'. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, very real issues in the area of protection need to be addressed and addressed at a much faster pace than this Government has been prepared to do so far. There is also a need to recognise that our tax system, and this is implicit in the Governor's comments, discriminates against savings, discourages investment and works to encourage consumption and debt. With the sort of country we have and the magnitude of our short and medium term problems, effectively we have precisely the wrong tax system. Over and above that there are a host of other specific areas that need to be addressed and on which the Government so far is devoid of any policy response-issues such as dealing with bulk land transport; the wharves; coastal shipping and cabotage; privatisation; and government sector efficiency. Those are all areas in which the Government is absolutely devoid of any practical or substantive response. The Government talks about it but, unfortunately, it has done very little. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the time we are given further disinformation. The Treasurer does that constantly when he talks about the state of the economy and what he intends to do about the various elements of macropolicy and microreform. We are now getting it in terms of his inability to deliver the goods. The statement that is to be brought down on 12 April was to be, initially, a statement not only announcing the tax cuts and new expenditure measures and so on but one explicitly including a package of microreform measures. Yet just a few days ago the Treasurer told us that those measures will be pushed off to May or later months and left to individual announcements by other Ministers. The fact is that it is all too hard. There is no capacity on the part of the Government to address any of these issues. It is just shoving them off. Presumably it will shove them off past the middle of the year and the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said recently that he had put privatisation back on the agenda. On that day a few weeks ago I was fascinated to hear The World Today report as I was travelling by car. A succession of Australian Labor Party people from around the country were interviewed and none had any idea that privatisation was back on the agenda. Some expressed a dedication to the view that they would reiterate their earlier position and vote against any significant moves by the Government on privatisation. Yet it is fundamentally one of the most important areas that need to be addressed in the area of microreform in order to achieve some of the things the Governor talked about when he referred to a constructive process-that is, his warning, `Cooling the economy is an essential but not sufficient condition'. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the process of disinformation by the Treasurer has absolutely no bounds. He is attempting, selectively, to rewrite history rather than address any of the issues. On occasions he attacks us for playing the man rather than the issue. He is a past master of playing the man and not the issue. Almost every time he opens his mouth in this House he attacks the man; he never addresses the issue. He will not debate anything. In my case, on every single occasion, except the first, he has refused to debate me at any time or anywhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He knows that I know that he does not know what he is doing, I suggest. He is now busily trying to rewrite history. I will cite one example of that. Yesterday in Question Time the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), asked him this question about monetary policy:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Why has the rate of growth in the money supply as measured by M3 and broad money accelerated in recent months when monetary policy has been tightened?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer was not going to be bowled over by such a question, so he waffled on and filibustered-it went on for about a page and a half in Hansard-without any understanding of the way the process of monetary policy works in a deregulated environment. As I have said, he spent much of his time in that answer rewriting history. For example, he tried to paint the picture that we are now in a deregulated financial environment where quantitative restrictions have been abolished. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>They left with deregulation in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA>What a very selective memory he has. They actually left in June 1982, before the Hawke Government came to office. Similarly, he explained why he had abandoned monetary targeting in 1983-84. He actually abandoned monetary targeting at the end of January 1985 and it was that factor more than any other that precipitated the exchange rate crises of early 1985. The key part of his answer, and the one I wish to draw to the House's attention, was his classic explanation of how monetary policy works in a deregulated financial environment. He talked about money being `available at a price'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It means that monetary policy is still as effective-</PARA>
<PARA>there is no way that those two comments could be remotely linked; however, he seemed to find a way-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the slowdown occurs but it occurs with a lag and there is some cushioning which comes with the operation of monetary policy in a deregulated environment via price. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Treasurer very much for such a clear and quite explicit explanation of the way monetary policy works. He showed an acute sensitivity in the House and letters to the editor of the Australian Financial Review and on a host of other occasions to the fact that the market is confused about the way monetary policy actually works in this country, and about the direction of his intentions for monetary policy and so on, yet he makes statements such as that I quoted. It is no wonder the market is totally confused. It shows that he has absolutely no idea how monetary policy works. </PARA>
<PARA> It was disturbing to read statements that the Treasurer made recently in relation to the Reserve Bank. He tried to take full credit for everything the Reserve Bank does. He said, `They do what I say, I can assure you of that. That you can put your money on'. That should make us all sleep at night! It should make us all have a warm inner glow! Here is a guy with no idea of what he should be doing with monetary policy telling us not to worry because the Reserve Bank does what it is told when it comes to monetary policy. He has absolutely no idea how monetary policy works in a deregulated financial environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of most concern to me is the extent to which the Treasurer has focused on the process of disinformation throughout the last 12 or 18 months as his last two Budget strategies have slipped dramatically into tatters. He has never expressed with the same degree of clarity as the Governor the magnitude of the problems and the nature of the policy responses that are required. He has never set down an alternative set of forecasts to those that are so dramatically off track. Indeed, they were already dramatically off-track before half of this financial year had passed. He refuses to debate most of us on relevant economic issues. He prefers to play the man rather than to debate the issue or debate alternative policy responses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background that I move my amendment in the form in which it has been circulated in my name. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) budget estimates put Commonwealth Government outlays at over a quarter of Australia's GDP, and that this is funded by revenue collection that has made this the highest taxing Government in the post-war history of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the Government's budget strategy is in tatters with its key forecasts on inflation and the balance of payments wildly off-track;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the Government is locked into a strategy of sole reliance on monetary policy and high interest rates to bring the economy back on track with the result that home loan interest rates are now at their highest level in Australia's history; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the process of micro-economic reform has stalled with the Government either stopping or delaying much needed structural policies which are crucial if Australia is to increase productivity and to reduce its unsustainably high level of foreign debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Appropriation Bills and oppose the amendment to the motion for the second reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 3). It is a privilege to follow the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) but his amendment is amazing. In the first paragraph of his amendment he says that Budget estimates put Commonwealth Government outlays at over a quarter of Australia's gross domestic product (GDP). He does not say that the outlays have dropped from about 30 per cent of Australia's GDP to about 25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third paragraph of the amendment refers to the Government being locked into a strategy of sole reliance on monetary policy. The Opposition relies on nothing and it will not say what its policies are, whether with respect to taxation or spending cuts. The Opposition will not make its policy clear. In the past, it has made it fairly clear that it would get rid of ceilings on interest rates. It has also made it clear that it is opposed to wage and salary increases. Therefore, I guess the Opposition's policy would be going in the direction of lower wages, lower spending on important areas like education, the environment, pensioners, health and schools and no ceiling on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth then spoke about delaying much needed structural policies. We needed those structural policies in the seven years between 1975 and the end of 1982. At last, structural policies are starting to take effect in Australia. They are being administered by a range of departments, not the least of which is the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. It looks to me that it is fairly easy to make the choice between the parties offering themselves to the people in the next election, whenever it comes. It is easy to make the choice because, although it is not clear what the Opposition's policies are, it is a choice between confusion and a sound economic direction. There is confusion about whether we will get the dry economic policies, the words of the Opposition front bench, or a repeat of the soft decisions between 1975 and 1983. There is a choice between that confusing presentation and a government that has shown itself to be made up of a group of sound economic managers determined to make hard decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth once again, as he always has, offered us a policy of scorched earth. He wants to cut essential spending, but will not tell us where. He will not tell us whether the spending is to be cut in the area of pensions, veterans' benefits, schools or health. We know from the record of the newly-elected Greiner Government in New South Wales that the very people for whom the Liberal Party indicated sympathy were those it hit when it was elected. The Opposition talks about having no controls on interest rates. If there were no controls, interest rates would go higher. That would smash business activity in Australia and cause a rise in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard today the policy of a silent member of a team that was in office for many years. The Fraser-Howard Budgets had the silent member, the honourable member for Wentworth, behind them helping to make policy. The members of that team did not have the courage to change the financial structure of Australia or the markets of Australia. They could not deregulate the financial system; they could not float the exchange rate; and they could not get together a decent monetary policy or a coherent fiscal policy. The people who vetoed them are still there. They are in the corner and they are there behind them. These are the parties that gave us double digit inflation, a recession and high unemployment. They preached the gospel of hard decisions but they practised the gospel of soft decisions. It is easy for them to talk in opposition, but what will they do in government?</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite have tried to tell us that they have toughened up. If we look at their policies we find confusion. They did not know where to be soft; now they do not know where to be hard. What they have said is that they will squeeze wage and salary earners. If they do not mean what they say, we will get more of what they gave us when in government-wage squeezes followed by wage blow-outs. If they give us what they say, it will be even worse because they are talking about having no awards. Wages will be negotiated in small businesses and awards will be done away with. Honourable members should think about how that would affect wage and salary earners in the country areas in Australia, in particular. We should consider how that would affect people in a small country town who do not really have a big choice of jobs. Someone with an important job in the town may have a spouse and need extra to keep the family income up. Opposition members appear to be trying to give people a choice of having no job at all or receiving $4 an hour, which some people in the United States receive. There has been some deregulation of the labour market in the United States. That is not for Australia. People are not commodities on a shelf; they are human beings who need food. They have children to feed and educate and need to maintain shelter. The Liberal and National parties are saying that the wage and salary earners of Australia are commodities or goods which can be bargained for, sold to the lowest bidder and, if unsold, thrown on the scrapheap of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy of labour market deregulation is all about bringing people back to the breadline. Let those who fall for the Liberal and National parties' crocodile tears about the plight of wage and salary earners and about family incomes, heed the words which they have used in this institution. They have approved one wage increase out of the past 20. That would have given us average weekly earnings 34 per cent lower than they are now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said, `No awards for wages and conditions of people in small businesses'. Most small businesses are ethical. Most small businesses want to pay what is regarded as a correct wage. What the coalition is saying is that there will be no guide for the ethical small business area. The few unethical small businesses will be able to take advantage of there being no award. Let those members of Parliament who want deregulation of the labour market and who want people to bargain with their bosses go out and bargain with their bosses; the taxpayers of Australia. We each have 70,000-odd electors. I would not like their chances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has helped 1.27 million people, extra wage and salary earners, off the dole queues, out of a life of boredom, out of a life of poverty, and into employment. The Government has also seen some extraordinary improvements in a wide range of areas. In relation to business investment, with the previous Government we saw one of the biggest failures of economic policy over the last 40 years. We have seen one of the largest investment phases since 1948. We have seen demand outstrip supply. If there is any problem, it is the fact that we cannot keep up with growing business. Public sector borrowing would be the same size as it was in 1973, in spite of what the honourable member for Wentworth said. We are going to have lower Government spending, Government outlays are down to 25 per cent of gross domestic product from the peak of 30 per cent. We have done pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to discuss some of the implications of the decisions made by the Federal Government for the electorate of Eden-Monaro. First, let us look at Queanbeyan, a town not far from here whose fortunes are related to Canberra. The feature since 1983 has been that development has been planned in a much more coordinated fashion. Private enterprise has been brought in to strengthen Canberra's economic base. Canberra is a company town and has always been a company town but it is good to see national organisations coming into Canberra and setting up here so that they can talk to government and to one another. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been planned development in construction. Parliament House has supplied many jobs to Queanbeyan people and to people in the area around Yass, Bungendore, Captains Flat and Sutton. Many jobs have been supplied to those people through the guided development which has taken place. This development includes the High Court, Parliament House and the Australian National Gallery and we hope it will include a national museum. I impress on the Government the need to plan for a national museum at the appropriate time so that we can maintain employment, particularly in the construction sector. We do not want to return to the Fraser days when Canberra went right down; we lost trades people to other areas of Australia and it took a long time for us to get them back when we needed them. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queanbeyan we have had some vast improvements, not only from the setting up by the Federal and State governments of local offices, but also in the number of private enterprise firms, factories and others, who have been prepared to set up there. The major area team for social security was set up recently, thereby filling a four-storey office which had been left empty since 1975. The Wran-Unsworth governments put in offices for the Valuer-General and for soil conservation. A branch of the State Government Insurance Office has set up in the new Riverside Plaza in Queanbeyan. We have offices for forestry and family and community services. Combined with private enterprise, we have a strong economy in the Queanbeyan, Yarrowlumla Shire and Yass Shire areas. Of course, accommodation is not keeping up. This is a challenge for private enterprise and for the New South Wales Government and local government as they look at the boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen changes in the social strata. Unemployment has gone down from over 10 per cent in 1983 to less than half of that figure now. Women, who then wanted work, could not get it and had never had jobs now have them. People were fooled in 1975. People were fooled in 1988 before the State election. People here told me that they voted for the present State Government and have now had their rents in Housing Commission homes put up, in some cases by 30 to 40 per cent. I can remember people saying to me, when I doorknocked in Eden-Monaro and Queanbeyan in 1975, `If I want to keep my job, I will vote for Fraser'. I doorknocked the same places in 1977 and the people were gone from the town; there were empty offices, empty homes, empty flats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) was in the House a little while ago. I am sorry he is not here now to hear me pay tribute to him, and to his predecessors, Mr Hurford and the present Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), for the fact that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has had its losses turned into profits. The Corporation's role as an internationally recognised firm of consultants and engineers was reversed under the Fraser-Howard Budgets when we saw many opportunities lost overseas. Yesterday we saw and heard the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business strengthen the changes that were made by his predecessors. Losses have been turned into profits. The Liberal object of privatisation of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Bombala, Nimmitabel and Eden areas we have seen a courageous decision by the Government on behalf of the timber industry. The Government has decided to renew the woodchip export licence so that it can proceed in partnership with the very important sawmilling sector. May I say that the people who came to me with representations were not the woodchip export people, but the sawmillers themselves who saw the need for a strong partnership between the sawmilling industry and wood chipping for export in an environmentally sensitive way. I pay tribute to the Government for taking into account important environmental concerns when it renewed that licence. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Snowy Mountains and on the south-east coast, from Jindabyne to Merimbula, Narooma, Bermagui, Ulladulla and Braidwood we have seen an amazing turnaround in tourism over the last three or four years. Local tourist offices and local government have tapped into the very important work being done overseas by the Federal Government in tourist promotion. We have also seen a change in attitude in those areas. Restaurateurs are no longer prepared to take their staff from the street. People are interested in making a career in the hospitality industry. I have been delighted to present certificates in a wide range of places throughout the electorate to people who have taken advantage of training systems which have been evolved through the cooperation of the Commonwealth Employment Service with organisations like the Retail Traders Association and local technical and further education colleges. Through these training systems we can encourage people to learn how to service the public properly and to consider their jobs as a career; a career which may take them into great opportunities in employment, or which may take them into businesses of their own. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that in the last area where I presented certificates I was able to learn a fast track method of bed making. It was very interesting to see how people took pride in what was once regarded as a menial task. They saw it as a way of gaining fulfilment and satisfaction in their present employment, and of gaining hope for future employment. Important decisions need to be made in all those areas along the south coast and in the Snowy Mountains about zoning and about planning to cater for the people who are now there. But we should not just think of the people in the future; we should also think of those who are living there now and who need to be comfortable. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the greatest changes effected by the Hawke Administration have been in the area of television and radio. It is good to see some honourable members here whose areas will very much be affected by aggregation. I refer to my friend and colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and a colleague on the other side, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Adermann). Their constituents who could receive no television or radio service at all are now receiving those services, as they now do also in the Eden-Monaro area. The south-east region was the beginning of television aggregation. It is up and running, it is working, and people have a better choice. They might want to watch Australian rules or soccer or rugby league. At last they will have a choice of commercial stations. Bombala, Jindabyne and Thredbo had no television at all when the Hawke Government was elected. Now, following many public meetings, agitation, and cooperation from Capital Television, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the then Department of Communications, ABC radio and commercial television services have been brought in to those areas. Radio 2CN could not be heard in the region around Canberra; now it can be. That follows strong representations to me from the New South Wales Farmers Association. Now farmers can have a choice of radio. </PARA>
<PARA> Formerly 2CN and 2CY in Canberra were required to broadcast Parliament. Now there is a separate station for that. Parliament has its own station and people have a choice of three national radio stations. Radio 2XL had problems in the Snowy Mountains and in Bombala. It has applications in now which I am confident will be approved. Radio 2EC had problems in Narooma; now there is a transmitter which enables Narooma people to hear that radio station properly. Many people could not hear it at all. EAR FM is a great community radio station. The ABC was lacking such a station for many years but that station now broadcasts to local people. It has a broad spectrum of listeners because it is prepared to have a broad spectrum of broadcasters, including pensioners, schools, Aborigines and business people. It is to be congratulated. Soon another 20,000 people who could not receive the ABC will be able to receive it. The area around Tomerong is already getting it, and from Tomerong to areas between Nowra and Batemans Bay. Soon the Eurobodalla Shire and the Bombala Shire will get it and it is hoped that there will be an improvement in Merimbula. </PARA>
<PARA> A great choice has come to the people of this area as a result of television aggregation. There are two new commercial stations in the vast areas of my electorate. It is proposed to transmit commercial stations, as well as the ABC, to Captains Flat. The Special Broadcasting Service will be available for Braidwood people, as well as three new commercial stations, and three commercial stations will be available to the people on the south-east coast, Cooma and the Monaro. Most people in Eden-Monaro now have better television and radio services because they have a wider choice. This is a first for Australia and congratulations must go to the Department of Transport and Communications and a wide range of interest groups. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . several official and trade representations in Australia include their share of professional intelligence officers and/or co-optees. These officers are as active here as anywhere else in working to collect political, technical and other information . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let me list just some of the existing Soviet bloc official and trade representations in Australia. The Soviets themselves have an embassy and trade office in Canberra. In Sydney they have a large consulate in Woollahra, a trade office in Bondi Junction, an Aeroflot office in the city, a tractor facility in Liverpool and various offices in the city area dealing in wool and wheat. In the last three years they have also established a trade office in North Melbourne. The Bulgarians, renowned for often acting on behalf of the Soviets in clandestine operations, have a consulate and separate trade office in Sydney. The East Germans have an embassy in Canberra and a consulate in Melbourne. The Czechoslovakians have an embassy in Canberra and a consulate in Sydney. The Hungarian presence is manifested in an embassy in Canberra and a consulate and a trade office in Sydney. Finally, the Romanians have a consulate located in Sydney's Bondi. This is quite an impressive list in a country of only 16 million people. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said on many previous occasions, our counterintelligence services, with their existing resources, are not able to monitor fully the activities of the personnel working from these premises. Yet despite this fact, the Hawke Government is about to allow the Soviet Union to establish further consulates in Melbourne, Hobart and Perth, under the consular agreement currently being finalised. The Soviet's explanation for wanting to expand the number of their official residencies in Australia is: to service the impending arrival of the Soviet fishing fleet, to organise the Aeroflot charters that the Hawke Government will soon be allowing to fly into Australia, and to provide consular services as part of the human contacts agreement also being finalised by this Government. Negotiation on all four of these initiatives has been undertaken, in large part, by Mr Michael Costello, an acting deputy secretary at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Should all of these agreements come to fruition, as the Government seems to think they will, then the national security implications for Australia are almost too horrific to contemplate. The Government is well aware that the Soviet Union is in the practice of using consular posts as a cover for intelligence officers. They are also aware that the volume and dispersion of Soviet intelligence officers that could be placed in Australia as a result of the consular agreement, the fishing deal and the associated landing rights for Aeroflot would simply overwhelm the already overburdened and under-resourced counterintelligence services of our country. Mr Valeriy Zemskov may have left Australia, but his legacy lives on. One of his objectives was the New Zealandisation of Australia, and with the implementation of the agreements I have referred to-agreements in which he played a pivotal role for the Soviet Union-that objective will be brought all the more closer to success. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly, the significant increase in Soviet activity in Australia and our region in general began with President Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech in 1986. It was further spurred along by Prime Minister Hawke's later comments in Singapore, comments that resulted in stern words from Singapore's Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and more than a few raised eyebrows throughout the Association of South East Asian Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in its history the KGB is being subjected to public scrutiny through the Soviet media. This is undoubtedly a result of Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika. This development has led some Western commentators to adopt the view that this is an attempt by President Gorbachev to weaken the KGB's enormous power. However, this is true in part and in part only. The only facets of the KGB's operations that are being scrutinised are its internal functions, not its external espionage function. </PARA>
<PARA> In the hype surrounding Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika campaigns, it should not be forgotten that his patron for many years was the late head of the Soviet Union and former long serving head of the KGB, Mr Yuri Andropov. Sources familiar with the Soviet Union, and in particular the KGB, have told me that Gorbachev is attempting to separate the KGB's internal police function from its overseas espionage function and is using perestroika as a vehicle to do this. Gorbachev's intention is to change the KGB into an agency dedicated to gathering foreign intelligence, mirroring the way in which the American Central Intelligence Agency is set up. I am informed that this intention was in fact flagged to Washington by the Kremlin late last year. Given this little known fact, it is hardly surprising that the new KGB Chairman, Colonel-General Kryuchkov, is a foreign operations specialist. If Gorbachev succeeds in his efforts, it is expected that the new revamped KGB will be far more effective than it currently is. </PARA>
<PARA> The KGB and Soviet military intelligence, the GRU, have greatly expanded their technological spying against Western nations through a huge increase in their signals intelligence, or SIGINT, capacity, and this is now being matched by an increase in agent operations in response to a recent call by Colonel-General Kryuchkov for increased activities abroad. Western intelligence agencies believe that Australia and its surrounding region are now considered by the Kremlin to be a priority target. The importance of Australia to the Soviet Union was amply demonstrated by the Soviet's decision to post Mr Zemskov to Canberra. Zemskov was a very senior KGB officer. In fact, he was the highest ranking KGB officer ever sent to this part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Further evidence of an increasing level of Soviet interest in our region was the recent trip through the South Pacific by the Soviet Ambassador, Dr Samoteikin. This was a trip obviously designed to drum up yet more fishing agreements in the region. Indeed, my colleague the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) this very week joined me in slamming the Government for jeopardising our national security and in condemning the Soviets for peddling lies throughout the region. The recent ASIO annual report also said:</PARA>
<PARA>While Australia has no reputation as a high technology leader to attract espionage in that field, there are pockets of interest. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Through various agreements and treaties of cooperation Australia is privy to sensitive information supplied by various other countries. With this access comes a very great responsibility to protect the information supplied. </PARA>
<PARA>The House may recall the recent publicity given to comments by the Head of the Australian Defence Staff in Washington, Air Vice-Marshal Barry Gration, concerning United States Government apprehension about giving Australia access to specialised and highly sensitive equipment. I can tell the House that the initial reluctance of the United States to provide that equipment was because the Pentagon and the State Department had become extremely concerned about the security situation in Australia. As we know, the matter was finally resolved in Australia's favour. However, I am told that the security situation in Australia, particularly as it affects American-provided equipment and intelligence, will be on the agenda when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) visits Washington some time in June. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to deal with some specific effects of the current swag of agreements this Government is negotiating with the Soviet Union. Firstly, I want to address the misconception the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers have nurtured concerning the fishing and Aeroflot proposals. On numerous occasions, as you will well recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have heard Ministers say that the agreements are no different from similar agreements the Soviets have with the United States. They have gone on to say that if the United States can handle the security problems, so can we in Australia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has attained a particularly high point of stupidity on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter, however, is somewhat different from the utterances of Labor Ministers. To begin with, the Americans do not-I repeat, do not-allow Aeroflot to fly charter flights into the United States for crew changeovers because they consider the security risk too great. Furthermore, the Americans were forced to reduce and restrict access to the number of ports the Soviet fishing fleet could use, due to the fact that American counterintelligence could not adequately contain the hostile intelligence activities associated with the Soviet fishing fleet. Indeed, United States and Canadian intelligence sources have estimated that 50 to 75 overt commercial fishing vessels operating off their Atlantic coasts are engaged in SIGINT and other intelligence operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has not been excluded from the attentions of Soviet spy trawlers. In June 1981 the then flagship of the Australian fleet, HMAS Melbourne, was shadowed as it passed through the South China Sea on passage from Hong Kong to Singapore. Soviet vessels have been seen on a regular basis cruising off our coast, particularly during the previous Kangaroo military exercises held in northern Australia. Their main aim is to collect SIGINT data. I can also tell the House that the Department of Defence, in planning for this year's Operation Kangaroo, has drawn up contingency plans to deal with an expected deployment of Soviet spy vessels to monitor the operation and collect signals intelligence. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) will be able to verify this. He will also be able to verify that his Department is extremely concerned that its everyday operations around the country will be subject to almost daily monitoring by the Soviets if the fishing and Aeroflot proposals get the go-ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in relation to the consular agreement, I call on the Government to make a clear, concise and frank statement informing the Australian public of just what this involves: that is, how many more Soviets will be allowed into the country to stage the consulates; will they be allowed to purchase real estate for their consulates; and, if so, will they be allowed to select the prime intelligence collecting sites in Melbourne, Perth and Hobart, as they have done already in Canberra for their new embassy? Furthermore, will the Government be allocating more resources to our counterintelligence services to deal with the hugely expanded Soviet presence? Finally, the Government might also like to let us know whether it intends to reopen the now closed ASIO office in Hobart to monitor the Soviet consulate proposed for that city. Opposition to the attempts by the Soviet Union to coerce Australia into signing a fishing and Aeroflot deal does not reside only on this side of the House. On 17 October last year during a debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) the Australian Labor Party member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) outlined many good reasons to reject the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the Government to explain fully what it intends to do in relation to all of the Soviet proposals I have referred to. Does it intend capitulating to the pressure being exerted by the Soviet Union and the friends Mr Zemskov left behind, or does it intend adopting the only sensible course of action, that is, rejecting the proposals because of the enormous threats posed to our national security?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's inept handling of these important matters is reflected in the totally inept handling of two freedom of information (FOI) requests I have submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The first of the two requests deals with the proposed Soviet fishing and Aeroflot agreement. Due to departmental incompetence, this request is now the subject of an appeal by me to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). A number of preliminary hearings have already been conducted by the AAT and I expect a full hearing to commence in the near future, at which I hope to obtain a great number of the documents that are currently being withheld from me. </PARA>
<PARA> The second of my FOI requests deals with Mr Valeriy Zemskov and his activities in Australia. Once again, I can only describe Foreign Affairs' handling of my FOI request as totally incompetent. The Department has now had my Zemskov request for 72 days, yet it remains unserviced despite the Freedom of Information Act requiring a response within 30 days. As a result, I will be lodging another appeal with the AAT tomorrow. In conclusion, I seek leave to table a copy of my FOI request concerning Mr Zemskov. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this my first speech in the Parliament could I say what an honour it is to be the first member of the House of Representatives to have taken the oath of allegiance in this new and permanent home of the Parliament of Australia. This place in history I share with the people of the Oxley electorate and I take this opportunity to thank those people for having the trust and confidence to elect me as their representative in the Federal Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Oxley electorate, with a population of approximately 102,000 people, is based on the provincial city of Ipswich, the oldest provincial city in Queensland, and takes in the surrounding urban and rural areas of the Brisbane Valley up to Esk in the north. The area has historical significance, being one of the earliest areas settled in Queensland, and as a result Ipswich grew very fast, with a strong economy based on agriculture, coal mining and at the time a very busy river port. A legacy of this early prosperity is a magnificent collection of historic buildings, many of which are listed by the National Trust. This, combined with the many recreational reserves in nearby areas, makes the area an attractive destination for tourists and day visitors from neighbouring centres. The city of Ipswich has also recently undergone a major redevelopment of its city heart which has re-established its position as a retailing centre. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one is elected to this House without a lot of effort and hard work by supporters, friends and family. I wish to thank all those people who, through their help and assistance, enabled me to be elected to Parliament. In particular I thank my wife Anne and our four sons for all their support and my mother and father, who are able to be in the gallery today. </PARA>
<PARA> To be able to serve my fellow Australians in Parliament is a responsibility I do not take lightly because I am fully aware of the effect the decisions we are called on to make have on the lives of the people we represent. The power entrusted to elected representatives should be respected by those people. I was reminded recently by a church leader of President Bush's inaugural address in which his first act was to offer a prayer. In that prayer President Bush said:</PARA>
<PARA>Use power to help people-for we are given power not to advance our own purposes nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very meaningful and powerful statement and can be applied to any area where people are in positions of power. Whether it be in business, community groups or government, the same principle should apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The revelations which arose from the Fitzgerald inquiry in my home State of Queensland are a perfect example of situations where people placed in positions of power have abused that trust. This abuse has led to a disrespect by the community of elected representatives and people appointed to positions of authority. Although it is only a minority of people that have betrayed the trust that goes with the power they have been given, sadly innocent trustworthy people in those professions are the victims of that abuse of power. It will take a complete new administration to rectify the position in Queensland and it will be the historic opportunity for the people of Queensland later this year to correct the situation in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The trust people place in governments is enormous and I am extremely pleased to come to this place as a member of a government that has a proven record of using the power vested in it to serve the best interests of the people of this great nation of ours. It is a government that, despite tough times, has given priority to the people who need the most help by showing care and concern for the poor and disadvantaged. It is a government that is committed to a fair and equitable distribution of wealth by reforming the taxation system so that tax cheats will now have to pay their way. </PARA>
<PARA> Before my election to Parliament I spent almost 25 years in the banking industry. Whilst in that industry, because of my concern for the welfare and conditions of my fellow workers, I became an active member of my union, the Australian Bank Employees Union. During this time I held a number of honorary positions. This involvement in my union gave me an insight into, and a better understanding of, the needs of my fellow workers and the broader objects of the trade union movement. The time I spent as an active union official was the most rewarding years of my time in the industry and I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to my fellow workers and union officials for their support and encouragement over many years. </PARA>
<PARA> As a former trade union official, I believe I am privileged to be a Labor member of parliament at a time when links between the industrial and political elements of the Labor movement have never been closer or more constructive. Under the accord, the Australian people have seen the unprecedented creation of more than 1.3 million jobs, real increases in the social wage, and improved competitiveness of Australian industry. We are now witnessing the massively valuable process of award restructuring which will, through consultation and cooperation, yield real improvements in productivity and in career opportunities for Australian workers. At the same time, negotiations between the trade union movement and the Federal Government are set to produce tax cuts and wage increases that, again, will alleviate the position of Australian workers. In other words, the accord processes, which have already done so much to put on a firm foundation the living standards of Australian workers, are still relevant, still productive, still yielding real benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Oxley electorate was not isolated from the general downturn in Australian industry during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This, combined with some adverse decisions taken by the State Government, saw the decline of the area's traditional employers, such as coal mining, railway workshops, power generation and a number of smaller manufacturing industries. The largest single employer in the area remains the Royal Australian Air Force Base at Amberley. Despite this downturn in its traditional employers, Oxley is well placed for the establishment of new industries with its existing services and ready work force. In addition, we have already seen a growth of employment in the service sector through the retail and hospitality industries and perhaps these areas will provide new opportunities in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy had to be restructured and it is through the accord that the trade unions and hence the workers of this nation have been able to play a vital role in the restructuring process. Industry had to be made more efficient and competitive and outdated work and management practices had to change to enable industry to attain these objectives. Workers are playing their part by accepting the restructuring of awards and changes in work practices as their contribution to making industry more efficient and competitive. However, industry must now also play its part. As workers have shown restraint in the restructuring process in the interests of the community as a whole, there is a major responsibility on industry to also show restraint. It is simply not good enough for workers to accept wage restraint and a lowering of living standards while some industries choose to pay substantial increases to senior executives and aim for higher and higher profit margins. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry has always been quick to pass on increased costs to the consumer; however, where there has been reduction in costs to industry, through lower import prices, particularly through movements in the Australian dollar, or reductions in overheads, the benefits have been taken as increased profit for the company instead of being passed on to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the people of my electorate of Oxley have been prepared to show restraint, they, like all Australians, are entitled to have industry show similar restraint by reducing prices in the interests of the whole community, and this would go a long way in improving the living standards of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> On its election to office in 1983 the Hawke Government recognised the need to reform and revitalise industry and, importantly, to lift its export potential as an integral part of the overall restructuring of the Australian economy. The Government's commitment to this reform saw strategies formulated for the steel and car industries in its first term, with packages in the following years for heavy industry; clothing, footwear and textiles industry; and the pulp, paper and paper products industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Hawke Government has introduced strategies for investment promotion; the development of the aerospace industry in Australia; and for the information industries. It also provides a 150 per cent tax concession for research and development, which is a substantial incentive for industry to develop new technologies and to take advantage of the expertise of our scientists. By developing research and development policies industry can increase its own productivity and also provide possible new export opportunities. All of this has encouraged the development and growth of more efficient industries, which has enabled greater internationalisation of Australia's industrial base and the reduction of government protection through tariffs and other forms of assistance. Overall, this should increase competition and reduce prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the development of our secondary industries will play a significant role in improving Australia's economic future, although this will not be achieved overnight. We must continue to place emphasis on developing industries to further process our products before we export them. These secondary processing or value-added industries not only have the potential to have a large impact on the return from our exports but also could reduce our import bill by supplying the local market with refined products that we now purchase from overseas-products quite likely produced using materials we exported in either a primary or minimally refined state. </PARA>
<PARA> I was encouraged by the recent reports commissioned by the Australian Industry Development Corporation on this issue, the findings of which were made available recently. These reports dealt with the potential for value added production of hides, sheepskins, cotton and wool within Australia. I hope to see similar reports produced on other industries so that opportunities for new or expanded industries can be identified. I would strongly suggest that my electorate would be well placed to take advantage of the benefits that these types of industries could provide. The necessary infrastructure and facilities to support such industries are already in the area. With adequate consideration given to environmental issues during the planning stages and with the use of modern technology in plant and equipment, I am confident that such industries would be both welcomed by, and profitable for, the people of Oxley. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the service sector may hold new opportunities for growth, especially in the export area. When we speak of trade we mainly think in terms of primary and secondary products and do not consider the potential to trade in services. The fastest growing area of international trade over the past 20 years has in fact been in the service sector. Australia's services sector constitutes the largest sector of the economy, with about three-quarters of the work force employed in this area, and it produces over two-thirds of our gross domestic product. The service sector is directed mainly at providing the community with medical, educational, financial, travel and recreational services. The domestic market, therefore, consumes most of the services produced. However, there is considerable potential for expansion into the export market. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism has seen more growth in export potential than any other area in the service sector and we still have many opportunities to exploit in this area. Health, education and financial services are also areas which can provide export potential. In our region and, indeed, throughout the world there is a considerable market available to trade in services. The Government is well aware of the long term potential of its service exports and welcomed the inclusion of trade in services on the negotiating agenda by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> The expansion of the service exports should go hand in hand with an increase in manufacturing, for there is a close relationship between the two. Both primary and secondary goods have a service component. For example, transport is a service used in the export of goods. If we are able to take advantage of this market, it will provide a substantial boost to our national economy by reducing our balance of trade deficit. An expansion in Australia's export trade can only produce more jobs and opportunities for Australians and hence improve our quality of life, especially for the poor and disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little doubt that only through a prosperous Australia, with a restructured economy, can the needs of Australians best be met. This provides people with not only economic but also social benefits as it cannot be denied that poverty is the greatest threat to the stability of society. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, as a result of Australia's economic ills, more and more people were being made dependent on social security payments for most of their family income. Most of these people were unemployed and had dependent children to support. These people were joined by a rapidly growing number of women who, through divorce or separation, were left without an income and usually without the skills to compete for a job. These sole parent families added to the number of children in need. Six hundred thousand children, at any one time, were dependent on social security payments, the real value of which declined every year. All of this was added to the existing problems of the aged poor, whose pension payments had not kept pace with increasing costs. Many people in my electorate were among those falling deeper and deeper into the trap of poverty, as were others throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government saw the needs of these people and set about addressing them. This was clearly illustrated in a reply the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) gave to a question without notice in the Parliament on 1 March this year. The Minister outlined how every year that we have been in government we have increased payments for the lowest income families, bringing payments for children from $10 in 1983 to $24 for younger children and to $31 for older children in 1988. The Minister was, of course, referring to the Government's cash for working families scheme, or family allowance supplement. This program represents the principal, but by no means the sole, action by this Government to fulfil its pledge that by 1990 no Australian child need live in poverty. The figures quoted represent a real increase in payments of 24.1 per cent. This was achieved by the Government during times of very tight fiscal policy. The Government will reach the benchmark it set itself for these payments this year and it has pledged to maintain payments in real terms. Pension rates have also been steadily increased since 1983 towards the target of setting the single pension rate at 25 per cent of the average weekly wage, with corresponding increases to the married rate. Pensions have also been fully adjusted for inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Money alone, though, will not solve the underlying causes of these problems and these causes must be addressed if the problem is to be removed rather than treated. For this reason, the Government has taken action to introduce reforms in the provision of and access to education and training, particularly for women. Action has also been taken to increase the retention rate in the nation's schools and colleges. By encouraging more students to complete years 11 and 12 and then go on to higher education or training, Australia will be able to build the necessary skills base needed to ensure our future prosperity. At the same time, programs have been put in place to encourage girls to study science and mathematics subjects as they have been under-represented in these areas for too long. This Government recognises the importance of proper education and training to our young. Education not only provides the best qualification for gaining meaningful, rewarding employment, thereby guaranteeing financial security, but it also provides our children with the skills to become effective members of society. The Government has increased the availability of child-care places to enable more sole parents and women to re-enter the work force and has set in place affirmative action programs to assist them in obtaining employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments, though, can only provide the resources and guidance for the provision of services to the community; it is the people in the community that make things happen. I am very fortunate to have in my electorate a large number of community groups, both church and non-denominational, which provide very necessary caring attention to the aged and disadvantaged, which is a very important means of support to those people. I have been encouraging these groups and offering them every assistance in the good work they do. </PARA>
<PARA> When I campaigned for election to the seat of Oxley it was with a simple but important slogan: `Continuing the Labor tradition'. The Labor tradition had been represented and advanced in the seat of Oxley for 27 years by my predecessor, Bill Hayden, now the Governor-General. Bill Hayden provided dedicated and far-sighted service to the community and to the nation over nearly three decades of membership of this House, including as Opposition Leader and as a Minister in two Labor governments for some nine years. I was proud to tell the voters of Oxley of my commitment to continuing the Labor tradition there that Bill Hayden so brilliantly typified. In this my first speech to Parliament I am proud to reaffirm that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that there was, and is, no quick fix to the economic problems facing Australia. The process of economic reconstruction, vital as it is, will take time. Equally, I am well aware of the real concerns that many families have about whether their quality of life is eroding. The Hawke Government's record at working to meet the twin goals of economic reconstruction and improved living standards shows it to be a government both of vision and compassion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often claimed-not least by our political opponents-that the Labor Government is out of touch; that the Labor tradition has somehow been abandoned. I repudiate that suggestion. The Hawke Government's record of job creation and social justice initiatives in an era of necessary economic restraint, and its close and constructive links with the trade union movement, dispel any such suggestion. But equally I am bound to state that if I see evidence that the Labor tradition is in jeopardy it is my job to speak out. If the Labor leadership does get out of touch it is my job to keep the leadership informed about what is happening at the grassroots of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what the people of Oxley elected me for: to represent their interests, to fight for their rights and to ensure they receive the full benefits of the Government's initiatives in jobs, industry development and family support programs so that their needs and aspirations are achieved. That will ensure that Labor's great tradition of service to the people of Oxley and to the Australian nation continues and prospers. </PARA>

<PARA> The debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1988-89, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1988-89 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1988-89 affords us an opportunity to scrutinise and comment upon the record of the Government and its handling of the economy. That record is absolutely wretched. Whereas last August we were exposed to grandiose promises and predictions by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), we are now being regaled by alibis and excuses for the complete failure of those economic forecasts. </PARA>
<PARA> With almost every forecast, every prediction, every assurance, the result has been the complete opposite. The assurances that inflation would fall have been replaced by the reality of rapidly escalating inflation. The promises of falling interest rates, recently echoed by the Prime Minister in Perth, have been eclipsed by savage increases and the almost unanimous opinion of bankers that housing interest rates will shortly hit an astounding 17 per cent. If we add to that the absolutely astounding statement by the Treasurer that it is the banks, and not the Government, which are responsible for rising interest rates, we almost have comic opera. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has been explaining for months how, through the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Government has exercised stringent monetary controls in Australia's best interests. Now he has the effrontery to protest innocence in regard to the spiralling interest rate debacle. This was the Treasurer who said last September:</PARA>
<PARA>We will not hesitate to adjust policy further if our balance of payments or inflation objects are being threatened. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year the same Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>We started tightening rates up as I said by 3 per cent. Well let me just say when I was tightening monetary policy in April last year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So let us have an end to this nonsense that it is the banks' fault. On an earlier occasion the Treasurer claimed all the credit, so now he must cop the crow. He must admit the Government's culpability is increasing the interest rates. The balance of payments deficit has already massively exceeded the total annual deficit forecast by the Treasurer. I will say more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business is in deep despair, faced by record interest rates and punitive taxation. There is no question but that increasing numbers will be forced into closure, insolvency and liquidation. In its boast of all the jobs it has allegedly created-I say `allegedly'-the Government turns a blind eye to the multitude of jobs which will be lost as businesses fail. We could go on. We could point to the Prime Minister trying to sidestep to qualify and otherwise escape from his commitment that by 1990 no Australian child will live in poverty. We have seen a pretty good example of sidestepping when he is reminded of that promise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right, Mr Deputy Speaker. We could, one by one, elicit the bogus promises which have been dishonoured by Labor in the last six years. The latest of course is the one when the Prime Minister said, `This Government will run its full term. There will be no early election'. Yet less than two years since the last election we see all the signs of an imminent election. That is one promise which Australia might hope the Prime Minister will break because most certainly that election will see the annihilation and defeat of the disastrous Hawke Government. However, the dismal record of the Government, the litany of broken promises, the confusion, bickering and failure in its policies are only too well known to the long suffering Australian taxpayers. I do not think that I need to extend the description further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I want to say is this: What concerns me is the complete inability and intent positively to confront these disasters. Next week the Treasurer apparently will make what he calls an economic statement. We have become used to these May statements which have consisted of platitudes and nonsense, and have never yet been in the nature of a mini-Budget which was desperately necessary. Therefore it would be altogether too much to hope that this occasion will be any different. Apparently the theme, and probably the entirety of this statement, will be addressed to alleged taxation cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter what might be the state of the economy, no matter what might be the practicability of sustainable tax reform, the show must go on. I guess the Treasurer will not admit to the massive increased taxation rake-off which has been the hallmark of this Government. He certainly will not concede, as he should, that any tax cuts will return but a fraction of this massive rake-off. Of course, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), as we know, has presented the Government with its demands. It said what it wants. Despite the protestations by the Treasurer that it might have to wait a bit, there is not a shadow of doubt that the Government will again faithfully accept its riding instructions. Minister after Minister, from the Prime Minister down, despite the economic madness of following the ACTU course, have said that it is a soundly based, reasonable, realistic formula. So obviously they will not be rocking the boat. </PARA>
<PARA> We see the relatively new Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) heaping vitriol on the Australian automobile associations for exposing the massive reductions in road funding. Contrary to all the facts, that Minister time after time stands up in this House-even as late as yesterday-and has the effrontery to allege that road funding has increased. Yet despite the huge hike in fuel taxes being garnered by this Government, all over the nation roads are deteriorating, construction falling way behind schedule, and the picture unfolding that things will continue to get much worse. </PARA>
<PARA> My own electorate shows the tragic fingerprint of Labor-the extension of the Bruce Highway widening and the bypass of Nambour were programmed in the Fraser Government under that excellent Minister, Ralph Hunt, by way of the bicentenial road fund trust, to be completed no later than 1988. They were on target and they would have been completed. But since Labor took over the time has lengthened, accidents and deaths on the roads continue and it seems that it will be 1991 or later before that work is completed. Further towards the north the highway will continue to reap its harvest of death because the Cooroy bypass, which should now be under way, is years away. The Six Mile Creek horror stretch probably will not be rectified for five years or a decade. The highway, as it proceeds further north through the electorate of my good colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) who I see here in the House, will get very much worse before anything is done. Yet to the cynical amusement of residents of the Sunshine Coast and Wide Bay, our local newspapers are full of waffle and statements by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) about the generosity and largesse of the Federal Government and making all sorts of promises and giving all sorts of assurances that cannot possibly be kept. He is generally making an ass of himself, but we need something to laugh about in Fairfax. It is only because of the tremendous efforts of the Queensland State Government and the local government that we are seeing a big program of road works in my electorate. He criticised them yesterday, but they are State and local government road works. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only when we look at the areas of responsibility of the Federal Government that we find deficiency, delay and neglect. It would be refreshing if the Government discontinued its denigration of the concerned and responsible automobile associations and faced up to its own neglect and its own avoided responsibilities. Perhaps then the road disasters will receive overdue attention. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter where we look, the same inefficiency is evident. Recently I asked the Treasurer when he would honour his promise to restore the two per cent which was purloined from Public Service superannuants and veterans. You will remember that, Mr Deputy Speaker. After all, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) was telling Australia that he had managed to get Caucus support for the restoration in the next Budget, so I thought that my question to the Treasurer was fair enough. His non-answer was first an attack on me for having the effrontery to ask such a question and even to suggest that the veterans and others had no reason to complain. Then he went on in a manner which indicates that it would be vain and fruitless for superannuants and veterans to expect any honouring of the promise of restoration this year, or perhaps ever. </PARA>
<PARA> Another ill-designed so-called exercise in economy is seen in the latest Government excisions from the pharmaceutical list. We get all sorts of excuses and all sorts of assurances. The Minister and the bureaucrats apparently know more than the doctors. Surely the massive protests from doctors, pharmacists, patients and pensioners cannot be so blithely dismissed as inconsequential, but they always are when we make representations to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) and the Department. In all its protests that economies are necessary, how on earth can the Department justify its action in sending out to doctors by way of communication in the form of a giant capsule or, as some doctors call it, a giant suppository 30 centimetres long to get their message across? We saw one here in this House today. I come from an electorate that has the Big Pineapple, the Big Cow and the Big Dinosaur; now we have the big suppository. </PARA>
<PARA> Has the Department decided that a simple 39c stamped conventional letter has outlived its usefulness? Has it opted for this bizarre, wasteful method of communication costing about twice as much? Is this the economy it claims its actions are designed to achieve? The heavy-handed bureaucratic manner in which alterations to the pharmaceutical schedules are made is absolutely deplorable. The Department seems to forget that it is dealing not with files but with people, many very old, frail and ill, easily confused and very apprehensive. When will the Department, let the doctors prescribe for their patients instead of its heavy-handed intrusion? After all, doctors know their patients, their needs and their problems, but this Government, which seems to think that every taxpayer is a tax cheat, also seems to think that every doctor is ripping off the system. In all probability it would be too much to expect that the Government would attack the root cause of Australia's malaise by departing from its doctrine of high spending. After the coalition Government dramatically and effectively cut back the prodigal government spending of the Whitlam years, total government spending in the 1982-83 Budget-our Budget-was of the order of $47 billion. All of this has been jettisoned by the Hawke Government and the 1988-89 Budget indicates spending of $82 billion, a huge leap. </PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with this total mismanagement of the economy, the current account deficit, forecast to be $9.5 billion for 1988-89, is already over $9.6 billion. Only Labor could establish the unenviable record of producing for the first time in Australia's history monthly deficits of $1 billion and more. Having established that record, the Government has sustained that disaster consistently for nearly three years. Labor has presided over a growth in Australia's foreign debt from $36 billion in 1983, 20.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), to an horrendous $121 billion in 1988, that is, 40.4 per cent of GDP. That is a huge percentage. I wonder whether the Treasurer feels that we have finally attained the status of a banana republic. If he does not, economists overseas certainly do. Not only has Moody's Investor Services Inc. downgraded our international credit rating from AAA in 1986 but there is a very real prospect of further downgrading. The Treasurer just has to accept and address these problems. Unless his April statement does so, he would be better off saying nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Government seriously considers reducing its huge spending, all of the talk of tax cuts and the like is just semantics. Families facing housing interest rates, predicted to reach 17 per cent, increasingly face the prospect of never owning a home or losing the home they are struggling to purchase. Honourable members should talk to their banks to see how many houses are being sold or are for sale each week. Indeed, more and more homes will either be repossessed or experience forced sale. What is the Government going to do to relieve this quite unmitigated disaster?</PARA>
<PARA> The main problem with the Government is its total incapacity to plot an economic course and stick to it. From the time of the much vaunted Tax Summit, when the Treasurer put down his paper and said, `This is what I will do', the Australian Council of Trade Unions made it quite clear that the unions, not the Treasurer, would take charge of the decision making process. Never in Australia's history has a government so rapidly and so frequently made pronouncements and promises and then, in a matter of weeks, abandoned them and gone into reverse. The latest imbroglio over the Sydney Airport is just par for the course. Such fiascos have become so commonplace that they are hardly remarked on any more. </PARA>
<PARA> The incapacity of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, Senator Button and Senator Walsh to look at privatisation of such enterprises as Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines and others has resulted from the total obstinacy and philosophical negativeness of the Left. Every time the Treasurer or the Prime Minister tentatively raise the prospect, there is a very quick veto by the Left. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also become very adept at avoiding issues and decisions by shooting them off to committees or inquiries, where they can quietly languish and hopefully die. That is where privatisation is at the moment. Sydney Airport will continue to increase in congestion, danger and inconvenience because yet another environmental impact study, not to be completed until safely after the next election, is to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why in Question Time we no longer get answers or information. Instead we get personal vilification, waffling and inaccurate allegations about the coalition's philosophies. It is interesting that we are repeatedly being asked, `What is your policy?'. It is obvious that the Government is completely unable to devise and institute policies to get us out of the trough and is plaintively hoping that the Opposition will come up with the answers. We are not about writing the policy for a failed and incompetent government, and the sooner the election is held and the Government is inevitably put out to pasture the better it will be. I am afraid that the speculation about when the Prime Minister will stand down and the Treasurer will assume the mantle is just daydreaming. The Australian people will shortly and decisively take that decision right out of their hands and it will be a long time before Australia ever has another socialist government. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in next week's statement the pensioners, who have been so disappointed and forgotten, and the veterans, who have been absolutely betrayed, will not again be ignored and insulted. Perhaps the Treasurer will change his inflexible mind and agree that one very positive contribution towards a solution to many problems would be to relieve the taxation burden on people's private savings. This would certainly assist in restoring economic growth, it would increase employment, and it would provide a real boost to primary industry and small business. </PARA>
<PARA> There is absolutely no incentive to save today. The repressive tax system puts a severe penalty on saving, so that between taxation, provisional tax and inflation saving is discouraged. Funds would become available if saving were encouraged; interest rates would be contained or fall; money would be available for home building loans; and it would certainly act positively against inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Treasurer puts on his blinkers, his sternest face, and shouts, `No'. So we do not save; we just splurge and money is in short supply, interest rates and inflation soar, and we go from the frying pan into the fire. The Treasurer could well be writing his epitaph and next week's statement could be that epitaph. History will underline his culpability in the destruction of the Australian economy. Hopefully, there are better days ahead; soon the Hawke Government will be just a distant and unpleasant memory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and the cognate Bills. I do not want to be provoked unnecessarily by the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Adermann), who has just resumed his seat, but I wish to respond to one or two of his remarks. Firstly, he referred to the level of foreign debt. We should all be concerned about the level of foreign debt. However, the honourable member should realise that our foreign debt can be broken up into something like 60 per cent private debt and 40 per cent government debt. In this financial year the Commonwealth Government, together with all other forms of government, has a zero borrowing requirement. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is zero. Therefore, we are allowing private enterprise more opportunity to borrow and expand and fuel what has been a quite significant investment push. The latest quarterly figures showed an investment level of about 22 per cent, which is an outstanding achievement. Investment fuels job creation. The more capital goods we put into place and the more factories that exist, the more job opportunities are created. Certainly we have a current account deficit problem, but we are working our way out of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge the traditional role that our primary produce and minerals play with their tremendous export potential. However, the Government has tried to broaden our base. For example, it has attempted to reduce the decline that has occurred in manufacturing industry. It is the Hawke Labor Government that has halted a 30-year slide, a 30-year attrition, from about 30 per cent of the work force being employed in manufacturing industry to 16 per cent. We have turned that around. We are getting net additions to those people employed in industry. Notwithstanding tremendous productivity improvements, computerisation and mechanisation, we are seeing manufacturing industry grow. What that means is employment for more people. To highlight the difference between the honourable member for Fairfax, on behalf of the Opposition parties, and the Government, we are about job creation and putting people into the work force. In our period in office about 1.3 million jobs have been created. The Opposition wants to be judged as a good manager, but under its administration the greatest growth industry was shattered families and employment opportunities and rapidly escalating double digit unemployment.I think that is rather disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to respond also to what has been said by some shadow Ministers. I was at a recent Price Waterhouse Urwick function at which the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Lewis, said, `We're not the Fraser Government. Don't judge us on our record. We're not like that. We had a mandate, but we're going to perform'. He made the comment on the day that Senator Chaney was pre-selected for a lower House seat. I thought I was hearing a challenge to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) because, after all, he was the Treasurer for five years in the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We can judge the records of the respective governments on the basis of job performance and growth in the economy. We need only compare the Fraser years with those of this Government. Honourable members opposite cannot say that the chief architect in the Fraser Government has somehow done penance and been rehabilitated. The people, particularly those families which were shattered by unemployment, will not forget the record of the Fraser Government. Honourable members opposite will have to live with it. Opposition members often say that we should take tough action to fix the situation. They say that the proposed tax cuts should be funded by reduced Commonwealth government expenditure. At the same time, Opposition members in the House say that Federal expenditure should be increased in this or that area-perhaps roads, pensions or other very worthwhile things. But they do not have the responsibility to indicate where they would cut expenditure. In these circumstances, the Opposition would let interest rates float even higher. It would cut back savagely on Federal government expenditure and investment and really contract the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do concede one point to the Opposition: it would very rapidly fix the current account problem. However, it would cause a monumental recession, if not depression. It would have unemployment rates shoot right up. It would control the current account deficit in that manner rather than in our way of recognising that it is a serious problem, but one that will not be fixed quickly. We recognise that we can restructure the economy. We can transform the economy, but we will do so with a minimum of social dislocation. That is the essential difference between the Opposition and the Government. The Opposition wants to get in there and smash families with the rod of unemployment. It wants to let interest rates go up even further; to have a contraction; and to kill off consumer demand. We want to manage the economy. We want to restructure it over a period. The problem with the economy is that it is growing too strongly, I suppose. We have a record of creating many jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> I am always amused when Opposition speakers say how concerned they are about the average wage earner or Mr and Mrs average Australian citizen. They have always opposed wage increases before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. They say that we cannot afford them, that we should not have them, and that they are not on. They always say, `Oh, yes, you will get increases, but they will be linked to productivity'. However, on average, productivity is about 1.1 per cent--</PARA>

That that has been accomplished with the goodwill of the industry and the unions is a great credit to them. That is what award re-structuring holds in prospect. It also involves training and career paths. I hope that it will also remove some debilitating demarcation disputes. Certainly there are prospects of real productivity increases in those areas. I ask the Australian people to judge us by what we have achieved in our period of office and what was achieved under the Fraser years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fairfax raised the issue of transport and the amount of government spending in that area and what causes road tolls. No one argues that better roads would not have an impact on reducing the road toll, but the real cause tends to be driver-related. The first issue I raise concerns buses. In New South Wales, bus timetables are approved by the Department of Motor Transport. A bus proprietor who wants to establish a timetable for getting from one town to another has to get the Department to approve it. We have found that the Department is approving a time which involves the bus driver driving at average speeds greater than the speed limit. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) has had a lot to say about the terror stretch between Goulburn and Yass. It is a terrible stretch of road. There was a bus fatality there not so long ago. It has not come out whether anyone checked the timetable of the departmental official who approved it. Was the driver forced because of the timetable approved by the Department to drive at speeds greater than the speed limit? If we start checking into some of these timetables, we may find that the State Government has condoned breaches of the law. I am not trying to suggest that the fault is solely that of the present State Government, but attention has been drawn to the matter and it is time that action was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that I have heard members of the Opposition ask for deregulation of the transport industry. They do not want to have any checks whatsoever. In this case, we have a check that should result in the saving of lives. It should be a safety factor, but it is directly the reverse. Whom should we blame? Should we blame the bus driver who has been told by his company to stick to his timetable and therefore breach the law? I find that he should be blamed. Do we blame the bus company that condones that breach or is forced to go along with it, or do we blame the official in the Department who approved the timetable? Attention to some of these sorts of matters can reduce the road toll. </PARA>
<PARA> In the trucking industry truck drivers have come in for a great deal of criticism for some of their driving practices. They are to be condemned for some of them. But where does the pressure come? Sole owner-operators have often mortgaged themselves to the hilt. They operate in a highly competitive system that forces them to cut corners and sometimes break the speed limit. I condemn those who let out the contracts, knowing full well what will be the result of their actions. What about the checking stations that have the opportunity to attempt to monitor the average speeds that must have been achieved between check points?</PARA>
<PARA> I draw those two aspects to the attention of the House. I know the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has made the suggestion, which I support fully, that we should have tachometers in buses and trucks. We would have a kind of black box that could not be tampered with that would keep a record of the speed at which these vehicles travel. That might involve the investment of some money, but it would be for the very considerable benefit of saving lives. The Opposition says that we are not spending enough money on roads. In fact, the Federal Government spent $1.2 billion this year; the States have spent $1.6 billion and councils, through local roads, are spending about $1.5 billion. In its period of office this Hawke Government has spent about $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I travel by road more than I actually do, but I frequently come from my home to Canberra. In the short years in which it has been my honour and privilege to represent the constituents of Chifley, there has been an enormous improvement. The last time I came down, which was for this week's session, I noticed that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown) had opened the bypass. I cannot recall the name of the bypass. </PARA>

<PARA> It is always possible to spend more money on certain activities, but we have done very well in spending $20 billion on roads in our term of office. People who use the roads would not argue that the roads have improved considerably. The Opposition should not come into the House and say that expenditure cuts of $5.5 billion should pay for tax cuts and then say, `We want to see road expenditure go up by a billion dollars', without telling us where it will get the money from. Frankly, I would not want to see one penny of the money spent in some of the Commonwealth programs in my electorate-whether it be for education in high schools or primary schools, for pensions or for the technical and further education (TAFE) college-diverted to roads. The Opposition cannot go on with its schizophrenic policy when National Party members, in particular, but Opposition members in general, talk about the need for more and more expenditure at a time when the shadow Minister for finance, who is at the table, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), advocates cuts in Federal Government expenditure without detailing where the cuts will come from. </PARA>
<PARA> In the western suburbs of Sydney we have now been subjected to the latest flood; the third in two years. I am disappointed that in the Federal electorate of Chifley, which covers part of the Penrith and Blacktown city council area, not one dollar was requested by the New South Wales Government to be spent on flood mitigation works, not one penny. I find that an absolute scandal. The New South Wales Government is very deceptive. The shadow Minister got up and said, `The Federal Government has not spent any money on flood relief in Penrith and Blacktown', but he knows full well that it is the State Government's responsibility to list the projects, prioritise them and then approach the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened in the last Budget? I will tell you what happened in the last Federal Budget, Mr Deputy Speaker. The State Government approached the Commonwealth Government with a program. Every project on that program was funded by the State Government-not 75 per cent, or 50 per cent, or 85 per cent or 99 per cent but 100 per cent. The State Government thought so little of the needs of the people of Penrith and Blacktown that it did not allocate one penny to flood mitigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, is running around saying, `I am prepared to spend an extra $5m'. I applaud that. He says, `I want to do it on a matching basis'. He has to do that under the scheme and he leaves people with the impression that the Federal Government is indifferent and will not match it. He does not tell the people that he is undertaking a review of needs and that that review has not been completed. The Federal Government is not in the business of allocating money when there are no projects. I think that the New South Wales Government should stop playing politics with people's lives and their property in the western suburbs. I am certainly one who advocates a flood free western suburbs. I know that goal will not come overnight. I think that is what the policy should be, both for the State and Federal governments and for the councils. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased that the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) will be taking the proposal for a task force to look into flooding problems to the ministerial council. This is something which I have advocated for some months. I believe that we need to work together to ensure that there is proper coordination at local government level-and now at trust level, I understand in my State-as well as between the two departments which are responsible and the Federal Government. I sincerely hope that after the review of needs in relation to flooding, my constituents in Blacktown Council and Penrith Council will be accorded the status of being on the list, will be given a high priority, and can look forward to the ending of the terror represented by the possibility of floods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) referred to our indebtedness as a nation and seemed to pass it off as something that was about to disappear, on the basis that a Budget surplus has occurred for the first time in a very long time. He went on to rationalise that what has happened in the past six years somehow compares favourably with what happened under the previous Government. In fact, he dredged up information, events and his beliefs of what happened up to 13 or 14 years ago, as though all this information were relevant today. The truth is that the country's indebtedness is somewhere in the vicinity of $120 billion at a time when the value of our dollar, in terms of recent history, is at a fairly high level, as measured against the US dollar. To make a virtue out of the fact that his Government is responsible for only 40 per cent of that debt is stretching credulity a long way.

<PARA> The Appropriation Bills provide the formal means by which the Parliament spends taxpayers' money and are therefore a reflection of the Government's fiscal policy. Additional appropriations contained in the Bills amount to some $684m, a minuscule part of the tax bonanza which the Government will reap in the second half of this financial year. After certain so-called savings, this represents a net increase of some $218m on expenditure outlined in the Budget only last year. A significant part of these additional costs is the cost to the Government of the national wage rise, while attempts to squeeze the Department of Defence seem to have led essentially to overspending rather than greater efficiency in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The major threats to fiscal policy seem to be in the future. As has happened so often in the past, the Australian Labor Party seems willing to mortgage the future, mortgage our country, for the sake of its electoral fortunes. The fiscal problems facing the Government as the economy deteriorates are potentially enormous. The present large and very desirable surplus is based on a significant rise in taxation revenue, helped along by a large dose of inflation which has contributed to the recent economic growth. As economic conditions change, so will the budgetary challenges confronting the Government change. The Treasurer's 1988 bicentenary Budget started to fall apart soon after his Budget Speech on 24 August. The initial flaws in that Budget were the forecasts that inflation would decline and there would be gradual improvements in the balance of payments. The Opposition criticised these assumptions at the time, and after only a few months it was clear, even to the most sycophantic followers of the Treasurer, that those predictions which were the basis of the economic policy of the Budget were hopelessly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> As we anticipated then, the opposite to what was predicted has occurred. Inflation has resumed its rise, but from levels which have been too high throughout all the years of the Labor Party's rule. Inflation will again be much higher than it is in other major countries this year. The current account deficit has obeyed economic reality rather than the vain commands of the Treasurer, and it is now at record levels. The current account deficit represents a huge drain on the savings of and potential for investment by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> High inflation and the current account deficit are just symptoms of the major economic problems Australia faces. The Government has attempted to deal with those problems through the initially gradual but now more stringent tightening of monetary policy. The only consistency in monetary policy has been that no-one has known precisely what was being done at any one time. Economists have correctly observed that monetary policy is a blunt instrument in its effect on the economy. They mean by this that it is not a very efficient means of achieving the Government's goals and, even if it does, it can do a lot of damage in the process. This is even more the case in a deregulated financial sector, or even in a partially deregulated financial sector as we have today. The damage done by monetary policy is a result of its effects on interest rates and the availability of funds to finance industrial expansion and investment. The ideal is a monetary policy which neither encourages malinvestment and overexpansion, as we are presently experiencing, nor places such a burden on businesses that virtually no investment takes place. However, a loose monetary policy at one time will necessitate a tight monetary policy later. The Labor Government has lacked any will to cut the Budget and use fiscal policy to continue the fight against high inflationary pressures on the economy. This is because in part it is beholden to vested interests which rely on government spending for their existence, and it is trapped by ideological commitment to floundering policies such as the ill-fated Medicare farce. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of taking the hard decisions, the Government has repeatedly fuelled rapid expansion of the economy, and this is underlined by enormous monetary growth and persistent inflation. This inflationary spiral, along with a range of new and onerous taxes, has allowed the Government to produce a large Budget surplus but it has removed the pressure on the Government to maintain a tight fiscal policy. For every apparent saving and efficiency gain the Government has made in the Budget it has created a new spending program to buy a miserable few votes or to silence some minority interest group. Any burden of restraint has been carried by State governments and the taxpayer. This is the standing record of the present Government on fiscal policy. We have a taxing surplus and limited spending restraint determined by political interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The dangers now are all in the future. Australia is facing major economic problems. It would be difficult to exaggerate those problems. The only variable is how long Labor can delay the forthcoming consequences of its misguided economic policies. An ability to delay is vital to the chances of this Government retaining office. For that reason political considerations are guiding the Government more than the long-term economic well-being of all Australians. It is clear that until recently the Treasurer saw it as being in his political interests to be seen as a tough so-called economic manager who was willing to make the difficult decisions. Now the Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, talks about the difficult decisions but makes none of them. As I previously suggested he-or the people who advise him-knows what those decisions should be and the dangers of not taking them, but all we get are vague promises to do something in the future. Economic reality will not wait for the Treasurer to find the courage. Talk from the Treasurer in debates in this House will not help anyone beyond the headlines tomorrow unless he takes some action on fiscal policy and micro-economic reform. The Treasurer will not act because he knows that the greater political risk for him lies in the backlash from those who are suffering and who will suffer more as a result of his failures. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure of prudent fiscal policy is not how well it works if everything goes the Government's way and its economic forecasts are fulfilled. Fiscal policy success must be judged by the ability of the Budget to stand up to the worst case scenario, to use one of the Treasurer's favourite terms. Economic policy is too important to leave anything to chance, yet the Budget-which these Bills add to-has not stood up to the changes in economic circumstances we have had already, much less those which will follow as the Treasurer continues to abrogate his responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Reagan's former budget director, David Stockman, in his book The Triumph of Politics, described how political considerations and the interests of congressmen undermined his efforts to produce a sensible budget. The way he chose to cater for these competing interests was by fiddling the budget forecasts of economic conditions. He produced what he described as a rosy scenario which promised a balanced budget in terms of the computer models used, but only because of totally unrealistic forecasts of growth, inflation and revenue. That sounds familiar, does it not? This is the sort of trick which the Treasurer pulled in his last Budget. The details are different but the principle of deception is the same. The trick is to delay the hard decisions, the bad news and the onset of reality. It will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just consider what will happen to the Budget as the economy moves into recession; and moving into recession is surely part of any worthwhile worst case scenario. The first development must be that revenue will begin to decline for State and Federal governments. Much of the present capacity of the States to accept lower payments from the Commonwealth has been derived from the boom in stamp duty revenue. That capacity will disappear. Federal revenue from income and corporate taxes will not grow as much as anticipated and sales tax will be much more difficult to expand. At the same time, the demands on Budget support will grow enormously. If unemployment also rises, the payment of unemployment benefit will reach the sky. </PARA>

As families suffer from rising costs, high interest rates and less secure employment, the demands on public housing, welfare and other income support will also grow. As we know from experience, these additional costs can grow surprisingly quickly. If a government is to deal with these potential problems, it must first have fiscal policy firmly under control, and this Government does not now. That is at the core of any future problems. That control is clearly not present now, nor does it seem likely that it will be in the future. This Government has not overcome fiscal policy problems. Worse, it has created new spending problems with programs which will be a burden for all future governments and for the taxpayers who have to pay for them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has given up. It is weak, it is tired, and it is showing all the signs of collapse. The real danger is that, with an election approaching, Labor will yet again promise to be everything to everyone. Already, prospective promises to wage earners, pensioners and lower income families are taking on huge, pork-barrelling proportions. Those groups might well be deserving of the assistance that is available, but to make a whole range of new spending promises in the economic circumstances which this very Government has created will be grossly irresponsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On top of the economic pressures of the Budget, the political pressures of a looming election which the Labor Party is desperate to win represent a further threat to sound fiscal policy. It is ironic that initial economic adversity will lead to a political reaction which compounds those economic problems. The Government is constrained in its action on fiscal policy by its so-called accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and its commitments to the expansion of the poorly defined social wage. The dangers of the wage deals which the Treasurer is negotiating behind closed doors with the ACTU and his masters in it are not just the size of wage rises but the other deals which are made on the side. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic problems the Government faces, however, will not go away. They cannot be blamed on foreign governments or international conditions. Fiscal policy is only one of the tools the Government can use to deal with the problems it faces and which it largely created. The Opposition has repeatedly warned of the dangers of a gross national debt in the vicinity of $121 billion. The need for micro-economic reform and privatisation is now even more pressing than it was just a couple of years ago when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) declared that micro-economic reform would be the focus of his third term. The Prime Minister has failed to deliver those reforms and has largely abandoned them. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most significant failing of Labor in government is the stifling of industrial relations changes to give wage earners more freedom and make the labour market more efficient. It is one thing to talk of award restructuring, but the centralised system of wage fixation itself is the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Appropriation Bills provide an opportunity for honourable members, under the protection of the Standing Orders, to discuss anything involving public affairs. They also provide an opportunity, given that they are supplementary Appropriation Bills, to examine the Government's approach to economic management and to contrast it to the approach of those opposite. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) got quite agitated and excited, but unfortunately he fell into the trap that those opposite so often fall into of talking in generalities and using the rhetoric of the times without going into specifics. He talked about programs that needed to be cut because of the great drain they are making on the public purse, but he did not identify them. Never will we hear concrete proposals from those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like briefly to go through one of the Government's principal instruments of economic management, the historic accord entered into with the trade union movement. The accord framework has allowed the Government the flexibility to address major structural problems in the Australian economy. Under this Government's economic management through the accord there has been unprecedented job growth. Between April 1983 and March 1989 over 1.3 million new jobs have been created-a job growth of 21.1 per cent. Compare this to the endless dole queues of the Fraser-Howard years. Unemployment has fallen by over 150,000 or nearly 22 per cent since the election of the Hawke Government. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was thrown out of office the unemployment rate was 10.1 per cent. It has now fallen to 6.2 per cent, the lowest figure for six years. The participation rate in February 1989 was 63.1 per cent, the highest level since publication of this series of figures commenced in 1966. </PARA>
<PARA> The historic level of job growth has not been brought about simply by the creation of jobs in the public sector. Of the 1.3 million new jobs created under this Government, 89.9 per cent have been in the private sector. It is undeniable that the wage restraint of the trade unions that has been possible under the framework of the accord has paid for the creation of these new jobs. It was estimated last year in a study by Phillip Lewis and Michael Kirby that real wages were 10 per cent below the level they would have reached without the accord. This study also credited the accord with assisting in the increase in employment by about 8 per cent or 600,000 jobs at that time. With the approaching wage-tax trade-off, the importance of the accord continues. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should compare this with what we might return to under a government of the opposite persuasion-a return to the confrontationist years of the Fraser-Howard Government. Where would we get to if we talked as the honourable member for Wentworth did when he proposed his second reading amendment? He emphasised and isolated labour market reform as one of the structural changes he envisages in his amendment. Where would we get to under a Howard-led government with people of the ilk of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) as the Minister responsible for the industrial relations area? It really would be a return to the dark days of confrontation and conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare this Government's economic management with the confusion of honourable members opposite. I am pleased that the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who is the Opposition spokesperson on finance, is in the chamber at the moment. He seems to be having a rather rough trot at present. Whilst he has made a meteoric rise to the front bench, he seems to be having a little difficulty in learning to negotiate the political tightrope. Let us look at his performance on the Face to Face program when he floated a few ideas. He floated the idea of allowing the States to impose new income tax. That is not a totally original idea from the conservative side of Australian politics. It was something that Malcolm Fraser pushed out under the heading of `new federalism'. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it was interesting that we got some discussion about tax policy from the Opposition, I believe that the Canberra Times editorial of 14 March best summed up the situation and gave some good advice to the honourable member for Wentworth. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson's proposals might be adding to the debate, but they are hardly advancing it. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the honourable member for Wentworth has taken over from Senator Stone as the spokesperson on finance. Senator Stone really had a troubled road as the spokesperson, basically because of his inability to handle the incompetence and inconsistency of the Leader of the Opposition. Perhaps the honourable member for Wentworth is now having the same problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the events which occurred when the honourable member was elevated to his current position. The good professor made a big deal of his personal trademark when he was talking about the vexed question of the Opposition outlining which programs it might cut to finance tax cuts. On 19 September 1988 the honourable member was quoted in the Melbourne Age. I am being very careful about quoting comments in the media attributed to the honourable member because I know that he has lectured journalists, telling them that they must not misquote John Hewson. I accept that and in good faith I read this paragraph from the Age of 19 September 1988, which quoted the honourable member for Wentworth as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I personally think we'll need to spell out a reason- able amount of detail . . . I have always had a disposition to giving as much information as possible-it's a personal trademark. </PARA>
<PARA>But it has not taken long for the honourable member's personal trademark to be smashed against the rock of political opportunism. I now wish to quote from the lead paragraph of an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 6 March. This is a quote from the article, not from the honourable member for Wentworth. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Opposition may abandon its idea of detailing its tax and spending policies before the next election as part of a strategy it is considering to minimise political risks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The article went on to suggest that the increasingly desperate Leader of the Opposition was the architect of this retreat. But it was not long before the honourable member for Wentworth joined in. In the Canberra Times of 8 March the honourable member for Wentworth was quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The position is that we really haven't made up our minds about when we will announce and how much we will announce. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a far cry from his advocacy of full information dissemination. It seems that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), was not quite in on this variation or shift in the Opposition's tactics-or perhaps it could have been that he was not quite attuned to what was going on in general. His response was:</PARA>
<PARA>Oh, is that so? Well, you know check with me, I'm the one who does the tax policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not mind which Opposition spokesperson does the tax policy, but the Australian public deserves better from the Opposition. Opposition members must really wake up-after six years in opposition the Australian public expects that when they offer themselves as an alternative government at the next election within the next 12 months they should put forward concrete policy proposals, policy proposals that can stand robust debate and testing. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, however, we have people such as the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Adermann) claiming that one of the reasons they do not want to do that is, to use his words, `the Government may be floundering, but it would pinch those ideas'. I find that a bit strange. I hope that the honourable member for Wentworth is able to get the cooperation of his National Party coalition partners in divulging this great information to the Australian community before the next election. </PARA>

The Opposition is in such a mess because it knows that any policy without the details will not be credible. But at the same time a policy which lists the cuts necessary to implement the Opposition's ideological nonsense will be unacceptable to the electorate. If the honourable member for Wentworth has resiled from his personal trademark out of loyalty to the Leader of the Opposition, that loyalty is surely misplaced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A vital component of the accord at the very outset was a commitment to improvements in the social wage. Since the election of the Hawke Government, considerable gains have been made in the social wage. I wish to quickly list some of the achievements. The first is Medicare. Tonight we heard the honourable member for Curtin calling Medicare a farce. Medicare has overwhelming community support; it is a universal and equitable system of health insurance for all Australians. We must remember that prior to Medicare about two million Australians had no health cover at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was ignoring him, Mr Deputy Speaker; but I thank you for your protection. I turn to community services. The number of child-care places funded by the Commonwealth has more than doubled, from 46,000 in 1983 to well over 110,000 in 1988. Between 1982-83 and 1986-87 the Government increased expenditure on dis- ability services by 78 per cent. I turn to the first home owner scheme. In 1987-88, the Commonwealth provided $222m under this scheme, which helped an estimated 52,000 low and moderate income households to buy their first homes and provided continuing subsidies to a further 247,000 home buyers. Under this Government, rent assistance for low income families has increased by between 150 and 200 per cent, depending on the size of the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me turn to the family package. This major social reform is part of this Government's landmark commitment to ensuring that by 1990 no child need live in poverty. The cornerstone of the family package is the family allowance supplement. The magnitude of this social reform was recognised by the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Bill Kelty, when he stated that, left to its own devices, the trade union movement would have taken 50 or 60 years to achieve increases for low income earners equivalent to those paid by the family allowance supplement. The family allowance supplement is a significant income redistribution device. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government's achievements in the social wage area are obvious, I do not deny that there are areas of further need. One of those areas is housing. Measures are necessary to improve the available housing stock. An important sector in the housing area is public housing. This Government should continue to look at increasing funding for public housing. That is not to forget that the majority of renters are in the private rental market. Even though there are those who have received great assistance from the Government, a case can still be argued for further assistance to those in the private rental market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government needs to be involved appropriately with State and local government-the other two spheres of government-in the proper planning for and provision of residential stock. There is a need to return to some of the visionary things that occurred during the Whitlam years. Under the Department of Urban and Regional Development (DURD) much work was done in appropriate planning, especially for our two major cities, Sydney and Melbourne. My colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), who has been of great assistance to me tonight in this speech, would know that on the northern urban fringe of Melbourne, in the electorates that we both represent, there is considerable immediate pressure as they are the areas that have the only available housing stock for development. Unfortunately, the municipalities in the area are under considerable pressure because of the population increase they will have to cater for over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Plenty Corridor, which reaches into the electorate of McEwen, was first considered, the population of the municipality of Whittlesea was estimated to increase from about 80,000 to 200,000 by the turn of the century. If honourable members considered the size of the municipalities or their electorates they would realise that this is a dramatic increase. It is dramatic because of the infrastructure that is required across the whole social wage, whether it be education, hospitals or other facilities. These things have to be planned, and planned well. In regard to employment, why should we go through the tortuous process of putting in place new residential stock in areas which are far from employment? We must return to the notion of total planning. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interview I referred to on Face to Face, the honourable member for Wentworth suggested that a number of things the Commonwealth Government was involved in should properly go back to State government. He may even have referred to the role of local government. I think we have an obligation as a national government to assist and be involved in overall planning, especially for our major cities. Our immigration policy is also important in planning. The Federal Government cannot insist that Australia take on board another 140,000 people without involving itself in the proper placing and appropriate settlement of those people. That is a challenge. It is an area in which, quite properly, the Federal Government should have a role. Perhaps it is apt for us to reflect on some of the innovative things that happened under Minister Uren and the old DURD during the Whitlam years. Our involvement, through proper planning, can be successful and appropriate. </PARA>

On every economic barometer the Fraser Government was better. The honourable member did not refer to those statistics in his very weak defence of the present Government's economic record.

In the first paragraph he talks about the Government being `the highest taxing government in the post-war history of Australia'; in the second, he talks about inflation; in the third, he talks about the high interest rates, and in the fourth, he talks about the need to increase productivity and about the unsustainably high level of foreign debt. I draw the attention of the House to those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to talk about April 1989 when the mini-Budget will be brought forward and discuss where the economy is and what are the fundamental problems facing Australia, the Australian taxpayers and the Australian people. Imports are exceeding exports. The national debt went from $36 billion in 1983 to $121 billion in 1988. We have an overheated economy led by overseas borrowings. Reasonably good commodity prices are helping the overheated economy. As a result of the Government's trying to slow down the overheated economy, which has been brought about by the big spending loose fiscal policies of this Government, we have high interest rates. According to the figures today, the prime lending rate has gone from 17.5 to 18.75 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA> The other bogey which is causing great concern to Australians is the current account deficit. Let us look at the accumulating figures. In 1985-86 it was $14.8 billion; 1986-87, 13.2 billion; and 1987-88, $12.2 billion. This year when it was supposed to be brought back to $9 billion we already have a current account deficit of $9.6 billion. If we analyse that figure, we see that we are running into a potential deficit of $16 billion. If we look at the total revenue expenditure of the current Government, which the honourable member for Scullin was so busy defending, we see that in the first year of Government, 1982-83, there was $42 billion worth of revenue and in its last Budget near enough to $82 billion of revenue. It has nearly doubled in the short time of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> New taxes have been introduced disregarding the fiscal drag and bracket creep on the poor old income tax earner who is now $58 worse off because of that aspect of the income tax. I will refer to that later. New taxes in this so-called reformist Keating Government have been introduced year by year. In 1983 a consumer price index increase was introduced for beer, cigarettes and petrol. Lump sum superannuation taxes were also introduced in that year. So year after year the CPI moves in on these luxury items and the poor old taxpayer is not quite aware that he is paying more, but he knows that at the end of the 12 months things seems to cost a lot more than they did at the beginning of the year. In 1984 there was a one per cent Medicare tax, a 10 per cent tax on wine, a resources rent tax and excise on new and old oil. In 1985 we had that wonderful capital gains tax that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was never going to introduce and in 1986 we had the fringe benefits tax. Company tax moved from 46c to 49c. Wine tax moved up to 20 per cent. In 1988 we had this complicated tax on superannuation. I will concede that the Government was forced by international pressures to reduce the company tax from 49c back to 39c in an endeavour to attract investment into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to proposals for tax reform. The greatest problem facing all taxpayers in Australia is the fact that they are moving into a higher tax bracket and they are paying more total tax as their marginal rate goes up. </PARA>
<PARA> Access Economics Pty Ltd, in its publication of November 1988 and its suggestion of a broad brush for tax reform, made certain observations. The authors of this document have a Treasury background and put forward some very simple propositions which average Australians are now understanding very clearly. Under the current Government, the tax regime produces an incentive for consumption and debt. Of course, in those circumstances, there is no incentive for future saving and investment which is so vital in Australia. During the regime of this bracket creep, the income-based broadening consumption tax has actually been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that Access Economics is making, which all Australians now agree on, is the impact of inflation upon average income earners. As wages continue to grow by the effect of inflation, taxes go up. Over the last four or five years real wages have fallen, but because of the impact of bracket creep a higher proportion of wages is paid in tax. The tax is well ahead of inflation and the poor old wage earner's standard of living is falling in real terms. Again, that document refers to the peak zone of damage being in the area of $35,000 of income. At that level the top marginal rate is paid and it is suggested that by 1990 this will be 1.1 per cent of average weekly earnings and wage earners will be in that bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the background of tax by stealth, where inflation pushes individual taxpayers into higher brackets, we can see the remarkable change over the years as taxpayers have moved into higher brackets by no fault of their own and by no legislation action by government. In 1954-55 the top marginal rate of 66c in the dollar was 18 times average weekly earnings. In the 1984-85 figures, this was a salary of $400,000 per annum. At that level of taxation, obviously income earners were being taxed at a high rate, but they certainly had to have a very high income. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1970s, the top marginal rate was five times that of average weekly earnings. As we moved into the 1980s the 49c marginal rate cut in at $35,000, which was one and half times average weekly earnings. So the net result is that Australians have less tax and less money to put into savings and develop their own lifestyles. The other skewing of investment and inflationary pressures is the fact that the present Labor Government was not game politically to put a capital gains tax on domestic dwellings, so this made the investment appear in many different quarters. We saw the prices of houses in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and around Australia reach record heights. One of the reasons was the fact that capital gains tax was placed upon investments in a very discriminatory way by the fact that housing was no longer capital gains taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Australia Bank summary in December 1988 made some very interesting observations on the saving investment crisis facing Australia along the same lines. Our future place in the world, the future of our living standards and our lifestyles really depended upon addressing this problem of inflation and the way in which it affected the average taxpayer. Investment funds were now moving to houses which did not have any capital gains tax away from productive activities. The funds that have been accumulated by hard-working Australians and which should be put into bank accounts are now melting away with inflation. So Australians who have any spare capital or even those who can borrow some funds are putting them into property, shares, antiques as is the Treasurer (Mr Keating), paintings, insurance bonds, spas, swimming pools, and the domestic home that I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a difficulty facing Australians with their funds. They have some concern about the drop in property values that is now becoming apparent and the fall in share market values that may be around the corner. If they invested $100 at 10 per cent they would receive a nominal $10. If inflation were running at, say, 6 per cent and they had to pay a 40 per cent tax rate of $4, their net return, especially if we took into consideration the Medicare levy of 1.25 per cent, would be negative for funds in investment holdings. The National Australia Bank, in its article, suggested that we ought to calculate interest and take into account the inflationary impact so that the investors and savers in Australia would be encouraged to leave their money in banks and building societies so that they could be made into productive investments for the betterment of Australia. A friend of mine in one of the biggest building finance industries in Victoria suggested, in discussions, that we should take a flat rate of tax from source at, say, 25 per cent, as that would provide an incentive for individuals to invest, and help the tax man obtain the rightful tax from those sources of funds that were invested in building societies. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to an article highlighting the difficulties that faced the Reagan Administration in America and some of the claims that had been made about the Reagan years. In my view, President Reagan tackled the problems with vigour and foresight and the United States economy continues to grow. The first claim the article made was that the United States deficit was excessive by world standards. However, commentators have tended to overlook the fact that there were $60 billion worth of surpluses at the State and local government level; whereas in Australia State and local governments and, until recent times, the Federal Government run massive deficits. The second claim was that the US trade deficit, unlike ours, was the result of a consumer binge, fuelled by tax cuts, causing a domestic deficit. Mr Maley, a visiting fellow at the commerce faculty of the University of New South Wales, suggested, in the article, that the change in the US deficit was the result of a massive reduction in US lending abroad. The third claim was that there was a debt-driven Keynesian import boom. However, during the Reagan years America created in excess of 15 million new jobs, dropping its unemployment rate to about 6 per cent. Mr Maley stated:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the outstanding features of the American economy over recent years has been the extraordinary flexibility and responsiveness of the labour market. Wage and work practice negotiations, occasionally on an industry basis but overwhelmingly by enterprises, have yielded private bargains forged in terms of enterprise survival and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA>The next claim was that US investment was lagging behind private saving at an all-time low. Mr Maley pointed out that under Reagan the US was the only major industrial nation to increase investment as a share of gross national product (GNP). The five points Mr Maley suggested as being the successes of the Reagan Administration were cutting tax; surging entrepreneurship and productivity in response to tax cuts; slowing the Carter regulatory explosion; reducing and containing total government expenditure as a proportion of GNP; restructuring and innovation in a competitive environment; and rapid labour market adjustment, especially at enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to bring to the House's attention Margaret Thatcher's comments on the problems faced by the Reagan Administration and her admiration for the way in which Reagan led the American people during the, at times, difficult economic conditions. At the end of his presidency the American economy remained buoyant and remarkable, given the length of time that it had maintained its profitability. The National Review of 1989 reports Margaret Thatcher as saying this about Reagan's leadership:</PARA>
<PARA> President Reagan saw instinctively that pessimism itself was the disease and that the cure for pessimism is optimism. He set about restoring faith in the prospects of the American dream-a dream of boundless opportunity built on enterprise, individual effort, and personal generosity. He infused his own belief in America's economic future in the American people. That was farsighted. It carried America through the difficult early days of the 1981-82 recession, because people are prepared to put up with sacrifices if they know that those sacrifices are the foundations of future prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA> Having restored the faith of the American people in themselves the President set about liberating their energies and enterprise. He reduced the excessive burden of regulation, halted inflation, and first cut and, later, radically reformed taxation. When barriers to enterprise are removed and taxes cut to sensible levels (as we have found in Britain in recent years), people have the incentive to work harder and earn more. They thereby benefit themselves, their families, and the whole community. Hence the buoyant economy of the Reagan years. It has expanded by a full 25 per cent over 72 months of continuous economic growth-the longest period of peacetime economic growth in US history; it has spread prosperity widely; and it has cut unemployment to the lowest level in over a decade. </PARA>
<PARA>I leave the House with this philosophical commitment of the next Howard-led government: the Howard government will cut taxes and expenditure and return Australia to a genuine long term prosperity that is not based on overseas borrowings, current account deficits and the capacity, as is the case with the present Government, to fudge the next difficult economic decision, which may be the case next Wednesday night when the Treasurer brings down his April statement in preparation for the election-whenever it is held. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take up some of the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), who spoke about some of the taxes the Government has introduced. We on this side of the House make no apology whatsoever for introducing a capital gains tax, a fringe benefits tax and for knocking off the free lunch. If that affects some of his supporters, some of the silvertails who had free lunches-that were called business lunches and were claimed as a tax deduction-that is hard luck. The working class people of Australia never had an opportunity to have so-called business lunches. I am delighted that we took action to knock off those free lunches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also pleased that the Government stopped the bottom of the harbour schemes and introduced measures to stop tax avoidance. The Australian Labor Party should be extremely proud of some of the measures it has introduced to stop the rorting of the taxation system. When the honourable member for Corangamite holds up the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) as a symbol to get Australia on the road to economic wonders, one thinks of when we came to government: he had left us with a deficit of $9.6 billion. The inflation level had reached double digit figures and unemployment had gone through the roof. The honourable member for Corangamite is a brave man if he puts that fellow up as leader because the people of Australia do not have short memories. They will remember what that gentleman was like as Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> I was extremely pleased that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) said in his maiden speech that we had introduced the steel industry plan. As a member representing the steel industry city of Whyalla, I am extremely proud because on 16 April Whyalla will celebrate its seventy-fifth birthday. If ever a community can hold its head high, it is the Whyalla community. When Malcolm Fraser closed the shipbuilding industry in Whyalla, which is remote from most major cities, many people thought that it was the end of the world. Admittedly, Whyalla was down on its knees. But the people, with their resilience, intestinal fortitude and courage, stuck with it. As a result of the Labor Party's restructuring of the steel industry, Whyalla is now up and running again and doing extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA> I am extremely proud of that because Whyalla has a population consisting of 64 different nationalities. When immigration debates take place in the House I am extremely proud to say that we epitomise what immigration is all about. The 64 nationalities in Whyalla work extremely well together; they cooperate. I cannot praise enough the contribution that nationalities from all over the world have made to that community. It is very fitting that on 16 April Whyalla will celebrate 75 years of being. It should be very proud in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table, the very competent Minister for Employment and Education Services (Mr Duncan), raised with me the figures of youth unemployment. It is pleasing to note that a figure recently released pointed to a decrease in the number of teenage unemployed seeking full-time work of 15,700 to 77,800. That is 5.5 per cent of the teenage population. The teenage unemployment rate dropped to the lowest figure, 14.8 per cent, since the monthly surveys commenced in February 1978. We should pay a tremendous tribute to the Hawke Government for attaining those figures. </PARA>
<PARA> A continuing problem causing concern for the constituents of my electorate of Grey is the level of unemployment in the over-55 age group. It is a requirement for each person in receipt of unemployment benefit, to provide the unemployment benefit form SU 19b. This form needs to be completed each fortnight by the claimant to prove that he or she has been seeking, or searching for, work. While I am in favour of beneficiaries providing proof of their willingness to seek employment, it is of grave concern to me that many older men and women, many of whom have health problems which restrict the scope of occupations available to them over and above their age disadvantage, are finding it increasingly difficult to approach three different employers each fortnight to provide the required information. </PARA>
<PARA> Job opportunities in the Grey electorate are restricted to one basic employer in each of the Iron Triangle cities and small offshoot industrial and support industries. Add to this a large rural area-bigger than the majority of electorates represented here in the chamber-which at present is undergoing extreme drought conditions with associated problems for small business, and the result is an ever decreasing number of businesses able to survive, reducing the already depleted vacancies available. The circumstances which prevail in areas outside the metropolitan region make it well nigh impossible for a person already disadvantaged by age and possible health restrictions to fulfil the requirements laid down in form SU 19b. The bureaucrats who make these blanket decisions do not know or care about how the decisions will affect smaller populated areas such as the Grey electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> These people face humiliation each time they approach employers, only to be told that no employment is available to them due to age or health. The feeling of uselessness is debilitating to them. They constantly feel depressed and unworthy of any support. These people are not considered for positions vacant, competition being high for any vacant job. Applications are received from all areas of the State with young, healthy people being given preference each time, but still these people must continually approach employers in an effort to maintain their benefit rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Further to this, many large companies display signs at entrances to their premises which state that all company recruitment is made through the local Commonwealth Employment Service and no personal approaches to the company for employment will be considered. This further reduces the already limited area available to the job seeker to approach employers and puts further additional pressure on him or her to find the required number of companies or businesses to approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that provision has been made whereby lodgment of the SU 19B form can be made on a 12-weekly basis under certain conditions. However, the problem still remains that, through the limited number of business houses and companies in the area and the long period of time in which the benefit would be drawn, these people still face the trauma of constant rejection. It is crucial that provision be made for a new category of benefit which encompasses these people. It should be a benefit which can be received without the stigma associated with drawing unemployment benefit for a long period and without the pressure of having to make approaches to employers on a constant basis, which the majority of the community recognises as a futile exercise. The benefit should take into consideration health and age factors for those people who do not meet the criteria for the invalid pension, but who are at a distinct disadvantage to the majority drawing unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> A constituent in my electorate who is suffering from silicosis is finding himself in the unenviable position of constantly approaching employers with regard to possible employment prospects and each time being told that his health condition and his age are against him. However, if this gentleman does not furnish the documentation required by the Department of Social Security and provide proof of his active job seeking, his benefit will be severed. The stress placed on this gentleman to provide the necessary documentation during each period is causing further deterioration of his health and well-being. He said, `After spending 40 years in the work force, I am being humiliated and demeaned because of my health condition and my age'. He continually makes approaches to the same employers even if he is feeling unwell. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an urgent situation which needs to be rectified immediately to give these people the respect they deserve. They do not wish to be reliant solely on benefit payment, but through no fault of their own they find themselves in this position. Many of them have been retrenched or have taken voluntary early retirement for age and health reasons. They do not have the same rights as a person on another form of pension or benefit; in many instances, they are at a greater disadvantage. For example, a small retrenchment package can return approximately $30 to $35 a week, as is the case for a single person claiming unemployment benefit. However, a pensioner on married pension is allowed $70 a week and a single pensioner $40 a week before the benefit is affected. This places the retrenched person at a distinct disadvantage. It may be said that retrenchment packages are voluntary, but let us not forget that in many cases those who accept voluntary or early retirement make way for younger people to enter the work force. I urge the Minister to look at encouraging this to take place by bringing the amount of allowable income for those on unemployment benefit at 55 and over in line with other benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of unemployment benefit being a temporary benefit needs to be laid to rest once and for all. In some areas of Australia we will never again achieve full employment, and this needs to be recognised. Consideration must be given to a form of benefit which will allow these people to receive benefits without the stress now endured by them. They should not be penalised because they are unable to compete successfully against younger people in an extremely competitive labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> A further problem affecting many people in my electorate is the rate of payment for Austudy for married men with dependants. Many men and women are returning to school to further studies to obtain new and necessary skills to allow them a fighting chance to seek employment in an area where employment prospects are low and competition is high. At present, the rate of payment for Austudy recipients with a dependent spouse and children is considerably lower than is the unemployment benefit. This is a disincentive to those people who are willing to take the enormous step of furthering their education. </PARA>
<PARA> A constituent in my electorate wanting to further his education was unable to do so because his rate of payment would be less than the married rate for unemployment benefit. This gentleman's financial commitments did not allow for a drop in his current benefit payment, as he had an expectant wife and two children to support. The age of the children, all under school age, does not allow for the wife to apply personally for unemployment benefit. Therefore, taking into account the Austudy payment with dependent spouse and assistance for the children through the family allowance supplement, this family would receive $50 less than if the husband stayed on the existing unemployment benefit. These are the people who must be assisted as a priority. They are willing to make the commitment by returning to school to further their knowledge to gain employment but many cannot take the desired step because of financial commitments. Their budget does not allow for a decrease in existing benefit payment. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that in this time of spending restraint, we must spend according to Budget allowance. However, I feel that these people deserve our assistance immediately. They have taken the step to further their skills; they have shown their willingness and incentive to give themselves a better chance to return to the work force. They do not class the receiving of benefits as their inherent right, nor do they wish to continue in this manner. Their desire to obtain work through self-betterment is worthy of support by all of us here today. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that assistance be made available at the earliest opportunity to allow married men and women who wish to take this step to do so with confidence and financial security. I implore all honourable members present to show their commitment to the many ordinary men and women facing this situation and ask that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) give urgent consideration to the plight of many of our fellow Australians and have the problems within the system rectified as soon as possible. I note that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), who is sitting at the table, is nodding in agreement and I am pleased that he is very supportive of this. </PARA>

I conclude by mentioning a progressive move that is taking place in my electorate which, I am pleased to say, has the full support of the people I represent. I refer to the acquisition of Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) television. For a long period I have been attempting, through various Ministers for Transport and Communications, to have priority given to the Spencer Gulf area in my electorate for the broadcast of SBS television. It is quite appropriate that this should be done. As I said earlier in my speech, people of 64 different nationalities live in Whyalla. A strong contingent of Italians and Greeks live at Port Pirie. These people like to be associated with SBS television, not only because of the soccer, which they all like, but also because of the first class news services and other services shown on SBS. I am pleased that the present Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) is very sympathetic to the cause. I hope that in the not too distant future I will be able to announce that the Spencer Gulf area in my electorate will be able to receive SBS television. This will be a tremendous breakthrough. I can assure the people in my electorate that I will continue to strive to have this first-class, superb television service broadcast to my area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a compassionate and sincere speech from the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil). Perhaps it is a pity that he, instead of some other members of the Government, is not on the front bench. I congratulate the honourable member on his speech and the bipartisanship which he displayed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly delighted to see the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) at the table tonight. No doubt he specially came into the chamber to hear my speech. I wish to raise a matter on which I received quite a sympathetic hearing for the Minister some time ago. I am pleased to see him in the chamber tonight to hear me speak on the matter again. The matter I wish to raise concerns the St Ignatius Catholic primary school at Bourke which has 150 pupils, about a third of whom are Aboriginal children. In 1987 the teachers and principal of the school took a quite novel and bold step when they started to run some classes with Aboriginal children and some classes with white children. I have to say that this has been done with considerable success. The arrangement has been very beneficial for the Aboriginal children. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, lest anyone should think that I am talking about apartheid in any shape or form, I would like to explain what has happened. Much agonising thought went into this decision before it was made. In fact, from what I hear, the teachers had considered the matter and had talked about it for about 10 years. When they eventually went ahead, they did so against the advice of nearly everybody else. But the teachers at the school, who have a particular compassion for Aboriginal children, recognised the disadvantage that existed. People who have had some experience with Aboriginal children, particularly in country towns, will know that most Aboriginal children arriving at school for the first time have never had a book in their hand, their parents may not have a television and, therefore, they have never seen Sesame Street and they do not know the alphabet frontwards and backwards as many white children do. Therefore, they start behind many of their classmates. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal children also have an inherent natural shyness. They have a fear of being embarrassed if they are asked a question. They fear that they will be humiliated if they do not understand something. I guess this is a natural fear. Unfortunately, if they do not understand something they are too frightened to ask about it and this leads to boredom and, eventually, to mischief. In the end it sadly leads to absenteeism and lack of motivation. As a result many Aboriginal children end up learning very little. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising this, the sisters and lay teachers at the school consulted the Aboriginal parents in Bourke who sent their children to the school. The Aboriginal parents readily agreed with the teachers that it would be a good idea to trial having the Aboriginal children in separate classes. I guess most of the Aboriginal parents trusted the sisters because they knew that they intended to do well for the children. They said, `Do whatever you think is best for them'. When the classes were started they were an instant success. The Aboriginal children immediately had a higher degree of confidence when they sat in classrooms purely amongst their own. They became keen to learn. They started to learn rapidly and, not surprisingly, their attendance levels rose. Of course, the white children, who were not being disrupted by bored Aboriginal children, started to do better too. So this was a beneficial side effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I hasten to say that all of the Aboriginal parents were given the option that their children could still attend white classes if they so wished. One or two of the Aboriginal parents chose to have their children stay in the white classes. But most of them volunteered to put their children in these separate classes. The children, of course, still mix. They mix for sport and they mix in the playground. The still mix in classes for music, arts and craft and, interestingly enough, science. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal children are taught in a flexible way when they attend the separate classes. If the bell rings at the end of 40 minutes and they are learning something about which they are all interested and keen, the teachers will ignore the bell and continue the lesson. They just play it by ear. I guess that is the secret of the success. I would not say that this arrangement would normally work anywhere. However, it works very well at St Ignatius because the teachers have a high degree of experience. They have a great love of the Aboriginal children at the school and their attitude is absolutely A1. I cannot stress too much how necessary that is for this scheme to work. On top of that, the scheme would work only where there was a high number of disadvantaged Aboriginal children students. If they were not in a disadvantaged position it would not, of course, be necessary to take such a step. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay a tribute to Sister Eileen Quade, a former principal of the school, for taking this bold step. I also pay a tribute to Sister Marietta, Lois Wilson and the other teachers who have followed on and been involved in the scheme. The morale of the school, as a whole, has gone up since then. I do believe that this school could be a blueprint for other schools in other towns in similar situations. Perhaps the same model could even be tried in some secondary schools. I know that the situation in some of the secondary schools is quite desperate in many aspects, even in towns like Bourke, where the percentage of absenteeism and mischief-making is at an abysmal level in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to recognise that in some of these outback towns, where the Aborigines tend to live on the fringes, the children suffer a type of culture shock when they turn up at school for the first time. They are disadvantaged, because it is not unusual for some of them to sleep in three or four different homes through the week. I have seen them bashed after pension night. It can be unusual for seven, eight or nine-year-olds not to have been sexually molested. It is terribly sad, because it forms a pattern in their minds and sets them on a road of behaviour which is detrimental to them and to the whole community. If somehow we could educate a generation of Aboriginal children to grow up and move normally into the work force and become-this is the most important point-responsible parents, who will be deeply concerned to do the best for their children and to see that their children go through school, take the hard subjects, study and do well and get jobs, we will hopefully be progressing towards getting over some of the problems we have today with Aboriginal people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme is working. In fact, it is the only successful Aboriginal story of some magnitude that I know of in my electorate. I am delighted that it is working so well. One other problem at that school, which I did raise with the Minister some time ago and to which the Minister has given some consideration, for which I am grateful, is the aspect of fees. Everybody at the school is obliged to pay a fee. The black parents, generally speaking, have not paid any fees at all to speak of. That places an extra burden on the school most of which is ultimately put back to the white parents, some of whom are getting a little tired of this. I acknowledge it is very difficult to suggest the correct solution. </PARA>
<PARA> One can talk about just giving a straight Government grant, or garnisheeing welfare cheques, to ensure that the payments will be made. But it is not quite as easy as that. For example, if one did something as drastic as garnisheeing the welfare cheque of an Aboriginal parent, the parent probably would not send the child to school. That would be a particular shame. In a Budget this year for Aboriginals of $808m, this area certainly needs consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I move now to another topic which I have raised twice previously this week; that is, the plight of the people in the Nyngan area because of the floods there in the last week. I want to apprise honourable members and get on the record what is happening. As I have said before, several tens of thousands of sheep in that area have already been lost because of flood waters which have covered about 5,000 square kilometres in my electorate. There is now an immediate concern for the 40,000 or more sheep which are still standing in water, or standing on little islands in the water. Some of them have been standing in water for five days or more. Fortunately, today I am pleased to announce that there has been a decrease in the level of the waters in some areas. This decrease has allowed the farmers to move some of their sheep to higher ground, or at least towards higher ground, because in some cases sheep have to be moved through water for up to 10 miles, which is a very slow and tiresome process. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful to the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) for making available a Chinook helicopter which arrived yesterday. It can lift about six tonnes which is 150 to 200 bales at a time. Yesterday afternoon, on its first run, it delivered several hundred bales to these starving sheep. Today it has made about five drops which amounted to 25 or 30 tonnes. At this stage, though, we are only feeding sheep which are on ground; we are not yet feeding any sheep still in the water. I am pleased to announce also that the sheep ate ravenously where the hay was dropped. We did not experience any shy feeders, as often happens when sheep are fed with fodder for the first time. They all moved and ate straight away.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay tribute to the Haddon Rig stud which made available 20,000 bales of first cut lucerne at cost, which works out at about $3 a bale. I guess it could have normally sold that for about $4.50, so it is quite a generous gesture. The farmers who receive this hay of course have to pay $3 for the bale and they pay 50 per cent of the cost of the freight to get it from Haddon Rig through to Nyngan where it is picked up by the helicopter. That particular freight cost does not amount to much and the State Government picks up the rest of the cost. The chopper, of course, is very expensive to run. I am told it costs around $9,000 an hour, which sounds like an extraordinary amount of money, but there are 10 personnel up there with the Chinook helicopter and two refuellers. Of course, the services of the helicopter are provided free to the farmers in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Government provides certain benefits for the people in these difficulties, the main one of which is $40,000 which will become available later for those in need, at a concessional interest rate of 6 per cent. When that amount was first set I guess it was a reasonably generous thing to do. One cannot have a drain too much on the public purse. Probably nobody appreciates that fact more than I. Even in this Federal forum, I say to my State Government colleagues that there may be a need to review this. It will not affect very many people in that area, but there will be some people in desperate need. Some of them have lost several thousand sheep. They have nearly lost all the sheep they had. Forty thousand dollars will probably only buy 500 or 600 sheep these days. Some people have lost 10 times that amount. Those sheep will have to be replaced. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I was talking to Merv and Gloria Johnson on the phone and they were telling me the most incredible stories. They have lost about 6,000 sheep and they still have 600 or 700 alive, standing in water. The sheep have gone up to low shrubby trees and are putting their necks in the branches of the trees to try to keep out of the water. As one can appreciate, the length of the fleece is very critical and these sheep are heavy in wool. The water goes into the fleece, is held there, and can give the sheep an extra 20, 30 or 40 pounds of weight. It becomes very tiresome for the sheep to try to stand up. If they go down they drown. The Johnsons, of course, are very stressed, because they are seeing their life's work being literally washed away overnight. It is a very tragic situation. How they will replace those sheep is beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA> I know one chap south of Gongolgon who has lost 5,000 sheep out of 5,500. He is only a small-time fellow. He is not a rich grazier, in any sense of the word. He had built up his business and this will no doubt ruin him. Another fellow, Chris Elder, and his wife, moved, I believe, onto their farm only a couple of months ago. They put 4,000 of their best ewes, the great bulk of their flock, on the Bogan River and they cannot even find any of those 4,000 ewes, from what I last heard. Imagine the distress that is causing them. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking this matter over earlier this evening with Jeff Wise, who has been marvellous in this whole thing. He is the district veterinary officer based at Dubbo. We talked about the plight these people are in. When disaster strikes people they usually lose either their assets or their income. They rarely lose both. The people at Lismore, for example, or in the cyclone at Gympie, could lose their house or have it ruined in the flood. If, for example, a person loses a job then he or she loses an income. But these people here have essentially lost both income and assets. Perhaps there is a special case for them. They cannot insure their assets because the premiums they would have to pay make that just beyond the pale. Most of them-not all-are in debt already. The value of the assets which they have lost is probably equivalent to the equity portion covering their debt. One can imagine the situation they are in. Having lost all their sheep they have lost their income, so they cannot serve their existing debt, let alone the costs that will arise from now on with replacing sheep, replacing fencing-the average farmer up there would have lost several thousand dollars worth of fencing-as well as paying for feed for the stock they have left, cleaning out dams, the cost of delaying shearing, et cetera. If left alone these people can only go backwards. It would mean ruin for some. That would be a shame because we would be losing skills built up over not one generation but sometimes several generations. It is very hard to be a stockman and survive out in that area. It is a pretty harsh climate. My heart goes out to those people, as I am sure do the hearts of all in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already spoken of some of the problems that are yet to come, such as the sheep deaths that will still occur from the weakness that will eventually overcome them; from bogging in the mud as the waters recede and they try to get to water to have a drink; from the ewes lambing-fortunately there are not too many up there; and the pregnancy toxaemia problems that go with ewes heavy in lamb. One of the big problems that will arise from now on is fly strike because of the humid conditions and wetness of the wool. Some of the sheep will be eaten alive by maggots-not a pleasant thing to experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Possibly worst of all, and something we do not learn too much about from the agricultural and veterinary manuals, is the peculiar problem that arises when sheep stand in water for many days. After seven days or so their hooves soften to such an extent that they separate from the coronet, the lower leg. When sheep move through the black soil up there, it sucks off their hooves. I was talking to a fellow, Mac George, who went through this with a mob in 1976. He said that after the water receded and the sheep were standing in the little pools of mud, they drove them up onto the higher and harder ground but the sheep immediately turned around and went back into the mud because their hooves were so tender and flyblown. They were so stressed that they just wanted to get back for relief. They lost the will to eat and eventually they all had to be destroyed. The ironic thing in that case was that poly pipe and pumps had to be flown in by helicopter to provide the sheep with water because they could not get to the water; if they had to go through the mud they just bogged in it. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see from that the sorts of problems these people have to put up with. I ask everybody to be aware of those problems, and if special help is needed perhaps consideration should be given to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In today's debate on the Appropriation Bills I would like to speak on a couple of important matters. One is the matter of privatisation, which has re-emerged just when everybody thought it had been buried by the last Australian Labor Party National Conference. Australia has very few public enterprises, public assets, compared with many other Western nations. We just heard the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) talking about farmers losing their assets. That illustrates how catastrophic it would be if the Australian people lost their assets. It ever privatisation comes they would lose their assets; they would lose their employment, they would lose their livelihood. Britain and France, with whom we compare ourselves, have until recently had public ownership, even in the areas of car and steel manufacture. The topic of privatisation pops up with such regularity and such tenacity that one wonders what fuels it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Privatisation is the dogma of the New Right which was embraced by members of the Federal Opposition a few years ago. When it was first mooted by them our side of the House flatly rejected it, and rightly so. As I mentioned, there are very few public enterprises in Australia-many fewer than in most Western democracies that we usually compare ourselves with. Those public enterprises that we do have were not set up for ideological reasons but out of sheer necessity, either because private enterprise did not want to invest in areas it saw as unprofitable or because it was found that public enterprise was needed to compete with a private monopoly to protect the public interest from private greed. So when one considers the roles of public enterprise, one of which is to keep private companies honest, one can understand why privatisation is so keenly sought by some conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA> By destroying public enterprises the privateers will achieve two things. First, there will be no public competition and therefore no check on private cartels. Second, there is a handsome profit to be made in banking, telecommunications and aviation by the corporate raiders and the financiers if they are allowed to grab our profitable public enterprises such as the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom Australia, Australian Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd. This nation is indeed indebted to my Party, the great Australian Labor Party, for not allowing such economic cannibalism. Believe me, there are lots of economic cannibals who would love to take part in the feast of privatisation and gobble up our very efficient and profitable public enterprises. I do not want to be uncharitable and name some of these fat cats from the corporate world, titled or untitled, who would benefit enormously from privatisation at the expense of the general public. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that privatisation has been tried elsewhere and has been found wanting. In Britain the sale of public assets was used to finance once-off tax cuts for the rich. In France, profitable public enterprises were flogged off by the Government to its corporate friends at bargain basement prices. Do we want to see a deregulated transport market with all of the planes flying under Sir Peter's colours, making uncontrolled profits at the risk of passenger safety? Or do we want to see our national carrier, Qantas, taken over by a foreign cartel? Of course not. However, whilst there is strong resistance within the Government to privatisation, those who would benefit from it-a mighty powerful group of the Establishment-have managed to persuade some members of the Cabinet of its usefulness. They have of course disguised their greed by referring to quasi-economic arguments such as `private is efficient, public is inefficient', `why should the Government invest money in enterprises when private consortiums can do it better', and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us pause for a moment to examine these totally unsupported assertions. There is not one iota of evidence to support the claim that private enterprises are inherently more efficient than public ones. The fact is that there are many very efficient and profitable public enterprises, like the Commonwealth Bank, and there are many inefficient and unprofitable privately owned enterprises, like the notorious Nugan Hand Bank. As far as efficiency is concerned one has only to look at the long list of failed companies that were inefficiently managed by the private sector. The latest scandal of mismanagement and alleged misappropriation of funds is the saga of the private rescue organisation, the National Safety Council of Australia. It certainly illustrates how costly it can be to let private enterprises take over the functions of government and run them without proper control. It is mind-boggling to think that an individual such as this one can set up a $2 company with a private army clad in uniforms and wearing insignia reminiscent of the swastika and milk out of that private company tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars and then disappear as mysteriously as he appeared. It took a nationwide manhunt to find him. As the Age put it on 23 March:</PARA>
<PARA>With the Victorian division (of the NSCA) facing liquidation, with potential debts of $235 million, questions are being asked about how it has been able to afford to acquire helicopters and turbo prop aircraft reputably better equipped for search and rescue than some aircraft available to the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there are many more questions that should be asked about this matter, especially relating to national security. As in the case of the failed Nugan Hand Bank, we may ask what role the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and our own spooks in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) played in the NSCA. I do not expect any real answer to this question as the spooks, domestic or foreign, shy away from public exposure and scrutiny. I doubt that we will ever hear the full story. However, it is our duty as members of parliament to charge our colleagues on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to probe how it was that our spooks did not take a proper and timely interest in the mysteries of the NSCA. In its recent annual report ASIO drew the public's attention to the activities of foreign diplomats in Australia and their role in gathering information from Australians of ethnic origin. However, it failed to mention the interest and involvement of United States diplomats and military attaches in the NSCA. When the matter was reported and the attention of the Victorian Commissioner of Police was drawn to the fact that there may be some CIA involvement in the NSCA, Commissioner Glare declared, `That is not illegal'. One wonders how much confidence one can have in so-called private resource organisations carrying out a function which should be properly carried out by the State and not by alleged charities and CIA front organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us leave the spooks for another debate and concentrate on privatisation. As far as efficiency is concerned, that is a mixed bag. Some public companies are efficient and some are not, just as some private companies are efficient and others are not. Efficiency is determined not by the type of ownership but by the quality of management, technology, capitalisation, the loyalty of the work force and the degree of competition. The privatisers do not wish to take over the fire brigades, the suburban railways or tramways, the Country Fire Authority and so on, but they are aiming to buy Australian Airlines, Qantas and the Australian Telecommunications Commission at bargain basement prices. Each of these public enterprises is well managed. Each of them is highly profitable and is becoming increasingly profitable every year. As well as providing necessary public services and performing a necessary role as watchdog over private enterprise, each of these companies puts much of its profit back into the public purse for the benefit of the community. The same cannot be said about private companies. Some do not even pay their taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent edition of the Brisbane Courier-Mail a front page article entitled `The corporate giants that paid no income tax' pointed out that six of Queensland's 15 largest companies paid no income tax last year while a few others were listed to have paid only between 0.5 per cent and 33 per cent, and only three paid or exceeded the 39 per cent company tax limit. Contrast this to the return to the public provided by our top public enterprises. For instance, Qantas's operating profit has increased from $62.3m in 1984-85 to $153.3m in 1987-88. Telecom's profit has increased from $385.2m in 1984-85 to $777m in 1987-88. Over the same period Australian Airlines' profit has increased from $29.9m to $46.8m and the Commonwealth Bank's profit has increased from $223m to $273.4m. What juicy targets for our corporate raiders! I am glad that the party I belong to has resisted the onslaught of the greedy privateers. No doubt the Opposition will continue to press for privatisation with dogmatic tenacity in an attempt to buy the support of the greedy corporate sector, the support it used to enjoy but lost because of its catastrophic mismanagement of the Australian economy when it was in power during the Fraser-Howard years. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the second matter that I want to discuss. It has become fashionable lately to insinuate that the Labor Government has abandoned Labor principles and its supporters and taken up the cause of the rich and powerful. Honourable members will know that I am not uncritical of the decisions of the Executive. I have in this place criticised decisions such as the sale of uranium to France, the introduction of identity cards, deregulation and, as I have today, privatisation. But I cannot accept the unfounded and unsubstantiated criticism that the Hawke Government has abandoned the workers and battling families of Australia. No government in Australia's history has done as much for working people as our Labor Government. The Opposition, which is laden with millionaire businessmen and other useless sons of the Establishment, and the press constantly claim that Labor has betrayed its traditional supporters, yet the same people always oppose workers, wage rises, job creation and improvements in the social wage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare this to the achievements of the Hawke Labor Government. We have delivered modest and sustainable wage rises despite the constant opposition of the conservatives. We have created 1.3m jobs. Nowhere else is the contrast between the previous Government and this one so stark. The conservatives when last in power threw hundreds of thousands of wage and salary earners out of work. We got them back to work again, and everyone knows that having or not having a job is the key difference between those who are in poverty and those who are not. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also cleaned up the taxation system, under which it was almost optional for the high income earners to pay tax. As I said before, some companies are still trying to avoid it. In the last three financial years the Labor Government has raised more than $2.4 billion through the fringe benefits tax. In 1982-83, the last year of the Fraser-Howard Government, only $4.8 billion was raised from company tax and $259m from withholding tax. This compares with $10.2 billion from company tax and $700m from withholding tax raised by the Labor Government last year. Even allowing for inflation this is a considerable increase. In addition, the Australian Taxation Office is now hunting down corporate tax minimisation schemes by conducting detailed audits of suspected companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at education. We have kept more working class children at school than ever before, Prior to the election of the Hawke Government only 36 per cent of students completed year 12. This figure is now 60 per cent, and there are many more places in higher education for students to proceed to upon completion of high school, thanks to our expansion of the tertiary education system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government has been quietly and steadily going about the job of reconstructing and restoring the economy, which was left in a shambles by the previous Fraser-Howard Government. As a result, we have improved the standard of living of the people. Our annual income per head of population has increased in real terms by more than $2,500 per year since 1983. The authors of `Futile Diversions' are the guilty men of the past who for decades let this country rely on the export of agricultural products and mining commodities and neglected to support our manufacturing industries. In its document called Future Directions, the Liberal Party laments `Labor policies which have attempted to shield certain groups in the community from the effects of a reduced national income'. Well, we on this side of the House do not apologise for attempting to shield those families and groups in the community which have fallen victim to decades of conservative support for capitalist greed. We do not apologise for the family assistance scheme-a milestone in Australian social legislation-which targets payments directly to some 150,000 low income families. Under the scheme a family with three children and earning under the income test level will make a tax free gain of $86 per week, increasing by a further $15.26 if they rent privately. Nor do we apologise for increasing the number of people who are in superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's supporters in the conservation movement will note that we have acted decisively to protect the Australian environment. We prevented the damming of the Franklin River. We handed the administration of Uluru back to the traditional Aboriginal owners. The Labor Government prevented the despoliation of the Daintree Rainforest and took steps to protect the Kakadu National Park from mineral and mining exploration by adding a further 7,000 square kilometres to the World Heritage List. Most recently, we have prevented the Tasmanian Government from lowering environmental safeguard standards for the Wesley Vale pulp mill project and from consequently dumping enormous quantities of highly toxic substances into the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> No amount of Future Directions or diversions will cover up the difference between the way this Government has treated its traditional supporters and the way they were treated by the Opposition when it was in power. Australian families are much better off today than they were under Fraser and Howard. The affairs of this nation are in good hands, and the Australian people know that.</PARA>

<PARA> Before the last election the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that by 1990 no Australian child would be living in poverty. As this House knows, he said subsequently that what he really meant was that by 1990 no child would need to live in poverty. More recently he has watered down that commitment even further to claim that there would be no financial need for any child to live in poverty. One could well argue that that is already the case-that with our welfare system there is indeed no financial need for children to live in poverty. But plenty do. Unfortunately, there are many parents who spend their welfare payments not on looking after their children but on other things, such as alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, part of the Prime Minister's program for achieving his goal of eradicating child poverty is the child support scheme. Basically, this scheme is to improve the collection and payment of maintenance from the non-custodial parent of a broken marriage. For some time the concern has been the default rates on maintenance, which were extremely high-up to 70 per cent of non-custodial parents were not making regular payments or were making payments that were less than the maintenance awarded. As a result, the onus of the sole parent was falling on taxpayers in general, rather than on the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the child support scheme, employers deducting tax also deduct maintenance payments from the wages of the participating non-custodial parents. The employer then pays it over to the Australian Taxation Office and the Tax Office then passes the money to the Department of Social Security, which in turn pays it to the supporting parent. A new branch of the Australian Taxation Office, called the Child Support Agency, is the collecting agency under the legislation. The Agency costs about $10m a year to administer and employs a staff of 180. Other departments are involved, too. The Attorney-General's Department has 47 new members of staff at a cost of about $2m and the Department of Social Security has an undisclosed number of new staff to administer the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Child Support Agency is operated out of the Tax Office because employers are already collecting tax on behalf of the Government and therefore the maintenance payments are merely added to the tax which is already paid by the employer. The money collected from the non-custodial parent by the employer is paid to the Tax Office once a month with the employer's normal tax payments. The Child Support Agency then puts all the collections together and turns them over to the Department of Social Security, which is responsible for making the payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided that payments of maintenance by the Department of Social Security would be made monthly on the first Wednesday of the month following the month when the money was collected and was paid over by the Tax Office. I want to raise the problem of the long delays in this bureaucratic procedure. Take, for example, a maintenance award for support of, say, $50 a week. Deductions for maintenance are made from the non-custodial parent's wages beginning, say, on 3 November, a Friday, and each Friday thereafter. By the end of November the non-custodial parent has made maintenance payments of $200 but none has yet been paid to the supporting parent. By 7 December the $200 is paid by the employer to the Tax Office. In the meantime the non-custodial parent has made another payment of $50. The Tax Office gives the money to the Child Support Agency, which then turns it over to the Department of Social Security, which then has to prepare to make the payment. That preparation includes giving effect to the Department's claw-back rules. These rules apply certain income tests to the benefits the Department pays out under various income support programs. To the extent that the custodial parent receives maintenance payments from the non-custodial parent, money otherwise payable under the Department of Social Security's pension and benefit programs may be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security takes a month to receive the disbursement from the Child Support Agency within the Tax Office, effect its claw-back, advise the banks and financial institutions and finally make the payment. Under the hypothetical example that I have given it makes that payment on 6 January. That payment, which was originally made by the non-custodial parent on 3 November, is finally made to the supporting parent on 6 January, the first Wednesday of the month following the month when the money was due with the Registrar. The payment made on 6 January will be $200. By that time the non-custodial parent has in fact made payments of $500. A full 10 weeks' payments have been made, but the supporting parent receives only four weeks' payment. In other words, it takes 2 1/2 months for the first maintenance payment made by the non-custodial parent to actually get to the supporting parent. Rationalising this delay, the Treasurer's office says that it is simply the cost to the individual supporting parent who has signed up for the scheme of having the agency as his or her cost-free enforcer of maintenance in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised complaints that I have received from supporting parents in my electorate with the Treasurer (Mr Keating). As honourable members can imagine, the Treasurer's response was entirely unsatisfactory. He admitted that there is a 2 1/2-month delay and said that there is nothing that he can do about it. I repeat: the cost of entering into this maintenance scheme is a 2 1/2-month delay before the sole parent actually receives the maintenance payment. No wonder the Director of Research and Information at the Law Institute, Mrs Carol Bartlett, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We do need a system of automatic collection, but they have messed the present effort with hopeless and uncoordinated administration. </PARA>
<PARA>How many times have we heard that said of this Government? Who is the one who suffers from all this? It is the poor sole supporting parent, the one who is left with the children and no income, the one who experiences a 2 1/2-month delay in receiving the payment made by the non-custodial parent. The 2 1/2-month delay is a serious deficiency in the scheme. The Government has a duty to the sole parents to do better. I urge the Government to speed up the payments to initial entrants to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to raise in this debate also relates to the Tax Office. There has been a lot of publicity recently about the Tax Office's issue of tax file numbers. I want to go to the origin of the tax file number because I think there is a serious problem in the way in which the Tax Office is issuing tax file numbers. I was on the committee that reviewed the Government's original proposal for an ID card, the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card. I am sure that the House recalls that that Committee rejected the Government's proposal. When we on the Committee were hearing the evidence from representatives of the Tax Office, I raised with them the possibility of using the tax file number instead of an ID card. One of the concerns I had was whether the revenue gains from using the tax file number would be similar to those from using the ID card, that is, in the tax area. The response that the Tax Office gave, in a letter dated 6 March 1986 given to the Committee, was:</PARA>
<PARA>The use of the existing tax file number with its very low integrity would produce relatively little extra revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>So, when the proposal to use a tax file number was first raised with representatives of the Tax Office they said that it would raise little extra revenue because the integrity of the tax file number is so low. </PARA>
<PARA> As the months wore on, the Tax Office got the message that we were not going to support the ID card but rather that we were going to suggest that the Government implement a tax file number. The Tax Office then came back to the Committee and proffered another view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the left wing are not only sensitive; they are also absolutely gutless. They are all talk and no action. An opportunity was given to the honourable member to cross the floor and vote against the ID card and he did not do it. He voted with the Government for the ID card. As I was saying, when it became clear to the Tax Office that we were going to oppose the ID card and recommend a tax file number, it had a change of heart. As I said before the honourable member interjected, initially the Tax Office had said that the use of the existing tax file number with its very low integrity would produce relatively little extra revenue. As I have said, subsequently it came back to us in a letter dated 25 March 1986 and said that it was possible to use the tax file number:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It would seem a reasonable proposition that the identity of taxpayers who have been regularly lodging tax returns and paying tax for more than five years could be accepted at face value at the commencement of any upgraded identity check procedures. The three million taxpayers with a taxation record of five years or under would be invited to confirm their identity . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Tax Office was saying to us, `You could use a tax file number and one of the ways you could use it would be to accept the tax file numbers of those people who have been putting in tax returns for five years or more and ask those who have more recently put in tax returns to prove their identity'. We accepted that evidence. In fact, when the Government introduced the tax file number legislation that is what we believed would happen. I believed, as I think nearly everyone in the Parliament believed, that the tax file number system would be likely to improve tax collections, that it would enable the Tax Office better to link information it obtains from banks and other financial institutions with income tax returns. We believed that the Office would ensure the integrity of the tax file numbers by accepting only those who had a record of lodging tax returns with the Tax Office and asking others to prove their identity. When the legislation went through this Parliament a lot of discussion was concentrated on the proof of identity procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Has Mr Boucher, in the rush to the next election, actually adopted those procedures? No. The Government is terrified of upsetting anyone and has given the orders: `We do not want to ruffle any feathers. We want to issue everyone with a tax file number. Issue them to everyone! It does not matter whether they are dead people, anonymous people, the ghosts in the system-issue tax file numbers to them all'. What is more, in South Australia they are being issued in unsealed envelopes. No wonder the Privacy Commissioner complained today about the way this matter has been handled. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern I have is that the mass issue of tax file numbers undermines the integrity of the whole system. The Tax Office has confirmed that it is issuing tax file numbers. It is automatically sending tax file numbers to all those who submitted an income tax return last year. It is posting them out to everyone who did not lodge a return through a tax agent. So it is issuing them to people who lodged a return for the first time last year. Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind you that last year there was an amnesty. Anyone could go along and lodge a tax return. So instead of purging the false names the Tax Office is, in effect, confirming the legitimacy of all the false names in the system. The Tax Office complained to us two years ago that these false names would undermine the value of using the tax file number. It told us that the use of the existing tax file number, with its very low integrity, would produce relatively little extra revenue. It was saying that the only way to use the tax file number was to upgrade its integrity. That is what the Tax Office said it would do. Is it doing it? No. It is just posting tax file numbers to everyone, even the people who used the amnesty last year to lodge returns. </PARA>
<PARA> Who could have lodged returns last year? Let me give some examples. An itinerant worker who completed a number of tax returns last year in the false names under which he or she worked will now be sent tax file numbers for all those false names. He will therefore be able legitimately to continue to evade tax-certainly legitimately under this procedure-by splitting his income amongst the Tax Office legitimised false identities. So all the false identities have now been posted tax file numbers and people continue to work under three or four names and put in three or four tax returns in those false names. What do they get? They get the advantage of the tax free threshold three or four times. What on earth are we implementing this whole system for?</PARA>

What the Government is doing through the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Boucher, is knowingly issuing tax file numbers to ghosts. The Tax Commissioner has said to us, `We cannot issue them to everyone because of the low integrity of the tax file number'. Yet that is what he is doing. What more proof do we want?

<PARA> Getting back to the Wesley Vale pulp mill, I consider that it was a disgraceful and shameful exercise by the Liberal Government in Tasmania to approve a weakening of the guidelines which would have released, in the form intended by the company, dangerous organochlorides into the environment. For the benefit of honourable members and the listening public, let me explain how a pulp mill works, in view of the fact that about four mills are planned around Australia, all adjacent to the coastline. Take the Japanese company Harris-Daishowa (Aust) Pty Limited. Honourable members should not be misled by the `Harris', which is a very minor part of the company; it is in fact a Japanese company. Harris is out of it. It is Daishowa. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fully Daishowa, as the honourable member has pointed out. It plans to build a pulp mill in New South Wales. Other companies plan to build pulp mills near Orbost in Victoria and Bunbury in Western Australia. All these mills involve a two-stage process. The first process reduces the logs to pulp by using a combination of mechanical and chemical processes which is called the kraft process. The second stage is a bleaching plant in which the wood pulp is bleached by treatment with chlorine gas in one case or, alternatively, a combination of chlorine and chlorine dioxide. So these are the two methods of achieving the bleaching. It is this second process-that is, the combination of chlorine and chlorine dioxide-which leads to the environmental problems. During the bleaching the chlorine bonds with organic material to produce the chemical by-products known as organochlorides. This material is a waste which is usually piped through an ocean outlet into the sea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier today I had occasion to refer to the environmental problems caused by the release of the organochlorides into the environment through pesticides and herbicides. I will quote from an article by Dr Peter Craig of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) which was published in the Australian on 16 February. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In the bleaching of paper pulp, up to 1000 different organochlorides will be formed, the specific compounds depend on the species and age of the timber being pulped. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of these will be unknown compounds because eucalypts have never before been processed by the kraft-chlorine method and because chemists have yet to identify all the compounds found in the by-products from existing kraft mills. </PARA>
<PARA> Little or nothing will be known about their properties or the effects on humans and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The pulp mill effluent is usually introduced into the ocean through a pipeline mounted on the sea bed and designed to maximise dilution of the effluent. </PARA>
<PARA> This process is in accord with the adage that the solution to pollution is dilution. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, organochlorides defy the adage. </PARA>
<PARA> On release into the ocean, they tend to attach themselves to particles that will drop to the sea bed if currents are not strong enough to carry them away. In this way, they can accumulate on the sea bed where they are available to bottom-feeding fish and may have a herbicidal effect on seaweeds. </PARA>
<PARA> Organochlorides will also accumulate in the fatty tissues of fish and shellfish whose habitat is in the area of the outfall. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought it was important to quote extensively from that article because it is written by an expert from the CSIRO. This is an expert article, in contrast to some of the superficial articles I may quote later in my speech. Opposition members have been keen to criticise the Minister, Senator Graham Richardson, for his decision to ensure that the environmental guidelines are followed strictly. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Grey says, he is doing a very good job. Senator Richardson's decision to ensure that the guidelines are followed strictly was a good one, but people who criticise fail to draw attention to the dangers which I have just outlined to the House. Both in the Baltic and off the Canadian coastline marine life is particularly sensitive to the effects of many of these organochlorides. The dioxin contamination from the organochlorides has caused contamination of shellfish and fin and gill rot, tumours and reproductive failure in fish. Both DDT and PCBs can be detected in all the seas of the world and have been found, for example, in penguins in Antarctica.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The organochlorides persist for many years before they decay. Marine scientists are not yet in a position to say what the long term consequences to marine life of this continual dumping of organochlorides into the sea will be. The Wesley Vale mill was expected to release some 60 million litres of effluent containing 13 tonnes of organochlorides each day. Yet the Tasmanian State Government was prepared to relax the environmental guidelines in such circumstances. That Government issued a statement which it described as an interpretation of the environmental guidelines but it was, in fact, a repudiation of existing strict controls. It was an irresponsible statement. Yet Tasmanian Liberal members in this House have the audacity to claim, as one did this morning, that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has been playing politics. It is they who are playing politics in their support of a State government led by a Premier who has a proven record of confrontation with the Federal Government. It is irresponsibility of the worst order by Opposition members who are prepared to support a reinterpretation of the guidelines which allows for no mention of dioxins. The original guidelines were quite specific in stating that there must be no detectable increases in dioxin in fish and shellfish. I quote from an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio interview with Dr Bob Brown, an Independent State parliamentarian, on 23 February:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. Well, for example, the dioxin issue. Previously, the dioxins would not be allowed into the marine life of Bass Strait, now we find that the dioxins will not be allowed to have a detrimental effect. That simply means that we would have a long argument over what detrimental means, but dioxins will be allowed into the marine life of Bass Strait. We see that the technology that's going to be the best practicable technology to protect the environment now has, that means in the new definition, commercially proven and widely acceptable. Which means that it's technology which has already been in considerable use elsewhere in the world. We're not getting anything new, innovative, and we're not getting any technology which is special in this mill. We're going to get technology which is already used elsewhere in the world where we know that this sort of mill is creating tremendous pollution, where we've seen the closure of fisheries in Canada and increasing alarm about the consumer products coming out of these mills such as coffee filters, napkins and milk cartons which are concerning people right round the world because of the organochlorins getting into them. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, Dr Brown said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a compelling argument for preventing this form of technology being brought into the Australian environment and we must remember, when the proponents of this mill, say that it's the best, it'll be the cleanest mill in the world, they're quite wrong. There are alternative technologies which avoid organochlorins and dioxins going into the atmosphere all together. The Russians are introducing that, the Swiss are introducing that. We just simply should not have this polluting technology which is going to put up to 13 tonnes of organochlorins into Bass Strait each day. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to quote from a Tasmanian television program of 26 February on which Charles Woolley said:</PARA>
<PARA>For the past 18 years a pulp mill, now owned by North Broken Hill, has been operated on the site. It's a small mill, it will be replaced by a huge one. It'll be the biggest current industrial project in Australia and the biggest ever in the history of Tasmania. The company promises to provide up to $300m a year in taxes and balance of payment credits for the Federal Government. There's also the promise of 700 permanent jobs directly and indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Opposition members concentrate on, but they do not talk about the debit side. Charles Woolley went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The mill will consume some 5,500 hectares of forest a year, opponents claim one tree in every six. And then there's the effluent. The company in its own environmental impact statement estimated about 1.5 tonnes a day of toxic organochlorin wastes would be discharged into Bass Strait. If dioxins are involved then typically they would occur in this material. The company can't guarantee they're not there but say it's unlikely. The farmers don't accept that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA>A farmer who was interviewed said:</PARA>
<PARA>They banned DDT years and years ago because they found it had organochlorins in it and this thing's going to start putting out exactly the same stuff that we've been banned. And so they now they started bringing in the meat testing in Japan and if we start showing up with organochlorins in our meat, well that condemns us straight away. There's a lot of money in meat, there's a lot of money in onions here and they're testing for it now so if it pops up we've lost the market. </PARA>
<PARA>That farmer is going to suffer from what is proposed with the Wesley Vale pulp mill, but do we hear Opposition members talking about those things? No, of course we do not. I am sure it must be obvious to all honourable members that the interviews I have quoted bear out the facts I have set out previously in my speech. I want to quote Bob Brown again because he is a Tasmanian and appreciates the need to preserve an environment in Tasmania which is still wild and untamed in many places. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, the human species has got along for millions of years without kraft, chlorine bleaching factories, we know that we can do that, the record is there, but it hasn't ever got along without this wild environment, without the natural planet itself. How far can we push the planet in the direction in which, how far can we pollute it? How far can we degrade the earth, the land, the sea, the air without which we ultimately pay the penalty?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important statement. An important aspect of this whole issue which has been neglected in the argument about the level of emissions from the proposed Wesley Vale pulp mill is the fact that the dioxins, which are one of the organochlorides produced by the bleaching process, are the most toxic substances in the world. Dioxins were the basic poisoning substance in agent orange which was sprayed on the communist forces in Vietnam and to which many of our veterans were inadvertently exposed. The dioxin danger will not be limited to discharges from the mill. </PARA>

No known safe level of dioxins has yet been proved. Dioxin concentration grows in animal tissues in a concentration which can be as high as 66,000 times the original contamination. The problem is that whilst these facts should be in the forefront of public discussion, the environmental impact statement deals with the issue in a perfunctory and superficial manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the proponents of the Wesley Vale pulp mill rely on articles by Allan Jamieson which appeared in the Age of 16 November 1988. I found the article to be superficial and completely lacking in any objective content. Is that the sort of article upon which Opposition members rely when they call Senator Richardson irresponsible? It is they who are irresponsible, particularly those Tasmanian Liberal members who would allow the Wesley Vale pulp mill to go ahead without the environmental safeguards which Senator Richardson has insisted must be upheld by the company. Allan Jamieson is the process manager for the Wesley Vale pulp mill project and is hardly the unbiased observer which the article appears to suggest. When I spoke this morning I wanted to make one environmental statement-that is, I am totally opposed to the Antarctic mineral resources regime. I hope in the future to have an opportunity to discuss this in the House. Hopefully, our tourism report will mention these matters but, of course, that remains to be seen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 February 1964, a co-educational secondary school named Luther College officially opened its doors and welcomed its first students. The school was built on a magnificent site of 13 hectares, at the corner of Plymouth and Yarra roads, Croydon-an outer eastern suburb of Melbourne. Since that first day 25 years ago, the school has grown steadily both in size and in reputation. It is highly regarded and respected as an educational institution-not only by the many students, staff, parents and members of the Lutheran fellowship who are, or have been, directly involved in its initial planning and continuing development, but also throughout the wider community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the original seven teachers and 53 students, the Luther College family has increased to a student body of almost 550, and a teaching staff of 49, plus administrative, teacher support and boarding house staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The story of this outstanding school has been comprehensively detailed in a very interesting and readable book which has been published by the college council as a major contribution to the silver jubilee celebrations. The book is entitled Bell, Clock and Cross-A History of Luther College 1964-1988. The opening paragraphs of the introduction to this special volume state:</PARA>
<PARA> Bell, Clock and Cross may appear to the casual reader to be a strange kind of name for a resume of the history of a school, but to those who are aware of the structure and character of Luther College, Croydon, the appropriateness of the title will be readily appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> Bells are usually appealing as instruments of cheer, but they are also, quite often, regarded as instruments of incitement. Perhaps the bells summoning staff and students to the classroom for the first period in the morning sound less cheerful than the ones signalling the close of the period of the day. But the sound of a bell usually serves to arouse, to revitalise, to lift the human spirit, encouraging enterprise and achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Clocks are perhaps most aptly described as a means of discipline. They constantly remind us of the fact that our time is limited. They put pressure on us. Just as they are in the business world, so they are in schools-relentless, unyielding instruments which undoubtedly help us to organise ourselves in the direction of success, but which also tend to engender feelings of frustration, even of despair. </PARA>
<PARA> What about crosses? Unlike bells and clocks, crosses are mute and unchanging. They are simply there, bearing silent testimony to the Christian faith. At a place like Luther College the cross is of much greater significance than the bell or the clock. Luther College was conceived, dedicated and has always effectively operated as a Christian school. It has demonstrated its commitment to the Christian faith and Christian principles through its care and concern for the educational, emotional, physical and spiritual needs of those students fortunate enough to pass through its doors. </PARA>
<PARA> Celebrations to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of Luther College have included a silver jubilee concert, a thanksgiving service, the unveiling of a commemorative plaque, a special founders day assembly and open day, and the planting of a commemorative tree in the grounds of the school. A time capsule is also being prepared, and it too will be `planted' in the school grounds during the college's traditional Maifest activities early next month. Unlike the commemorative tree, it is planned to dig up the time capsule in 25 years' time, when the college celebrates its golden anniversary. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that such a fine school as Luther College is located within the boundaries of the electorate of Casey, and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the contributions made and achievements attained by the school during its first 25 years. Congratulations on a job well done. </PARA>
<PARA> To the dedicated people who possessed the vision, courage and commitment to establish the school, to the present students and staff who have the important responsibility of continuing to build on the firm foundations laid for them over the past quarter of a century, to all who have had in the past, or will have in the future, the opportunity to experience the care and the training provided by Luther College, I would like to say you have every reason to feel very proud and very blessed because of your association and involvement with the Luther College community. Best wishes to you all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At approximately 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 4 April 1989, Cyclone Aivu struck the north Queensland coastline approximately 60 kilometres south of Townsville. It was one of the most powerful cyclones to hit north Queensland and had a force equivalent to that of Cyclone Tracy, which devastated Darwin in 1974. Cyclone Aivu caused extensive damage to the towns of Giru, Brandon, Ayr, Home Hill, Inkerman, Clare and Mingela and to the historic mining centres of Ravenswood and Charters Towers. Numerous homes and buildings were unroofed and much structural damage was caused. The litter of devastation was testimony to the violence of the winds. Established trees were uprooted and shrubbery, corrugated iron, broken glass and other debris were strewn everywhere. The $450m sugar cane crop was flattened by the 230 kilometre per hour winds. The sugarcane crop loss is conservatively estimated at $20m. Power lines were brought down and electricity and water supplies were cut. One person was drowned and approximately 20 other persons were injured and required medical attention. Heavy rainfall which accompanied the furious winds caused local flooding. Cyclone Aivu has since developed into a tropical rain depression. Now the threat of widespread flooding is an additional anxiety faced by the people of the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The State Emergency Service called on the Natural Disasters Organisation for urgent assistance. Townsville-based Defence Force personnel responded immediately to the pleas for help. At about 4.30 p.m. on the day of the cyclone the Defence Force Aid to the Civil Community Group commanded by Major Peter Hanlon and comprising 139 soldiers from Delta Company, 2nd/4th Battalion and five other units of 3rd Brigade left Townsville by road for the devastated area. They took nine Landrovers, 10 Unimog trucks, four Mack dumper trucks, a recovery vehicle, a bulldozer, a water purification unit, a light observation helicopter, sandbags and tarpaulins. </PARA>
<PARA> The group arrived at last light and proceeded to place tarpaulins over holes in the roof of the Ayr Hospital and other damaged buildings. They also commenced the gigantic task of clearing debris. The light observation helicopter was used extensively to carry out reconnaissance flights to assess damage. The Army's 9 Transport Squadron moved stores, generators, a Telecom ground station and tarpaulins to the area. The troops on the disaster scene quickly established liaison and working procedures with police and emergency services. </PARA>
<PARA> When cyclone warnings for the north Queensland coast commenced, the Army placed liaison officers on the spot to work from police stations at Townsville, Innisfail and Mackay until the emergency was over. Yesterday an Iroquois helicopter from 35 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force base at Garbutt carried out a reconnaissance of power lines from Townsville to Clare and Proserpine. This morning another Iroquois helicopter from 35 Squadron went to Mackay to provide food relief and was available for medical evacuation purposes. Iroquois helicopters of 35 Squadron are still on standby ready to provide assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Travelling in an Iroquois helicopter piloted by Squadron Leader Ian Fogarty, I visited the scene of the disaster yesterday in company with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen), the Leader of the Queensland Opposition, Mr Wayne Goss, Brigadier Jim Connolly, Commander of 3rd Brigade, Lavarack Barracks and Captain John McDonald of the Natural Disasters Organisation. The Deputy Prime Minister spoke with police officers and other officials at various locations in the disaster area and guaranteed the people of the region that the Commonwealth Government would provide financial assistance to the Queensland Government, which has primary responsibility for disaster relief in that State under the relevant guidelines of the natural disaster relief arrangements. These arrangements provide that the Commonwealth Government reimburses at least 50 per cent of State outlays on eligible measures for the relief of personal hardship and distress. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of other eligible relief and restoration measures, such as repairs to roads and other public facilities, concessional loans to farmers, small businesses, needy people and voluntary non-profit bodies, the Commonwealth Government provides financial assistance when a State's total outlays on these measures in a financial year exceed its assessed financial capacity as represented by an annual base amount. This assistance is on a dollar for dollar basis in respect of outlays up to 75 per cent above the base amount and $3 Commonwealth to $1 State thereafter. Queensland is already eligible to receive $3 Commonwealth for each $1 of State funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the professionalism of the military personnel from the 3rd Brigade, the officers and airmen of 35 Squadron, local police, the State Emergency Service, the North Queensland Electricity Board and council workers. They served magnificently and they have earned the enduring gratitude of the people of north Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to inject some reality into the picture which has been painted throughout this week in respect of the Government's alleged care for veterans and war widows following some recent statements made, particularly by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). I am delighted that he is present in the House tonight. I remind the House that it was this same Minister who, in the House on 23 May 1988, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Well, I was a motor mechanic for many years and I've had kerosene and petrol and oil thrown on me so if he wants to throw Agent Orange over me I don't think that's going to worry me in any way . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is but a passing indication, but nevertheless an indication that is in Hansard, in relation to the Minister's attitude at that time in respect of the agent orange issue. That leads me to point out to the House the 10 big cutbacks to veterans and war widows under the Federal Labor Government since May 1985. They show the extent of its approach and attitude and give the lie to the figure that the Government continually cites, that it has increased expenditure overall-and it has-from $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion. But that is a smokescreen for the reality of what is happening in relation to its assistance and programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The first cutback concerned the travel allowance, which was reduced by half to a flat rate of 11.6c per kilometre in the mini-Budget of May 1985. It particularly affected country veterans. Secondly, the subsistance allowance, including meals and accommodation, was reduced substantially for veterans, resulting in considerably less Government expenditure for that program. Thirdly, in regard to the dental scheme, four categories of treatment were severely limited, causing considerable hardship to the veterans involved. Fourthly, the totally and permanently incapacitated pension criteria were tightened very significantly under the Veterans' Entitlements Act which was introduced late in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, provision was made for termination of the dependants allowance by commutation, albeit on a voluntary basis, and that there would be no further increase in the dependants allowance, another cutback. Sixthly, war widows and their dependants, as well as service pensioners and their fringe benefits, will no longer have access to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In other words, war widows were wiped out of the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Seventhly, war widows who also receive an age pension had their social security component frozen at a maximum level of $60.05, with no consumer price index (CPI) adjustments. Eighthly, in 1986 a two per cent Defence Force retirement benefits cut-back was imposed, along with a six-week deferment in increases in CPI. That still has not been rectified, despite indications by the Government that it was planning to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Ninthly, from 1 January 1988 a $5,000-plus statutory patient contribution was imposed on veterans in nursing homes, even when they were in nursing homes for war-related conditions. Tenthly, and finally in this list of 10 big cutbacks by the Federal Labor Government to veterans and war widows, there was a serious cutback in the list of available drugs under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme, along with other related cutbacks, including some which came into effect on Saturday, 1 April, causing great hardship, difficulty and confusion for veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reality of the Government's treatment of veterans and war widows. That is the type of treatment that the Government has meted out to those who served their country in time of war, contrary to the dictum put down by Ben Chifley many years ago when he told the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA>Upon this national Parliament rests the responsibility of seeing that the right thing shall be done for those who served their country in time of war. </PARA>
<PARA>By contrast, our commitment-the commitment of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), my commitment and the commitment of all members of the coalition-is to provide a fair go for veterans, a fair go for war widows, a comprehensive program to see that they get that fair go and the treatment, disability and service pension assistance which they so richly deserve. Our program will be administered by a modern, separate Department of Veterans' Affairs. I think that that clarifies some of the debate which broke out this week in relation to veterans' affairs and repatriation. It spells out the true picture in terms of looking after that very important category of people, veterans and war widows. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Domestic violence is not something that is new or unique to our time, but it is an area which must be given very serious consideration by us all. It is now recognised that domestic violence is a major social problem in Australian society. It is not a simple problem with simple answers. It is a complex issue and one which we all need to be aware of. While the provision of services to combat domestic violence is generally a State or Territory government matter, the Federal Government commits a considerable level of funding. It is a sad fact that many women and children are living in fear of serious injury, or worse, each day of their lives. Therefore, it is of immense importance that the Federal Government has brought this issue to the attention of the public. Domestic violence is widespread throughout the community, and occurs in many varied home styles, regardless of race or creed. Statistics show that 95 per cent of perpetrators are men, with as many as one in three being directly affected by domestic violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government has declared this month of April 1989 National Domestic Violence Awareness Month as part of a three-year national domestic violence education program. I am pleased that this program has been put in place. It aims to educate the general public on this complex problem and will look at ways to reduce the incidence of abuse. The percentage rates of those in need of help are staggeringly high. In my electorate of Grey alone it is not unusual for one family per day to seek assistance from a women's and children's emergency shelter. In some months there is a dramatic increase on this figure. It is of vast importance that shelters of this nature be maintained to the fullest extent, with adequate funding being made available to allow the continuation of the commendable work now being undertaken and enable the Government to look at the differing areas of domestic violence. Many shelters are finding the increased demand on their services difficult to meet. Therefore it is of utmost importance that the Government continue to support this important program. Without the current service provided by the shelters in my electorate, many women and children would have to remain in a potentially dangerous environment, in the hope that their situation would improve or change. </PARA>
<PARA> In these times of violence, one man to another, a harmonious home life is one which most of us take for granted. However, in many cases this is not the daily routine. Australia cannot continue to tolerate the level of physical and mental abuse which is widespread throughout our community. I congratulate the commitment shown by all coordinators of shelters in and around Australia. Their unstinting work and efforts on behalf of the women and children of Australia are worthy of very high praise indeed. I have been deeply impressed by the obvious love, compassion, kindness and caring shown by the women who run the shelters in my electorate. I have visited these shelters and I totally support their wonderful work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for people living with the fear of violence in their homes to know that they have the choice to find help. An alternative is one which should not be taken lightly. Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a government initiative, is highlighting this sensitive area in an effort to bring to the attention of members of the public the fact that there is help and support available to them in their area. I commend the Government on taking this sensitive issue to task. It is not a popular issue; therefore the significance of highlighting this area shows great concern and courage by the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of us is accountable for his or her own actions. However, it is unreasonable and unrealistic to expect women and children to stand up for their rights and confront a brutal partner. It is therefore pleasing to me that in 1987-88 the Government allocated as a major policy initiative $1.6m over a three-year period to a national education campaign on domestic violence. A total of $208,000 was expended in the 1987-88 financial year and an allocation of $680,000 was made for expenditure in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Activities undertaken last year related to research on community attitudes towards domestic violence, in an effort to provide the basis to develop a campaign. The announcement of an awareness month for April 1989 is something which I feel will highlight to us all the very real problem of violence in our community and help us to become better informed as to available services and counselling in and around us. Time, and a change in our acceptance of the problem, will be needed before changes can be made. We must understand that it is not our right, nor our privilege, to abuse our partners or our children. I ask all members present today to continue to give their support for such a worthwhile program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise and follow the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil). I endorse the sentiments he has expressed tonight. It is appropriate that I should follow the honourable member for Grey because the issue I wish to raise is one in which he has been partially involved. I want to recognise tonight the cooperation he has given in relation to the matter I shall bring to the attention of the House. It is also appropriate that I should find myself in the House when the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) is at the table because the matter I wish to raise is also one which directly concerns him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A great deal of concern has been expressed in South Australia about the question of nursing home care. South Australians feel that their enthusiasm about being diligent providers for aged citizens over the past two decades is very much to their disadvantage now that the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, for his own well-intentioned reasons no doubt, is endeavouring to introduce what he sees as some equity into nursing home care. South Australians are feeling unfairly penalised. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of nursing home care that particularly concerns me is a Roman Catholic nursing home known as Star of the Sea at Wallaroo. Wallaroo is one of the port towns in the Copper Triangle of South Australia. I have to say to the Minister that last weekend and indeed this week the citizens of Wallaroo indicated that they were bitterly unhappy about the intention of the Department of Housing and Aged Care and the Minister to close the nursing home beds at the Star of the Sea nursing home. After this announcement was made it was not long before Monsignor Pope, Sister Gabrielle and Mrs Thoday from the nursing home came to see me. </PARA>
<PARA> While I appreciate the fact that the Department is acting from what it sees as a statistically equitable point of view, it is quite unfair for it to take statistics for an urban area and apply them to a rural setting. If you are as familiar, Madam Speaker, as I am with a rural area you will know that to move retired people from one town to another is totally dislocating. In an urban setting it may not be difficult to move them from one suburb to another. The threat that these aged people of Star of the Sea feel is the threat of having to leave the community of Wallaroo to settle somewhere else. Many of them, because they are in nursing home beds, are quite unable to make any sort of provision for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> A protest meeting was held at Wallaroo last Sunday evening. Five hundred people from a town of barely 2,000 attended that meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I was there, as the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Farrer, acknowledges. More significantly, the bishop of the area, Bishop De Campo, was there. He clearly had to restructure his Sunday evening in order to attend this meeting. While, appropriately, he did not become directly involved in the protest, his very preparedness to be there indicated his concern about what was happening to Star of the Sea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real concern is that these people have made provision for this nursing home. They, among others, made it possible for the nursing home to be set up, and they are currently finding themselves losing the right to occupy the nursing home beds. The Department has not been totally callous. It has said that in taking away the nursing home beds it is prepared to offer some sort of subsidy to extend the hostel in the town so that people who occupy the nursing home beds can occupy the hostel rooms. What the Department and the Minister fail to recognise is that we cannot use an urban statistic and urban criteria in order to determine what ought to happen in rural areas. I indicate to the Minister that when he visits the electorate of Grey he will receive a deputation from the people of Wakefield via the member for Wakefield, thanks to the generosity of the honourable member for Grey. </PARA>
<PARA> An action committee has been set up in Wallaroo and it will be bringing to the Minister, through me, the concern it feels about what is happening to aged care in Wallaroo and what may well result from the decision to close the nursing home bed at the Star of the Sea. It is simply not good enough to propose to replace these nursing home beds with hostel beds, since the nursing home beds are what keep the Star of the Sea viable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak tonight about an accident which some people here will recall: the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979. This week marks the tenth anniversary of that accident. Honourable members may have listened to a very good program on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio which discussed the accident. The containment on that occasion was claimed to have been quite successful. Perhaps it was compared with Chernobyl, where more radioactivity was released into the atmosphere directly and where the results and consequences were much more obvious. But the population in the vicinity of the Three Mile Island reactor will not know for some years yet, and possibly for at least a generation, the real level of damage to their health and to the health of their future families. It was thought that the escape of large amounts of radioactive iodine, for instance, would be a problem for local people. That still remains to be seen. The authorities could not even get into the plant to carry out an inspection for five years after the accident because it was so radioactive. Even then the inspection had to be performed by robotic equipment, which discovered that a 30 per cent meltdown had occurred. This was much greater damage than was previously suspected by the United States authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that there has been no commissioning of a new nuclear installation in the United States since that time. Perhaps it is no wonder when one realises how frightened the population in the area must have been and also how much more concerned ordinary people in the US, no matter how close to the reactor, would have been after that accident. The clean-up bill was in excess of $1 billion, and the American community was severely shocked by the disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> People across the world are now expressing concern about the greenhouse effect, caused by the excessive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. Some nuclear power advocates are seizing upon this problem to promote the so-called cleanliness of nuclear energy, suggesting that for that reason it is a viable alternative to fossil fuels. This argument is not valid on at least two grounds. First, nuclear power only produces electricity. It is not, therefore, a substitute for fossil fuels such as petroleum or diesel, or even coal in certain industrial applications. Secondly, nuclear power plants are themselves potent pollutants. They may not affect the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere but they present insurmountable environmental problems both through their by-products and through the disposal of the vast plants themselves at the end of their relatively short working life. </PARA>
<PARA> The world's environmental health is a complex matter and I am simply making this speech tonight, as I know many others would if they had the opportunity, to point out that it is impossible for us to find a simple solution to those problems. It is especially difficult when some people in a very un- popular industry, and a very unsafe industry, grasp at the straw of something like the greenhouse effect, which is in fact caused by our civilisation as much as the burning of fossil fuels. It is the way we live as much as the fuels that we use in an endeavour to promote what I believe is a very dangerous and vastly overrated source of energy for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting, too, that environmentalists in this country and in other countries perhaps have not grasped this problem before. But most of them would say without a shadow of doubt that we ought to be looking to other forms of fuel and electricity generation rather than nuclear power. We are fortunate that Australia is, at least in the main, a nuclear-free nation. We have the odd little nuclear reactor for medical use, but in the main we are nuclear free and I for one would like to keep it that way. We would be doing the world and our country a disservice if we were to fall for the sham that has been put up by nuclear power proponents now that the greenhouse effect has become the problem that it has, and accept that nuclear power ought to be used as a substitute for fossil fuels. It is not an accurate argument, it is not a genuine argument and it should be rejected out of hand. </PARA>

He attacked me for my statement in relation to agent orange. I said that when I was an honourable garage proprietor I had petrol and kerosene thrown over me. When a veteran said he was going to throw agent orange over members of parliament, I said that if he wanted to do it I could not stop him, and that if he wished to do it I would not be concerned if that satisfied him.

They sent them to fight, but when the veterans asked for a royal commission it was the Labor Party that gave it to them. The veterans were not happy with that, so we gave them the Hogg inquiry into the findings of the Evatt Royal Commission on the Use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian Personnel in Vietnam. Hogg reported and we gave extra Vietnam veterans counsellors and also gave the veterans halfway houses. What did those opposite do? When in government they did nothing for the Vietnam veterans and Opposition members. The honourable member for Farrer should be ashamed of himself for getting up in this place and accusing Labor of doing nothing. We are very proud of what we have done on behalf of the Vietnam veterans, in the form of extra counsellors, $400,000 for halfway houses and so on. We have allocated a lot of money for the Vietnam memorial. We have done everything we can, and are continuing to do what we can, for the veterans. This Government will be in government for a long time and will look after those veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer did not mention that it was a Labor Government that ensured that the totally and permanently incapacitated (TPI) pension was payable for life. He did not mention all the good things that Labor has done, nor did he mention the extreme disability allowance. It is disgraceful that he should come into this Parliament and attack the Labor Government on these issues. I suppose he is not interested in the fact that we reduced from 100 per cent to 70 per cent eligibility for the TPI pension. I suppose that that, in the honourable member's mind, is no good either. We set up the Veterans' Entitlements Act monitoring committee and, having considered all the recommendations from that committee, we accepted half of them. The honourable member in his policy mentioned only two. Members of this House should read that policy. It says that the Liberal Party intends to do something for veterans when economic circumstances allow. There is nothing that they will do for the veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Farrer talked about cutbacks, but he has said nothing on that topic in his policy and will say nothing about it in this Parliament. He has not said what he would do on behalf of the veterans. Does he intend to reintroduce all the areas in which he has mentioned cutbacks? Does he intend to give the veterans all that money? He has put himself under no obligation on behalf of the veterans' community. He goes around the country saying that the Labor Government intends to do away with the Veterans' Review Board.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Ministerial Declaration on the Uruguay Round (the Punta del Este Declaration) was mindful of the negative effects of prolonged financial and monetary instability in the world economy, the indebtedness of a large number of less developed contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and considering the linkage between trade, money, finance and development and determined that action to liberalise world trade would promote growth and development.</PARA>
<PARA> In this sense the Declaration noted its concern with the issues (a), (b) and (c) and was convinced that a freer trading system would promote growth and development and through this, address the debt, financial flow and monetary issues facing the developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Progress has been made in a number of areas of direct interest to the developing countries including in tropical and natural resources based products. To this extent, the Round should fulfil the intentions set out in (1). Finalisation of the agreements reached in Montreal at the Mid Term review has been made conditional on agreement on agriculture and textiles among others.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Treasury sets out the Australian approach to handling the debt problem in the Submission to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. In that Submission, the Treasury notes that Australia has consistently supported the present case-by-case, growth oriented debt strategy as the only realistic way of resolving debt problems over the longer term. It is recognised that there can be no lasting solution to debt problems without the restoration of growth. This requires fundamentally that debtor countries pursue appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies, oriented to growth and aimed at attracting the necessary external financing. In addition, however, Australia has recognised and has pressed the point strongly in international fora-that growth in debtor countries also depends critically on the policy actions of the major industrial countries.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, at the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings in Berlin in September 1988, the Treasurer again emphasised the importance for sustained world economic growth of further progress in reducing external imbalances between the major deficit country, the United States, and the major surplus countries, in particular West Germany and Japan. He referred to the need for the United States to further reduce its fiscal deficit and, with other industrial countries, to avoid undue reliance on monetary policy, the costs of which include higher interest burdens for developing country debtors. The Treasurer noted that Japan had shown leadership in acting to lift domestic demand but that West Germany could do more in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer emphasised the importance of market access for the resolution of debt problems, noting that it was a sad indictment on decades of supposed international cooperation that protection by developed countries reduces developing country national incomes by almost twice the amount of official development assistance that they currently provide.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has also been a strong supporter, through its financial contributions and participation in decision-making, of the key role of the IMF and World Bank in the debt strategy. Central to this role is the provision of policy advice and financial assistance to debtor countries to promote economic adjustment and catalyse private and other official finance. The wider role of the IMF in particular in helping to strengthen international policy coordination, reduce global imbalances and improve the functioning of the international monetary and trading systems is directed at an improved world economic climate in which debt problems can be more satisfactorily resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> The Fund and Bank have established a number of new facilities to assist developing countries facing debt difficulties and are augmenting their financial resources with those difficulties in mind. (The World Bank agreed in April 1988 on a General Capital Increase of $US74.8 billion). Indeed, since 1982 the World Bank has become the largest single source of new money for the heavily-indebted middle-income countries.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr Lionel Bowen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO) and both the Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association (AFCCRA) and the Australian Consumer's Association (ACA), members of AFCO have received government assistance through my portfolio. I have no knowledge as to whether any other Government Departments have provided any financial or other assistance to organisations affiliated to AFCO.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Financial assistance is provided to AFCO and AFCCRA in the form of grants-in-aid. AFCO has also received a grant in 1988-89 to support its involvement in Price Watch activities (see Question 2). In 1988, AFCCRA received an additional financial contribution to help meet the travel costs associated with the attendance of its members at the National Forum on Consumer Credit. In March 1989, AFCCRA received a financial contribution to assist with the costs associated with its annual conference. ACA also received a financial contribution in 1988 to enable it to undertake a research project on defective products.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) In the 1987-88 financial year, AFCO received a grant-in-aid of $209,000 and AFCCRA a grant-in-aid of $20,000. In the 1988-89 financial year, AFCO was allocated a grant-in-aid of $217,000 and AFCCRA a grant-in-aid of $21,000.</PARA>
<PARA> AFCCRA was given $4,000 to help meet travel costs associated with the attendance of its members at the National Forum on Consumer Credit. In March 1989, AFCCRA was given a financial contribution of $5,000 to assist with the costs associated with its 1989 annual conference. ACA received a financial contribution of $25,000 for its defective products research project.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The grants-in-aid were provided to enable AFCO to fulfil its role of providing input on consumer issues to Government decision making processes. AFCCRA provides specialist advice and liaises between government and non-government sectors concerning credit, debt recovery, insolvency and law reform. Grants-in-aid are assessed against certain criteria which specify that the activities for which the grant is provided must be non-profit making and benefit a wide section of the community in a demonstrable way. Organisations are accountable for the use made of grants-in-aid and other financial contributions and are required to submit audited financial statements.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. The Department of the Treasury has advised that it has provided grants to the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations (AFCO) and the Australian Pensioners Federation (APF) to support their involvement in price watch activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Payments of $15,000 and $18,000 were made to AFCO and the APF respectively on 24 June 1987. The same amounts were paid to the organisations on 27 June 1988. Funds of $33,000 have been allocated in the 1988-89 Budget for renewal of the grants, subject to Ministerial approval at the appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Grants were provided on the basis that funds were to be directed towards the setting-up and operation of price watch committees, the distribution of information to local consumers and travel expenses in relation to these activities. In accordance with usual conditions attached to particular purpose grants, evidence is required in due course that funds have been spent on price watch activities and any unspent amounts are repayable to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The assistance is provided to enable AFCO and APF to participate in an extension of price watch committees across Australia. The APF wrote to the Prime Minister in December, 1986 suggesting a national, community-based price watch organisation and the Prime Minister announced the Government's support for the initiative in March, 1987. The National Prices Network was established with the co-operation of the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, a representative of which has observer status on the management committee of the Network. AFCO and APF were invited to serve on the National Prices Network which was established to oversee the implementation of the initiative.</PARA>
